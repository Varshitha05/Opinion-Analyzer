abortion is murder
good abortion is killing babies adoption is a better option
as a canadian im extremely glad we have a choice and the issue is that everyone should have a choice for example what if a young girl gets raped
its about time
if you dont want nun in life stay single
how discussing dissatisfied  and  horrible  horrible  behavior  of republicans now as we the person of the united states of america we have to stand up for ourselves  and voter  blue and see what biden  will  do  for the united states of america we the people  women  vote blue   republicans  dont  care about  the united states of america we the people woman  at all dearly  hearts  stand up for the rights   
liars which states made abortion illegal yall suck
pro choice indirectly supports grape culture women use abortion as the ultimate birth control so women go out for a night of fun with friends never with the intent of getting pregnant or graped but put themselves out there to be targeted by evil people which there seems more today  in 2019 alone over 625000 abortions occured ranging from 5 to 12 weeks old and 1 to 5 inches fetuses in that year alone how high and wide would you stack these dead children enough to fill 6 diesel truck trailers
"1 abortion bans do nothing women will always have the option of abortion whether its banned or not 
2 abortion bans actually increase the number of abortions ironically so i guess you people really arent about saving fetal lives so much as virtue signaling
3 fetuses now have a right that no other human being has and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another persons body to stay alive no other human has ever been granted that right even if you stab someone and theyre bleeding out and you have matching blood types the government cannot force you to give them your blood to keep them alive or if you use a mask gloves etc but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organs start shutting down the government cannot forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organs you used protection so the chances of giving this person the disease that youre a carrier for were very low but it still happened and now theyre dying because of you guess whatthe government does not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive thats exactly what an abortion ban attempts to do however so im not sure why fetuses should have that right when no one else does"
wow this is really fucking sad maybe our voting rights will be gone next this is why history is important
terrific to see the rights of the unborn finally being respected we need that in europe as well
easy solution ladies do not engage in sexual relations with any men in these statesask for id residency
the democrats are furious they cant control the black and latino populations in these states margaret sanger must be rolling in her grave
i am so happy that they are banning abortion it is wrong and should never be done human lifes are precious and should never be aborted and you cant say that i am wrong
wait so theyre banning abortion completely i guess girls better make sure you don fuck the wrong guy now
but why cant i chop up my own baby  seriously my only defense for baby chopping i refuse to use the pretty word abortion is that if a potential mom can do this while the baby is inside her for protection then maybe that beast shouldnt give birth  you realize they cut your baby up inside you like you would a whole fryer chicken only not as nice right  hitler thought he should be able to pick and choose who should live  youre all a bunch of minihitlers
abortion should be banned
use your vote america dont fuck it up or they will go for contraception next 
how can you call abortion murder if you cannot prove there is a child
this is not helpful regarding states11  nine cities  i inquired as to the 11 us states  why so secretive  include the drug companies that manufacture the abortion and morning after pills
keep your pants on if you dont want a baby mudering is still wrong there is freedom theres consequences these women may not believe in god  but we will find out at some point god declared that the wages of sin is death so good luck
abortion bans kill women ectopic pregnancies sepsis if forced to carry a dead fetus forcing a child of incest to give birth whence her body isnt mature enough to carry and where are those who love abortion bans where are they paying for funerals would they want their daughter to have forced birth for rape or incest where are they they scatter like cockroaches in the light they run away from the consequences and those people are the same ones who have a fur ball if criticized saying dont you tell me how to raise my child yet want others to give birth to unwanted unloved kids pathetic
stop hating eachother bc you disagree the irony
ban it also
if they need it let them get the abortion
ok heres why some people need to get abortions if they had the baby they would die so they had to get abortions
why not
we cant ban abortion
i just saw a sign to legalize abortion from conception to birth why have we criminally charged women who killed their newly self birthed their fetus
yes ban all abortions  im sick if seeing women get abortions they want to keep giing around spreading they legs and want to play but not pay for it  fuck that them babies deserve life what if that was you in a belly and ur momma wanted to abort you  and rape is sad i understand but give baby up for adoption let it atleast have chance and incest again if its incest and no rape then like i said before keep your legs closed
people kill babies and feel nothing
so women will have to take responsibility now
these bans put in another notch in the belt of women who just cant win for anything in this sexist society a man doesnt want to marry no problem she doesnt want to marry shes called a lesbian or a man hater single moms everyone says the kid needs a father single dad no one says the kid needs a mom treating moms as irrelevant and unimportant at the same time demanding she be a mom  man has a lot of partners no problem she has a lot of partners shes called names she abandons her kids shes considered an awful person he abandons his family no reaction well if you have an abortion youd make a lousy parent some would say  but are silent about deadbeat dads who refuse to take care of their offspring  well if you kept your legs closed you wouldnt get pregnant some say but just me says to him no one forces you to jump in no one is forcing you to do it with her youre yelled at if you have an abortion you have a kid its oh no here we go again another welfare kid well life begins at conception but then you have those who have no idea how long it even takes for the sperm and egg to meet acting like women can control that it can take days or weeks for the fertilized egg to attach to the womb there are a lot of barriers to cross and then of course you have the problem of an ectopic pregnancy the ignorant dont have a clue about the egg attaches to the fallopian tube and grows and kills mom when it ruptures and she bleeds to death abortion is murder people tell her but say to her no problem if you abort with a genetic problem most of which can be managed prosthetics for a missing limb lots of help to learn things if you have downs syndrome they can learn just like everyone else so abortion is murder selectively abort the imperfect keep the perfect you dont want essentially women cant win no matter what but no one imposes anything on men pure sexist hypocrisy and of course the pro lifer will never take in a pregnant woman nurse her through 9 months be there at labor and birth and be a surrogate relative helping to raise the kid theyre not there to personally find child care they dont care if mom doesnt get paid maternity leave but get upset if fathers dont get it they dont care that schools stop their lunch programs because parents are too damn lazy to wake up an hour earlier to give the kid breakfast and pack a lunch but have no problem feeding their own faces wonder what the politicians would do if unwanted babies were dumped on their doorsteps you wanted the kid born now you take care of it those against abortion call themselves experts on the subject whove never been in the situation abortion is different for people for some the decision is easy but tough to go through for some the decision is hard to make and hard to go through contraception is also sexist its all dumped on her but he runs if offered a condom pathetic all the way around the way society tries to control women it just doesnt like and oh yeah the ignorant assumption that she makes babies no sperm no baby we dont spontaneously create babies not only is there ignorance about abortion but human biology as well no abortion then there should be forced neutering of men i bet  that would drive men crazy shame that will never happen so we can hear men tirade about denial of reproductive choice
abortion bans are just another form of sexism and stereotype and hypocrisy sexism comes to play because no one puts bans on vasectomy he can do it for any reason no questions asked he can control his reproductive decisions without government imposition same old crap he can we cant no one yells at a man demanding she get an abortion she wants it suddenly doing it is awful the stereotype remains in that women must have a kid because thats her lot in life if shes a lousy parent boo hes a lousy parent or doesnt even stick around silence the hypocrisy comes in by those who want other people to have no rights but it must never happen to them gun nuts are a perfect example they dont care of your right to vote is suppressed they dont care if a womans right to choose when it comes to having a kid is interfered with but take away their guns even suggest it they have a hair ball tantrum
i always thought abortion was a need not a want only to prevent the child from suffering if there was something seriously wrong with the baby i even understand that so why is having an abortion because you want it okay i agree with a portion of abortion if its a need to prevent the child from suffering or in a way to save the mother from jeopardizing her health why else would abortion be okay if you want it and not need it know what im saying
ban the shit
effective immediately all states that have banned abortion are required to collect dna of all males ages 12 and above since 1994 the us department of justice has maintained a nationwide forensic dna database known as the combined dna index system codis today the federal government and all 50 states as well as the district of columbia contribute profiles to codisjan 20 2021
wait i thought most of these pro lifers  are christian which is weird because in the bible it says life begins at first breath so which is it either the bible is the word of god or the bible has some errors in it
i would never have an abortion but if they can live with it then its not my place to judge this is really setting humanity back 100 years
"hello 
every doctor swear to follow the hippocratic oath 
the hippocratic oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians it is one of the most widely known of greek medical texts in its original form it requires a new physician to swear by a number of healing gods to uphold specific ethical standards the oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the western world establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today these include the principles of medical confidentiality and nonmaleficence as the seminal articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value it is enshrined in the legal statutes of various jurisdictions such that violations of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oaths symbolic nature

"fyi  leader of major texas antiabortion group arrested for soliciting a minor
mark frauenfelder  214 pm thu aug 25 2022
luke bowen the political director and the public face of texas right to life was arrested earlier this month for solicitation of a minor the forced pregnancy organization fired mr bowen on the same day he was arrested"
thats not right thats killing innocent babies
well after the roe v wade was demolished now its getting control over the women and soon it will be illegal to be transgender and that will be a great day for our nation
im so happy for this new law its awesome
oh no  these poor women will be forced to consider birth control methods like  god forbid   the pill or condoms  the inhumanity of it all 
pouring gasoline on the fire of rage against religious extremism and the march toward theocracy  85 favor legal abortion  if you dont show up at the polls and choose representatives who support you then you are the problem  vote its our only recourse
i like the fact that the bitches and gold diggers need to get a proper job now instead kill little angels for living
these 11 states have my full support
this just make people hate the churches even more and not trust their government because they know the governments are influenced by religion i dont agree with abortion because to me it all falls under being irresponsible and therefore also making you a murderer no matter how you see it but people need to live with their own consequences so it should be legalized women saying my body my choice is selfish because it takes 2 to make a life not 1 you didnt make that baby on your own and any guy who support your decision is a murderer like you some guys are going support your wrong decision just to get laid to make themselves look good but of course you women know that but as long as they are on your side you dont care here is my solution legalize abortion anyone who gets it under 3 months gets 1 year of federal prison on charges for 3 degree murder anyone 4 months and up 5 years in federal prison only women who were kidnapped and forcefully rape should get physical and mental treatment and paid by the state solution solve youll see how abortion goes down
"watch birth control pills are still effective way to control birth

even in states where surgical abortions are now prohibited contraceptives can still be used for birth control"
"contraceptives are an attempted way to stop the babies birth

even in states where surgical abortions are not allowed contraceptives can be used to control births"
"so rape victims have to keep there baby
or the college student"
i see this republican insanity over a womans right to choose biting them in the arse soon
losing rights to kill a baby and shutting down gay parades  finally god is getting his justice
"what about ill women who would die while giving birth
what about rape
what about incest
what about young girls

god that is why canada is better"
what happens when a child gets raped is that child supposed to keep that baby if they get pregnant huh you cant seriously get a child to give birth and lose their childhood because of a man thinking they own our body im am not sorry this is an insult to humanity even the men are thinking this is pathetic or even a woman that gets raped and cant keep the baby due to religious beliefs our body our choice
when the ugliest women support abortion even though they never had sex
i think its great that all these old white rich men are making decisions for these poor black young women since they are the majority who get abortions mainly due to financial and health reasons
"heatbeat fingers curl
a hand out to stay the blade
why care inhuman"
"heatbeat fingers curl
a hand out to stay the blade
why care inhuman"
democrats kill babies vote republican
im not american but people should know that abortions will always exist now those decisions  will just cause more unsafe abortions that will harm both the woman and the unborn child lets not forget bringing unwanted children that may grow up criminals and do damage to society and increase crimes rate  thanks and congrats to boomers for making more genius ideas to ruin this world once again
get these religious fucks the fuck out of here god tells them not to judge but they sit on earth doing nothing but judging
"so does that mean men cant have a vasectomy either or are republicans just really after women 
the sperm in our scrotum is a living organism before it even gets to an females egg "
lets hope they ban all abortions everywherewomen cant be left ro make these kinds of decisionsthey just arent smart enough
i think its fine there should be a few exceptions tho like for rape and incest they also need to take care of the unwanted babies properly
this ban is like a christian religious lawsince when does the governments do this
cool
"in south korea women can have abortions anytime for no reason
korean women can abort even after six months of pregnancy and need no reason
korean women say thats what the us does
is it right"
abortion is evil plain and simple stop having sex if you cant handle a kid and if your raped give it up for adoption do not kill babies its evil no matter how u look at it
crime is going to skyrocket in those states by people who literally should never have been born what do these prolifers think was going to happen
why do men always care about the things that wasnt born yet lol
i started trading with forex trade late last year and till date have made over 127 btc even with the ups and downs since the journey  with forex trade help i no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of bitcoin  you can easily get in contact on my channel
republicans are pandering to evangelicals americas taliban in order to widen the base from just white supremacists the separation of church and state has fallen evangelicals believe in the biblically ordained submission of women so now women in red states are being stripped of their rights to bodily autonomy and contraception as part of the plan to subjugate and control women the country is going off the rails to a mideval puritanical theocracy vote blue thats all we can do republicans are vicious misogynists
the unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for they never make demands of you they are morally uncomplicated unlike orphans they dont need money education or childcare they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships and when they are born you can forget about them because they cease to be unborn its almost as if by being born they have died to you you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth power or privilege without reimagining social structures apologizing or making reparations to anyone they are in short the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe
many bioethicists warned the left over the past year that supporting vaccine mandates will open the door for other forms of medical totalitarianism now we witness the takedown of roe next we will see other examples of medical totalitarianism like crispr or nauralink being mandatory for the 4th industrial revolution the left is consistently simple minded and unstrategic in their analysis  so embarrassing
ad the district of columbia to your list where abortion is at risk  theres no state government it is the jurisdiction of the congress and if republicans win the midterms they will outlaw abortion in dcwhile sending the congressional aids they routinely rape to new york for abortions
abortion shouldnt be banned it should still be legal under certain circumstances if the baby isnt going to survive if the mother cant physically have the baby safely if the pregnancy is threatening the mothers life or if the pregnancy was the result of rape those are real legitimate reasons for abortion where the mother would actually need it
finally
not your body not your right who are you to take someone elses life and im athiest so dont get me with no religious bs
love will end abortion i hope you guys know that the pro life movement helps women who are struggling to take care of their baby
the fbi is taking away peoples judgment and controlling pregnancy rates  this is one way to do as they please to the people  the fbi is targeting young women and have been for a very long time  this is one strong way to derail their lives causing them to have a problem  the fbi ruined mine repeatedly  they chased me down after college making sure i wouldnt have what i planned and had many attempts of set ups for a fall in life  individuals arent what they use to be  their frontal cortex of their brain has been picked apart in many such ways through some government mind control where this effects their judgment  judgment is hindered which can lead to many other types of instances such as pregnancy  when the prefrontal cortex is disrupted mental illnesses develop such as schizophrenia  we had many cases of schizophrenia in the past two decades  the fbi does not want to see young women succeed  they like to make them fat and ruin their lives  people might not care for these individuals cause they were brainwashed not to at first  but if the fbi targets you as a women it is very uncomfortable to live  and you have many downfalls  you just have to act like you dont care about all the horrible things they cause and keep going
is there any exception in regards of rape victims 
"welp let this be the last moment abortion to be ban cause this day modern women have no morality to kill thier own child even if its came from incest and rape which that its a crime to murder and rape 

people are blinded to thier sin of pride lust and anger  may god forgive thief soul cause they dont know what they were doing"
it was never a constitutional right please report the news and not opinion
"when you speak much about speaking on womens right and right to choose consider these too 
1like toddler or adolescent the terms embryo and fetus do not refer to nonhumans but to humans at particular stages of development
2 no matter how much better it sounds terminating a pregnancy is still terminating a life
3 the onetime choice of abortion robs someone else of a lifetime of choices and prevents him from ever exercising his rights
exceptional case must be dealt with separate law like medical emergencies rape etc abortion just because convenience should be stopped by law"
i am so glad this finally came through this is truly amazing f abortion
my body my choice lol the baby aint your body hun just becuase theres a long tube connecting you to it
all ima say is make the best choice and dont have fucking sex you dont like this abt abortion getting banned in states dont have sec dont fuck each other and rapers need to stop to maybe tapers get the fact that we that we struggles we are just incubators we carry babies for 9 months right and left women carrys babies cmon bro just dont have sex and be cautious on your surroundings m
"remember ladieswhen you are 6 weeks pregnant
you can now
1 ask for child support  
2 child credit on your tax return
3 ride hov lanes
4 cant be deported because your baby is us citizen"
so yall out here trying to ban abortion but yet dont wanna take care of all these foster kids in the system ohhh ok
america land of freedom but we forbid you
ban abortion why not increase tax on meat because it against constitution and most conservative partychristian should fast on wednesday and friday forbid to eat meat i bet that those republicans out of control to eat meat on these days because they only interest in politic
people who had been rp3 and been pregnant at the age under 18 now this what people become now
where in the constitution is abortion a right
womans rights were a mistake the r v w case was based on a lie
"we dont want the
word to go out that we
want to exterminate the
negro population
 margaret sanger founder of planned parenthood"
as if police officers dont have enough to worry about now they have to serve warrants on drs medical staff and blah blah blah
god almighty bless the antiabortion team its high time to stand firm against this decades of murdering innocent helpless babies us will thank them when time to come face to face with your god creator who hates killing innocent babies
all abortionists and those who wants abortion should have been aborted by their own mothers thenno one would be killing their own  innocent helpless unborn babies and make excuses to sexual immoralityno brainer freedom has a higher level of responsibilitymature honest  people understand this principle very well
"interesting fact     
 in 2005 the united nations human rights committee un hrc ordered peru to compensate a woman known as kl for denying her a medically indicated abortion 
this was the first time a united nations committee had held any country accountable for not ensuring access to safe legal abortion and the first time the committee affirmed that abortion is a human right39 kl received the compensation in 201639
 in the 2016 case of mellet v ireland the un hrc found irelands abortion laws violated international covenant on civil and political rights because irish law banned abortion in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities"
"and if we can accept that a mother can kill her own child how can we tell other people not to kill one another
 mother theresa"
just because a state bans abortion dont think for a moment that doctors wont continue to perform them in the world of medicine its all about coding a procedure the use an alternate procedural code to bypass insurance companies who will pay for one procedure deemed medically necessary or another code that isnt i worked in a hospital in the medical reports department and noticed a rise in a procedure called a dc after reading through the pathology reports i figured out the hospital was doing abortions
what are the 11 states 
first of all that was not a constitutional right there is no place in the constitution where it says abortion but a lot of americans are having their second amendment rights in french to bond by these red flag laws by the communist democrats and the absolute trader republicans that should be kicked out of the party
see youtube dont want to admit that anything that says jwoke to the left gets 10000 thumbs down and only one thumbs up and anything to the right gets 20 000 thumbs up and maybe two thumbs down
ban the damn thing everywhere
" we need to work together give better sex education on period of ovulation and when the reproductive system is most likely able to conceive social media also has to stop telling women that being pregnant and having kids is disturbing we need to help more women and men with mental illnesses too miscarriages and deadly ectopic pregnancies are not abortions under the law you cant compare them to actual abortions where the mom intentionally end the life some women actually dont like that people compare or mix their miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy with abortion it is not and should not be about winning something but about saving the mother and the kids life abortion was never safe and as higher risk then actually giving birth true that banning abortions is not a concluding solution since even if it is ban in certain states women can still go to other states and people are actually creating organizations to help these women get abortions and some on tiktok are also telling them to use hangers and papaya seeds to end the innocent life 


 we should work on the base of the issue if we truly want that the baby and the mom live and have a safe environment of course we cant change everything but help the people that need and want to be help and try our best but in order to do that people need to also help pro life charities that are not represented enough i also believe that some pro lifers need to be and stay humble truly care about the life and be dispose and prepared to help these women everyone should people also have to stop saying that helping a women make a better decision is wrong some of them dont even know that its alive we have to stop letting social media control us and just agree like that with something just because everyone else does and without even knowing more about the subject pro lifers need to stop calling women who had abortions murderers or killers it doesnt help we have to keep calm and truly advocate for what we say with care and truth in front and behind cameras or people addiction is also a base of the issue that can lead to abortions we should give more care to them and people will also have to want to change and work hard to become better poverty charities need more founding to help homeless mothers we have to do what we can to save both life republicans or democrats"
so happy the murder rate will be reduced in 11 states
i never agreed with thanos more than i do now
the fact men were fighting shows the state is wack
im glad its banned
amerika lets gothe stone age waits for us
its never been a constitutional right to kill babies quit lieing to the world full of lies cnn thank god for what has transpired with roe vs wade its amazing so many lives can now be saved and more opportunities for families 
"heres a simple solution to abortion

"fun fact only 3 members of the un did not ratify the un convention on the rights of the child  south sudan somalia and  usa

blame the dumocrats  jane roe lied about being ganged raped and they paid her and they pushed for late term abortions  and they arguments are outdated their from the late sixty  before google  sell phones internet ultrasounds  medicines that can save the life of premature born and low birth weight  premature babies in 1970 survived 5  now its up to 75 percent dumocrats are just using outdated argument  we have ultrasound  we can see the the baby one to weeks  their pushed for late term abortions that was that was the last straw  im talking 7 8 9 months
why yall got that women in the red suit reading a script for yall
murder is not a right just because its convenient to you
"life must be respected in all of its forms whether in the womb or outside womb
its not a wise decision to promote abortion laws by raising the issue or rape medical emergencies and teenage pregnancies etc real truth is 90 of abortion kills healthy viable babies just for the comfort of couples or profit of hospitals or companies"
this is what progress looks like im not american but this shows that they are really getting somewhere
if it takes 50 years to take it back thats a lot of lives saved 
this is terrible some womens lives are threatened due to pregnancy and those babies die too would you rather save a life or kill two
god bless those states i am so happy the happiest ive been we have stopped those baby killers child murderers these people are real heros godblessthem
im thinking travel bans for anyone who is pregnant could be next to prevent crossing state borders where abortion is still legal
there will be a mass exodus out of those states
hallelujah abortion is nothing but murder and child sacrifice we will continue to push back on this murder excusebring the fight on we are ready for you too both spiritually and naturally saying this as a proud believer in the lord jesus christ
way to go tn overturn p8
how sad that the important thing about taking rights away from your women is the next election
i find it funny how westerners argue about democracy all the time and when the majority side wins they cant handle it and protest againts their decision you call it abortion others call it murder it wouldnt even be a problem if people didnt have sex before marriage
abortion especially on demand is one of the most demented yet necessary things in this world i consider women who decided to keep their babies to be greater than those that didnt but once again it is their choice  in an ideal world no one should and will never have an abortion out of their own free will since abortion will be hard to criminalize and i doubt that it ever will it should only be allowed up to a certain point and in the earliest possible time if done so electively
right killing is right instead be mature and make a serious choice before getting pregnantlife is not a joke or casual stuffwhether you kill 5 year child or unborn child its the same thing murder
if you personally dont like abortion dont get abortion i dont see why it bothers you what people do with their body and personal life choices
dumbest shit i ever heard
i mean america was never great i petty the people there
casually drinking liberal tears
i cant wait to vote republican this time around because its insane to think the the obviously failing democratic party will do anything for my people 95 percent of native black americans whose ancestors died and bled while building this nation got nothing in return out of the 60000000 babies that plan parenthood murdered 13 of them are native black babies margret sanger designed this to solve the  problem of annihilation of disabled children before they enter the world and had a chance and black children because she deemed our lives worthless because we are born non white we all know that because white will be the minority in ethnicity in this county that they are not killing their children at alarming rates these clinics are in our neighborhoods with the full intention of making it easy for silly young women who cant seem to pop a pill say no or use some form of birth control our people need to wake up the biden harris ticket has been a nightmare for our people and where are the reparations they use the race card play on your emotions and tell you that they are your friend they dont care anything about black women so its time to wake up stop lying these well to do white women are pisses because in all their privileges they have nothing else to do cry about this or that when their  many rights are being shifted but the truth is the mass numbers of black women need reparations maybe then they could afford houses day care or a nanny to keep their children many of our young women need to stop using murder as a means of birth control
anortion is a crime not a right im glad they finally prohibited it also abortion leads to less population look at arab people they are the hugest race in this world keep your race dont reduce it another thing if you are with abortion dont even start being pregnant have sex only with your husband dont have sex with other men get pregnant and have stds then you say its your right to kill a child you are afraid of having a baby dont have sex till you are ready to have a baby cuz sex leads to pregnancy sex not for fun you are horny go masturbate or have sex with toys or watch porn and use your imagination dont do stupid thing then you say you dont want to be a mom if you dont want to get burnt dont be close to fire you dont want to get drown in a sea dont swim till you are ready and you want it glad they illegalize this crime its a crime not a right no one has a right to kill a fetus killing was never a right just cuz that fetus was inside your body doesnt mean its your right to kill it exactly like having a child you abuse it cps take it from you you have another human being inside you it means it has a right to live then this fetus after she or he gets born and become an adult can decide if they want to keep living or not you still dont want your baby send it for adoption bunch of women wish they get pregnant and have babies just talk to the nurse and let her find the baby a mom to have it once it gets born it happens in middle east if the mom has too many kids and cant have any more and she hit pregnant she gives it to her sister who wants more to adopt it

both extreme positions banning all abortions and allowing abortion up to moment of birth do not have majority support allowing abortion until the detection of a heartbeat is not effectively banning abortion allowing abortion in the first trimester is not effectively banning abortion allowing abortion up to the moment of birth is gross that is the killing of a fullterm baby most people support limited abortion the media is lying about this issue
"yeah roe wade is dead      womens rights how about the rights of all the women these women murdered   we women have plenty of reproductive rights  right to decide to have sex right ti decide what form of birth control to use right to decide to keep the baby or place the baby for adoption  what about  womens responsibility to the child they chose to create   i am a woman and i believe abortion is reprehensible  quite calling it womens rights most women

"do fetuses have the right to life

the argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong
i will simply assume instead of proving that your murder is seriously wrong
i will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder
finally i will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issues to which this analysis of abortion ethics may lead
the symmetries arising from the analysis of the main arguments on both sides of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult
consider the following standard argument against abortion fetuses are both human and alive people have the right to life
therefore fetuses have the right to life of course women have the right to control their own body but the right to life goes beyond a womans right to control her own body
therefore abortion is wrong
the fetus right to life does not include his right to use someone elses body to preserve his life
however an opponent of abortion may point out that a womans right to use her body does not include her right to end someone elses life in order to do what she wants with her body
in response one might argue that a pregnant womans right to control her body is not much if it is wrong to take any action that ends the life of the fetus within her
however an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus right to life does not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses
the consequence of all these symmetries seems to be a stalemate
but if we have an attitude then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of rights a fetal right to life versus a womans right to control her body
one could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control ones own body in the case of abortion because the loss of ones life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control ones own body a respect for nine months
therefore the right to life prevails over the right to control ones own body and abortion is wrong"
all these people who are pro abortion should have been aborted waste of air
bro who cares its not a real human yet let a woman abort it if she wants i dont understand why its illegal
boo hoo yall wont be able to get away with murder anymore
move to california and watch your life go to shit ill give you leftist a ride
"can someone tell me why tho like why did they just decide to get together and take away this right

 was it out of the blue or was this a work in progress over the past couple weeks months or years

 it just seems outta no where like even the president doesnt agree w this decision so idk ik i sound dumb but im just out the loop under a rock lmao just seems stupid imo 

takes up time money resources causes strikes and riots it only makes space for a fat mess tbh so much for land of the free

even if u dont agree with abortions the choice should still be yours to make

hec this world is fastracked towards overpopulation eventually and this dont help that cause either"
fake news it says nothing in the constitution about abortion
a woman carries a child at the cost of her health and future so only every woman can decide whether to have an abortion or not and not the state by banning abortions you will only put women at risk abortions will be done anyway a woman is more important than an embryo and by the way at the stage of abortion someone is not yet a living being
thank you jesus christ our blessed lord for hearing our prayers and answered amen  the spirit and the bride say come lord comeamen
woho  finally no more easy killing in womb

im surprised there are so many abortion rate in america and they are banning abortion  god bless america guess people need to take more responsibility in having sex
and rape victims  they live in hell and she doesnt have a consent what the actual 
good job weve saved innocent lives now next is lets get every state in the us to ban baby murder gods army will always prevail then finally we can start imposing new processive laws like no dating in school until 24 or until young adults can prove their financial stability to take care of a new life they eager to create fact is the more people are educated the less sex they crave the problem is most highly educated and smart people dont want create children to pass on their superior genes while most lowly educated and not so smart people always want sex to create more children hope we can address this issue as well
good ban democrats next
u should study indian constitution
american constitution is too much rigidwe indians are 400 ahead than american constitutional rights
oh excuse me your all atheists so god has no bearing on your pitiful lives ok got it

also you can only adopt at 21 but a 12 year old is capable of raising a baby
big up to backstreet abortion and adoption
okay so why arent men getting their ability to pass sperm blocked  until they are able to conceive notice how women do all the hard work but its never the man who has to make any sacrifices women should go on strike and not go out their houses and anywhere near men and kill the population off  see how they like that
the funny thing is liberals want to ban guns because of latest killings but want to be a able to kill thousands by abortion so it you kill a woman who is pregnant you cant be charged with double homicide right because the fetus isnt human by liberals standards
think of all the black babies that will be saved
each state is like a country in europe
"i got one for you cnn

res 261 section 1 neither the united states nor any state shall deprive any human being from the moment of conception of life without due process of law nor deny to any human being from the moment of conception within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws

now i understand your not very versed in the constitutional law of our lan and thats ok im here to help basically under law the fetus is its own separate entity from the mother getting all of our rights and freedoms from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg im sorry to tell you its not your body and the only abortions protected under law is do to rape and possibility of death"

most complaining so far seem to be from liberals people on the left but basically states who want to cam just decide that you can abort even in the 9 months soooooo should not right people complain also for this potential atrocity 
guess you better be responsible  keep your legs closed  im not imposing my religion  im not religious but i think abortion for birth control is an abomination  and i live in a state where enough people agree  if you dont like it frame an argument and win over a majority to change opinion  otherwise keep a rainy day fund to get scraped in california ho bag

america is a dreadful
its okay to kill little in school with guns 
"i request zelensky  or president  putin or any christian in the world  to always think  these abcde and fs in your life  for a great future 
god bless you
logic of  joy or peace in life is very lies in a very moral knowledge of  life style
thats as below
everytime or every moment  or always when you do not love   careful that someone watches you  the world  eyes flesh lusts and pride 
you have lot of 
peace 
courage
a gods children have no fear of death  
but we will not die unless it is gods willgreat peace  in times of diseases or fearful journnies in life battle 
b we shouldnt be worrying about anything a lot because everything works together for good for those who love god  marriage or death  or any good or humiliation or a great permanent honour
c we must sacrifice our life at least for our children
the world is not  life  to us 
imagine will a father be happy if he gets some privileges but not his children  
never 
so something if you dont get 
or something dangerous happens to you deliberately is for good 
because we live for a fellow christians or a christian family and children and overall for the  kingdom of god in earth  government
d we must know that
our heart  is filled with fear and guilty conscience for many reasons
1 for not following according to 1 john 216
2 our unbelief  jesus could not do many miracles because of their harden heart and unbelief
3 our blind eye  we dont avoid or cut our relationship with a bad christian towards a bad companionship
e if fod doesnt comfort tou with a bible verse we can not keep it as our possession
invite shames to you  before you  expecting a miracle we forget brotherhood and prayers  god will be glorified amongst brothers and church 
so tell your problems to the congregations medias people or governments but miracle is gods  in any situation what we can do we must should do it  never expect god to do what you should do honour god respect god 
but life is god 
for example 
lazarus death 
the news reached jesus  this means to prayer  and brotherhood 
rolling down of the stone take away the stone  take off the grave clothes john gospel chapter 1139 and 45 
untie the bandages
for example
we got some shops in the middle of a city here 
but managing to keep it with respect as a owner is very difficult
but god comforted me with a verse 1 corinthians 131
this shops to us are from our hindu ancestors so though god is helping us to keep it but we get lot of insults 
every time when i get a problem i pray god and go according to his counsel
29 so that no one may boast before himbg 30 it is because of him that you are in christ jesusbh who has become for us wisdom from godthat is our righteousnessbi holinessbj and redemptionbk 31 therefore as it is written let the one who boasts boast in the lorddbl
so what 1 john 216 
says about not to love 
lusts of the eyes  because people or enemies watch it make it a issue as sin this we must be careful everytime at home and outside holy it means do not love sights do not turn back and see do not listen to what they speak even
lusts of flesh 
pride of life  insults
you must know that there are temptations common to all men  paul to corinthians about sins of israelites in wilderness
f 
never forget alk are sinners
ecclesiastes 7
g always know ba face our life is eternal
not in this earth
but here too god can raise honour your head

so the hand maids tale is actually what those christians and republicans are aiming for you cant say this wasnt obvious
im just wondering if the people on the other side of my computer have any idea how much they are going to suffer from here on out its more than just a slap in our faces its a violation of our civil rights
but it should not be decided at the states through the legislators and reps as some are saying it should be dicided at the state level through the people via a direct vote in ballot initiatives do you support abortion yes or no governors should not be deciding for everyone because lets be honest you can have more individuals in support of abortion or gun laws or whatever at the state level however gerrymandering can allow a republican like ron desantis to win and hence a enacting laws that the majority of the people do not want all the republicans from the top down for decades have been passing these gerrymandered voting maps i have never seen a more maniacally unfair cheating dishonest group of so called christians in my life
it has always been evil to kill babies womens rights the unborn babies also have rights they have the right to live jesus is king jesus will have the victory at the end

constitutional right to kill their offspring poor pitiful bunch of feminazis might have to go back in the closet i call that a breath of fresh air poor babies maybe they might decide to plan having a child rather then use abortion for birth control sick bunch of miss guided minds
sadly it was only 11 
hahhahahah exactly a hard slap to bad women at least as bad as phu thuy d
"no other country on earth includes abortion as a right in the constitution not eve liberal canada 
newsflash the supreme courst didnt ban abortion"
"hmmmm i searched cnn arizona capital and nothing came up 
the capital was overrun with legislators trapped inside but thats ok right"
murdering your own child is not a constitutional right
here comes  the next migration to free states
why ban abortion i dont get it
a question for everyone who supports abortion  what is the fault of the child and the generations that are killed  is their fault their weakness and inability to defend themselves  if you do not want the child there are those who dream about this child that you are killing make other families adopt him instead of killing him or not carry him in the first place
there will be restoration of truths to america  god  listens to his people unbelievers dont   understand everywhere there is life shows proof of god open your eyes
will banning abortion stop it or will women turn to unsavory and unsanitary methods  is there free sterilisation or birth control methods in america how about trying to prevent or reduce  the need for killing first
"what does abortion ban mean to men
end of financial freedom"
oh cool texas banned abortion 
who cares its not like the massive grotesque land whales that typically demand the right to murder children are ever going to get fertilized reeeeeeee reeeeeeeee
seriously what good are any of these democrats they let this happen on their watch starting to think these people suck and they have no plan
"those maniac magats are using facial recognition software to capture faces and software that checks all social media for matches 

       i think we should all  always wear masks  those dark web sites are screaming about aborting us  again "
i think i know why they did it i had nothing to do with abortion it has all to to with getting the house and senate back since they cant win in a fair election they banned abortion so democrats in swingstates will move out of it to a democrat state therefor that state will become red again they get more votes and more power that way its a long run process but i think thats there endplay maybe look into that cnn just an opinion of me
first the zealot religious freak rightwing cult went after the first amendment then roe vs wade and now most likely the separation of church and state
"this is servitude   

thirteenth amendment
neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction"
shame on those 11 states your steping back in dark times  shame on you
democrat politicians couldnt be happier they now have something to campaign and fund raise on
"dumb  she says its harder to cross state lines to get those legal services if needed 
but no one got a problem going to cali to visit disneyland   or florida  or vegas to place a few bets  or hawaii to go to the beach
so bogus"
its not a constitutional right show us where it says that in the constitution
abortions is evil only the devils children get abortions
i just want to know whos going to take care of all these unwanted children its going to happen and its not going to be far away is the supreme court going to step up or is this just going to be orphanages like theyre used to be all over the states
next prohibition of all contraceptives mark my words theres only a very thin line left between the conservatives and the taliban
it is not a constitutional right all states should ban abortion
finally no more kill babes
abortion is just like inviting someone over to your house and then killing them
i am not american this news show sounds like opinion rather than news which is essentially propaganda there is no need for opinion in news you can just inform people thats enough
the new kkk aka gop party made their message clearthey want us to go back to the 1800s im glad that i dont live in my home state of missouri anymore
maybe if all these beta boys had a pull out game as good as their fortnite game you hairy women wouldnt have to worry about abortions
amen to those states
congratulations usa welcome back to the civilized world the united states has made progress in civilizing by changing legislation and now you are one of the people only primitives kill unborn children thank god god is great glory jesus christ
im a foster mom and you people care so much about these fetuses but once theyre out you leave it to people like us to clean up for 11 damn dollars a day
abortion is pre meditated murder unless under certain conditions
"trump2024
but first the midterms nov 2022
red wave coming "
this is an easily win a bow argument for democrats you propose abortion and you play some limits on it thats it give it a timeframe thats all you gotta do its not hard its not complicated you come up with a time frame dont make it indefinite but you can include the rate for a woman to have an abortion can you set an limit a date within the pregnancy once they do that you presented as the federal standard you wish to employ in every democrat should get behind it even if you want more you say i can agree with this after that you ask the republicans for their standard because most americans believe a woman should have the right to an abortion if you can present some argument and then ask your competitor 2 there and its fractured at best you can win votes
as a man i never knew that there was such widespread hatred and disrespect for womeni mean the religious right hates women more than they even hate minoritieswow
arkansas banned the act of baby killing and i am proud of my state  time for the rest of yall to get on board
404 women of color use abortion services more so women of color are slutslol
abortion was never a constitutional right
roe was just the beginning so many other decisions are predicated on the right to privacy that rvw enshrined birth control gay marriage interracial marriage the list goes on were heading to the handmaids tale at this point
love this panel led by abby she is one of my faves
here is something the evangelicals can really sink their teeth in to they believe that a human life begins at conception if that is so and it is also so that every person has a soul then every conception has a soul it is a scientific fact  look it up  that in the  normal course of human reproduction approximately 74 of conceptions  do not survive to become a full term baby for evangelicals then in heaven 74 of the souls there will have never had a life they instead were conceived died and then just moved into heaven for the evangelicals and now for the rest of us based on the scotus decision for every million souls in heaven 750000 will have never had a consciousness in life to everyone but evangelicals that concept is absurd

"from another post  im not promurdering babies
im probecky who found out at her 20week anatomy scan that the infant she had been so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organs
im prosusan who was sexually assaulted on her way home from work only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later
im protheresa who haemorrhaged due to a placental abruption causing her parents spouse and children to have to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or her unborn child
im prolittle cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11yearold body isnt mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal
im promelissa whos working two jobs just to make ends meet and has to choose between bringing another child into poverty or feeding the children she already has because her spouse walked out on her
im probrittany who realizes that she is in no way financially emotionally or physically able to raise a child
im proemily who went through ivf ending up with six viable implanted eggs requiring selective reduction to ensure the safety of her and a safe number of foetuses
im projessica who is finally getting the strength to get away from her physically abusive spouse only to find out that she is carrying the monsters child

you can argue and say that im prochoice all you want but the truth is
im prolife
their lives
womens lives
you dont get to pick and choose which scenarios should be accepted its not about which stories you dont agree with its about fighting for the women in the stories that you do agree with and the choice that was made
womens rights are meant to protect all women regardless of their situation

us citizens are themselves guilty of destroying their own country and allowing tyrannical and theocratic state governments to rob americans of their constitutional and human rights the 2nd us civil war coming to a neighborhood near you will decide what kind of country the usa morphs into its up for grabs
why tf cnn has russian colours in the background
the next right to be pruned by the fascist gopgqp chainsaw is the right to peacefully assemble and protest the first amendment its already gone in states that have made it legal for drivers to run over and even kill protesters walking on public roads without any fear of being charged with a crime eg places like florida

walmart and many businesses do not give employees a 40 hour work week just to avoid paying for or offering insurance"
what rights have women lost these ppl are clowns women still have rights you just cant end the life of a baby do these clowns not own a constitution where does it say you have the right to end the life of a baby the constitution says not to deprive a person of life
a womb is not the safest place to be these men think its a walk in the park what a horror show im so ashamed i served this countrymy guns have more rights
this is still a fight i wouldnt consider this the sky is falling moment
its actually insane like the level of extremism to let a 9 year old raped girl be scarred for life by forcing to bear her rapists child go to happen and endorse it  like these 6 clowns  i guess the my body maskvaccine  crowd suddenly dont care about bodily autonomy
reading through the comment section i realize how uneducated and brainwashed cnn viewers are

40 of the black community in america is eliminated through abortion

people who believe for birth rights you have that always the right to have an abortion has been taken awaythats not right
well abortion is a murder and im not religious women should not be able to kill their children when theyre least protected and face little consequences
so please explain  if the voters go back to this and try and vote it back in the socus is lifetime and they can over turn it again even if 100 of the people vote it back in there is only one way this will change if the bad apples on the supreme court somehow mysteriously die then maybe this can be fixedjust sayin what everybody is thinking
jesusi never think that us population goes into that bad situation
banning abortion will increase the chance of child abuse
i hope they start killing lawmakers over thisthey did it to abortion doctors and bombed clinics when it was legalso what good for the goose

just think about how young some of these justices are they are definitely not going to retire until republicans are in a position to nominate and affirm another conservative unless one is assonated god please dont let that happen then it could be decades before dens got control of court back scary to think about
there sure is a lot of crying from so many people who have claimed to love our democracy until rvw is thrown back into democracy from federal authoritarian rule
50 years of babys not being killed 
the courts not conservativetheir blocking 100 years of medical caresome are sick deformed  incest and rape victimsits very personaloften tragic
so let me understand law enforcement who can barely keep up with the number of murders rapes home invasions robberies and cybercrimes are now going to add abortion to their job description good luck with that
these 11 that past this law well done because the lord jesus doesnt love killing at all well done all the states should do this because people are wicked killing off so much babies the lord jesus is going to get everyone that abort a baby
this new development should teach us many things first both men and women need to be responsible when they interact with women secondly stop voting for politicians that dont have your interest
poor american people have lost two basic human rights the right to live by repeated massive gun killing  the right to abort by supreme judges who made their decision based on politic io law  what a diplomatic country

the deciding justices have ignored fundamental civil rights guaranteed by our constitution and years of judicial precedent to advance a politically partisan agenda there is no denying the fact that this is a direct attack on all women and black women stand to be disproportionately impacted by the courts egregious assault on basic human rights we must all stand up to have our voices heard in order to protect our nation from the further degradation of civil rights protections we have worked so hard to secure we the people who cares about abortion and gay rights need to register and mobilize voters in what will be the most critical midterm election america has ever faced if youre not registered to vote or know someone who isnt now is the moment this is no time for anyone to sit on the sidelines now is the time for all current and former dems politicians celebrity allies business owners and organizations to hold rallies and townhall meetings every weekends in poor white latino black and asians rural counties to educate voters on how dems policies are improving their livelihood this will help get dems voters motivate to vote in 2022 so dems can keep control of the us house and win a super majority in the us senate with 61 dems senators this is the only way for dems to pass meaningful police and criminal justice reforms voting rights comprehensive immigration economy abortion gay rights and gun control
i bet any money people will move out of these states
lies lies lies  dear mr biden on 62222 i was watching news and there you were on tv lying about how the ukraine war was responsible for the high gasoline prices in the u s  apparently you actually expect the public to believe that lie  what you left out of your lying rhetoric was how you came to that conclusion  maybe you can explain just how in the hell the ukraine conflict could possibly have an effect on the price of gasoline in the united states  of america especially since the u s is completely selfsufficient in oil production and independent of foreign oil  lets get this out in the open so that the american people can learn how just you make things up as you go along whatever suits you like for instance the russians are invading the words that was responsible for getting things stirred up in ukraine and which has got us to where we are now in ukraine  such as you stockpiling that drug crazy friend of yours with enough weapons to destroy ukraine which he is doing little by little and blaming it on russia  today it just so happens that i feel like strolling down memory lane  lets see now in order to make americans forget about all of your fuckups you started with your lying rhetoric about how the russians are invading yet you did not start any sanctions against russia when all the russians were doing was postering at the ukraine border  in fact you did not start sanctions against russia until you used the peaceful incursion of russia into ukraine as an excuse to start sanctions  then you kept up the rhetoric until nato eu and your drug crazy friend zelensky got on board with your lying rhetoric about russia invading  then your drug crazy friend decided to go a step further by telling the ukraine population that the russians are invading and coming to kill them which started their scramble to flee that possibility  then your drug crazy friend decided to take things even a step further by starting to bomb ukraine and blaming it on russia  evidence of zelensky doing the bombing was submitted to you congress senate nato and eu yet none of you acted on that evidence and allowed zelensky to continue with his rhetoric and bombing because he is doing exactly what you want him to do which is to smear putin because you hate and fear him so much if it was not for your words the russians are invading of which nato eu and zelensky picked up on there would not be any destruction in ukraine or people fleeing their country  so mr biden whether you like it or believe it or not you are solely and directly responsible for the ukraine conflict which history will eventually show  what a legacy you are going to leave behind  first palestine then afghanistan now the texas border and ukraine after the supreme court decision today to kill roe v wade you can also add abortion to your fuckedup legacy because you could have prevented it by adding three more justices to the court  it was a conscious effort on your part to not add the three justices to the court because that would mean that the court would then be ruling in favor of the democrats and you being a republican in sheeps clothing posing as a democrat could not allow that today being 62522 one day after the devastating earthquakethere is help from the  un and international and local charities as well as the taliban govt  where is the help from the u s to the people you deserted and left to the mercy of the taliban does your hate for the afghans still linger so much that you refuse them aid and instead help with a worthless war in ukraine  god what a legacy  also you congress and the senate were provided with evidence that the u s is entirely selfsufficient in oil production and is independent of any foreign oil  in fact the evidence shows that the u s exports 7 million more barrels a day than it produces  how is that possible  is someone dipping into the reserves  that being said then how can what happens in ukraine or anyplace else in the world possibly affect the price of gasoline in the u s  to make matters even worse you actually believe what the lying crooked oil companies are saying about being unable refine enough oil to keepup with demand  do you really believe that even if they could that they would be producing enough oil to reduce the price of oil  what the hell are you thinking  make them prove it to you  do you actually expect them to tell you the truth about anything  i cant believe that even you and the dummy congress can be that naive  so all of you people out there in facebook land if you dont like what is going on at the gas pump then get on these peoples case and demand action  also mr biden it becomes more and more apparent that you ran for president on a false ticket by claiming that you were a democrat when in all actually you are a republican in sheeps clothing  all of your actions point to that being the case  so far everything that you have done has been contrary to the democratic party and has favored the gop  in fact once you stop and think about it the same thing can be said about vice president harris and the supposedly democratic congress and senate  so far none of you have acted democratically  i believe that i can provide an answer for your actions  if you performed as democrats then it would mean that you would be risking your lives by crossing trump and his crazy zealots and the insane and dangerous gop and of course the president because he has already shown where his allegiance lays  therefore i guess you poor guys are in a predicament arent you  your damned if you act like a democrat and history will frown on you if you dont  personally i would not want my children or grandchildren to remember me failing my country due to cowardice  as far as you are concerned harris because of your hate for biden you have become the most inefficient vice president in history  the same can be said about the u s congress  do we even have a democratic govt any longer        just voicing the truth 62522  cc  biden harris pelosi schumer schiff cnn
bottom line roewade was bad law there is nothing in the constitution that supports it overturning rw was not about abortion it was about the law the court did not ban abortion or make it illegal in 1973 when the court said that it was a constitutional right they were wrong nothing in the constitution gives that right no what the constitution does say is we have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness key word here is life
shame shame shame shame shame on all those who have taken away womens rights
the state compelling women to be baby bearing slaves is barred under the 13th amendment   this decision also violates the establishment clause by making the catholic faith of scotus justices the law of the land  time to remove the power of constitutional review from scotus   congress can do this simply through amendment of the judiciary act of 1789 and limiting scotus jurisdiction to those legal issues as defined in in the constitution   there is no constitutional authority for scotus to adjudge the constitutionality of laws passed by congress  this type of judicial review was an invention of john marshall in marbury v madison and it is without foundation in the constitution
hes right the womb is the safest place for a child in oklahoma once theyre born his government puts their lives at risk oklahoma ranks 46th in insured children 45th in education 45th in child poverty and 44th in child wellbeing
5 religious extremists are holding this country hostage as a first generation american i thought we were safe from religion especially in 2022 god isnt even a thing how are we changing real live law based on a madeup invisible man religious extremists making the rules is something i thought id only see places like afghanistan do this
"roe v wade and abortion rights are not the same thing  
it just means that abortions are taken care of at a state level instead of a federal level  
keep in mind the the reason this is happening is because a woman abused a federal law to force a man to financially take care of her and her child while he wasnt the biological father"
freedom and democracy for all lol  the taliban took back afghanistan now it looks like theyve taken over the us as well
antiabortion but promassshootings 
leave those states reducing their population reduced the sits in the congress and their power in the government we need workers in our democratic states better paid and with better laws more human more safe
lie one cnn abortion was never ever a constitutional right show me where it says killing a child in the whom is a right and i will show you where it says i can keep my ar 15 to protect my baby from any harm
il gonna make that 
"last year i posted 
those who call themselves prolife believe a human life begins at conception  and those who are prochoice believe a nonviable fetus is not yet a human life  the only resolution would seem to be complete control over conception so that only intentional pregnancies occur   can we just agree that until control over conception is a medical certainty this will remain an insoluble issue  until then this will requires tolerance and respect from both sides  we have a moral obligation to do all we can to prevent unwanted pregnancy   yet we must not chastise those who face such a personal choice  i do not believe anyone has the right to force a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term  prolife beliefs should be respected but their beliefs cannot supersede the rights of the pregnant woman herself prior to fetal viability that is  for now the roe decision on using a viability limit to govern abortion is the best compromise available to balance the rights of all concernedfor now  
and now we are proudly marching into a past that was never as good as their selective memory recalls 

god help us"
is it a crime against human beings or a women right like how  this prouves that the western ppl are running from the responsabilities even as parents
trump did all this 
"government intrusion into womens privacy and reproductive
healthcare at the behest of the gop is just the beginning other
shoes will soon drop as scotus justice thomas made clear
birth control availability and means are now on the chopping block"
facing the global energy crisis oil dried up the best way is to produce hydrogen energy and build hydrogen refueling stations
found the movement it seems in america by hundreds of thousands of women and by the democratic party is the fight for men not to wear a condom and its not teaching women how to use other contraceptives maybe because the democratic party thinks women are too stupid morons and they will not comprehend the use of other contraceptives besides abortion on the other hand the republican party is telling them to put on the condom and use contraceptives and not to use abortion as one
"yes crushing a babies skull ripping off its little legs and arms while it is still in the womb and then throwing the bloody body parts in the dumpster is healthcare   
oh and sometimes the baby survives and you dont want to know what kind of healthcare they give it then
lol"
i strongly advise any woman who does not want to have a baby should not get pregnant
abortion is not a constitutional right show me where in the constitution is says that
you will now see an exodus out of those states  this will also discourage people from moving into those states
its mistake then its a mistake  who we  are to tell women what to do with they own body  thats so crazy controlling 
they wont mention religion because that would hurt their business
abortion only increase taxes 
tell the lefties to move to california where taxes are always increasing
lol accountability
its a good thing liberal woman have penises
taking bets on how and how often sock puppet joe will embarrass the us on his european field trip
vote out republicans now
thank god   
the 2000 mules caused the biden administration now you have to pay the gas bill find out who they are
wow great time for the ones who were screaming my body my choice about a fking shot
so if abortion is not a constitutional right can we make it one  i think that would be something that can be successful  the fact is many anti abortion people are only anti abortion because of their local culture but they quietly support it they will vote for it in private
when does my body my rights no longer exist the minute the baby comes out seconds before the baby comes out weeks months can you kill your child anytime because they came from your body at one point so when you get an ultrasound and see the babies fingers you still have no issue having an abortion i understand why abortions should be allowed for certain reasons but just confused how people are not realizing they are killing a baby
"bottom line is if a woman tells another individual she is pregnant expecting a baby the response should be congratulations you should have the baby youd be a mother not you should abort 
beyond that basic example without further explanation it is important to understand the variables if the individual suggests they are not going to deliver the baby or carry full term it is not an easy solution the same exact for every individual experience 
thereby in some instances people are going to do at times what they themselves may be inclined to do 
in addition it is important to understand a miscarriage is not the same thing as an abortion women do lose babies by miscarriage that decipherable by the course of the pregnancy it seemed one discussion was trying to imply connection between losing a baby and aborting a baby two very different experiences typically though both are very emotionally upsetting and leave years of anguish sorrow regret wonder sadness etc becoming a mother giving up a child for adoption or any such other experience is usually of serious impact as a human connection if the individual has a heart a soul emotions it is not a light decision it is serious and personal moms who have had children a child usually love their children child and are happy of having had them thus if a person has news of pregnancy try to encourage and be supportive yet understand that the experience is complex the physicians may or may not know more in regards to the womb and the delivery and that personal opinion is absolutely best in regards to personal decision and as a recommendation guidance"
more and more people will have a vasectomy now
must be the family friendly states 
imagine living in a world where people are driven to hysteria and violence at the prospect that babies might be allowed to live  welcome to the twilight zone  
this isnt just a slap in the face this  will be used as a precedent to take even more rights as fast as possible
soon the united states supreme court will go after contraceptive rights and gay marriage and then free speech and then take away all opposition
the man should be prosecuted for jerking off
guns in ny and abortion overruled just distractions by the right to get americans to turn away from the 6th hearings
children life mater
whats the point of a panel discussion where everyone on the panel has the same point of view
thank you trump children are greatfull trump for life 
there is so much time that goes into talking about discussing topics nearly every topic over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over it seriously seems amazing that people do not become tired of talking about stuff repeatedly repeatedly
vote vote in the name of every native american that arent allowed to vote still in 2022 there are tribes that never got the right to vote 2024 marks the 100 year anniversary of the indian citizenship act but some states still dont count some tribes as part of that act tribes like the 16 comanche tribes who never surrendered arizona flipped last election because the navajo stepped up and used their right to vote some tribes dont even realize they too can vote others refuse out of distrust for the left and right churches dont pay taxes but they still are allowed to vote
cnn telling lies again abortion was never a constitutional right
all this because many democrats decided to sit out the 2016 election because their guy didnt get the nomination hopefully those people learned the error of their ways and moving forward i only hope those people also learned that elections have consequences boy did we pay a horrible price for it as a result of their stupidity
there appears to be broad public support to ban abortions in multiple states
 this emptyheaded female really just said medication through the mail    abortion pills simply do not fit the definition of the word medication
as it is their democratic right dont like it move
is this taliban or usa
liesconstitution never give that right
i think that if the baby is blackabortion should be legal
im sure babies and mothers feel a lot safer now all medical expenses related to pregnancy and childbirth will be covered by universal healthcare and childrens living expenses will be paid for by the big government that promised to protect every child thank you to the supreme court for helping the quality of life for children in the 4th trimester and beyond
this is disgusting women should choose not the state what happened to freedom
cnn i though everyone is against the ruling but in all these comments i see that everyone is happy with the ruling
sooooo those who shout adoptionare they going to adopt these unwanted unloved children have they done so already and cant take anymore children in i asked my former classmate who uses her christianity as a weapon3 days later and my fbf want an answer
black markets arise in 11 states as well
as an unwanted child whose mom only had me because of religious beliefs due to lets just say lackluster parenting ive been passed through the system for a while why dont the ones who push for abortion bansrestrictions help fix some of the underlying problems first so us mistakes dont have to live in the current broken system that is cps after being born my time in cps hasnt been super fun but my experiences dont speak for everyone and most workers mean well i used to despise the idea of abortion too but with so many kids like me who go down the wrong path because they never had proper structure and stability in their lives needed to flourish abortion might just be for the best yk
the way these people are freaking out i really have to ask the question how many times a month are these women getting pregnant  this makes no sense
it is called the will of the majority that is what the people in those states wants i doubt that california oregon washington illinois ny nj new england states will follow suit so abortion is still available in the us and legal in those states that is what the  people want it states rights
so sad now these republicans need to adopt all these unwanted children
god is fighting for the unborn good luck murderers
they can take a trip and get one else where
only 11 keep it coming it will be a glorious day when its illegal countrywide we all know the lunatics in new york and california will never let their love for killing unborn children go away 4850 is good for me
mommy stop killing me give me a chance
if those 66 of americans who do not wish to see abortion bands vote for democrats to win the senate they can secure abortion is legal
"i dont think there exists a more morally bankrupt political organization anywhere in the western world than the gop 
fascist autocracy at its finest"
clarence thomas and mitch mcconnell might consider that like abortion neither is interracial marriage constitutionally protected only since 1967
these forced breeding bills is just pure insane and completely unconstitutional
the republicans strike back
the republicans strike back
never visiting or doing business with a red state
i dont understand how so many people who doesnt care how people walk around as if  nothing is wrong people are so worried about other people and no one can help them no one see nothing wrong with that picture right now let us save the lives of the children who are her ect and try to save our lives and get them to act and make life easier and more affordable and more liveable we need them to lower the cost of living food gas rent everything else and keep something high but not that high and make things low that can be low amen and let what can be free be free i know we have time but expif you standing outside and someone approached you to bless you are you going to say no thank you or come back later amen so today is always a good day
god bless donald j trump
great news
america has not freedom
w america
and in breaking news republicans are to phase out the elephant icon and replace it with a foot and crosshairs
dont date anyone that doesnt believe in womens rights dont live in states that believe women have the right to autonomy and look how fast they can act no ability when babies are murdered thats murky and shouldnt be political but stripping right back to 1898 is all good no more pretending this is a matter of political differences authoritarianism vs democratic republic  and if white folks are willing to murder each other what can the rest of us really expect   
there are government programs to help the moms out there like free health care and welfare programs
get your tubes tied its cheap painless reversible and theres no need to murder a baby and go to hell
its amazing how cnn can just lie to everyone and morons eat it up think for yourself know what the truth really is  or shut the fk up
republicans just want to be able to rape women and not be responsible for the child they create
hmmmm i wonder what constitutional rights the democrats will take away now republicans opened pandoras box
these red states are used to having inbred people nothing new
whats next same sex marriges votes for women or the return of jim crow segregation crazy usa
why are they not trying to prove that abortion is a constitutional right 
i blame democrats for this i tried to tell anyone i came in contact with before the 2016 election that roe v wade and obamacare was on the ballet because the positions that mitch was holding up and justice ginsburg heath but to many made excuses to why they couldnt vote for hillary now we all will have to suffer for their stupidity
once the government successfully  eliminates a right you would think they would be satisfied but they are not they keep going look for more limits on your rights with no end in sight
"woman he had sex so he has to take responsibility for the cild and pay 20yrs of support
woman just because i had sex doesnt mean i want a child i have a right to kill it with abortion"
its a distraction from whats really happening  people wont afford food and water that are surviving right now bidens up to the plate to answer to that one the lefties will take more of your tax dollar soon too
ar15 need to be banned before we talk about abortion
white supremacists are infiltrating all levels of government from local school councils to state and federal congresses  they plan to overturn future elections and create a dictatorship mary miller of illinois is one of them majorie taylor greene and lauren boebert are too vote against them in november 2022 and 2024
yes to life
those numbers arent correct
there 50 states this is bs
god wins save the babies 
unfortunately that 60 in favor of roe v wade are concentrated in blue states
i support abortion until a child is able to become selfaware until that point the child is no different than an animal disagree and you are a pro choice hypocritical monster
if roe is on the ballot i guess ill be voting red
"garland just keeps gnashing his teeth 
thank you rbg and president trump"
"the constitutional right to abortion says the cnn snowflake
there is no right to abortion in the constitution abortion and constitution are two words that should never be in the same sentence"
you dont have the right to murder your own baby
if you can cross state lines to get an abortion then you should be able to cross state lines to buy a gun also just saying you cant have one and not the other and its hilarious when  the shoe is on the other foot
women can we agree that you stop sleeping with men that are uneducated and cant afford to raise the kids this way you screw over all the losers that voted for this cause you know they are all broke af with no talent and just want to make you a single mom its 2022 stop sleeping with broke people to show you are in control of your body then watch them change the law back asap
"the supreme court has no constitutional power to overturn laws on the basis of their constitutionality judicial review so let the democratic states make laws outlawing the possession of firearms by private citizens who are not part of a well regulated militia

as the 2nd amendment intended"
evangelical america  using the handmaids tale as a blueprint since 2022
abortion never was a constitutional right
"11 out of 50  that leaves 39 states to have an abortion and in the future the issue will go to the ballot boxes  so the issue is not settled so dumb
speculation and assumptions"
women who have misscariages early in their pregnancy or late will be suspect to criminal charges in some of these states and it will be hard to prove ones innocence anyone that doubts that this will happen only need to google it has already happened before even when roe vs wade was the law of the land
throw in war and pestilence and its basically the dark ages
in oklahoma if you are a victim of rape incest or your life is put in danger from the pregnancy you can still have an abortion they forgot to report that
conservatives can celebrate that they got what they wanted via hypocrisy stealing cheating lying perjury  there was a complete abdication of ethics  morals in obtaining this temporary victory minority rule is the road to fascism  should not be tolerated
let me get this straight now i can vote whether a woman has rights or not
those who would sacrifice liberty for lower gas prices will get neither  apologies to ben f
abortion is the red herring
dang it now me and my girlfriend cant go on our cruise next month how dare they make abortions illegal
137 someone needs to tell mrs pelosi that the ladies that are carrying the children didnt just spontaneously get pregnant i personally think its not real fair to the dads that do want something to do with their children that they have no say in wether an abortion should or should not happen if someone can explain why the dads should have no say in this i would love to here
all about a womans right to play god
i wish men had a right to choose they dont we sure dont have any reproductive rights and all over usa men are being kept from their children they love that they never hurt or anything forced to pay child support amount regardless of income or bills and food other children overhead prices medical costs no exception if a man can not see his children release him a man should have some rights really men are parents to we do have a parental instinct and love our children as much as a woman can they are part of us as well it takes two to make one ya know imagine being happy overjoyed about a incoming child but the other parent decides not to go thru with it and you want the baby but have no legal right to fight to save it and regardless of your pleas they abort your child anyway
to all those saying my body my choice i am curious what you all think about suicide if a person wants to end their own life it is their body and their choice many people look down on those that commit suicide and call it selfish why so its ok to take another persons life abortion but not ones own
"absolutely fantastic these supporters of infanticide yes the brutal murder of the foetus latin for baby thats right baby do not realise the most high creator of life is going to hold them accountable

woe to them"
well thanks for the list of states in which women should avoid living simple as that
god please move against these evil voices throughout cnn
we need to thanks the late judge ginsburg for this mess if politic is chess the democrats is playing checker my god they are loser im not a fan of conservative ideology but at least they deliver get your shit together liberals
and honestly certain medical abortions should be constitutional
its a great day in america
i know its a big inconvenience but it saves lives good way to look at it
california governor newsom said it right dont ever tell me america is the leader of the free world half of american states have now embraced fascist totalitarianism you  people make me sick autocratic fascist enslavement  what i see is that america has just gone to war with itself this will kill so many now im glad the second ammendment is in place fundamentalism has crossed the red line 6 months and youll be killing each other more than you already were anyway once the consequences are felt once enough girls and women have died i dont think any of you is prepared for what is about to happen  one tiny example the law abiding father whose student daughter gets raped previously he would have let the law work while he dealt with an abortion now that dad will kill that rapist and anyone else that gets in his way anotherm the career woman that dies after arranging to get the baby kicked out of her in a back alley leaves a daughter who hates men grows up bitter and twisted have fun with your dystopian reality while it lasts i would say 9  18 months and it all starts sliding towards possibly the end of america as a union north and south at the very least  
suprem court my a conservative fools these people turns everything back to the stone age
heres what you got to dovote change the people in charge the alt right wants to control your life 
many people are not having children until  late 20s early 30s so i have a conspiracy theory that another small reason is to get more people in the workforce to compete against chinas superior work productivity
republicons lying about everything no shite sherlock
many people are not having children until  late 20s early 30s so i have a conspiracy theory that another small reason is to get more people in the workforce to compete against chinas superior work productivity
step 1  get rid of the electoral college step 2  make the senate reflect population do these 2 things and the theocratic minority wont be able to do any of this again
so can row v wade be reinstated
im confused all this talk of womens rights from the same insufferable clowns who are incapable of defining the word woman 
soooare they coming for gay people next and then bringing back slavery  tell me againwhat is the difference between the us and afghanistan
there is 50 states go pick one that supports your beliefs problem solved 
mississippi banned abortion
it this doesnt get the indifferent majority to the polls we deserve the fate of afghanistan
is clarence also ready to roll back the laws legalizing his interracial marriage or better yet women suffrage that would really get the feminist camping around his gated subdivision
the craziest thing is that they really think women will suddenly stop getting abortions being deluded by self righteousness is the worst
i am a canadian and i am a father of two beautiful daughters i would support each of them if they need it my support for an abortion i dont think its the laws choice or decision to tell what a male and a female can do with their bodies what the supreme court has done to the american women is wrong and in a disgraceful
"the unintended pregnancy problem is easy to solve
_1_ sexually active tweens and teens must use contraceptives must avoid alcohol and drugs at parties and must avoid being and walking alone at night this age group especially must be on the alert to avoid all situations where rape and incest may occur
_2_ number 1 also applies to sexually active women over 20 and married ones you can enjoy many sex acts without penile penetration of the vagina use several birth control methods condoms are about 92 effective
_3_ the government must make any effort possible to end poverty by 1 lowering unemployment 2 giving universal basic income ubi to poor people and 3 making sure all women have a high school diploma "
good only 39 states to go
use  birth control  also  condoms  work be responsible with youre body
god wins
america is moving closer to syariah law alhumdooolilahhhhh
women rights blabla yes all gone accept it and move on go to blue states or abroad to procure your abortions
this hurts me so much but the fight is no over we will get our right back

im voting progressive here on out no more democrats and republicans are unless to us  the ppl
thank you scotus two back to back smackdowns for the liberals i love it drinking a diet coke to celebrate like trump is probably doing hahahah
yes it is a slap in the face pelosi so what
like i been saying this country should not be ran by old rich white ppl making laws they not going to fully see
time to rewatch the first five minutes of idiocracy
i like how people cry so much about the kids in uvalde but not for the kids that couldnt even make it out of their loving mother before being ripped apart
these ignorant people believe judges are supposed to dictate all the nuanced rules on abortion which involve whether teens can get medical procedures without informing or gaining parental permission who will pay or provide them if legal how late a baby can be aborted what methods of abortion are acceptable plyers coat hangers poisons etc who can perform them exceptions for victims of rape and incest child abuse ivf clinics what punishments will be for violations etc it is not the job of judges to dictate all these rules the legislative branch writes the details of the law the executive branch signs it into law and the judicial branch is there to interpret the law in how it applies to various situations this is civics 101 which they obviously dont teach in schools or everyone would understand this ruling is correctly placing power where it belongs
are yall really that lazy where you wont put on a 5 dollar condom but will have a 300 hundred dollar abortion
the right to abortion is not constitutional right  the right to parent is a constitutional right
abortion is not for convenience or a contraceptive stop crying and be responsible
"it is time that all people of color vote libertarian both the republican  democrat parties have turned their backs on people of color in an attempt to make america great again for the white caucasian race therefore the only hope for people of color is to vote libertarian 

a vote for the lessor evil  democrats is voting for the same evil that is murdering people of color in large numbers it is the same evil that is murdering our kids  teachers it is the same evil thats going in our churches  synagogues and murdering our prayer warriors it is the same evil that has no love were people of color lives matter "
they act like they got to carry the baby worry about your own damn uterus and whats in it
i know i am a man and its none of my business but this whole argument is about a womans right to  xill her babies right
they asked joe biden about this again today at the g7 summit and he said listen folksno joke  no really  im not joking  the dem voters just need to accept that roe is gone and probably not coming back  i have no power to do anything  lets just move on and unify our people as a country  theres no red america or blue america theres only the united states of america  just let the country become full stop rightwingy shooting down the gun laws with teeth up in new york and passing the weak paper tiger gun bills in congress and letting roe get overturnedits good because it unifies the country  and dont forget to vote in november not because the ruby red scotus is middle aged and their roe ruling will stand for the rest of the 21st century but so the multimillionaires i go to five guys with for lunch every friday can keep their inside trader privileges and advance stock shareholder information access  thank youand hey i like your tiehehehehenow okay where do i go nextover hereyoure not somehey do you know thetheres a some kind of moth or bug flyingokayim being told im talking too muchwhat
i know why youtube wont ban this bot thats posting after every comment its because youtube is controlling this bot
"is getting a vasectomy worth it
vasectomy is safer and cheaper than tubal ligation blocking the fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy in women the onetime cost of a vasectomy may be cheaper over time than the cost of other birth control methods such as condoms or medication guys take the lead"
"americans remember
if you are loosing youre rights to free abortion remember
this is the fault of the republicans
republicans are the enemy of the people republicans are to be ignored in the next election
republicans took away youre rights for safe and secure medical attention
all american women whether republicans or democrat should remember in the coming elections that the republicans took that away from you 
americans just went fifty years in the past all because a few people decided 
too take away what youre mother and grandmother add access easily and safely now what will you doo
vote démocrate
fuck the republican party and send them a message
trump and his stooges are nothing without youre vote 
republicans are the ennemi"
"the best social revolution for equal opportunities in abortion and also but above all to avoid traumatic abortions because of poverty is putine who did it respecting all the advice of un specialists 
and who is it  who provoked the war in kazakhstan which inevitably followed in ukraine by agitating the idea that this social revolution for equal opportunities for children would be a return to communism he is the preacher whose vassals claim to defend europe against the communist invasion meanwhile friendly mothers do not seem to have had the information of this social revolution advised by un specialists
its not communism its a pension for children and future children until the end of university studies its some confederate europe who wants to keep an injustice of chances in front of access to studies by money dont like that the socalled protectors of life dont like it and pay to prevent it they said they would rather defend poor womens right to abort than give an annuity to poor women who would prefer to keep the baby if she could they even dreamed of succeeding in pushing russia to fire putin but all these cons who talk about democracy for them and nondemocracy for putin do not have the same rate of acceptance by their people as him
biden is 70 who do not like him macron is less than 25 who voted for him
the pension for the fetuses until the end of their school studies without the parents being able to touch it from a certain age is what all should do to solve all the concerns of injustice against the children of the fetus to studies violence against childrenetcperhaps it will be necessary to improve but it is already very advanced towards better justice"
if you just check the list of countrys that ban abortion you see the us is in great company thats the countrys you want join fuck this modern free countrys
the womb is not the safest place for a child to be thats why they are not born until they leave it doofus
so a woman has the rights of personhood when shes a fetus but not after being born
women have been stripped of their baby killing rights which should have never been rights at all
"just a doubt is this abortion ban based on christian believes 
because if thats the case overturning roe vs wade is illegal since a judicial decision should never be influenced by any religion 
because then youre doing the same as the sharia in the islam religion and culture"
this troll thats posting nonsense after every comment has a strategy and a purpose its to keep americans from communicating with one another on youtube they fear our coming together
imagine getting rid of a constitutional right because you feel something isnt right but let this be about gun control and everyone starts losing there fucking minds
your not going to be murdering any babies in my state
in my opinion the scotus roe decision is literally going to cause the breakdown of many american families in red states blue states purple states and for us families throughout the world if girls and women are jailed how will their families husbands boyfriends lgbtq partners single significant others cope with the dilemma when they might have other children together if unfortunately a woman has a miscarriage will the police go gestapo into peoples homes to question and possibly arrest women literally throwing them in jail what about women who get pregnant within their fallopian tubes or through abnormal processes will these abnormal pregnancies health conditions fall within the state medical guidelines of concerns for the life of the girlwoman
move to a blue state that still allows them  get ready to pay more taxes too to pay for all the ones who get it for free
why didnt dems secure it at any point in the last 50 years they have to stop trusting republicans these republicans are not trustworthy they arent even republicans anymore they are something else radical power hungry control freaks that dont care about people is what they are now we must take the gloves off and stop being nice and never trust one of them again fix this mess now we can and should fight dirty too i know its not the civilized people we want to be but to save our country from these terrorist traitors we simply must
one need not be conservative to understand that extraconstitutional matters are reserved for the states
praise god its good to see liberals and feminists being upset
abort the court
abstinence contraception adoption motherhoodtheres four choices right there
its not a constitutional right it is a right tho
condoms dont exist on this network like natural immunity 
"didnt the supreme court recently rule that california cant impose ethical animal treatment laws on other states due to some bs about interstate business so if thats the case texas and all the other bible bumper states cant impose their bejesus will on the blue states 

something else to consider for women of childbearing years what happens if you vacation in one of these states and have a miscarriage and they dont allow abortion to save your life check out the american in malta that just experienced this scenario some of these states will hold you hostage to prove their point and your life will be endangered   im all for boycotting travel to any of these christian taliban states"
dems need to freaking get in the game they are playing checkers while republicans are playing gta
looks like the usa is starting to go fully mediaeval damned if id want to live in a country where the only people with any right to freedom were heavily armed white male bigots with everyone else being treated as barely human
the majority ruled by a minority this is not what america is supposed to be
"im thankful it was there in 1980 when i was raped and am thankful that now im too old to get pregnant but im devastated for all the women who will die because taking their own lives will be the option they feel they must choose or back alley abortions that go wrong people dont matter to republicans control and power matter voting for any republican no matter how different you think they are is a vote for losing our freedoms and rights and damaging our country 

michigan has a temporary injunction stopping the ban so for now its still legal"
now its time to fix the foster system hmm
theres no constitutional right to kill babies  thats fake news
where was that care about body autonomy when it came to being forced to take an experimental jab hypocritical fools
fake news judges are not supposed to write the laws that is for the legislature a separate body of government they lament the ruling makes no exceptions for victims of rape and incest this shows laws on abortion are by necessity very nuanced and complex and involve not just these issues but whether teens can get medical procedures without informing or gaining parental permission who will pay or provide them if legal how late a baby can be aborted what methods of abortion are acceptable plyers coat hangers poisons etc who can perform them what punishments will be for violations etc it is not the job of judges to dictate all these rules the legislatures job is to write the details of the law the executive signs it into law and the judicial system is there to interpret the law in how it applies to various situations
no child policy for those below poverty and one child policy for those below median income
"land of the fre oh hang on ah its only ok to end life with guns over there isnt it dumb yanks 

hmm note to self idea for abortion rifle with the right advertising well have you all hunting them little critters by next year

so so glad that the lunatics running our country arent bible freaks as well"
thank god that all people of america have been given back the right to life  liberty and the persistent of happiness will now follow for millions
us republicans idiocracy with mean trumpism
so you guys were studying the taleban and isis  it seems like american want their own shariah law i just hope ignorance doesnt trickle to actually free developed countries
this mean i have to wear nylons and lipstick again if i want the job i mean since im losing a right right
not a constitutional right
regardless of our opinions abortion is now illegal  people need to stop having irresponsible sex there are more protective measures and access than ever before much more than when roe vs wade began lets start practicing safe sex or no sex feminists pressure men to use male contraceptions
"womens rights used to be about equal pay and equal opportunity now its about killing babies and letting males pretending to be women beat the crap out of woman
 
it used to be about i am woman hear me roar now its about i am woman let me hurt other women

its about destroying the hopes of millions of women so a few hundred men that couldnt compete with other men enjoy the status of being at the top of a womens sport


women would rather now see hundreds millions of other womens hopes and dreams be destroyed and let them be in misery instead of a of a few hundred males
now the oppressors of women are women"
"my solution

women everywhere should stop having sex with men until roe v wade is codified"
how about women just stop opening their legs for every guy they meet eh
this scotus is completely illegitimate as the cherry picking of privacy cases shows only too well the idea that that we have to go back to the 1900s for constitutional protection is in and of itself ridiculous their tortured logic is lazy stupid and cruel its just an excuse to codify into law fox news right wing  grievances we are now acting more like iran or afghanistan in that a court of religious zealots are imposing their beliefs of christian america without caring the least bit about human suffering or human dignity america is supposed to have separation of church and state but nothing will stand in these horrible peoples way no right is safe with this court even it this comes up again as equal protection they will find a way to squirm out of it zero integrity
fear and sorrow can be the only path for equal rights honestly 
"women should know that the abortion pill is still available by mail if you get it early enough you can perform the abortion yourself you do not need a doctor or a clinic they are only there for the very rare cases when taking the pill causes side effects 
every woman in these states should know this that they can still get abortions thru the mail 

and they cannot stop this as long as democrats control part of congress or the presidency they cannot stop this 

the political entity that currently exists in the united states that is your best shot of slowing the descent into authoritarianism is the democratic party"
you people are just insane lol voting only for identity and not for policy is why were in this mess the left and the right slowly stripping all of our rights away
time for everyone to be proactive its obvious our country has left us to fend for ourselves its time to research and seek all options available for ones individual needs there are alternatives to this nightmare we have to address this reasonably protest is nice but once the rights are stripped protest is useless so find out all of the options available and plan accordingly its time we save ourselves and do whatever necessary to avoid being burden with unwanted
only thing thats happened is theyve made it harder andor more dangerous to have an abortion not impossible a woman desperate enough is going to do what ever she feels she needs to do desperation trumps laws even commandments we are humans and weve sinned from the start hello there might be more headlines now like baby left in dumpster 19 year old college student gang raped that got pregnant has commited suicide preachers 13 year old daughter died trying to abort her baby or republican christian senator molesting his daughter paid  for her to have abortion theres no stopping the filth in this world why bring more innocent babies into it that arent wanted by the woman carrying them duh

they claim  its only 3 of their business  supposedly  97 of their business is still operational 
unless its true they were always an abortion mill"
american exceptionalism right
this should have always been a state decision abortion is not a constitutional right regardless of your feelings on the matter i also see so many pro abortionist protesting christianity there are plenty of secularist against the murder of unborn children all the blue states will vote and continue to murder innocent life in the whomp they will probably even double down and push for late term and even partial birth infanticide
"are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction and having them under the management of congress if our defense be the real object of having those arms in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety or equal safety to us as in our own hands

"if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellowcitizens this appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army and the best possible security against it if it should exist

this is nothing more than religious bullshit outlaw all religions now
how any open minded individual still lives in red states ill never understand their education rankings suck economies are some of the worst people are mostly awful and theyre boring places come to colorado well never take your rights away
when the first satanic church of america makes the statement you cant outlaw abortion its part of our worship then we understand exactly  why abortion is so important the ancients worship of moloch sacrificing live babies into a burning fire
regardless of where i stand on abortion in my opinion there is no indication in our constitution that it should be considered a fundamental constitutional right this was in my opinion an extreme interpretation done by the supreme court at that time by the way i also think there is no indication in our constitution or second amendment that anybody at 18 should be able to purchase an ar15 one thing is the right to own arms another thing is what type since what age and with what requisites both these are extreme interpretations that intend to make something constitutionally covered so it cant be discussed i think this is wrong i think both things should be defined in congress and have limits to when and how you can exercise those rights
you cant be in favor of people having the right to bear arms weapons to kill people and animals and be against women having the right to choose
biden needs to add 2 more judges and explain that this is the will of the people we cant go backwardstwo judge stolen my trump taken back
"ps where are the voices and demonstrations concerning threats to democracy itself where are the loud demonstrations to indict trump for being a  clear and present danger to the very core of your democratic institutions he attempted to overthrow a free election he used militant armed domestic terror groups to stop pence from certifying the election people were killed  the coup failed but you dodged a bullet
the doj needs public pressure to hold everyone involved fully accountable imo its  the most critical problem before you"
republicans hate women they must be gay or smth
take the right of a man to have a vasectomy
politicians caused all of this further chaos
2022 welcome to the divided states of america
the roberts court is the most corrupt supreme court in history  we all know it
you know what type of men and women who wants abortion to be reverse its all the ugly men and women who are not physically attracted who dont get laid regardless who only have a hurt and anger in their hearts especially to a goodlooking or normal people who do get laid and trust me it has nothing to do with religion
what is good about the supreme courts decision to knock down roe v wade just looking at some of the women in this video tells you that there are only religious people who are happy with this ruling david brooks from the nyt says you cannot fact check a person with an emotional state i would go one more to say that you cannot fact check a person of a religious faith thats fine until the people of a religious faith who are in a minority end up deciding what the rest of the population should do who are in the majority this must be maddening to see this happen before your eyes nevertheless what you can do is not to get mad but get even what is the root of this problem its the electoral college that allowed a candidate withlisten to this3 million less votes than his oppositional candidate to win the election for the presidency thats right donald j trump won the election that hillary clinton had won the popular vote by 3 million people what happened next is one of darkest chapters in american history mitch mcconnell quickly realized he had a proxy president who would willingly do his bidding if he got all the credit mcconnell deftly stacked the supreme court with religious fanatics that do not even come close to reflecting the views of a majority of americans this is a reality difficult to accept where nothing can change a supreme court ruling but you can change your countrys disasterous path of having an electoral candidates that puts questionable candidates into office that would not have won in a true democracy george w bush got in the same way and americas image has been forever stained by a president whose vicepresident called the shots and once againgave george w bush all the credit im an overseas viewer and this is my two cents to sort things out but i think this is an excellent time to use the rising anger not to explode on the streets but to take out the seed of the problem making your country a laughing stock across the world abolish the electoral college before a person like trump once more is in charge but who may just decide to use nuclear weapons
forced pregnancy is a serious violation of sexual and reproductive rights and autonomy like all sexual and genderbased human rights violations it can cause severe physical and psychological harms and often has lasting personal social and economic consequences  amnesty international

women of child bearing age have lost their right is cnn saying men cannot get pregnant
i would say any constitutional right could be taken if it was born after the 1950s it wasnt a constitutional right if it was then congress would have passed a law to make federal abortion illegal finally the states have the right to make abortion illegal
so do u pro abortion people believe in aboration in a 3rd trimester
the republican appointed supreme court justices in their confirmation hearings acknowledged  roe v wade as set precedence in overturning roe v wade they perjured themselves in confirmation hearings to be confirmed to be a supreme court justice if the house and senate dont hold  these republican appointed justices accountable for perjury by not impeaching for perjury these corrupted justices send a  message that perjury is okay the supreme court justices by overturning roe v wade have taken women backwards in their right to choose which brings them back to when there were many deaths from back room abortions  forcing women who have already been devastated mentally and physically who are a victim of rape  incest or a dangerous pregnancy are once again a victim of their right to choose  being taken away in most states before a child is given up for adoption both people give consent to give up the child the supreme court justices and the states that have banned abortions have given the rapist and  the perpetrator of incest parental rights to once again victimize the already devastated women
censored me blacks the dems aint your friends
its another sad day for the usa and a scary portent for what will follow land of the free my ass
this could be harbinger of a split of the united states into two separate nations  reminiscent of the 1840s and 1850s when the antislavery movement was growing in the northern states
ok but you meant children of child bearing age didnt you the republicans are all child molesters and should be executed as such
cnn aborted journalism long ago
the same activists that said clintontrump now think elections dont matter and dont want to vote lol
if they are going to do this there must be massive investments on child care
factoring in cnns margin of error 11 is actually 1820 22 states have it legal presently and 810 are undecided with more than half leaning to ban in the end it will likely be an even 25 for legalban which showcases that america is divided right down the middle with no chance of that gap ever being bridged i think its time for a divorce
why would you want to killed unborn child
dont like you states laws move but until then be sexually responsible something you should be doing anyhow its really not that difficult
red state oh no i didnt know the leopard would eat my face said the people who repeatedly voted for the leopards eating faces party
trump wins again
people so triggered that they now have a chance to vote on an issue
america the land of the dumb and the home of the scared why else you arm yourselfall men are equal bullshit  yet you had slavery george washington was a slave owner liberty and freedom are just words men have no right to decide what women do with they bodies you care about the the unborn but do not care of the the born give free medicare and then you have the right to say you are rightoues and care about human rightsnote all caps so you pay attention shame on you america the divided states is the correct name
thoughts and prayers to all the pregnant men out there
"banning abortions does not lower abortion rates 

you know what does

allowing abortion services

it is a very simple demonstrable fact that states and indeed whole countries elsewhere in the world that have the most draconian antiabortion laws have the higher levels per capita of abortions illegal stds teen pregnancies and child mortality and birth defects 

abortions are part of reproductive health and that goes handinhand with
prepost natal health care services
child support
comprehensive sex education
access to contraception
income support
housing benefits
affordable health care or all out state funded universal health care
payed maternitypaternity leave

these services lower abortions whilst allowing abortions 

and it goes without saying the states  that are frothing at the mouth at banning abortions do not have these services or are gutting them to point of being meaningless 

if youre a foetus your rights are sacred once youre born you can f off and die for all they care"
"i dont think everyone understands the seriousness of this abortion situation

these are children thats being ripped apart limb by limb they feel every bit of that


come on now yall"
yall are crazy to watch this crap
amazing that asma khalid would be outraged while wearing a hijabthat is forced upon her by male muslims and the fact that contraception and abortion is forbidden under islamas well as the fact that forced child marriages is allowed under islam as well as honour killings
its amazing how many women like unprotected s3x and wreckless casual encounters   and they told us men were the dogsthis proves the opposite
"this is inflamatory news imo why do american news channels  magnify issues out of proportion and drive stakes between american people 
google the question and see which states have banned them and at what stage
even desantis platform supports contraception and early stage abortion he suggests 15 weeks as a limit to when abortion should be legalized it looks like the question for states is  at what developmental stage should abortion be illegal or even just medically unethical
it is an important question that includes but also extends beyond privacy rights and choice
i am a woman with a uterous who has had pregnancy scares has been pregnant and  had childern i know the issues i have as much right to influence abortion policy as the pro choice lobby
please de escalate the rhetoric and deliver a balanced calm news piece the american people have been through trauma after trauma be part of the healing and unity project not part of the problem"
these creepy leaders banning womens health rights are insane what childcare  family supports are they proposing to help pregnant women after the child is born
america is slowly becoming a shithole country
hell yeah lets arrest women human rights
republicans will take over the house and senate get rid of the filibuster like the democrats always should have and pass whatever draconian laws at the federal level that their gods voices tell them to
god bless those 11 states
absolute worst decision in the history of the supreme court i am disgusted that anybody could ever support this decision
we in europe have experienced what happens if rights are being reversed i just hope it will not end in getting slavery back in place and be sure we will not come to free you from fascism you are on you own
decent americanswe have to defeat the trailer trash hillbillys that are trying to turn the country into a theocracy
i thought religion and state was supposed to be separate i think the women should sue the us at the world court for violation of human rights
expand supreme court  resist and reject the fascist gop party
most of the 1 million abortions in america are from poor lazy and uneducated women come on america educate your masses 
joe biden cheat sheets   you take your seat   this is what you get when you order a president by mail  the us is a laughing stock all over the world 
roe allowed abortions right up until the time of delivery why dont you ask americans how many of them support that cnn ill bet it aint 66
if were now going with literal interpretation of constitution and rights which are not explicitly enumerated in constitution being deligated to states lets remember that 2nd amendment protects the right to bare arms but it does not protect the right to sell guns hence states can flat out ban sales of guns same goes for shipping of the ammo or guns across territory of a particular state
oklahoma is now the safest place a child can be  what the hell kind of rhetorical bullshit is that
clarence thomas is political and supreme court judges are supposed to be objective
its not going to impact suburban women at all they can afford to get an abortion no matter what that great white replacement they fear is coming about by their own hands
stop making women look uneducated
a huge step in the right direction
"oklahoma is the safest place for a child to be

are you are increase funds for maternal and child care

are we what now"
werent these women talking about a sex strikeproblem solved 
"well democrats are keeping the dream of eugenics alive

hmmm were all biologists now 
making america great again god bless america
this is wrong
why was this not on the voter ballot  this is unconstitutional for the supreme court to make the decision against the will of the people
how about roe lied that she got raped in an interview and said she was an alcoholic and stole money from peopleher words
40million afghans  the people of the graveyard of empires  have capitulated to a life under the tyranny of less than 100000 taliban 140million russians have capitulated to a life under the tyranny of putin so why will it be any different for 330million americans visàvis the real republicans of maga
amazing the supreme court does not consider the states are qualified to regulate gun control but are very qualified to regulate womens reproductive rights   in one week they have managed to produce contradictory opinions on states rights   the gun control opinion comes as a rebuke to the bipartisan resolution passed by congress a few days earlier  it aims to appease the nra for allowing and cooperating in the bipartisan legislation that no one would have dared oppose
and the voters if they disagree can have it placed on the ballot  cnn where the terminally ignorant go for misinformation
"all states should make abortion illegal unless one of the following happens 
rape given the morning after pill to abort or no longer then two weeks after that then they should not be able to abort 
medical emergency  doctors dont have a choice but to abort but only with two or three doctors in agreement that it would be the best decision 
babys health doctors say the baby will not have a quality of life for reasons such as brain damage severely deformed etcthen and only then with  two to three opinions with same opinion 
other then that abortion should be illegal period and if a doctor is caught preforming they should be imprisoned for life without parole  life for a life same goes with mother abortion is murder period  we are a nation that is supposed to be under god but we go against god on many things such as abortion gay rights and many more things america has become very dark and we need to get back in the light and stop going against god if not america will fall as if people can notice it is starting to crumble and pretty soon america will not exist if we dont start getting it right democrats are destroying our country a little at a time as per their agenda and we need to take our country back out of the hands of this demonic power that has its grasp on many people god bless and love to all"
"horrible  it doesnt make a baby safe  it will be in foster care 
unloved and abused"
after birth abortion is the most appalling and evil thing i have ever heard of
when i thought america couldnt get any worse right wing nuts with power prove me wrong again we are falling deeper and deeper into authoritarianism by people who a majority of americans disagree with something must change or america is dead
at the very very least what i require to feel bad about women because of this all those women voting blue from now on otherwise accept what you voted for
oklahoma is the safest place for children to beuntil the next school shooting facilitated by the lack of gun laws
this should be a big boost for canadian tourism
look at all these serena joys rejoicing at having brought about their own subjugation
so sad to see 33 of americans support this madness republican party is a mindwasher to amazing levels if something this obvious is an issue how the f are we ever going to pull together on the real problems everyone keeps ignoring because they are too hard to solve pure madness
with body autonomy now voided by these states these 11 states can make vaccination mandatory
thank  god  almighty  for our amazing  conservative  supreme  court  justices 
11 states that should vote blue next time
"in the same time the court rule in two cases 
first case you do not have control over my gun
second case i have control over your body you do not have control over your body
this is why the christian democrats dont want christian hypocrite to rule this country so we do not go to the stone age like iran afghanistanetc

the history of abortion laws in america
 
"
good hopefully this will wake up the people in those states and get them to vote these antamerican anti freedom bastards out
"its theocratic dogma from an illigitimate benched supreme court overturning precident set by at least two decisions by previous courts

i blame dems for letting this sit as precident for 70 years and not amending the constitutional privacy sections to include personal medical rights"
women shouldnt you guys be saying birthing people
women of color disproportionately depend upon abortion services cnn is right about that thats because margret sanger founded planned parenthood to control the population of minorities
lmfao your elections are going to be dealing with republicans elected who may end up taking over who gets into power and who doesnt  i just shake my head at all of your in america and count my blessings every day that i live in canada  america is now in the same circle of 2 other countries which are considered dictatorships and do not allow abortions in their country  again  lmfao
i havent seen democrats this mad since republicans freed their slaves 
abortion is not a constitutional rightget your facts straight
it is time for a female sexboycott for bringing back abortion rights
"take the word effectively out of the title of this video and this story becomes dead space
cnn consumers will likely andor effectively interpret and transmit this story as 11 states ban abortion"
irresponsible voters distracted by the sirens song of the dog shit of dogwhistle politics are entirely responsible for this happening
there will be a run on knitting needles and forcepsthe old standbys disgraceful ruling by the court
whats the matter you dont want the public to know that doctors profit off of aborted fetal parts
funny how the same nazis who were crying over masks in private shops want the gvt regulating bedrooms and wombs thats not going to happen we will not allow it no matter what it takes the 2nd amendment is to protect against gvt overreach
the solution is simple expand the court
if gop wife daughter mistress need abortion they secretly leave the country an have abortion the hypocrisy so deep get boots on an by the rich women will still getting abortion
yeah what happens next is we fight abortion can save lifes of alot of woman that know can not give birth do to the risks of death and what about rape victims this is an insult to human rights
oklahomo just became the most dangerous state for women
the majority of red southern states are supporting this insane situation that allows old wyt men to just ravish young wyt girls and then raise their unwanted offspring
i remember when planned parenthood got exposed for selling aborted fetal partsplan b ladies dont let them profit off of your aborted babythat is what this is aboutno profit in medications that dissolve a pregnancy22000 for an aborted fetal brainjust sayingstop making women look uneducatedsincerely a biological womanpeace
kansas should open abortion clinics on the borders adjacent to oklahoma and missouri and advertise them like a casino
free birth control  nation wide  prevent as many unplanned pregnancies as possible  why cant we do this   regardless of left or right can we agree that prevention would be less stress on the health care system and society as a whole
oklahoma is far from the safest place in the country for a baby the infant mortality rate is one of the highest in the country at 57 deaths per 1000 births in fact look up mortality rates and the red states lead the way in death
kevin mccarthy would go for extermination camps if he thought it would win votes __
"these rightwing extreme evangelicals even non christians who condemn prochoice fail to realize that the only sin that can never be forgiven by god is the unpardonable sin of grieving away the holy spirit entirely to rejectnot listen to the holy spirit they are in far more jeopardy of loosing their salvation and burning in hell than a woman who has had to endure an abortion and seeks forgiveness

matthew 123132
therefore i say to you any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people but blasphemy against the spirit shall not be forgiven whoever speaks a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whoever speaks against the holy spirit it shall not be forgiven him either in this age or in the age to come"
amazing victory for all family people loyal people and horrible news for cheaters people who like to sleep with everybody and victims of rap which are a tiny minority btw lets be honestprotest all you want just respect the law and dont break anything okaaay
"women will be forced to bare their rapists childbiden
well i think the hospitals could hand out plan b along with the rape kit wouldnt you say"
no j6 hearings or
cant wait to hear how many republicans get called out for their abortions i imagine trump and kids have racked up 6 or 7
"for republicansto be an american you must be born in the usa be white christian and a man
i would not be surprised in 10 years if women are not allowed to vote"
"to cnn
it was not a constitutional rightread the constitution and stop spreading misinformation"
all that happens is the people needing it go over the border into countries that give abortions   those countries make millions of dollars ireland women used to come to england  they do not now because ireland catholicism practice has fallen and sanity prevailed and ireland realised it needed to get in the 21st century looks like the us has gone back a century
the problem that arises from more millions of americans as refugees from the failed gop states  like for california that handed joe biden 5million of the popular vote that he did not need to win california  is that it entrenches the disruptive power of a deathgrip on the country that the republicans  the real republicans of maga  hold by way of the electoral college system
sorry to hear this from canada here maybe its time to drag these supreme court justices out into the street for a trial by the people you outnumber them dont take their shit
these folks dont care about babieskids so doesnt matter how these children come about or what the pregnancy can do to the mother or life it would have being born to someone who doesnt want it same folks complain about government assistance low income adopt agencies better get more locations  rooms what about the rights of the mothers this is very very bad
i love that they keep saying women but they dont even know what that word means
right here right now watching the world wake up from history 
stay focused on donald trump democrats dont take your eyes off of him tunnel vision pays off yet again
why american women need the supreme court justices recalled the supreme court justices if they cant protect women rights to abortion they are appointees and can also be removed politically motivated overturns roe and wade in any part of the constitution are abortion illegal they punish women for having sex the supreme court justices cant read the constitution and sent women to the cavern age they need to be removed
the best way to fight this is for all of the democrat supremes to stand down for to take away the scotus as the stick for the real republicans of maga to terrorize the country also make sure that this november and 2024 is the stake through the heart for the real republicans of maga
"the taliban moves forward
usa moves backward"
they wont ban ar15s but ban women rights to choose this country is so backwards
"hey in colorado you can have an abortion at 10 months just suppress birth for  a month who cares if it is a human living baby who cares  come to colorado and abort your baby
colorado is going overboard to get your abortion monies  heck maybe even free buses and free air fare oh guess dicks and tesla are doing that already  ok just come to colorado to abort your baby 10 month is fine ok  you all come"
breaking news roe is dead and the democrats leadership has utterly failed them now back to donald trump and the neverending impeachment
the supreme court justices should have term limits and not be in for life
this is the greatest of democracyi love it
do any of these people understand us law maybe they should move to move to another state or another country
abortion ah the ultimate bright shiny object  the orange fuehrer and his turd riech has just hammered down the last coffin nail for the republican party   has anyone thought of why did the supreme court dropped this decision before the midterms  to deflect from the january 6th committee dominating the news  clarence thomas is neck deep in the conspiracy to overthrow democracy and is trying to keep himself and his wife out of jail  remember the line trump used to pressure georgia secretary of state raffensberger  you just find me 11000 votes and the republicans in congress and the court will do the rest  the january 6th committee want to talk to ginny thomas about trying to overthrow democracy   boom  roe vs wade is overturned   so now january 6th is back burner and abortion is the new fight which just finally will give total congressional control to the democrats   the dog just caught the car  and fascism was at the wheel
they will be going after birth control next
thank you democrats just please keep voting for biden and pelosi we couldnt have done it without you
"now kavanaugh can rape through the us without feeling bad about killing the unborn next goal womenvoting rights i guess or stop female education
usa you are insane"
abortion should not be a constitutional contraceptive for bad behavior bad decisions between men and women
this country is dying as fast as lake mead
5 month old baby girl shot and klld in chicagos south shore  wheres the outrage i wonder  wheres blm
i dont view abortion as a choice and a right i think its always a tragedy  senator joe biden 2006
its not a constitutional rightget your facts straight
what time is it time for a constitutional amendment maybe to revive the era maybe to bring back roe vs wade maybe to increase the number of scotus justices maybe to revise the 2nd amendment  maybe something else its time to restore the rights that the gop wants to take away make america a leader in human rights again
what do you get when you order a president through the mail an unbroken string of victories like this one right here good job democrats 
pph actually lowered the black pop to 12 4
if you are all about medical advances then there is no need for surgical abortion which doctors profit from aborted fetal parts in most casesthere is no financial gain from taking medication to dissolve a pregnancythat is what this is about
"dear pro lifers you are more than welcome because i dont make choices for you to have all the babies your little heart desires  but dont shove your choice on me  you do not have that right  i dont like men with beards so every man should shave to suit me  it should be federal law  same for tattoos  if i do not have a right to my body no one else should have that right   also pro lifers please pop out more so we can ensure we add to the workforce and foster homes and adoption agencies  we are doing such a good job of caring for them now  
you need to do some research on oxygen  only 2 things live on this planet without oxygen  you know breath of life and all that  a fetus is not a living breathing baby until such time  period  
i can assure you women have very serious talks with god when it comes to this type of decision  you are not god you are not there you do not know what path god has planned for that person  you are not god  
your spoiled snot nosed little sheep that think you have the right to be gods"
i hope those states are prepared to assist the mother to rear  that child to responsible adulthood
how can we punish the people that put trump in office that led to this
so those 11 states being usa will abort their children while they are at school age in mass shootings
democrats seem hell bent on pushing population off the proverbial cliff lol agenda 21 and 30 paying employees to fly and get an abortion doesnt that cause a big carbon footprint are they gonna take an electric car where does the source of electricity come from wind lol the hypocrisy on democrats is un real open your eyes and ears people dont be so simple minded scientists want the embryonic cells for future vaccines and plandemics
if democrats want to keep on  winning victories like this then they should just keep on voting for the leadership theyve been voting for thank you nancy pelosi and joe biden good job 
they keep saying my body my choice and they are 100 correct they have the choice to keep their legs closed
like germany italy and other countries the states set a time limit like 40 weeks ny aborts them at the birth day
so those judges would celebrate the new life to be when a teenage  family member is raped
terra nullius is a latin expression meaning nobodys land it was a principle sometimes used in international law to justify claims that territory may be acquired by a states occupation of it the state is occupying vaginas
religious bigotry is alive and well in these states
heres my next observation how is texas or any other state going to prevent me from freely traveling to an abortion friendly state how is that going to work maybe i misunderstood if i go to another state then texas can prosecute me how is that going to work i didnt commit a crime in texas im puzzled if i murder someone in ny state texas cant prosecute me i have to be extradited back to ny  another question mothers who abuse illegal narcotics during their pregnancies are they going to be prosecuted for the damage to the baby a heroin addict cant have an abortion so she births an addicted baby if nothing else think of the costs associated with the long term care of this childmaybe money will make it mean something to you prolifers the human suffering is making no dead way
but who gets arrested
beware the theocrats
i think its hilarious how were acting like women are randomly waking up the next morning with unwanted pregnancies as if they didnt make the decision to have sex in the first place
"yes they lied under oath what is there penalty just my opinion and thought 
this is bull  sugar honey ice tea and they know it   so when one there family members whomever it is need to due what they just outlawed   passed lets make sure news  media is there to report it  this is just my opinion keep a  eye out  even the news media family members who agree with the decision just my opinion "
 remember the female doctors and nurses that were among the group of other doctors and nurses in different cities in america that were fighting against hospital mandates to juice people where were the pro abortion people for support where was my body my rights for support see  this is definitely about money  definitely about white people depopping themselves and a big thanks to soros for the pro abortion people protesting now when they should had been in protest from the use of the juice to now  i guess soros had to refill his cash flow for a while  see god is getting ready to bring women to their knees now god is going to put limits to women freedoms no matter what welcome to jacobs trouble karen and liberal women 
those with money or influence will not be affected
"you should show a list on the screen show it every day
keep a death toll as well"
if we look at the striking down of roe v wade in the context of trumps coup attempt with the massive assistance of his republican coconspirators with those same legislators further abrogating their sworn duties to uphold our constitution and actually do their jobs rather than obstruct everything they can then it becomes obvious that the republican party is thoroughly corrupt and seeks to destroy our democracy for only one thing and for only its benefit not americas power  does anyone in his right mind want to give any power to this criminal cabal of traitors  no i dont think so either
constitutional right to kill babies
lets hope this attack on womens rights  sends them straight to the ballot box
thank you harry reid and ruth bader ginsberg we couldnt have done it without your help
reproductive freedom same sex marriage immigration social programs control of arms of war poor people opportunities to have a house good education health services a government that work for all and not for the riches those rights are on the election on november vote vote vote we knew w we are mayority we are more 
if they  try to band birth control  for  women  does  that  include  condoms  that  help prevent  stds  
im a semi retired activist of 25 years on all human rights anti war in the 90s was a very lonely movement i always encouraged younger people to never take any of our freedoms for granted begging young people to be vigilant about abortion and usually it was an ok boomer response but i warned about selfish unimaginative right wingers want to take away safe legal abortion and frankly if they could take right to vote as a women too take nothing for granted i am however still totally amazed that i had more rights in 1991 age 21 than women do now we need to fight hard voting rights is also on the chopping block women have always been undermined in patriarchy at least todays women wont be screaming into the wind as i did in the 1990s nobody cared much then there was no social media to organize with except newsletters remember the words of the great fredrick douglas who did activism with the suffragetes power concedes nothing without struggle well woe to the vanquished because we will devastate the gop in the house and senate look out for harris county and gerrymandering
the unborn only wish they were worth threefifths
most of these states dont even allow exceptions for rape or incest republicans dont think there wont be backlash
the supreme court giveth and the supreme court taketh away
talk is cheap someone has to take their case to supreme court again
there some elements of the  dystopian science fiction of the handmaidens tale are beginning to look like a documentary commentary in some red states it will not be sufficient to ban abortion in these states it will be necessary to restrict the movement of potentially pregnant women to stop them leaving to have abortions in other states they may face arrest on return should they leave for such operations natural miscarriages will be subject to legal investigation this is simply following the change in the law to its logical conclusion
abortion was never a constitutional right its not in the constitution
leave those states reduce the population that way you reduce the numbers of sits in the congres and the power of those who dont care about what the people needs and want
who voted again oh wait its the people so whos fault is it that these laws are made you guessed it might not be what you want but you should consider that when you vote someone into power
its so funny that the oklahoma governor said oklahoma is now the safest place for a child to be when the state is ranked third to last for overall newborn healthcare labor and delivery seriously the hypocrisy knows no bounds
a sentence from rui barbosa a lawyer that was 3 times presidential candidate in brazil in the beggining of the 1900s and consider one of the most brilliant minds that ever existed in brazil says the worst dictatorship is the one coming from the judicial power against which there is nobody to whom one can appeal this decision from the scotus against the overwhelming majority of the american population is raw judicial dictatorship
damn right it will be bad for republicans i was going to vote red before because republicans were promising to improve economy now i realized their word means nothing when 3 of their conservative judges lied to be confirmed i am voting democrat now hope many other women will too
the red trailer trash states will be asking for larger handouts
"theres zero parental leave healthcare social services affordable housing safe schools etc and theres already a huge shortage of foster homes and too many of the existing foster homes arent properly vetted

what could possibly go wrong"
sex with women should be illegal unless for the puposes of childbirth problem solved
welcome to the republican caliphate
if a woman is already paying for the abortion then why is planned parenthood being funded by the government if the government is funding the abortion why is planned parenthood charging the woman anything for the abortion
but it takes two
fact abortion cannot be banned unless an election is held statewide and voters make the decision state legislators can only act on voting results
fk fanatical fascists
coolthe will of the people
the 3 trump puppets should be impeached for perjury occuring during their confirmation hearings just more lying pub garbage
psychopathic democrats want to kill babies in the name of womens health that proves they are evil
the pro life should start paying the child support since they wanna be the baby daddy of all the children that get saved from abortion
the trouble with any right a court gives you is a court can take that right back anytime it wants to
apparently it wasnt constitutional
haha  a muslim woman at a abortion table telling women to vote
its about time the constitution is followed and the people of the states are given back the power of the government
when americans start voting on abortion its going to be illegal to get an abortion after the first trimester thats going to cut into planned parenthoods profits significantly
fk i just moved to one of the states that banned abortions im moving back
its really pretty simple to fix  78 of the country disagree with banning abortion   so get off your lazy azzes and vote in november   if you vote blue you can finally put this issue to bed once and for all  if you vote red or fail to vote then you are giving the right permission to take away more freedom from you simple logic 
"well then it sounds like alot of people dont support abortion in this country

the united nations recently celebrated the international mother earth day as a reminder to protect the environment heat waves droughts fires and heavy rains that cause severe flooding have become more frequent in many parts of the world due to climate change which affects the entire worldwide population

the earth is facing a triple planetary crisis warn un officials climate disruption nature and biodiversity loss and pollution and waste are the main areas of concern regarding the current state of the environment this year the earth days theme is invest in our planet so what would humanitys best investment for the planet be

we need to start by cleaning up the planet there is no place on earth where the air and water are clean and thats a real problem in theory tackling this issue should be our priority when it comes to taking action to improve the dismal state of our planet but lets not fool ourselves such a plan alone will solve nothing

it will only help the international organizations to justify their own existence they tick off done to raise as much money as they want and thats it if we do not improve relations between us we will not be able to achieve the great and ambitious improvement in nature that we want and need to attain globally we will never achieve a good result through bureaucratic mechanical measures

there are a lot of people sitting in their comfortable offices profiting from the environmental crisis and demanding money and respect they keep flying from one end of the world to the other on all kinds of missions to make a lot of noise with what they are doing and which everyone needs to hear as if that alone means something is happening but in practice we see no real progress the earth must also be cleansed of them of these people who engage in useless campaigns that only cause harm because they mislead the world leading it away from the real solution

the cleaning of the planet should start inside out if we do not clean the planet from within and continue with our reckless behavior and the selfish nature of our hearts as before nothing will change for the better the immense sums invested in environmental initiatives should be directed to spreading an educational process aimed at improving the way we relate to each other

humans are the most developed and influential factors of all of natures levels still vegetative animate and human since we occupy the highest level in nature positively affecting the environment the climate and nature in general can be achieved by reaching positive relations among us on the contrary by letting our divisive drives tear apart human relations we also destroy our surrounding environment the very nature that our lives depend on

the more we humans are able to correct ourselves by changing our divisive attitudes toward each other into positive attitudes of mutual support encouragement mutual responsibility and reciprocal concern the more we will receive positive feedback from nature and the more we develop without making this necessary correction the more negative feedback we will receive from nature as we have experienced in the form of natural disasters pandemics

it is of utmost importance for us to organize our thoughts desires and qualities so that we understand that saving the environment and a shift to a better future depend solely on changing our attitudes to each other from antagonistic egoism to positive compassionate and cooperative relationships"

the states are cultivating laws they have their hand on the plow trying to grow the law in every state where the federal government says roe versus wade we shouldnt make laws governing abortion maybe thats good for the goose is good for the gander state shouldnt be making laws about abortion leave it up to the doctors in the patient
interesting that its mainly the lighterskinned that are protesting all over and up in arms where is the diversity on this topic
since joe biden has come to power democrats have suffered an unbroken string of losses everything he touches turns to disaster
im prochoice but since democrats are so antiamerica and insane on every other issue facing our countryi cant vote blue

"theyre pretending there is a problem with white reproduction rates spoiler alert america has the largest white population in the world
the irony is this could lead to a mass exodus and actually cause the problem theyre pretending they have now
there are plenty of english speaking free countries around the world with no religion no rw extremism no racism free healthcare and no risk of being shot or jailed for nothing"
the republicans are antifreedom and they only preach about freedom when it comes to their own needs even if it means ruining our country
im glad abortion is now illegal women have lived their life on easy mode never having to deal with accountability every terrible decision they made the law was always on their side to help them but not anymore  it started with the depp and heard case and now this and im all for it
hey how about that democracy in action
this is where the matter should be at the states cnn also might focus on the states that allow abortion or abortion procedures this issue falls back to the stats and that is where it belongs
"this is frightening 
im embarrassed for this country 

how do we get rid of these supreme court freaks  they lied   doesnt that mean something  theyre the sc

abortion is no different than walking into a school and shooting children at least the kids have a chance to run away 
if you had a abortion your a depraved murder"
how many republicans in any government capacity have had or paid for an abortion

"imagine how many cheating spouses will soon have extended their step families having your husband introducing his mistresses new addition to the kids will be what memories are made of 
supreme idiocy is what this is all from"
the supreme court has taken women to the 15001800 periods please watch the movie homesman directed by tommy lee jones and hilary swank the scotus want women having babies not to compete with jobs that should only go to white men
if you want to restrict abortion then surely you support welfare for all those poor babies right no because it isnt about children if they actually cared the foster care system wouldnt be unable to house the kids in the system we wouldnt have street kids with no place to lay their heads and poor mothers wouldnt feel hunger and desperation they dont care about children
if men would just keep their pants on
muslim in favor of abortion right fasigh
well child surpport will go up i hope all these new dads that live in ban states are ready to pay and the big hike in goverment assistance to house and feed the children great job supreme court
is abortion mandatory for all women im really confused because i know multiple women who will never think about abortion
we really hate each otherthat is the tragedyi wish we could get a divorcethe ununited states caused by these republican conservatives nutz
the tragically absurd thing is that these people say they hate religious extremists from other countries yet here they are the christian talibanforcing christian sharia law down our throats all due to the conservative mullahs on the supreme court vote women vote in iran and afghanistan in the 70s women wore what they wanted married who they wanted became doctors and lawyers and in the space of a single year it was all ripped away by the religious right in their countries in the blink of an eye they became property with no rights if you thought that cant happen hereit is happening right now this is step one unless you fight back through engagement in the democratic process through words through solidarity with your sisters
"democrats will continue to pay the price for as long as they think that the filibuster is more important than the rights of women just like pelosi did when she pushed for an antichoice candidate over a prochoice proworker candidate as long as dems gang up on progressives the regressives in the gop will keep getting away with murder 

and quit blaming the corrupt justices for this it is the democrats who allowed this to happen by protecting the filibuster so yes suffer"
boycott products sold by those states dont travel there starve the ameritalibans

11 red states  given power  by gerrymandering  they also  dont want  anyone but  their  base they have voting 
i want to join the army like emma defending her country and marching for equality with her two mums while being told they cant have an abortion after getting raped  never been so proud to fight not only for oil buy also for womens rights  shithole us imagine living abroad and just watch 2020 season 3 of the usa keep going and more guns i heard season 4 gonna be wild 
i dont see how a federal law legalizing abortion is going to negate an existing state law criminalizing it i hope that can happen but well see people have got to realize voting is always more than simply voting for a candidate or a party it affects policy and lives
"first they came for the socialists and i did not speak out
     because i was not a socialist

then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak out
     because i was not a trade unionist

then they came for the jews and i did not speak out
     because i was not a jew

then they came for meand there was no one left to speak for me"
could be just a stunt  too get eyes of the treason of jan 6th the lack of morals allows the owners of the party of the rich  to do what ever their  far right  fascist  bosses  tell them too do if you live under the fiction  that we are no more then slaves  as far as the far right rich see us think again for sure their  women  will have the  power to chose to have kids or not if your not  rich if uncle  crazy  gets hi on drugs and  rapes you at  12 years of age  your having  that cock eyed   kid its no longer up to you your mom or  any sane person its up to  some old  man with preg  envy its a private issue only the women  involved needs to face not a  neo fascist   tyrant  g o p  fanatic   that  stole  office via gerrymandering or  by the 1804  electoral college  elect  democrats and they can  amend the  constitution  too match the needs of the people not  some  c e o of cult of personality   nut case  we never give the most votes too  we would use the popular  vote and ban gerrymandering  if the dems  get the power to do  so
no consequences for lying under oath for supreme court nominees or breaking of laws for justices  guess gop presidents and gop nominees can violate laws wo consequences 2 justice systems 1 for average americans and another for gop souverign citizen government employees ie presidentsjusticesrepresentatives senators etc

the most dangerous place for a child to be is in the shower with joe biden
god wins those against god will lose
some of them do not even have an exception for rape and incest  that is sick
more states will join them and then the real political fight will start to clean up the rest now that the courts have eliminated that roe wall of protection
and if you think that abortion rights for women are the only law that the farright extremists are banning then better wake up they will attack everything that american democracy holds dear and come after every progressive accomplishment that there exists it is time to finally treat this people as real domestic enemies to usa who have now infiltrated the government im serious and jail trump dont wait until they will do more damage to america before the world wont recognize this country anymore its going sectarian backwards 200 years at least
the supreme court was supposed to protect citizens instead of fighting against them
its unrealistic to think that the recent decision by the supreme court and states enacting laws will actually stop abortions  what they will do is stop safe abortions
"reproduction freedom is on the ballot in november  nancy pelosi

reproductive freedom has been on the chopping block for decades and the feckless democrats have done nothing to prevent this day  they care more about the filibuster than your rights"
pro choice states should boycott antichoice states all anti choice states are red states with no economy and rely on federal money just to operate at a deficit 
come and have a vacation in canada  we are a free society
no child is safe in this country with  all the guns and mass shootings
if people only knew the actual procedure and how abortions are performed they might change their opinion
ban and confiscate all guns in america
last time abortion was illegal a man could say it wasnt his and skip town men have almost zero parental rights already in conservative states a woman can put a baby up for adoption the father will pay child support no matter what at any time over the last 50 years congress could have passed a law so every 4 years abortion and the mexican border gets brought up to distract you from the fact your children have no future
im pretty sure she has the right to choose if she wants to get pregnant in the first place accidental incest and rape make up less than 1 of abortions
time for guns to be up to individual states
red states government are pushing restrictions against people just like in ww2
margret sanger founded planned parenthood to control the populations of people of color
this is effectively bs 
rest of world should look at america if you vote for looney this is what you get
pretty sickening that the first effort put forth from this attorney general is to activate law enforcement nothing about getting healthcare coverage for pregnant women or maternity leave nothing about helping these women that will be affected not to mention the poor children that they are forcing to come in to this world obviously its never been about the sanctity of life punishment is what they have wanted these people are dangerous to society and are trying to take us back to a time when women were the property of their fathers and husbands
 this is only a break from january 6th regular programming 
the us now effectively a kangaroo supreme court
theres a reason why abortion bans disproportionately affect women of color 46 of abortions are performed on women of color theres a reason for that too margret sanger planned it that way
i cant wait to look at the shock on female rightwing supporters as it finally affects them personally instead of plain politics in taking sides after being so brainwashed all these while i bet they be like after the abortion ban you say what
pelosi is quite hilarious women are still able to make their own decision but before having a baby if you dont want to give birth dont get pregnant you still have a choice you dont decide to create life to only then question do i want this or not you simply do it before
this is ridiculousi cant believe they overturned it what kind of country is this because its definitely not a free one good america you failed again

the republicans havent offered a better solution to any problem since 1861
you might want to check your facts before you start spouting off about matters of any importance nowhere in the constitution or the bill of rights is abortion the legal means to kill a baby legal means to kill a unborn baby spoken of or addressed even in the slightest and since its not in either of those documents it definitely is not a constitutional right for women to be able to have an abortion there is no wonder why so many americans consider cnn fake news this is a prime example
when this republican party gets there agenda done we the people will have no rightswhat will you cling on nut huggers who voted for them do then
all republicans dont forget trump added the judges that overturned roe  this is another mess your guy is responsible for now deal with it lol 68 of the country was against this ruling  once again he could not care less about the majority
bad times in america progress of the last 50 years destroyed for women by trump loyalists in the now corrupted supreme court who want to enforce their religious beliefs on all american women there is only one who is so happy about all of this and thats marjorie taylor greene that traitor i put her on spot in the first video in my playlist because i dont want her to get away with it

"women in these states need to start thinking of privacy browserapo data could get them a murder charge now  if states can request data from facebook google   microsoft etc

using tor and linux should become the norm"
"i supposed to good news is this tidbit of red meat for republicans is likely to get even some republican voters to vote against them  it is also likely to motivate socalled undecided voters to actually go out and vote which will most likely be blue  effectively i predict that we are going to see a turnout for a state voting that weve never seen before in order to show where the people actually are on this issue

also i suspect conservative voices who were concerned about the domestic supply of children in the foster care system are really just looking for a lot of kids that are going to screw up their lives and feed into the prison system in order to provide crap loads of virtually free labor for states and some corporations that depend on it  the other big concern that ive seen for the future is the prediction that the white race is going to become a minority given the birth rates of white families  wealthy people do not have as many children as not so wealthy people theres no need  as such white families tend to be waiting later in life before actually having a baby if they have a baby at all  and it doesnt compare to poor families of hispanic descent which tend to have about five or six kids out of necessity considering that about half of them are not going to make it to adulthood if the police have anything to do with it  to similar story with black families  but now that weve taken abortion off the table we are instead looking at flooding the united states with babies of all races  or more specifically were going to be flooding red states with babies of all races meaning these otherwise predominantly white states are now going to have lots and lots of babies of color and theyre going to lose their majority  this is kind of counterintuitive to the whole white nationalism thing  which to me kind of shows that these guys do not think ahead at all at least not very well 

 its kind of like the whole antiscience agenda you want a great united states and yet you do everything you can to put sticks and sabot into the gears of science and progress  this in turn weakens the united states and to becoming inferior to other countries"
"oh no you mean the voters get to decide
thats a democrats worst nightmare"
its not like  women  are stopped from having  kids the reason for this is too cause  discourse   100  divide and conquer its the g o p party of the rich way post nixon it works until they  screw things up so bad it dose not work  if your not rich and want too decide   that you  own your body  you best stop voting the  slave maker party of the far right neo fascist  g o p simple
its debates like this that ruin the political discourse in america trotting out a statement that abortion rights may not be on the ballot in november because its not the 1 concern is incredibly condescending to the voting public  people are capable of considering more than one policy topic you know
11 states effectively ban abortion ah so these are the 11 welfare states who love paying their poor women and men food stamps and checks and then sending their kids off to get slaughtered in the army
"the dumb supreme court just gave the democratic party super majority in november and i love it

no we will not be divided
im old enough to remember the time before roe this is going to sound callous but i think these state bans need to stay in place for a few years long enough for women particularly in red states to get a bellyful  so to speak most people now alive dont remember what preroe america was like now theyre going to find out education is good
for a woman to vote republican is the same as the abused posting bail for her abuser
this is going to be so bad for republicans  just the 65 voting blue will give the senate the ability to codify into law a womans right to choose nationwide  vote in the midterms
who the hell does the conservative supreme court judges think they are the only reason that they did this is to keep capitalism the consumer and low wage tax payer strong for the future telling you that you that authoritarian corpofascist ideology is in control cause the didnt want to financially help americans that much they cut unemployment they cut and limited stimulus and try to blame the financial help that most of us hadnt seen in years no raise in the minimum wage assholes tried to cheat to keep a stupid fuck and a cheat in power cops shooting unarmed citizens and fuckers ducking and covering when one kid with one weapon is killing children and lying to the public about their response and heroism these people need to be taken out trump his henchmen his stupid lying followers congress needs to put term limits on supreme court judges any one who would flag a comment about trump being taken out is part of themremember his buddy is killing civilians in an illegal war committing war crimes lies about election fraud created a coup that got people killed fuck trump and anyone follow him

i identified my sex because i wanted to express that regardless if i was caucasian asian hispanic africanamerican i am a man i should shut my damn mouth and stay in my lane when it comes to telling a women what to do and not to do with her body"
"perhaps its a good thing for red state economies  

it will create lots of business for illegal abortionists who will need schedulers to set up the illegal appointments probably working from out of state assistants to dump the bleeding women in an alley when the procedure has unforeseen complications lawyers to keep them out of jail  a new cottage industry"
to all women who value their privacy and decisions made between themselves and their doctors and the men who agree with that lets support states that support those rights that includes tourist dollars goods and services to shore up tax dollars to states that uphold womens rights we are far from powerless and we know it
this is about saving white lives the white population is declining significantly

it was never an abortion issue its about a womans right to self determination about her own body and her own life remove the first and how fast will the rest be removed when i was younger my mother could not have her own credit card or even her own bank account she had to prove she couldnt get pregnant to get a mortgage loan for a house ect ect ect the right has already stated birth control and ivf are the next on their list to be taken out
why is this bad for republicans
democrats will educate the public on safe drug use but not safe birth control
women still have the freedom not to become pregnant crazy nancy
the usa invented a time machine good job
just come for fun of f a k e news hahahaha
based on the fact that these trumpmcconnell appointed supreme court judges obviously committed perjury lied under oath their decision to overturn roe vs wade should not stand instead these judges should be held accountable and impeached for lying during their confirmation hearings
that is so backwards us is declining towards pre 60s mentality your conservatives are your taliban destroying decades of female rights progression
wow  what a brilliant use of law enforcement and the justice system  sure makes hopeless other inconsequential cases like death penalty cases defense in wrongful conviction cases etc   way to go gop fundies  in the end i wonder if it may be statelocal law enforcementjustice professionals who lend  urgent significant pressure to stop this bs

why should any state get to force thier beliefs on another group of people abortion should be a womans choice between her own conscience and her doctorthats true freedomthats separation of church and state why should republicans get to take away anybodys right to thier freedom of choice politics should not play a part in abortion at allthe republicans claim they care about life of a child until that life is hunted down at school by the second amendmentif one woman wants an abortion she should ba able to get one and if another woman does not believe in it she doesntt have to its that simplepeople who are for abortion are not telling people who are against abortion to have one its the other way around people who are against abortion are the ones trying to force thier beliefs on people who are pro abortion and that is not right
the left cant define what a woman is much less define a person or life  this is the result  you lefties voted for big government and you got it  you guys preach democracy now you have it  you now get to vote in your state on abortion thats the democratic process welcome to america learn to cope

it shouldnt be the mainstream democratic party job to fight an extremist party 

we need a threeparty system with a confident progressive party that will fight back the extremism coming from the right feverishly under a different banner without having to drag mainstream democracy in the mud 

this new party should be a new yellowparty head up by bernie aoc and elizabeth warren together they could raise a good amount of money to start a new party off"

the supreme court has just unleashed the twilight zone oklahoma have you lost your fckn minds criminalizing womens reproductive rights this is such insanity gqp have lost their collective minds
oh so you banned firearms  great   oh waitmy bad  i guess our school kids are still the best subjects for target practice with weapons of mass destruction   anyway congratulations to all oklahoma women  you are now listed at the bottom of the food chain  just below plankton   you will have to look above your position to see microscopic human embryos
this is brought to you by the same people that ended free lunch for children
banning things dont mean there a going away so what are the gop doing to prevent unwanted pregnancies absolution not sexual health education i guess as they did under the bush administration you need to understand that many democratic countries are not taking the us seriously anymore
"lol this story is so easily verified false
the court ruled that texas has the constitutional right to limit abortion after a heartbeat is detected cnn is listing texas as banning all abortion not true
in texas abortion before a heartbeat is still legal
how many lies does it take to show how dishonest this network is
the courts heard this case because the left challenged the heartbeat law roe failed because the lefts desire to have zero limits applied to abortion"
"in 1861 republicans put an end to democrats slavery and dehumanization of blacks

in 2022 republicans have put an end to the democrat eugenics program called abortion where children are labelled clumps of cells and have their brains mutilated in the womb"
is the womb really the safest place to be oklahoma  what about drugs or alcohol  there are some women that need help and cant get it  why add a pregnancy to this serious issue
now we know why trump surrendered to the taliban  he is the taliban
it isnt the end of the world just less rights for women and their government telling them what to do
these republicans claim to care so much about the unborn child but literally do next to nothing to protect the child or children in local schools who die to gun violence theyre hypocrites liars and political prostitutes and god will judge them
"abortion rights denied yet firearms rights expanded

should i be alarmed or am i overreacting"
"oklahoma had better build more orphanages and more prisons 
the unwanted children born today will be the prison population of tomorrow women will money will simply travel out of the state to obtain abortions"
i hope men in those states will dutifully stand outside the govt office at airports and state lines waiting for their wives and daughters to pee on a stick to determine if they are pregnant cant travel outside state lines cuz they might get an abortion

liberals will need to learn about contraception abstinence or anal sex
those children end up dying in school gun shooting
racist and misoginist those states
they need to band abortion in all states there is such a thing as birth control pills condoms you can have a shot so you dont get pregnant it is against the law for mother to murder her child but because it is in her thats okay at 5 months the child was pretty much formed just because a woman is in responsible and gets pregnant then she has the right to murder her child i dont think so need to change nationwide and ban abortion
i am sure that these states are all proud of themselves  lets see how they react when their mistress or teenage daughter needs an abortion see the law doesnt just apply to democrats

so therefore were at a place where we must expand to balance the sc abolish the filibuster and immediately thereafter codify voting rights protections then with real votes counted win elections

the dems have waffled in denial for too long we may be out of timeimmediately abolish the filibuster and expand scotus to balance or we literally lose americans fundamental democracy
the ignorance cynicism  denial of too many millions of americans is horrifying 80 million eligible voters did not vote yet they fully expect their lives to improveif they dont start voting and voting prodemocracy blue the constitution becomes a mere artifact"

stop getting pregnant on purpose   rape incest medical those ore leget reasons
btw  mothers of girls of all ages who live in those states enroll your girls in the track team today they will need to be able to run fast and run far
these pro life extreme rightwingers say they even oppose the elimination of a one month old embryo which has not taken a definite life form and cannot think or see or act in any manner that embryo should not be eliminated even for the protection of the mother that means they really dont care about the life of the mother moreover these same people most fervently support the use of guns even by children for so called selfprotection but the vast number of gun related deaths happen in the us are not incidences of selfprotection but mass shootings violent gun crimes and aggravated assaults these pro life people really dont care about those tens of thousands of lives as well these same rightwing people are big supporters of the us military and their numerous wars around the world what about the millions of lives killed in those wars they really dont cared about those million lives as well it seems in real terms they are very much antilife
good  some of these foolish women use abortion for another way of birth control

these justices are not conservatives they are terrorists  they are politicians installed to act on political agenda of their radicalized leader  our courts are now infected and cancerous with judges with no justice fair or balance scotus is no longer trusted to have its citizens and country at the highest regards  this is now proven by the dismantling of roe vs wade  from thomas to the newly installed justices  if these people remains in scotus americas doomed  
"in the immortal words of bill hicks ill tell you how to solve this abortion thing instead of leaving unwanted babies in alleys and dumpsters leave them on the supreme court steps

this is a war on women

why would anyone want to be born to someone who doesnt want them  so take of the future mothers then adopt them out to parents who are new born with drug or other problems to begin with one drug lady can get 10 kids pimp them while getting welfare free housing free medical care  or better yet ophans who cant get a family will get them when their crack head adopted padents go to jail end up instuationed for life better lets lock the insame up like them were before  get a bunch of wire clothes hangers as plastic has replaced most and break while giving abortions the law will change back when the goverment  rich realize how much money their loosing with clinics closed why do you think probation was revoked  your loosing money who gives a sht that peopleike to fk thats what makes the world go round 
"republicans abortion will now be illegal in our state

okay can we get a living wage and decent healthcare

it is not about children or religion or caring it is about hate and power  gop hate themselves and now hate everyone that is not gop how will their god meet them when they are filled with hate
you cant have an abortion but you can shoot your kids
i hope women remember this when its time to vote  republicans demand you have that child so they can murder it when it gets to elementary school
if you cant feed your baby then dont have a baby
we voted already the democrats have the house the senate and the white housedo your job now make it a federal law
not only are the republicans a threat to this country theyre a threat to the human race there is no cure for the republicans greed addiction
freddy must be furious
oklahoma the most dangerous place a woman can be
should a woman be more responsible with her body before needing an abortion is abortion murder of a child is the baby in her belly a living life should a woman use her right to choose before she is in a position to abort her baby are woman using abortion as a form of birth control
can putin hurry up with that nuke because im really starting to dislike my own country

"it is horrible obviously but it is also fascinating these politicians must be sure that doing this will help them in the upcoming elections even though polls indicated that the vast majority of voters is against abortion bans so  do these politicians know something that we dont know to me this seems like political suicide and totally unnecessary they could still do all those horrible things after the midterms they waited since 19873 surely they could wait half a year more

so now does a state gov think it has the right to limit anyones travel within the us this is nazi germany
right here right now watching the world wake up from history 
so why doesnt biden issue an executive order to protect abortion rights im asking as a british viewer my knowledge of american politics is limited
jesus is not pleased that so many are fighting to kill unborn children remember satan  killed babies to try to prevent the birth of moses and jesus being born poor is better than being killed how many great people rose from poverty and achieved great things birth from assault is less than 1 of abortions what if the father wants the child do they have any rights
i lived through the last time abortion was illegal the chiropracter across the street was running an illegal abortion clinic for years the other fellow up the street was his assistant they made a lot of money and never faced consequences there are always going to be people to provide services where theres a demand whether illegal or not and whether safe or not the newspaper constantly had stories of women dying from toxic shock

biden the usa is in bad shape please step down 
if you still vote for republicans america  you deserve this
you just can not perfect mankind  abortion has centers of practice  nothing and no one should interfere with another life choices  we have always had karens in our midst  these dogooders have nothing better to do than interfere in the business of others   the scotus should be a place where we can go to iron out issues and concerns  since the scotus members are biased and not our arbitrators anymore where do we go
sheep are falling for and reacting to this staged show set up by the us government this was a planned operation yet again
already we hear of mothers who killed or tried to kill their babies of children who have been abused by their parents this terrible problem now has the posibility of growing
what do you think about this new
elections have consequences  if you vote r or dont bother to vote at all then youre a big part of the problem  vote
those who support pro life are simply anti women period
oh bs what a gaslight of a headline
its an attempt to disenfranchise women from voting by criminalizing them  thats evil
this is all trumps fault  biden will make this country strong again and unite the people finally a man with morals and intelligence build back better kamala and biden 2022
what about indian reservations under federal law
this is an assault against all american women get ready for the next great migration from dirt poor red states to wealthy blue states that respect rights

"important to mention

this was done by a court filled by a senat that is not representative of the will of the people by design and a president who was rejected by the american people twice and only got into office because of the undemocratic electoral college

can somebody explain to me why some people still think of the usa as a democratic republic because the will of the people certainly doesnt seem to matter"
its all yalls fault that you reiled on a flimsy court ruling for 50 years
so basically america is gonna end up with a whole lot more homeless peoplepoverty neglected children etc etc  the welfare system likely wont  adjust to support any of the children born to parents who would otherwise have had an abortion coz they cant afford the child or maybe theyre drug addicts who now r forced to birth the child n the kid will have a crap life   good job guys way to go america gets dumber and dumber every year
lol they act as if voting rights havent been blocked at every level
interesting that oklahoma goes straight to law enforcement strategies instead of health and social support of those who would have had their abortions legally and safely otherwise nothing about recognising the injustice of natural abortion events being safeguarded from law enforcement agencies force is the operative word and clear intention life is precious and god is good  i don t think so
usa has lost the moral ground of accusing other countries of human rights violations  in many countries abortion is protected by law not court decision  usa just join a few countries in the world that abortion is banned or restricted  countries from japan to india to canada as well as most of europe women can safely access abortion either on request or based on broad social or economic grounds
a state cant ban a pregnant woman from traveling out of state for an abortion
so that means you flakes have 39 states yall can move too so you can toss your babys out   get moving
if the scotus decision was based on federal overreach on an issue they said belonged to the states how can they turn around and make a federal ban they claimed this was not even about abortion how can states take their laws and try and exert them in other states this is stupid on steroids women should realize this is an attack on their autonomy and equality regardless if they themselves would access an abortion these absolute bans can affect their daughters grandchildren sisters and nieces imagine rape incest and the health of the mother all being ignored by men who are more concerned with how many white babies can they force women to have
when he said oklahoma is now the safest place for a child to be i thought maybe they had just banned the sale of firearms
so pete buttigieg cant have an abortion now im confused
please stop saying they are conservative justices  they are extremists i am tired of the minority ruling over the  majority  men trying to control women  we are citizens of this country we have rights and will not be second class citizens we are half the population fine  i say we quit our jobs dont give sex and crash the economywe have that power
justice thomas and others want to go backwards in time to enforce these new laws other  than abortion there is also making it illegal for gay people to marry back in those days iinterracial marrige was illegal so how will he approach that since his wife is white
at the rate the us is going its going to be one of the most backwater country in the world in a decade
this is a country who cares so much about life that they dont have a proper health service dont support the needs of children in poor families and allow its sitizens to run around with automatic weapons its the richest third world country on earth they even have the highest infant mortality rate in all developed nations
democrats love drama they dropped the jan 6th deal like a used condom if democrats are unhappy it must be good for the country

"all eleven of these states should be embarassed for their regressive laws regarding abortion and a womens right to choose 
these states do not have the right to tell women what to do with their bodies   religious beliefs  there is supposed to be a separation of church  state so why are christian valuesmorals allowed to form policy or overturn policylaw because of religious beliefs"
dont we all love government controlled healthcare
the way this panel speaks as like a joke
when texas passes a law that says anyone traveling to another state to get an abortion will be prosecuted thats what we call overreach and thats why this needs to be dealt with on a federal level there needs to be one overriding standard that applies to all americans otherwise well see state laws that are oppressive and extreme
"i sadly doubt it will happen but every woman should immediately leave those states
the current supreme court is most definitely not conservative they are radical reactionary fascists at least the perjurious five who voted to cancel roe v wade enemies of progress humanity humanism science  and democracyand anticonservatives conservative justices respect stare decisis 
our only hope is vote democratic
throw every r radical fascist out of office and keep any new ones outprobably for at least a generation into the future"
so how soon will we read news about babies found in trashcans
i blame this on all the states biden had to flip back to blue if yall would have stayed blue clinton would have won and we wouldnt be in this mess
the republicans dont care about children they only need to use children until they cant use them anymore just so they can make money as well as hold on to power faster theyre a disgrace to this country i still cant get over these hypocritical republicans confirming amy coney barrett as a conservative justice for the supreme court bench after the passing of justice ginsburg in the middle of an election and during the pandemic not to mention they were ok with her lying under oath about roe v wade this country is heading into dark times and the republicans are to blame for this when it comes to the republicans its freedom for me and none for thee on that note they need to remove land of the free from the lyrics to star spangled banner because this country is far from free and its all because of the republicans
what happens next   more dead women  girls  foster care overwhelmed  and more babies in dumpsters
please vote blue to save our democracy from the disgusting gqp and orange clown cult members 
fuck the democrats now youre trying to save face used this for years as a political tool good luck to that party ever doing something for the people can hardly help people who are already struggling now hahahaha
essentially the people who support this are the same people who are likely to dissolve responsibility when children are being born into poverty
republicans are off their rockers its ridiculous and scary where they are trying to take this country 
i agree with cnn we should be militant about cutting defenceless babies into small chunks  then selling their body parts to cosmetic firms how will nancy pelosi get by without her night creams
every woman better come out and vote i just registered my granddaughter that turned 18
roe versus wade was never a constitutional right all roe did was make it legal to have an abortion anywhere in the us it was never a right and never can be a right
i for one has no respect or confidence in this supreme court and even our current democratic folks in congress and the president

"hooray

hopefully some personal responsibility will make a comeback

stop spreading your legs ya sloots"
honestly every state that has passed their bans still have law written to save the life of the mother so thats good
anyone who votes republican has no right to complain about this republicans as a whole have never hidden their agenda voters said oh they say they want to overturn roe but it could never happen the gop understands the political game better than dems

"i am not american but saw on piece about this on the international news they were reporting that the us is no longer a free country because they have lost basic human rights to healthcare and privacy this is terribly sad as the us used to be a respected nation i support my american friends who are fighting for their freedom you have international support dont give up
edit the news was also reporting ireland was in a similar situation years ago they got the united nations involved under international torture laws forced birth being a form of torture perhaps it is an avenue for your country to explore as well"
all republican states its only the beginning of what this supreme court will take away from women 
look at it this way im a few years actual murder will probably be legal then we can wrap up a lot of issues a lot faster
if women stopped having unprotected sex disease will go down too
mostly red states go figure stupid republicans
we need to stop letting people get away with the idiotic life begins at conception myth it is not a medical or scientific construct calling a fertilized egg an unborn child is stupid i guess it makes conservatives feel morally superior now that moron thomas wants to go after samesex marriage i thought it was a great example of societal progress that after obergefell people accepted it and moved on it became a nonissue create more hate clarence
all states to follow
"god  help us we are going backwards  in this country what the hell are these republicans thinking

and it was the right decision to let the states decide they can still go to democrat states its just like everything in california causes cancer well all the other states disagree with you
so stop and think about this if a woman cannot prove rape and she gets pregnant she has to then go to court with her rapist and have a custody agreement how is that ok we have that going right now because the rapist is well connected in their town he got full custody of his rape victims child and she had to pay child support to her rapist are you guys out of your damn mind so sitting in a room with men now women arent equal with rights wtf is wrong with you talibangelists are men going to start being made to pay child support at conception too
ussr split now its the usa s turn  it is going to happen

"it is disgraceful what usa have done  taking the freedom from women this is a human rights abuse and should be looked into by the un also all developed countries should boycott going to usa until this abomination is removed half the usa citizens are women  hence usa has removed freedoms from over 180 million citizens unheard of in a developed country

"always remember this and what republidiots  did
and we need to show up in nov
and get rid the idiots so they cant continue to take our rights away"
the party of small government and more freedoms has scared the living shit out of their base about liberals taking away their freedoms using big government for decades this ruling is the antithesis of what the republican party are supposed to stand for this party of radical hypocrites believes their right supercedes the right to choose for the other 70
well maybe if democrats would have treated the judges a little nicer instead of putting them through a circus this wouldnt have happened did you think they forgot karmas a b and as far as abortions go with the rising inflation and recession they couldnt afford an abortion or the gas to get there
why dont they mention the fact that nancy pelosi and chuck schumer campaigned for an anti choice democrat henry quaillar  sp
i think its finally time for the united states to have that difficult conversation that theyve been avoiding for so very long  its time to properly talk about human rights in the us  youve been dancing around it putting bandaids on fixes for decades  its time to review and revamp all these small amendments and create a proper and definitive declaration of human rights in your country just like the majority of the nations around the world have done decades ago  hint take a peek at the un declaration of human rights for ideas
the newest member of the court does not even know what a women is

women are more important then a country under god
so i guess the usa is back to being a religious controlled government good job on stripping humans rights away on behalf some peoples belief
and just like that democrats care so much about dark red mississippi arkansas and alabamawomens rights but you support men playing womens sportsyou have no sports either but thats okstay consistent if youre for womens rights then support all of them

as a man this really sucks for the women unlike conservatives i actually feel the heartfelt natural compassion for them so much for separation of church and state with this scotus ruling

the problem with people who believe in abortion is that they have a real big issue with when  an unborn child call can be called a human beingwhen does an unborn child go from being a foetus to a human being where is the cut off point if a baby is half way in its mothers birth canal and half way out is it human if a baby is no different 5 mins or five hours or five days before its born but for the fact that it is now outside the womb and its umbilical cord is cut is it now only considered human when does it go from foetus to human being people who belive in abortion really need to answer that questionim sure people who believe in abortion like being alive at this moment in time but yet say its ok to abort an unborn child if it needs bean unwanted pregency is a hard thing for any womann no doubt but its not the end of the world and there are services that can help women in this difficult time im there lives and yes abortions happen more in less well of parts of society then in richer partsthe testimony of a former abortion doctor dr anthony levatino to congress a few years ago is worth watching if your so sure abortion is a womans right to choose
more to come  yay

"america  you once held the position of an advanced innovative and highly sophisticated society you led the world through technological and cultural advancements but unbelievably a highly funded regressive but vocal minority has sought to rob half of your nation of basic automous a agency over their bodies and the right to make life choices
these actions make a mockery of the conservative ethos of personal choice free will liberty and restraints by governments over the lives of individuals
what a bunch of sanctimious hypocrites are the republican party of the usa
you are a hateful miserable force determined to force your religious views on others who do not share them
but the good ol boys will always find a way to arrange an abortion for their secretaries pas and mistresses so not to impede their career progression
you are holes make me sick

 they use sa  poor families as an excuse for killing babies so if your father is a criminal you should die 
you have 3 million men in prison so should all those children of fathers in prison just disappear
america is lost the plot
how white is missouri with their 1 clinic"
ask all the woman who support abortion how many they have had i can bet you whatever amount that most have never had one and many have no kids or just 1 maybe 2 so then ask how is it possible to not have numerous abortions or several kids its called protection why in gods name do you people not push for safe sex if the woman and the man use protection the cahnces of become pregnant is almost zero very very very rarely if at all will a pregnancy happen
you alone are enough you have nothing to prove to anybody  trust in yourself
meanwhile the justice with the wife that wants to overthrow democracy is targeting even more rights of freedom loving americans dont they make a wonderful couple

the same people that feel that they have a right in any womans reproductive rights are the same ones that believe drinking bleach for a democratic hoax manufactured in a lab in china is logical they believe that jfk jr is alive and well and is a republican they believe that hugo chavez played a part in the last election they believe that jewish space lasers influence the weather the same people also believe that they have a right to carry around an ar15 being afraid of everyone and everything and ready to take a life at a moments notice
if donald trump had been aborted hmmm

what happened to not knowing what a woman is
abortion is not and never was a constitutional right
not hard to see why america is travelling backwards after reading a few comments

abortion isnt becoming unpregnant  its becoming the parent of a dead child
someone should ask these judges  state officials how abortions have effected their lives  these are god fearing ignorant people playing god  the high court appointed men and women with two who committed perjury under oath during their appointment with the gop are unworthy of judgement  i though the smartest people should be in charge not the most hurtful   shameful lot hell bound for these men and women  with one foot in the grave who think their gods  not smart enough as far as im concerned just plain ignorant spite at hand

amazing now they all know what a woman is and abortion should be illegal in all states 
men making decisions for women ridiculous and disgusting
be 11 of the same states we should have taken in the civil war
church and state are supposed to be separate obviously that is not how this decision was made
it was because of women that they won their voting rights it was because of women that ended the vietnam war with bringing our sons home its always women that repair the damage that powerful spiteful man due to this country and worldwide there are now two different united states there are the united states with the us constitution and there are fascist states that disregard the us constitution those fascist states happen to be christian dont let them secede from the united states expel the fascist states from the united states its war that they want they put a chip on their shoulder and women are going to use a wrecking ball to knock it off

"if women were asking the father before aborting all this might not have happened 
their body might be theirs but half the embryo belongs to the father 
women are not the center of everything"
 abortion  americans 
we all want progress but progress means getting nearer to the place where you want to be and if you have taken a wrong turn then to go forward does not get you any nearer if you are on the wrong road progress means doing an aboutturn and walking back to the right road and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man there is nothing progressive about being pigheaded and refusing to admit a mistake and i think if you look at the present state of the world its pretty plain that humanity has been making some big mistakes were on the wrong road and if that is so we must go back going back is the quickest way on  c s lewis
why isnt cnn covering the riots or will they pass them over as mostly peaceful protest lol
children in these states are not safer they are now endangered more because predators know they can rape a child and force her to birth his child unwanted children will be neglected and abused this made children and women more at risk and gave power to the predators and men
governments should start payment child support for every new pregnancy   if is a life at 1 week then pay the mother for that child
its so sad to see us going back in history its mind blowing to see our rights being stripped away like its nothing
if you dont like the abortion laws in your state    move very simple    leftist socialist are too stupid to realize that
evil evengenital kkkristian republickkklans wrath against women was inevitable their fight against abortion was made through trillions of dollars of tax breaks for the christian churches they get 1 trillion worth of tax breaks every 12 years that adds up what the fuck do you think theyve done with it theyve stacked the goddamn supreme court its time to end tax exempt status for churches since they used it politically fuck the christian churches with political power
ask yourself why now why has scotus chosen this timing to start revoking rights thomas has made it known that same sex marriageadoptions and birth controlcontraception is next the scotus which is there to interpret the law has been politicized and weaponized against the majority of americans this cannot stand
if a clump of cells is now considered a person can  we now get life insurance for that person

11 states becomes the republic of gilead  bet the ladies there aint  too crazy about that 
remember democrats are in favor of murdering newborn babies that are alive and outside the womb just ask gavin newsome
watch out for the death rate of women going up because of this some women who are stuck in situations are going to try to get out of it themselves instead of being able to go to professionals this is so archaic
it was a democratic decision you have to accept it
it should be up to the states that why you get to elect you local officials the fed is too broad for such an issue
the male pill would make all of this laughable
if your wife cheats and get pregnant you in trouble lol
daily reminder that  rape babies and incest babies make up only 5 of abortions in america

"good  at least one good thing happened during the biden administration  term of office 
and killing babies is not a right"
lets see the financial plan for taking care of all these forced births  this will increase poverty depression deaths prison for children now known as foster care disease  this was never about women having body autonomy its about power hate and control of the majority of americans
and they will lose voter and tax revenue as people move away from their tyranny republicans effectively ended their careers this week
our founders warned us that our great freedoms were only fit for a moral and ethical society and one only needs to look at the headlines to see the founders were correct thanks in part to roe we are no longer a moral and ethical society it is high time we started on the road back to personal responsibility scotus nudged us a little in that direction
no abortions  more welfare mothers and more foster children  higher taxes
so dad now you have an 18 year sentence as well  child support at a minimum
taking away rights most likely never good they can do this because it affects the poor
truly if any american actually understood the definition of conservatism they would find out it is the fundamental antithesis to what it means to be american  truly our nation is regressing under these conservative  justices 
child support really needs to start at the first missed period
hay men pray for the health and safety of your woman because yours depends on it oh and we are working on taking some rights from you

i find ironic what the gop christian conservatives did to undocumented children at the border and yet in the same breath say that the life of an undocumented unborn child is more important than abortion rights of a us citizen truth is this is about religious fascism we the people shouldnt have to be forced to conform to christian idealism
31 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice holy bible
26 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature  27 and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which was meet 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient holy bible
abortion yes 
no state has made abortion illegal
gather around men and dont sleep with ugly women
the majority of women are against killing the unborn
why do women scream like banshees to kill their own
rip to the 65million babies aborted since 1973
i want abortionmurder to be illegal in all 50 states the only case where it would be considered would be if the mother and baby were both gonna die guaranteed in childbirth but it would be an emergency thing and not something anyone could do
muslims take religion seriously and in russia but not the west
one night stand vs gay a difference

this moment will go down in history 
"im adamantly in favor of legal abortion at anytime for any reason however ill make a deal with you all pass laws that make vasectomies mandatory for all men and boys of puberty age nation wide and have it enforced to the letter no exceptions he can have his vasectomy reversed when him and his partner are both ready to have children and will be legally obligated to get a vasectomy again once his partner gets pregnant then and only then will i cosign banning abortion with acceptions for minors and health complications of the woman or fetus to be clear when i say health complications i mean right when the problem is dected and not waiting until the woman is on deaths doorstep

that person in the thumbnail nial needs to thin those thick ugly eyebrows"
it is not freedom to kill a child it is murder
the pro choice supporters are unhinged and embarrassing the liberals get worse and worse every year
abortion is not a constitutional right
great win   babies can live  like all the abortion rights folks can live
bruh imagine crying because you cant kill your unborn child anymore 
women do abortion for the health of themselves and they will only be killing something not even resembling a human its not like that kid is going to be the next albert einstein or alan turing you call this progressing i call this one step into a dystopian country
"i believe abortion should be banned except in last resort emergencies and there should be no government funding of abortions getting rid of roe v wade actually secured womens right by giving women the right to be born 

and of course the pro choice and pro abortionists are angry they are always angry about one thing or another"
blessed be god
the idiots who said my body my choice failed to uphold that principle across the board and only doing so when it suited them and now their hypocrisy has come back to haunt them no mistake this is a bad move but ultimately for the worthless and inept feminist movement is their chickens coming home to roost
texas left the chat
200 the court is not the right place to expand freedoms period
fortunately the recriminalisation of abortion in canada through legislative andor judicial means will never see the light of day  evidently abortion has long remained a proverbial thirdrail of canadian politics
lady are you nuts the unborn are separate people from the mother unborn human lives matter
thank god this is the greatest news of my generation
443  well of course people who kill babies ought to go to jail  they ought to get the death penalty  
since when is it a right to kill a baby in the womb where is the babys right  the right to choose is the right to murder a baby  a living human life in the womb  all of these people even the reporters will have to give an account to god
fight fight fight fight i want stuff that i can upload youtube to get hits off of and make money from
women are ed  no leftists are ed real women dont care because theyre not the immoral babymurdering scum that you are real women are sickened by abortion
never have i seen people so despondent about not being able to murder innocent children the immorality of the modern american left is beyond anything ive ever seen in my ample study of history genghis khan slaughtered children without hesitation nor remorse is there a difference here
look at all those women protesting against womens rights
"i should be able to fck with zero fear of responsibility if that means killing an inconvenient child then so be it it cant be wrong if its legal

these fools would have been spitting on slavery abolitionists nonchristian postabortive here so my perspective kind of trumps so many of their proabortion talking points

thank god for this step in the right direction i disagree with 999 of abortions but can at least concede to debate it for the extreme outliers that they love to tout as the reasons it should be legal"
where them ladies husbands at they need to grab them and settle them down aint no way my wife be embarrassing me like that in public without getting a spankin
"these people are possessed
they want to satisfy their sexual desires without facing any consequences there is no argument to support abortion"
someone best tell these women about condoms or the fact he can pull out  if they hadnt treat abortion like a contraceptive and wanting to do it in the 3rd trimester then it might not have been overturned my body my choice  where was that with covid jab 
lol everyone in the comments so based
lets end this stupid debate by making it an issue for only women to vote on then live by the outcome 
w pro life finally atleast some babies will be saved from these murderous monsters
"would you agree that without ones health safety and welfare that the right of the people to be secure in their persons cannot be assured 

would you also agree that the basic foundation of healthcare is about ones health safety and welfare and therefore it is implicit in amendment 4 persons 

would you further agree that being that abortion has been an accepted medical practice for over 50 years in us history that thomass assertion that it is unconstitutional can be outflanked by those who actually know the us constitution

to outflank thomas according to amendment 10 amendment 4 and the bill of rights is superior law to the states adhoc that were post thomas assertion for persecuting people 

hence these state laws would have no traction  if the dems had the mojo to use the us constitution in the name of the people"
pov constitutional right to abortion where does it exactly say that killing babies is a right
fundamental right says biden how can anyone stand with a straight face saying that killing a baby is in any way a right
murdering babies shouldnt have ever been legal
poor liberals now they  cant murder babies anymore
its a bit bias i honestly came to listen and not have an opinion but its so bias i just cant sure pro life person didnt completely answer the question but she did put down her standing it seems non negotiable her stance is similar to make sure gender are equal we should kill the other gender im not saying thats what shes saying just an example of what i think of her stance now she did bring up a point abortion is mainly a social problem of what society might have become and social issues shouldnt be paid in the childrens lives she should have asked the pro choice about that
human sacrifice has been there for thousands of years the length of existence doesnt make it right
i was never more proud to be a conservative than i was the day the dobbs ruling was handed down what a glorious day that was im a young guy im not a lawyer or a judge or a politician but if my vote and my yearly donations to prolife organizations played even a small role in making this possible i am content
this is good now people have to be responsable
kids then why do you not rally to sue all organized religion then why i do not understand you when you do not rally to stop cops and police unions for the fact so many have died by police sheriff fbi state troopers crossfire but its a standard of disarm everything that is dumb sue and petition to stop centuries of child abuse that is the real ones in the united states that owns all the department of justice owns all of the department of defense its the one that think they have a right still to tell you what to do while if you dont listen and realize disarming the ordinary citizens is so stupid get ready when usa ends up bombed then what will all of you do oh thats right you all rallied up for no more 2 amendment rights all of you idiots rally for abortions instead of adoptions and or sending the fetuses to labs to help try and give them to mothers needing and wanting children
all fine and dandy until the courts are dealing with more children than they can support because parents didnt want the kid and had to decide keep or give uo for adoption   until there are more parents in jail due to child abuse until all these unwanted kids become the problem of our country  dont agree or disagree with abortion  its a sad reality that noone is going to win
weird to see women out in the streets squealing for the right to rip their unborn babies apart limb by limb
it was never constitutional to begin with
the united states government cant stop killed they killed people everyday even americans and nonamericans
"right you can be executed but cant get an abortion 

logical "
is it wrong to wish gang rape on a person i mean i just wanna see the look on her mangled face when she cant have an abortion
bunch of baby killers on the lib side
god formed us in the womb as we read in psalm 139 it should be a protected place as god designed us if people claim to be christian and also say they are proabortion substitute their euphemistic term then that is a massive contradiction exodus 20  dont kill god bless you americans who have realised that and we need more here in europe
"the will of the people is to have abortions
then why are so many states banning it"
these womans minds are so warped they put the emphasis of choice and rights at a wrong juncture their right is to choose a proper mate and to choose a proper person to take their panties off for not to take their panties off for random multiple men and then kill an innocent infant because they were immoral in their decision making that is not woman power womans power is in creation not destruction woman  love your self males you are not manly because you have tones of notches on your belt it is not manly to string multiple woman along its gross males respect your selves respect your seed
wow women now will have to think twice before laying up with chad or tyrone without birth control
no right to abortion
"polls
like the ones that showed brits didnt want brexit before they voted in favour of it"
well biden unlike you trump actually kept his promises that he was elected for
"taking liberties away
what greater liberty than the right to live"
here we go have you guys ever heard of the book called freakonomics iii cut to the chase when roe v wade got institutionalized there was an economic study done on the amount of criminals in incarceration 20 years later after roe v wade got implemented the crime rate suddenly droppedthe people incarcerated this means that if those parents wouldve been forced to have those children they wouldve grown up poor and neglected the most important parts when making a criminal but 20 years later they werent there what does a good mother to for their child they do whats best and maybe whats best for some children is wiping them off the face of the fucking earth before they have chances to lead miserable lives with the rest of us
"the left men shouldnt have a say concerning an abortion
also the left men can get pregnant
oh so now men can get pregnant but cant make laws concerning what happens while they are pregnant 
the left stop using our own words to show how stupid we are"
truly unbiased reporting right here award worthy
let the foetus killers perish
abortion is not a right channel 4
murder should never be a freedom  how   would the left feel if abortion was only accepted if a women can prove she was raped with dna evidence of the male who got her pregnant  and also only in the case where a dr can scribe that she will be in a horrible medical situation if she does not get one  no other exceptions  that will still be less than 1 percent  something tells me they would protest even more
great day
"you can over turn those rights the difference is women can make themselves abort however they want to or need to
you cant stop women from doing it causing an abortion onto themselves"
"whats an effective way to get texas lawmakers to change their view on abortion law
get their wives pregnant if they have any"
if they want a abortion it should be just like cosmetic surgery if you want it you pay cash no free money or insurance accepted
is abortion still allowed in the first trimester if yes then whats the issue
lratioroe is gonebaby saved
i am so happy it makes me sleep so good i sleep on a puffy cloud knowing you people are in pain because you cant have what you want
its like they forgot vasectomies and tubetying exist
u people are sick damn psychos paths
focus on the light and the dark fades away a win for the innocent unborn god always wins
this report is based lol 
at least they look normal 
how can and girl scream abortion is a human rightso sad
340 if the majority of people wanted to bring back slavery should usa bring it back obviously not i dont care if even all america wanted to kill children it still should be illegal and praise the lord jesus it now is
women will just abort with pills what is trump going to do break into their houses lol
i love that american women like killing babies
ill pay for any woman who want a abortion to travel to a legal state to get it done  so fu all you states that made it illegalguess i found a way around your state laws and a big screw you lol
dont we want leftist woke liberal women to be first in line to end future voters  i say yes please hurry down there right now
now we can call it a fetus shower instead of a baby shower congrats
"prolifers be like white male christian over 50 

you aint having babies sir your opinion is not valued"
" go back to alabama 
is the only appropriate response to prolifers"
scotus based
for crying out loud you screaming proaborts womens rights are not just about abortion  in fact womens rights didnt even begin with abortion in the conversation if you really care about womens rights then start caring about the little women in the womb hey bald guy a right that has existed for 50 yrs think about the thousands of years previous when it wasnt legal and why it wasnt
fjbfool
god please save us for the world has been corrupted by satan if i become president ill make a point just by banning anything with abortion and even condoms for a year can you live without lustful desires or will you take the chance to have a child
scream babykillers scream 
abortion is not a right its a medical service you do however have a right to do whatever you want at home with a coat hanger good luck
i could watch this all day lol
abortion was never a constitutional right and now it is up to what the citizens of each state vote to keep abortion legal or to make it illegal lefty overractionists
liberal americans are brain washed americans
this is why women shouldnt be leaders in anything when emotions take over they lose all logic and common sense show your emotions in the comments liberals i know you cant help it after reading this lol  ps abortion is murder you psychopaths
to the idiot reporter abortion is not a constitutional right no where in the constitution does it say that is a right what an idiot statement
"channel 4 is known for its poor biased reporting
nobody with any intelligence takes it seriously"
it wasnt ever a constitutional right you fucking lying retard
so wait please tell me why it is wrong to kill a child out side the womb but its ok to kill one inside the womb thelifeof the 1 week old child is nodiffrent from a kid in the womb please explain to me all u pro abortionist
bad reporting
why is women rights more important then a babies rights they should be the same
pro life for life
abortion gives women the ability to determine whether or not a man becomes a father thats a lot of power to loose
roe v wade passed 5 months ago and yet  women riots who think abortion should stay alive is so pathetic it makes me laugh every time abortion is not a constitutional right never has never will
some of those women claim my body my choice  its your body but not your life youre taking and first of all they shouldnt blame the unborn baby for the irresponsible decision they made to get pregnant
what if it was one of the supreme court people had a child that got pregnant by  force they would think differant about it
which states made abortion illegal the dems are fos only late term should and is illegal in some states you can even cut your boys parts off if you wanted a girl
most of these woman should be ashamed there not using abortions  because they got took advantage of there partying sleeping around getting pregnant  then casually aborting a human life after a long weekend making bad choices  or lying about it  people dont take responsibility anymore they can all stand around yelling my body my choice but most of the time abortions are murder from a bad decisions
abortion is the death of an unborn baby end of story
"theyre gonna have to use birth control now and be accountable 
whats the world coming to"
they talk about womens rights womens right to choose what about the rights for the unborn babies so sad that too many babies did not live because of their mothers decision to abort them
jippy it is a win for poor babys
i drink your feminist tears shhlurrrrp i drink them up
whenever i hear people talk about this case its always about what they think should be allowed morally rather than looking at what the dobs v jackson is actually about the decision wasnt based around what is right or wrong but instead its the question of should the government be allowed to tell states what laws to hold on abortion to prevent the government from having too much power states tend to make most of their own laws apart from the federal government and abortion laws vary greatly from one state to another most states allow abortion up to 24 weeks and in new york it can be at full term personally im fine with abortion being legal but not at full term but thats just my opinion and my opinion isnt the issue here the issue is about who should decide what all the definitive laws on abortion should be in each state should the individual states be forced to adopt laws based on the bigger governments desires
the biggest rally in the world is from the pro life movement therefore the supreme court speaks for the majority of the american people
just because you put rights in front of something it doesnt make it right
oh nomy state made abortion illegal  i guess they win and im going to have to have this baby oh waiti knowill just travel to a state to where its legal to get it doneroflmao
i love all the comments here by anti abortion people who completely ignore the fact that the only thing this did was make people who want it travel to a state where its legal to get it done
where was the energy for voting  fuckin women bruh
there are two things a person should never be angry at what they can help and what they cannot
love how the proabortion women are saying the women are mad as if all women agree with this smh trust me theres probably more women in favor of prolife then you
we lost our freedoms look on the bright side now millions of babies have the freedom of life 
i love how 95 of the proabortion protesters have never even had an abortion or will ever even get one
why is the punishment only on the women some men lie some are married and creating single parent homes elsewhere circumstances are different for everyone
look how they portray the pro lifers as the crazy ones  and the baby killers as oppressed victims
i see  on one hand with a lot of women are happy that this is gone only the crazy little women who wants to kill babies are mad he probably want to sacrifice the babies that they killed to the devil im not surprised if they do
she shouldnt really worry about abortion not with those eyebrows
the hypocrisy of baby killers
a great day for protection of the most innocent who do not have a voice in this
funny how these my body my choice protesters are the same people ridiculing antivaxxers for not getting a shot whatever happened to my body my choice 
prolife believers say its about saving a human life but it is not it is about the pregnancy if they cared about human life they would pour energy into robust development of adoption agencies social support for needy families education and general welfare of all children so no child would be born with the risk of poverty and poor educational opportunitiesprolife is all about forcing everyone to the same set of rules kind of like forcing women to wear a burka and only travel in the company of a male relativeif the antiabortion people really cared about reducing abortions rather than forcing people to abide by their rules they would work to make family planning and contraception free to all women in the united states and vasectomies for men if there are no unwanted pregnancies the number of abortions would plummetjohn messmer md hummelstown paprolife is not about saving a life  pennlive letters 
those proabortions who are terrified about the roe vs wade overturn have never been loved
the constitution doesnt protect abortions it doesnt have any amendment or right stating it this news agency needs its credentials removed
make a short story short for those who think murdering gods kids is ok  they should be worried god doesnt abort them there are women who have had an abortion and know what they did is wrong under their father in heaven and pray for forgiveness and have a relationship with him then there is monsters who who have an abortionmurder gods children and spit on their father in heaven you say god or jesus and the demons come out of the wood work
"abortionmurdered unless it is for medical reasons 
those young zygotes or features also deserve the right to come to society even if it is just one minute and a taste of life
and i promise you this the supporters of this crime that regret in the future is an understatement
if the baby suffers because of coming to the wrong person what do you think you will suffer go and read about the consequence of abortion before you suffer from what you jump around the street and beg for  coming back to you in the harsh way possible
this is my advice from a women to women"
the first major ruling going in the opposite direction a little bit biased formulation isnt it
i thought men didnt have a say in this or is that only if they arent on the left
"37 weeks fullterm baby
and you can still get an abortion 
wow on what planet is this ok with some people"
"court took away the constitutional right to an abortion
cant take away a constitutional right if it never existed in the first place"
pro abortion till death i do not appreciate these zealots making choices on women and they mostly are men and ugly chicks   
abortion is not a constitutional right
oyyyy vey that nose on the thumbnail
watch 7 day life option  this is your baby  here 
the best decision the scotus has ever made
im a feminist and im glad that abortion is illegal across the country now women everywhere can get free tickets and stairways to heavensell baby limbs for extra cash
these hack talking heads are out of control
its not funny how many people are crazy stupid thinking its the end of the world
dismember children oh my i feel so sad and angry just terrible manan attack on the poor
without any concern for the financial spiritual psychological  or community consequences of this terrifying decision
i dont care if you democrats dont like it its the law comply or face prison
"all of you who think it is a womens  choice to kill a baby where is the childs right to live and its choice since when did we say it is okay to kill is it the childs fault that it was conceived  as for women dying
look at the stats 2 of the abortions are incest  rape and molestation and womens health so why are people fighting for the 98 who chose to lay with a man"
in 2021 in new york city more african american babies died  in abortion clinics than were born in hospitals in new york city the next time you hear any politician defend abortion being legal in america please make them aware you are not a fool make the politicians aware you know abortion would never be legal in america if the same percentage of white babies died at abortion clinics
"question
so why is a baby called a baby when you want to keep it but called something else when you dont which one is it are you pregnant with a baby or are you pregnant with a lump of tissue and cells in your womb im thinking that people say this to appease their conscience so not to feel so horribly guilty when it comes time to get an abortion i mean seriously people make up your mind all ready"
"people who want to stop the brutal murderslaughter of innocent babies by criminals
"
great abortion is murder
mothers can drink alcohol whole pregnant but they should be charged if it harms the offspring
"i believe if a mother drinks alcohol while pregnant and it causes the offspring to become disabled it should be charged as and it is just like

breaking someones leg so that it remains that way and it causing the person to be disabled forever"
or playing baseball breaking the neighbors window and then refusing to pay for innocent neighbors window to be fixed
abortion is just like running a stop sign gstting into a tbkne accident involving an innocent driver and then walking away from them negating your responsibility to them
the great awakening  christianity must be saved
"22211 from the lord our god and savior
the word of the lord spoken to timothy
for all those who have ears to hear


thus says the lord 

peoples of the earth you have hated life you have polluted my garden diseased and awful generation you have destroyed the garden and so i am come to cleanse and to wipe away i am come down my face is very near do you feel the heat of my wrath o ignorant and vain peoples you retain no knowledge at all only greed and wickedness wickedness upon wickedness passes before your eyes without ceasing and oh how you love to have it so
dead generation your hearts are stone day after day you build up wrath the vessels overflow day by day the bodies are stacked up in heaps day by day the unborn are slaughtered whole generations of people murdered without cause multitudes of innocent cast off as refuse yet you think me too harsh and my punishments too severe my judgments unfair

i am the lord and this is my earth
these are my children
all you see from the ground beneath your feet
to the farthest reaches of the universe is mine
and i shall do as i please
i shall do according to the counsel
of my own will2 for i am god

therefore o peoples of the earth because you have slaughtered the innocent and murdered your neighbor lo you have even made for yourselves laws that all may do their pleasure in unrighteousness and perform evil at their leisure so then shall i also declare my law and it shall fall hard upon the backs of all nations yea i have put forth the decree and hasten to carry out your sentences o peoples of the earth
and what is the sentence you ask look upon the slaughtered innocent look upon their torn and broken bodies behold how they are torn in pieces see how their blood pours down and their limbs are strewn about look look how they are scraped out of their mothers womb look upon the works of your hands you evil and most wicked generation look upon your wickedness look upon all you have done
thus says the lord god creator of heaven and earth because of this blood which remains on your hands because of all the multitudes of slain you have piled up in heaps because of the evil works of your hands in where you have agreed together to both do and allow them to make them law thus shall i in like manner do unto you in like manner shall you receive at my hand
lo even double shall you receive at my hand and double again until there is no place found that is not laid waste until every land is polluted by the stink of rotting corpses both man and beast shall lie down in death together they shall be as refuse upon the land i shall tear down your cities and break apart all your dwelling places i shall tear your leaders in pieces and pour out the blood of your mighty men upon the ground until it reaches unto the neck3
behold all mighty and evil men shall be torn in pieces with their limbs strewn about in the open fields and in the waste places4 behold the great army the astonishing company the assemblage of nations who have come together to fight against the holy one of israel5 shall be broken in pieces without hand for strong is the lord and sharp is the sword which proceeds from his mouth6 behold i even i the lord of hosts shall scrape every last vestige of man and his inventions from the earth at the last day for i am god and the glory of my strength is revealed in my holy one

the glory of men must die
declares the lord of hosts
the only creator the god of israel

cann we focus more on the problem of fertilizing chimp embryos with human genes we do not need human chimp hybrids spending the money on that rn when our children have little odds of being able to have water in their 20s is ridiculous  i feel like roe vs wade is a distraction from the real problems if you think abortions is the real problem in the world rn get ready to be traumatized
how women support having their own rights taken away is mind blowing
its not a constitutional right you hack

too many pro abortion people other than me prove their hypocrisy over the issue waaa waaa roe was overturned they cry how dare you politicians put bans on abortion but theyre hypocrits i keep shouting there should be no restrictions restrictions for abortion are stupidly  fine by most pro abortion people im outraged and have said it at the time heartbeat laws are wrong other pro abortion people are silent waiting periods forced sonograms are wrong where were the protests about those non existent the lgbtq people are getting into the fray saying our rights will come next because roe was overturned but not one of them cared about abortion restrictions during roe not one of them while demanding roe and the years after have joined or started protests demanding no abortion restrictions they never cared because most women who get abortions are straight but when their rights are infringed the world must stop spinning in these protests now over the abortion bans where are there any lgbtq people holding up protests signs decrying the overturn of roe none theyre just mad that theyll be next for rights removal and men sure theyre all for abortion so they dont have to pay child support where were the men marching with women in the 70s demanding with them the right to abortion the namby pamby pro lifers certainly wont take pregnant women and young girls into their home while theyre pregnant paying their medical bills and being there at birth and helping to raise that unwanted kid if you say life is so precious then where are you when that life is growing in utero and the namby pamby well i donate to charities who help single mothers with kids people wont even donate unless they get a tax deduction because they have to personally benefit im fed up with the hypocrisy on both sides im all for abortion i had one but in 1987 there were no waiting periods no forced sonograms no heartbeat laws and the minute those came out years later i was yelling about those while other pro abortion people were silent abortion will not stop itll go back to back ally butchers
all these w people crying about abortions when we no what hood these clinics are in how many abortions are given on marthas vineyard
"molech the child devourer
"
good those babys were getting straight rolled
"technically speaking they didnt take any constitutional right away thats just a talking point used by one side to try and state that it was inalienable 

what they did was reverse what they found to be a mistaken decision from 4950 years ago 

that is to say people were operating for those years under a mistaken premise 

whether you agree with the court or not thats the objective facts of what occurred

they didnt strip you of some explicit entrenched right"
what id like for them to do is get a copy of the constitution and read it all front to back and they will find there is no abortion rights in there to begin with
these women that are crying
they never overturned the right to abortion overturning roe v wade gave the decision back to the states and i am so tired of repeating myself on this issue if you dont know what roe v wade actually was then dont claim to have an opinion on it
dont worry there will be a republican landslide this november  and abortion shall be fully banned and illegal in every scenario nationwide  so excited  i love america and president donald j trump  abortion rights are a joke and always will be
when men abandons the kid they are seemed as evil and they should pay child support no matter whatbut for a women she could kill the kid too
this is what ideological possession looks like on both sides
the fuckin country is falling apart with rents and cost of living that makes middle and lower class a living nightmare and people argue about this bullshit
i think its good women shouldnt have the choice men havent had a choice when it comes to child support or getting any kind of assistance i call this equality
nobody has the fundamental right to end a human life yes it was legal for 50 years but what about the 200 years before that women can still get abortions but they may have to drive to a different state women still have the right to choose abstinence birth control common sense self control and in the worst situation  rape or incest the morning after pill which doesnt kill anyone it prevents conception from taking place i dont understand what is wrong with these women who are crying over a hypothetical baby and their right to murder it at any point in time
they didnt take away a constitutional right to abortion they stated that it was never a constitutional right to abortion in the first place period
i never realized just how insane some women really can be until you take their murder away
"the movie 2001 a space odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion a space odyssey is a fetus in the womb the clint eastwood dirty harry movies was angry calm it seems nasty but its a good police officer angry calm is how a women chooses abortion 

everything in motion makes one error your supposed to park the errors where it doesnt matter or you play wack a mole with errors its intelligently designed that if you try killing god you will always make one error a movie is in motion so you have to park the errors where it doesnt matter 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind that why hal computer eye is colored red so it still has artistic integrity 2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made it only has one error to park you cant do better than that"
yes finally abortion is banned
why are people crying over this 
so your upset cause now you gotta be more responsible before you sleep with anyone
abortion is murder change my mind
half these women wont even get a chance of getting pregnant with this attitude lol
handsmaid tale for real
saving childrens lives is the best decision the court has made now it goes back to the states welcome to australia also the 14th amendment protects life liberty and property that includes the life of the unborn deal with it lefties start accepting responsibility for your promiscuous actions
"the man seems confused on the one hand he says that peoples rights are being taken away but alsodoes not want the people of his state to decide of course his decision about rights is more important
what a shame that he presumes to represent austin"
wow the reporter is just like so impartial
no one has the right to take a life you know babies have constitutional rights
iam a woman to me pregnancy is the most beautiful feeling in the world in all stages of pregnancy going through the labour stages i felt the  pain but it wasnt the pain i thought about it was hoping the baby would be ok that is what is on every womans mind who is ready to give birth those who abort their beautiful babies will never get to feel that
a baby has rights too you stupid women dont kill them
its ok alright these aborted babies are added to gods kingdom as angels   at the same time all these hoes will be thrown in the lake of   fire for an eternity

disgraceful reporter incapable of doing her job  little more balance harridan try not to be so pro baby killer
these people with the catchcry its my body to with as i wish should be answered with the cry from the unborn babyits my bodyplease do not murder me
"we are focusing on the wrong problem here only 14 of 100000 women of chilbearing age chose to have an abortion while god sits over in the corner being completely ignored as he rubs his dirty little hands together thinking about how to take out the next baby

in 15 of pregnancies god chooses to kill babies and that is just the miscarriages this doesnt account for the countless times he gets it wrong and plants the egg outside of the uterus or tries to strangle the poor thing to death with its own umbilical cord as a last ditch attempt to prevent it from seeing the light of day forget all the deadly birthdefects where the poor creature designed in his image is born without a brain kidneys fully developed lungs at least these abominations give us a good clue as to the kind of higher being we are working with here add these in and god is by far the most prolific baby killer on the planet 

not to mention the us has the highest rate of murder of women by god just for trying to give birth to a human in his image out of any developed country in the world you think with all these laws being passed to hinder the doctors who are actually trying to save the lives of babies and mothers on a daily basis he would cut us some slack but it seems like his blood lust continues 

just based on these facts if you really want to stop all these murders of babies and pregnant women it would make so much more sense to get to the root cause of these murders logically we should ban god from all forms of government because he obviously could care less about the life of a baby and its mom more god is definitely not the answer"
pretty sure the thumbnail lady wont have to worry about getting pregnant
notice when leftwing nutjobs dont get what they want they are allowed to say elections and decisions are illegitimate but when a right wing nut job acts the same way its suddenly insurrection and domestic terrorism

"the left is excited about finding life in the form of an ameba  on mars but is willing to destroy life here on our planet  help me under that 
the argument that it takes away their personal rights is a leftist narrative  they say  we are loosing our democracy when in fact the court simply returned the democratic choice back to the states as is correct in a constitutional republic like america  roe v wade was never the law of the land  a court does not make law"
original sin all cruelty first generated in a males mind because males have free will can use free will against others and should never use free will uniquely human were the only species to kill and eat each other males kill females wholesale not go to jail females are allowing female to be put in jail for doing only what females can do flawlessly for free
peace begins first between males and females then hatred cancer disappears

why cant people realize if you dont want to have kids go get protection they cant take responsibility in the bedroom
there has never been a constitutional right to get an abortion the only thing done was restricted states from prosecution of those who get an abortion and of those that perform abortions there will never be a constitutional right to end a pregnancy in order for that to happen the opinion of the supreme court would have to be that ending a pregnancy is an unalienable right a right that you are born with given by your creator so until someone can show how ending a pregnancy is an unalienable right then theres no reason for the people to think that its a right and not a privilege you want to argue that its your body then if you can show me where your creator has endowed you to do whatever you want with your body then you have an argument do you have a constitutional right to get a tattoo do you have a constitutional right to commit suicide  no you dont so the its my body argument is moot
ernest hemmingways mom wanted to abort him instead we got a great author beethoven deaf and dumb we got the greatest composer sean penn was mentally challenged we got a great actor babe ruth had two left feet we got the big bambino how many sean penns have the selfish women aborted is my question
"my body my choice  the most arrogant thing ever said on the face of the earth

gods creation his choice  overrules nonsense logic"
the reporter is so bias such trash
abortion is murder
constitutional right to abortion i dont think it is in the constitution since its murder
i dont understand the hysteria  it just means that each state can now decide whether to allow abortions or not  its not outright banning any abortions anywhere

stupid fucking irresponsible leftists i am praying for civil war because you will not win
i heard a wise man once said if men could get pregnant then abortion would be a drive through probably true
ok lets try a different logic and see who really is against abortion  the age of abortion starts at 15 and goes to 18 then till adults 44  lets just take a look at 15  a child may have an abortion at the age of 15 no parental consent  they cant drive a car  they cant smoke a cigarette  they cant have alcohol  they cant vote  they cant join the military but there old enough to decide all by themselves if they want to end a life   if your a parent i want you to look into the eyes of your child and see if thats a good idea to you  since the parent is responsible for the decisions till 18yrs old  the parents body and choice it really is  most of all another lie told by the devil the truth is its gods body and not your choice  but i digress how many children have made this decision alone and then had to live with its consequence for life
now make it a crime for homosexuals to marry thank you very much
"yesssss life won
oh boy the women are pissed well what did you women ever invent every time you get in a vehicle thank henry ford every time you get on an airplane thank the wright brothers etc and so on"

my thing issssss why do they care so much wen they not going to be the one raising or helping with the baby they need to find them some business

"good maybe you learn to close your legs im a biological woman so learn what the woman suffrage movement was really about

the audacity using  excuse from a time women had no say  at all

we can say plenty because of that movement  the older people who are there are woke parents now ignorant and selfish women i got harassed for saying women and now they are saying women  

yea i have nothing nice to say
about ignorant selfcentered greedy  individuals who dont know what they are fighting for

people who are born want to kll people who are not born  pchyopath babbling much when i was a kid these women were considered crazy and had no choice if they wanted to go to the psychiatric and stay in a psych ward so shut up and close your legs go home already 

here is the definition you dont want to research i did my research

what did the womens rights movement accomplish during the 1960s

gradually americans came to accept some of the basic goals of the sixties feminists equal pay for equal work an end to domestic violence curtailment of severe limits on women in managerial jobs an end to sexual harassment and sharing of responsibility for housework and child rearing

that old lady said the 70s there you go ignorant woke individuals  say it right or dont say it at all "
i think the scotus did us a favor overturning rvw turning it back to the states has caused activism that will cause democrats to hold both the house and the senate if you want abortion rights funding for climate change taxing  corps the democrats are getting it done without republican support  vote blue keep your rights

so where in the constitution does it say you have the right to have an abortion or not have a rifle with a bayonet lug   
lol could this report be any more biased lol
the land of unlimited opportunities becomes the land of unlimited stupidity initiated by humans believing in imaginary sky daddies and ghosts fetus is not a baby not an infant not a teenager not a grown up not a senior it is a bunch of dividing cells without self awareness with a potential to go through the above mentioned phases only very ignorant and genitals obsessed humans would take the right away from the women to their bodily autonomy
"former prochoicer here  seeing our first baby during the ultrasound  was just incredible  it was a baby  and it was alive
the lie that its just a mass of cells its not a baby was exposed by seeing our babys image on the screen
some time later i saw a video showing the remains of an aborted baby  i learned that after an abortionist cuts  slices up the baby inside the mommy they have to reassemble the babys body parts on a tray to ensure none of the cutup pieces are left inside the mom
now why do proabortion people go into a rage when responding to proposals that women see their babys image in an ultrasound before going through with aborting their baby  why do they oppose transparency and fulldisclosure  why do they oppose letting women see the truth
why do people lie about abortion being a constitutional right when it is never even mentioned in the us constitution 
if our future is a more civilized one history will judge harshly those who advocated for the mer dur of babies including them with the architects of the hollow cost and other historical mass mer dur atrocities"
aww now the whores can only kill babies in 29 states
why they be puting the most ugliest girl in rhe pic all the time lol
and abortion isnt health care its murder the baby is an human being
stupid lying politician

"here are contraceptive options available

contraceptive options can be readily available even in states where surgical abortions are banned"
this guy just wants to spit evil double tongue split serpent words
99 fucking years in jail thats some bullshit right there
best decision of all time its never okay to kill we as men have a right to choose what happens too republicans for life trump 2024
"your all a bunch of racists
"
why on the news they say mother and unborn baby were killed by drunk driver but when a woman goes to kill the baby voluntarily its all of a sudden not a baby but a clump of cells 
this is hilarious what the world has come to 
disgustingly biased
cannot belive they have done this im glad i live in the uk
only situation where i think abortions should be allowed is in the case of sexual assault
overturned in instant 50year is instant
they climbed bridges cause someone said have a decision in 16 weeks 4 months 12 the birth dems wonder y entitlement at all time high stop boosting their egos

seriously who is banging these ugly pro abortion women
there was never a constitutional right too abortion
roe vs wade is a republican wedge issue the true is this is about womens rights the government has no right to force a woman to give birth
aint no happening in india
abortion rights arent womens rights
roe vs wade is a republican wedge issue the true issue is womens rights
jose vela confirmed beta male and ignoramous on the constitution as well as legal norms around the world regarding abortion
the liberals in power allowed this to happen  sure blame it on trump lol  they think its going to rally people to vote democrat and stop the huge republican wave thats coming not going to work nice try clowns
if you dont want a baby use contraceptives protect women protect babies
i hav to ask y is abortion such a top issue in the usa  babys r the greatest thing in creation these abortionists make it seem like if they have babys it will be a monsterbut maybe for them abortionists they really are monsterssad 
if you were to murder a women who happened to be pregnant youd be charged with killing the woman and most likely be charged with the death of her unborn child so theres already a law saying that its a life before birth because you cant be charged with murdering something that was never alive this news station is about as biased as possible this isnt reporting this is called activism lol 
people would be pro life if american health care didnt charge 10000 for a baby so i guess abortions were just another way of big business to milk more money off of poor american libtards
"so plant it what the seed

shouldve just used condoms or birth pills in the first place nobody wants to hear you brag about how you got 4 abortions in 3 years
protect civil libertiesamazing grace or more disgracethe right to life liberty and the pursuit of happinessthe right of a woman to take a sacred life even if she chooses only to take male unborn childrens lifesit is not a civil libertyit is the worship of bal in child sacrifice for ones own pleasurefreedom of choice begins and ends with the choice to sleep with a male out of marriagefor money or even more foolishly for free
all the women who want to sin and not be accountable
the supreme court overturned a universal fake unconstitutional right to kill a child that hasnt fully gestated and left it to the states 8 of which now have banned killing babies at any stage isnt it great it is and you should be happy and not slant your titles to call it anything else than what it is its not her body therefore its not her choice
for anyone thats unsure about this issue please think about this what about the babies that are fertilized in the fallopian tube instead of the womb thats fatal for baby and mother or what if a mother has a miscarriage and its incomplete and she needs an abortion to remove the rest so she doesnt die from infection it doesnt matter that its uncomfortable to talk about a woman should have the right to lifesaving medical treatment and sometimes abortion is that treatment imagine being a doctor and knowing this and being told that youre not allowed to save your patients life because other people decided for her that its immoral none of that has ever occurred to most voters yet the lives of women are now in the hands of ignorant people it could happen to any woman i hope that the people who decided this for us eventually feel shame for what they did to all those women who died because they forgot abnormal pregnancies happen and there wasnt proper treatment to save them
go somewhere else then if you want to kill babies
proabortionists never actually address the concerns of prolife activists in their arguments saying my body my choice will inevitably fall on deaf ears because prolife activists fundamentally believe that its the fetuss body they are trying so valiantly to shove a square peg into a round hole
they stripped away my rights to take a vaccine which is giving my heart  problems i swear after the vaccine my heart is not normal
"how abortion was sold to the public
"
its not there body
cartel has a right to muder inocent lives no different than abortion
get ready britain its coming to you the fascists and corporations dressed in dark money groups are here
i guess women would rather have 9 judges in black robes tell them when and if they can have an abortion and what they can and cant do with their own bodies instead of putting it back to the states where they can actually have a say in it they would rather have the federal government tell them what they can and cant do with their own bodies and have no say in it whatsoever regardless of who it is the government is going to be telling them what they can and cant do with their bodies i guess they would rather have no say in it at all
i think abortions should be legal so there are no more pro life mfs left
expanding the right to human life from conception is an expansion of freedom lady
channel 4 news is trash i only watch this video to hear the good news of the end for roe v wade
this truly was a great moment for america its so rare for good truth and common sense to prevail in this day  age personally i celebrated  rejoiced in my spirit over roe vs wade being overturned  abortion for one is not a constitutional right im tired of women claiming their body their choice that is not a valid argument women need to practice responsibility in their personal lives and avoid pregnancy like a responsible adult instead of using abortion as a catchall  eraser thats not how life works if you as an adult choose to be intimate  become pregnant that is now your responsibility you dont get to slaughter the innocent soul now attached to your body simply for convenience by liberal logic i as a man should be able to abort my responsibilities as a father should i get a woman pregnant and she carry it to term by their logic men can say my body my choice i dont want to be a father to my seed shes on her own but they only use logic when its convenient and liberal women especially hold men to ridiculous double standards then to claim infant health will also be affected by this decision as if the infants well being has ever been a priority to a pro abortionist is an other example of them using emotional vomit in place of facts rational arguments and empirical evidence if theyre so concerned about infants then they should be appalled that almost 70000000 innocent human beings were murdered in their mothers womb a place that was once the safest place in the world for a child  there is no logical scientific or moral argument for abortion i hope this country stays on the right track

that for the sins of a people god may suffer the best government to be corrupted or entirely dissolved and that nothing but a general reformation can give ground to hope that the public happiness will be restored  the kingdom of israel was brought to destruction because its iniquities were full  because there remained no hope of reformation their government degenerated in proportion as their vices increased till few faithful men were left in any public offices  at length when they were delivered up for seventy years into the hands of the king of babylon scarcely any remains of their original excellent civil polity appeared among them  when a government is in its prime  virtue prevails  every thing is managed with justice prudence and frugality  but vice will increase with the riches and glory of an empire and this gradually tends to corrupt the constitution and in time bring on its dissolution this may be considered not only as the natural effect of vice but a righteous judgment of heaven especially upon a nation which has been favored with the blessing of religion and liberty and is guilty of unde
i think this is hilarious
we should all be against anything bad that happens with any human remains what was done to us here is wrong
this isnt reported as news first of all it was never constitutional this is an opinion piece
the problem with journalism today theyre all activist not a news reporter among them
"why dont we ever talk about what this procedure does to women
its incredibly damaging to a womans body mind and soul
idk any women who arent emotionally damaged after having one 
addict1on depression se1f harm being unable to have children instability and on and on
do you know who doesnt suffer from any of this 
men 
we always debate whether its a baby or a clump or cells but i dont ever hear what is done to educate and help women from the damage this leaves emotionally and spiritually"
honestly reading many of the comments makes me feel like there isnt much hope for the future why do these antiabortion people want to criminalize and take away womens right to choose how they live their own lives so badly its hard to believe that many of the antichoice activists and supporters have mothers sisters dauthers or even more unbelievably are women themselves what is the next step criminalizing women for every time they dont get pregnant because tecnically the egg is an unborn baby
 im absolutely terrified im so terrified your terrified about not having the ability to kill an innocent child we have bigger things to be terrified about
why do some people think its ok to kill an innocent child like seriously thats not just a fertilized egg when the sperm and egg come together it becomes a human i dont agree that if you get pregnant in any circumstance you can just kill that baby because its your body that baby has its own body when the man and woman do it they know the risk yes sometimes a baby gets conceived from a horrible situation like rape but that dose not mean the baby will grow up to be bad person also you can give the child up for adoption everyone deserves a chance at life even if its an unborn baby
congratulations america has successfully created a new category of criminals  like we need more criminals than we already have
up next lets reconsider interracial marriage since its the 1960s again
"these people are cheering like theyre team just won a game

what they havent comprehended yet is they have dropped the first domino to take away other rights for both men and women and all working class people   but not the wealthy few

happy and joyful dumb idiots"
seeing the emotion in the womens voices made me cry
nobody would want to impregnate tge majority of those effers
man its so sick seing these pro choice women crying because they cant kill a baby it almost comical most of the pro choicers look like they dont even like men anyway 
i wonder what those prochoice women trump supporters are thinking of him now  can someone interview them

wow no more so what youre saying is
you dont have the right to murder somebody simple
im so sad for anyone with a uterus i fear what this terrible country is becoming land of the free if you are a straight white cis christian born in america man
they try to make it seem like most women want more abortions when the reality is its mostly men that want abortions to not have the responsibility of being a dad
"i like how they say my body my choice yet fail to use the required steps to prevent accidentally creating life while sleeping around
its just mind boggling how they think after being promiscuous and lustful then getting pregnant that abortion its the best solution
imo make condoms more accessible than they are give extensive sexual ed for teenagers and adults and those who think they are better than everybody else and screw around like a bunch of rabbits then thats their problem"
"what you should be protesting is bill 14067 section 4 biden bucks
will take away cash and the government will turn off your digital currency whenever they want
this abortion issue is a distraction from that
wake up"
"hold up this doesnt technically outlaw abortion this technically just means that abortion will not be defended or illegalized by the supreme court the supreme court simply ruled that it was not their decision and should be up to each individual state

abortion rights are not illegal yet unless your state gov says so"
im so happy it was overturned hopefully people understand how wrong abortion is now
when will people shut up about this stupid law all it does is shift the law from a federal level to a state level thats no reason for sjws to start rioting and acting like literal cultists

god has no favorites among men a person who lies on a test in school is just as guilty as hitler was when he mass murdered millions of people
however i would not kill anyone who attempts this demonic procedure because that would be murder as well just know this your children will raise from the dead on the last day and testify against you before the throne of god"

why are women happy about their right being taken away thats like me having a party when my right to a gay marriage gets taken awaywhich will probably happen at this rate
tired of all these manboys shouting theyre not ready to be fathers but want to play house vasectomies for all that would eliminate the need for 90 of the need for abortions fact
literally the entire issue baffles me first why would you get yourself in the position of needing an abortion besides the less than 05 of rapes most heathens killing there children are healthy 20 yr olds who act irresponsibly are self entitled have blue hair dont value life or dont know who the father is because there riding the pony express well past common sense while i have had my wild years it was rarely an issue that i got the ho pregnant and didnt know what to do i knew the gun was loaded so when i fired away my aim never hit bullseye why because i wasnt always ready myself but would have never wanted the female to torture the baby to death after seeing abortion survivors on youtube i am glad i never felt the need for this procedure to exist
since males are so intent on ending abortion rights and taking away a womans right to privacy and control over her own body i say take all these newborns to their daddies to care for and feed
i am glad the fathers have the rights to stop the woman from killing his unborn child  thank you president trump and president ronald reagan for appointed those judge to the supreme court 
imagine breaking down in tears and going into a fury of rage because you cant kill babies
love how its a very non american woman doing the voiceover talking about the american government
let those babies grow stop abortion rights if you lived why cant others live as well its not there fault you didnt use anything for protection girls first open there legs without thinking the consequences then they end up having an abortion no you open the legs because you wanted that to happen now the baby has to grow
i have had a horrible week and i needed a laugh today  thank you silly feminist tell me you know nothing about us politics because your a foreigner without tell me roe vs wade was severely outdated 
not a constitutional right
what are the liberals so upset about i have seen most of bidens appointed people and they cannot even define what a woman is
i remember the first time i worked at grade school this tiny little girl who was missing her two front teeth looked at me and she said hey misthta come here  i went over to her she said let me see your finga i extended it she took her little fingernail and gently dug it into my skin a little and she started laugh and she said say ough ough ough ough like that that was a precious kid i said ough ough ough ough and we were hysterically laughing it was one of the cutest things ive ever seen in my entire life later i covered for the gym teacher we were going to race i said okay kids dont go until i say go i said line up they lined up i said on your mark get set do you like squirrels they said what i said okay okay this time this time they started laughing i said on your mark get set squirrels are so cute arent they they started laughing finally after several goof offs i said go lol kids are beautiful i love kids you mean selfish people you should be ashamed of yourselves youve turned into complete monsters i hate you
a have you ever worked in a grade school with children aw i love those kids aw come on aw they want to go to school la they want a chance to live uh come on uh what are you people doing you should be ashamed of your selfish selves
one of the sides here theoretically could have more people voting and thinking like them in the next generations and its probably not the side that is culling their population
i swear to god some of these people are retarded like anyone who argues for up to 9 months might as well get to choose a few years in too its not murder that was your dna
women selfabort all the time and a lot later than heartbeat it is called miscarriage and it is an aborting of the fetus in fact in the latest scientific studies most women do this many times before a pregnancy takes almost zero women get pregnant on the first go so this change of law has criminalized being a woman go america
i think they should overturn abortions and make it very clear by over turning to legally allow abortions the woman will be sterilized after her abortion you arent ready to have kids now than you wont be later
"what we have to get across to abortionists is the babys body is not the womans body
and the supreme court simply gave the choice back to the people where it always belonged as the left got everybody to believe it was part of the constitution oer the years and it never was part of the constitution"
its still a baby i dont care if you were rapped name me one other crime where we punish the perpetrators child and not the perpetrator whats that there are none you dont have to keep it but you do have to carry it cause its not your body the part you want to kill is the babys body
oh the delicious feminist tears 
you still have the same heart that began beating in your mothers womb houston kat
 the supreme court had gone against the will of the people  she speaks only facts
now that roe v wade has been overturned how are christians going to determine whether their wives have been unfaithful or not
something for your ears 
woman have the choice to motherhood abstinence contraception and adoption what you mean there is no choice  do they want the right to kill unborn defenceless babies 
then stop going around fukg
in my opinion this is just powerful people trying to silence women and take away their rights to their own bodies 
so why dont the dems go with my body my choice when they want us to take the covid19 vaccine note i lost a job over that
roevwade could have been codified into law when the democrats held a supermajority under obama but they didnt
no one can deny that the unborn child is a distinct being that it is human and that it is alive it is unjust therefore to deprive the unborn child of its fundamental right to life on the basis of its age size or condition of dependency

most of use american do not want abortion to be legal when does a life become a life stopabortion
i genuinely believe abortion is wrong i dont really see why thats a controversial opinion
this video is truely abhorrentperhaps the pro life supporters should be charged with impersonating human beings and having grandiose delusions that they have the right to decide what a woman does with her body personally i think they are the ones who should be sterilized so they cant reproduce and  take away any more of our freedoms which the constitution guarantees us

"heres a question why dont women use all these protections to prevent pregnancy oh the responsibility huh get your back blown out and go get an abortion to correct your bad choice
  men do you part as well use protection because these slores will lie and say they are in the pill after you finish with your condom throw it in the toilet and watch it flush if you put it in the trash she will get it out and put it inside her drake incident protect your seed men and dont be stupid"
roughly 3 of the united states population are black women capable of pregnancy yet black women make up 50 of all abortion cases each year unpopular opinion roe v wade being overturn was a major w for the africanamerican community

those people didnt know what they were doing and still dont care they think their way is always the right way no matter what how would you like it if somebody actually took something off the market just because it was too dangerous for that person although it did you good
thank you  jesus for finally  answering our prayer for these unborn babies
my body my choice sure what about vaccines

nobody sees the big picture here this overturn doesnt mean a thing to the supreme court they could care less about abortion this just opened the door for them to start taking away our human rights little by little watch and see

correction on the title they didnt overturn a right because it never was one abortion isnt mentioned in the constitution and it isnt mentioned because our forefathers were god fearing men and they never wouldve allowed abortion it being a constitutional right makes no sense this country was founded on christian values and still is if the scotus did anything they admitted a mistake that roe vs wade was a decision they previous scotus never shouldve made that it should be up to the states to decide what is allowed funny thing these same women wouldnt like the vatican telling them whats allowed but theyre ok with the scotus telling them but yet they scream no one has the right to tell them what they do with their bodies hmmm sounds to me like theyre ok with the scotus so long as they do what they say they seem a little selfish and vigilante to me
i love texas
"assured it wouldnt impact other freedoms
so they acknowledge this is a freedom theyve taken away from women lovely"
they are sacrificing children to moloch its all rebellion rage and arrogance of the evil one repent
"yeshua hamashiach is god in the flesh the son of god the word of god and he died so that you may be presented blameless in the sight of the father and so you may inherit his kingdom the lord yeshua hamashiach is the only way to the father and his kingdom repent of your sins accept him into your life as your lord and savior before its too late every day is not guaranteed 

john 146

smh liberals are destroying this country we call home
those raped children are now dead
"we are all so worried about our rights and lives but who is protecting the liberty and lives of our most precious unborn babies that cant speak for themselves why doesnt the unborn have the right to live
children are a gift from god the bible says in psalm 1273 kjv lo children are an heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward
we kill our unborn gods most sacred creation we pluck it out like its cancer we should be ashamed who gave us the right to play god we dont have that right its a sin so how can it be alright we have no right to kill it is one of the ten great commandments that god said that we must obey the sixth commandment in the bible says in exodus 1213 thou shalt not kill why is that so hard to understand
a mother that has just given birth can be charged with murder if she kills her baby but a doctor can do the same while gods child is safe and sound in the womb they are then called heroes they are not heroes what they are is murders what they do is absolutely a sin in the eyes of our god how can we expect to have gods grace i believe god turned away from the united states when roe versus wade became law
god knows all those children the bible says in jeremiah 15 kjv before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations
this means that god has already given that baby a name
i want to ask all the lawmakers and judges in our country since youve failed to protect the next generation how can we trust you to protect our generation you have the blood of millions of babies on your hands it is the worst genocide in history you will have to answer for your position on abortion when you stand in front of the highest court in existence gods heavenly court i hope you have a good answer because you cant use the i didnt know excuse because you know its wrong
you have been warned
2 corinthians 510 kjv says for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad"
those arent protesters they are far left domestic violent extremists
the court just  return it to the states  so state citizens will vote on abortion limitations  if any  depending on the state this is democracy california should not tell texas what to do any more than texas telling california what to do
this is insane there has never been at any point in the history of this nation at any point in the constitution or bill of rights that says women can abortion human fetuses
taking control away from women shame on them
i want you to notice how many white women jews are activists
look into how much these clinics make on the sales of the body parts of the unborn they murder to labs for studies thats on top of the price they charge the mother to murder there unborn cant you see its a business and the mothers are the incubator for the product and that womans rights to be used as a cash cow and incubator for a product they sell 
i would like to see who took the poll
my body my choice what about my choice to not take the covid shots or loose my job i was told i would loose my 16 year career if i didnt comply to joe biden
"it is murder plain and simple would you remove the unborn puppies kittens etc from the mama 
cutting them
dissecting them 
poisoning them 
drowning them
bashing them in their heads 
sound like cruella de ville"
almost 8 billion people on earth
abortion is definitely murder sugar coat it all you want you demoncrats are always up to no good
 is what they advocate liberalism is satanic
their fuckin stupid dude they know what they did
these idiots need to realize that they dont have the right to kill a baby baby if they do maybe it should be legal for us to kill the women who kill babies
i love the future is anti abortion sign when the rest of the first world is looking at us like a bunch of ignorant white trash morons
now all these rich white idiots are gonna go out and expand medicaid and adopt foster kidsright
so im not from america but i just wanted to know what if a minor gets pregnant because she was rapd or if the mother or the child have fatal condition abortion is through and through illegal
lets be civilized killing another human for your own mistakes is not how our future generation should be taught and be normalized into respect all living being and start taking responsibility for our own actions what if your partner killed you because he doesnt want you anymore does that sound like the world you wanna be living into 
"the supreme court did not overturn right to abortion
the supreme court sent the issue of abortion back to where it should have always beenwith the states"
the sad and wrong title  of this video
"america is dead keep fighting guysthe sane ones left who can actually think for themselves without putting god in every fucking sentence before these lunatics turn it into a war zone filled with bibles and guns
also change your countrys name while youre at it its about time we call u the divided states of america"
my friends wife is five and half months pregnant at least she was until a recent ultrasound revealed the babys kidneys hadnt formed properly and there was little to no amniotic fluid the baby did not form lungs and is now a non viable pregnancy you people would rather force her to mourn this baby twice now and again when she delivers a stillborn quit pretending this is about christian beliefs when half the people that support this are the furthest from that
that woman is an idiot she never answered one of those questions
i just see a lot of people who want their clam smashed without consequences and who also dont understand the country they live in way to go public education haha
"trigger alert

i only support aborting woke liberals and feminists "
united states  of afghanistan no women rights lots of guns no global understanding at all see the similarities
"2022 you must deliver that baby
2072 any family with more than 1 child will go to jail

smart make the problem too big to handle then come down on the people by infringing on their rights again for the greater good

control is a nasty thing"
i dont have anything against a women murdering her unborn baby but she doesnt have the right to spend my money to fix her fckups
"i am actually scared of america
i thought that women are allowed to make their own choices
bruh i used to dream about living in america
but as far as i have seen in terms of treating its women poc blacks east asiansi feel as if my country is far better
abortion is also legal here
we may not be as developed as the great america but i actually feel safe here"
roe v wade started because a woman who wanted an abortion didnt have her life threatened by her pregnancy yet most of these pro choice protesters talk about how it saves womens lives you can still get an abortion in pretty much every state if it risks your life
womans rights do not include murder baby killers screaming because they cant kill babies unbelievable the vile creatures
if you crazy leftist want to abort babies because they dont fit in your life dont complain when a man dont pay child support or take care of the kid because it doesnt fit in his plans or he just dont want it dont be hypocrites
the nose on the thumbnail speaks for itself
welcome to gilead
ugliest thumbnail ever 
demons shrieking because they really wanted to have been aborted
the left has pushed the culture wars way too far now the empire strikes back
549 she didnt even answer the question
screw all of you who dont like abortion  i will pay and help any woman get to a legal state and get a abortion
womans right to kill their babies sounds insidious
seeing trans women crying over abortions is crazy ngl
hey get it through your head people abortion is not a state choice but a individual choice based on personal circumstances that differ from person to person if youre not the one to question should i keep a pregnancy to term or abort asap then it is not your place nor the state or any law to decide what america did banning it will just lead to deaths depression poverty trauma and only troubles but i guess thats the goal
im democrat and i support the ruling
"where are all my pro choice people at for my right to choose

legalize safe and convenient suicides
i should have the right not to live amongst you baby murderers"
can someone explain to me like a 5 year old why is abortion good i mean i can understand medically if the doctor determines the mother could die or if it was a miscarriage or something like that but man other than that i find it to be unnatural grotesque cruel and selfish plain evil to summarize none of us should have the right to decide if someone should be born or not we are not god i agree people have the right do whatever they want to their body but a fetus or baby is not an organ or a part of the body its a separate living organism and it has the right to live if the parents dont want him there are always options more sensible than killing
what if adoption was banned 
praying for all the pregnant men
man this is some bullshit reporting right here want to see what fake news looks like you should be ashamed of how pathetic this is
ok so 15 years of illegal abortion and 5 years in prison for raping thats fucked up
if you dont want a baby then stop fucking around
so my question is if theres a rape victim in a hostage situation were shes not able to get a plan b or any such pills to prevent the pregnancy to go for longer  then she finds a way to escape but shes already about 5 months pregnant does she have to keep the baby will you have to let  lets say a 13 yr old hold on to her baby aka rapist father  or is that ok for an abortion
there will be no functioning society without women suddenly men dont exist anymore
cry about it all i can say
w for humanity today boys
keep that same energy when it comes to child support
taking these liberties away   oh no how could they stop people murdering defenceless babies how horrible thank god they did this
is that person in the thumbnail even a woman 
these stupid women who never done anything and will never do anything want to abort john lennon jim morrison kurt cobain jimi hendrix john f kennedy hemingway mozart beethoven einstein davinci shakespeare
all those my body my choice protesters out there yelling  screaming are suffering from what i call small breast syndrome got the short end of the stickgive others the shaft
what has to happen now is a national referendum on what the era was supposed to do in the first place make women equal to men bypass the congress bypass the courts make the era the law of the land by a vote of the people
its not about rights its about whats right
for all of you saying there is no constitutional right to abortion you are right there is no mention of the word abortion in the constitution however the right to privacy which abortion was previously protected under is not explicitly stated in the constitution either it is inferred and this a right that every american holds near and dear just because it is not stated explicitly does not mean it isnt inferred bear in mind this constitution was written in the 1700s
pro tip if u seem to be getting drunk and fucking ppl go on the pill if u support abortion then where u ok with ppl in china doing it if it was a girl
build more prisons parents will kill more babies after they are born stupid fus they probably will abuse them for a year or two an innocent helpless baby will be in danger 
no one think about the baby if a person is not responsible enough to take a birth control pill how in the fu will they be able to take care of a baby there is so much child abusers child porn i dont care about the women i care about the misery abuse and murder after the baby is born dumb mother fucs
there should be a nation wide memorial for all the babies that have killed
it is never a right to kill a baby there is severe mental illness involved in the killing of babies straight up insanity in every sense of the word
ah yes then people ask why does a child have to keep someones baby if she was forced and r
everyone is crying but hey guess what you can still go murder your babies in other states congrats i for one cannot wait for it to be illegal in all 50 states
abortion was never in the constitution or bill of rights the court decided it is left up to the states as it should be
its going to be decided by the states so if you live in a state where abortion is prohibited just go to another state
thank you jesus
mandated forced or compulsory pregnancy contravenes enumerated rights in the constitution namely the 13th amendments prohibition against involuntary servitude and protection of bodily autonomy as well as the 14th amendments defense of privacy and freedom
tyson james hirez and bryson gray rapped about this 
finally 
were so sorry you cant kill babies
all of the people who are upset look mentally off  what does that tell you
"the very same people that were applauding individuals to lose their livelihood over an not wanting to take an experimental vaccine are the same ones that are extremely against roe v wade being overturned 

sucks when the shoe is on the other foot doesnt it"
its correct that there never a right to abortion or a constitutional right to abortion so literally we only made abortion a right because we felt like it and then there is just pure ignorance the overturning of roe v wade only now gave the states the power to set terms of abortion and didnt completely outlaw abortion i mean people should take a history lesson all this commotion is totally unnecessary if we all knew what roe v wade was and what it did
"the ruling that abortion is legal was based on a right to privacy this was a misapplication of the right to privacy your right to privacy does not include the right to plan murder laws are not based on the opinion of the people in the country they are based on the exact wording of each law if every person in the country decided that taxes are bad they would still have to pay taxes until and unless congress repealed the tax law s
    all the court did was say abortion is subject to legislative revue each state can allow or ban abortions or congress can enact laws either for or against abortion
      the real question is why are the current justices right how did all the other supreme court justices get it wrong is the current scotus correct or just religiously biased"
i like how people think the majority opinion matters this isnt a democracy its a republic babies have rights too and it doesnt matter what the majority thinks
amy is such a pick me im one of the boys 
american is filled with cancellablecucks dont matter how much money you have  not the life for me thank you
we need abortion or there is going to be so many single black moms and all those black babies are going to cost the tax payers so much money democrats and the left are correct we need population control
how is this any different than medical marijuana patients who live in states that criminalize marijuana use and possession they usually have to move to california to get the access to the  medicine they need to live
i think when a minor gets raped they should implement law with death penalty for rapists other methods should be castration or injection for infertility for the rapists if the woman is adult she should decide what to do with the rapist s life  since her free will was taken by force from her i think he should no longer have free will if she decides she wants to marry him he should comply with her demands and be forced to work and be a provider for her and the baby
its not in the constitution that you have the right to kill your unborn babies these are some sick feminist who want to be like men now that men want to be women and swim and beat them they get upset more men will become women soon the definition of women will be nothing worthless piece of trash so be it shall it be done said cesar
i say let them fight for their pro choice views it will only make their punishment all the worse
holy bible 5 mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry 6 for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience 7 in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them 8 but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth
26 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature  27 and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which was meet 28 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient holy bible
holy bible 18 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the lord 19 husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them 20 children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord 21 fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged
are you fucktards going to protest muzzles and vaccines i doubt it losers
poor things do not have enough self esteem  to believe they could learn how not to get pregnant a little education goes a long way
meat is murder  oh dang im at the wrong protest 
abort them all
"a fetus has no right to live at moment of conception  very poor logic  planned parenthood donated money to political campaigns  
men should refrain from contributing to creating people  the loss of family and centuries of law 65 million having less is ok  barrier method so an ova and sperm dont get together seems ok"
you have options take the pill the morning after pill  pull out etc
the old abortionist biddy in the green abortion kerchief at 233  wtf is a green abortion you kill the unborn with a solar windmill
wow the reporting is so unbiased
"why are so many people fighting for their rights to kill babies 
im scared for the future"
no one has the right to take another persons life
there never was a constitutional right to abprtion there was a court ruling this is just making it a choice of state legislatures to pass laws
600  609 by the time women usually get abortions the baby literally looks like a fucking a clump of marinara sauce
lollibtards throwing a tantrum again
dont understand how killing unborn girls is good for womens rights
who in their right mind would get these harpies pregnant they dont want just the right to kill their babies they would to kill your baby baby killers
this supreme court ruling is a real relief its great that we the people can undo legalized abortion this is a real victory for the rights of everyone and we celebrate it
its not a freedom its murder people are so blind
love seeing libtards lose their fucking minds abortionismurder
"and if we can accept that a mother can kill her own child how can we tell other people not to kill one another

		 		 

mother teresa"
do we really want these people breeding just saying if their mothers would have aborted them this would be a much better place im a pro choice conservative cause i want less of these people
logically lets look at several things that influence how the law makers decide things the goal for the creation of row v wade decision was to initiate a slow down in the population of the us birth rates reduced now birth rates are so low due to several reasons that its important for the economy and future of the us to have people who can work for the beast look up the stats its obvious it has nothing to do with what you want or what you have control over
good the people of this country side killing a baby is wrong
"there was never a constitutional right to kill a baby
and planned parenthood should be arrested because selling fetus body parts is a federal crime"
most americans are against abortion so they got that wrong
who was knocking up the chick in the thumbnail no one wants to bang a grigotts goblin
america is falling from being a modern developed country and this ruling confirms it for people around the world now any personal liberty can be challenged
abortion is the genocide of the black race in america
people going crazy over babies that are not born but will gladly buy cows milk that strips mothers from babies and happily eat a mother pig who was tortured and had her babies slammed to death against concrete walls to die slow and painful deaths enjoy your bacon and cow milk with all the suffering that comes with it
most people believe this
hope ireland is next to do away with this horrible law so proud of america
"we will make it a crime in all 50 states to murder a baby

 children being killed in classrooms on the daily
 lots of children being neglected in the system
 not imprisoning child abusers
 black innocent children being murdered by police

but hey theyre not babies anymore"
"as always the truth is painful and somewhere in the middle i am old enough to remember deaths from back yard abortions i am also old enough to be disgusted with how many women use abortion numerous times as a form of contraception
as always abuse of any system in place which intentionally was there with good intentions leads to the chaos and hysteria we are now witnessing
is it a good idea to bring unwanted unloved children in the world no
is it right to tear apart a baby limb from limb after the first 12 weeks no
if people were rational reasonable and had some order in their lives these options would not be an issue
i feel sadness for the unwanted unloved children born to ferals 
and i feel sadness for the babies torn to pieces
this world is too cruel and insane for me"
according to the talmud abortion is a right so it becomes a religious freedom these yooden activists really are pushing hard
"feminist  my body my choice
men  my wallet my choice"
finally
make condoms great again
for decades we have relied on unborn child killing to deal with our social ills thats bars
great day in american history
im pro abortion  mom with 4 kids who also herself wasnt aborted and is living huh
if its your body then why arent you women fighting for legal prostitution  countries already allow it its your body
women have a false sense of power in america and this clearly illustrated the power they thought they had
funny how the woman they put in the thumbnail is yuck she doesnt have to worry believe me
a bunch of baby murders and proud you dont want a baby dont do sexual acts that make babies period if a women consented and was all for it why should an innocent life suffer what if your mom aborted you so contradicting too that a lot of those pro choice protest women are moms 
so is the morning after pill still legal then  free in uk or was get from chemist
the hair pulling liberals reveal the depth of their total denial of reality  scotus returned the power to the states considering libtards elected a demented criminal is indicative of their stupidity dementia never gets better fools
that woman on the left is so fill of it
the direction in which usa was going  it would take another 20 years and chinese would open their companies factories in usa 
i am so terrified right now  and i am going to turn my fear into anger and  storm a hospital with my feminist frends and rip apart some white babies
im scared for women in the us im scared for myself that they will do this here too 
hoes mad time to be more conscious of the dudes you bang handmaidens
hahaha harpies screaming because baby murdering got overturned at the federal level
330  you gotta love the unbiased journalism here
im so terrified i cant kill a baby anymoresome whinny liberal or something
117 they messed up the chant
keep your knees together
yo i dont understand i didnt see one woman  on the pro choice side that will ever have to be concerned about getting an abortion anyways id get into the details but just look for yourself no wonder they cant figure out what a woman  is
the way that woman with the brown hair just avoided all their points 
supreme court isnt there to make law its to make sure laws are following the constitition
bidens problems always end in 2 words donald trump
rises are red violets are blue roe vs wade is through through through
roe vs wade got smoked hahaha buncha crybaby bitches usa usa usa
hardcore facts yall are so genuinely shocked because your school did not let you take the harder political classes im sorry they took away your right to education please learn online the constitution
im embarrassed behave of all women that our reaction is getting angry and crying seriously wtf did you all not learn the us constitutionwe wont be seeing any changes of this is your reaction and i see yall posting it on social media guess what it doesnt change anything politics arent emotional looks at the gun laws time to write a constitution written by our genius women come on now
just as you want your right to your body the child has the right to live
oh no you mean we have to live with consequences
"hahah the tide is changing and channel 4 is a bias liberal media source 
liberalism out"
i wanna know how many of you out there crying over a persons right to an abortion have taken the time to help out or adopt at least one of the 34 million children in foster care to date since this ruling none of you ill bet because thats not something you can protest and whine about and it would actually help out a child or teenager in the foster system so you wont do that its not your problem why should you help a child if you cant whine about it the government winds up paying foster parents every month for a child none of you want so dont call this a success for you or the children the foster parents are being paid to take unwanted children in for you so you havent accomplished anything by raising protest signs and marching down streets the children that my wife defends as a casa volunteer are still left in foster care since none of you have done anything to help their becoming part of a real family and someones child a 10 year old child impregnated by her father has no way of supporting a child legally too young to work and provide for that child but thats okay for you i guess after all its not your problem its someone elses problem but youve won not hardly
t     satan speaks to reporters about the decision
i believe in the right to choose trump
you ever notice that the females that protest the loudest are just plain butt ugly
"after all the frauds and double talk
the jist of roe vs wade is the persons right to kill for their own pleasure"
abortion is disgusting
i genuinely dont know if people are happy or sad about this
"i am an american i am a patriot i am  a man of the most high god a christian evangelical die hard american red blooded man i am hispanic american and i say
good job
we choose life over death"
"fact

if you are alive reading this your mother was pro life

period

enjoy it"
dont worry bitches no man wants to smash even drunk
"absolutely false the supreme court does not make laws and the ruling for roe v wade had nothing to do with an abortion because jane roe did not have an abortion they ruled that going into her medical records was a violation of the 4th amendment and create case law
case law is an oxymoron its not law to the public its the law of that case
citing it to get a dismissal does not mean the judge has to do it"
women crying are scandalous lol they like it raw
god gives life once hes the only way to true peace
its messed up how they take away womens right to murder thier unborn babies so sad
one thing i dont understand most people find it terrible when someone simply opens fire on innocent people in a school with a gun he is considered cowardly and disgusting but the difference is that people at school can call for help hide fight back or run away at least you have a chance a baby cant do that is it enough to simply see a baby in the womb as not a human being to legalize murder of him i can imagine that these people are also against the death penalty in people who are guilty but in a child who has done nothing they find it is womens rights
am i missing something all the supreme court did was say its up to each state to decide sort it out yourselves
good women dont have rights to commit murder and you cant call it anything else it is mainly used as a escape from responsibility
i wonder how all of these right wing christian zealots will feel once their daughters who were getting abortions behind their backs will feel once their little angels start turning up pregnant
because in america people value freedom being progun is exactly the same as being prochoice there is an ugly side to both issues  but it boils down to being able to have personal freedom of choice no matter the cost
we all learned in 5th grade that all human life begins at conceptionperiod  no one has any intelligent are able point past this one has to be as smart as a 5th grader
i know a friend who commited suicide when she was 18 because she didnt have that choice and she cant tell her parents because they will either kick her out of her home or will stop her studying and marry her most probably because they were conservative parents and her boyfriend also left her after he knew she is pregnant he was 24 so reality is very different than you think and giving people choice can really save them
"its like taking normandy beach and we will get to berlin 
we will make it a crime in all 50 states to kill a baby"
pro life people should have been aborted
even if roe vs wade wasnt overturned the scotus case of planned parenthood vs casey gave republicans the power to make as many loophole anti abortion laws as they want to where its basically illegal to get one in a republican state
"about 39 years ago i was close to 13 weeks pregnant and had an abortion near the end of the abortion the nurse said oh my god and stared for about a minute then left the room the doctor continued staring for about a minute or two longer i saw they were in shock and knew they watched my baby die my legs were draped so i could not see please read below of the extremely fast speed of fetal development 
heart pumping blood day 21 brain waves day 40 see baby center fetal development week by week
 which states on week 11 the baby can feel if the belly is gently poked on mom is kicking and stretching almost fully developed look at the pictures  the fetus looks like a developed baby i was told at the appointment the fetus was just tissue  the same lie told today despite the advanced technology showing the truth many women do not discover they are pregnant until 6 weeks have already passed  heartbeat and brain waves are present the babys have bodies and rights also murder is not a right
the reality of 1st trimester surgical abortions  dr norman maclean nzom see fetal development milestones 9 weeks from conception  thumb sucking may occur"
good to see the scotus restore some sense to the law f the baby killers
"for now
hey for all women who support prochoice
if u do not want to pay for child support
u do not have yo as long as its legal
get into the white house free card"
aint nobody in this freak show jackasscrat convention getting pregnant anyway for the most part so why dont yall go n protest something like shitty haircuts bc you all got em non breeding demagogues
im glad i wasnt aborted
abortion is murder and it was never a womans right
there was never a constitutional right to abortion
the scotus has decided what religion the us will follow
but it aint a baby its acluster of cells with no memories
remember one month ago these are the same people that didnt know what a woman was and used birthing person
remember when i did not want the shot
rbg also said this bad law wont stand
sorry killing babies was not found in the constitution but owning guns was
if you cry because you cant kill a childyou need to be in a federal prison
if women are so scared of their lives getting ruined because of abortion then get an implant birth control that lasts 5 years you wont get pregnant
their social lives are at risk because of not aborting ridiculous and selfish
"there will be no functioning society without women 
lol there still are many anti abortion women"
women rights to be heard by government get policy to be protected and information to avoid unplanned pregnancy its not moral to  get  pregnant out of plan abort the baby and then claimed it as your moral right  it should be women get protected  and policy in guiding them to become   morally future mothers
50 years of abortion and killing of innocent babies how many babies killed per day per week or the entire time if those babies  were given chance to live american could have millions of  genius people  its not issue to help this kids as americans help other country problems yes abortion can be avoided if women inform how to avoid unwanted pregnancies and men will understand on this aspect you cannot make law  or policy  which means of killing as human being we value each life no matter how ugly and poor that human life is
a win for life
life begins the moment it is conceived life begins to form itself into a child  god is against murder  no one has the right to kill another not even in war 
this once fetus is very happy for my fellow unborn fetuses   yay
crying  oh nonow i cant let men just use me as a cum depository
"you women couldnt tell biden is the pied piper  leading the masses with his plastic appearance deceptively dragging you to an abbys  you had a chance to be saved by the outsider donald trump but you were tricked by the flute of the trap in a suit  trump may be raucous vile and insulting but he has your rights in mind  he believes in human rights he sanctifies them  read between his lines hes standing up for the little person  biden has not lived up to any of his promises he just grins stop supporting muslim arab women rights and gay rights and stand behind your bodys rights  biden is the corporate trickster whose only job is to simulate you into a factory product to produce future soldiers to fight abroad   why do you think they want so many babies born  trump doesnt want to fight eats he wants to increase the economy and get america out of foreign situations of war and occupation  remember he withdrew

trump the outsider is the real genuine person biden the smiling puppet was the trap to suck ugly into losing your rights  biden is perfect smiling clean looking  never judge a book by its cover

arab muslim women in college are probably the culprit benning this anti abortion movement to steal your body from underneath you  remember arab islanics hate human rights so stop standing by them  duh stand up for asian americans instead"
very simple a baby is a human being whether in the womb or out the womb abortion is a code word for baby murder and its disgusting most women actually have severe mental health disorders from killing their baby because of the dreadful decision they have made
womens rights is not getting stripped away by this decision  please look at the real enemy  transgender competing in womens sport  that scares me  the lack of common sense in this country scares me
great video we really have returned to medieval england
some of these shouldnt worry about abortions  no sane person would sleep with them
i feel sorry for your country and your all just twisting and moulding your amendments to fit the monthly narratives  your country is a mess
this report is such a joke the supreme court is not there to protect civil liberties its purpose is to ensure laws passed are constitutional more propaganda
oh yea lets protest bc we have lust
making abortions illegal doesnt stop abortionsit just makes them unsafe womens rights over their bodies should never be questioned this is terrifying
thats what yall get lol it turned on all yall low key racists women and supposedly non racist women all yall who voted for him yall thought he had yall back nope  i dont feel bad and i wont be standing with yall on this
is it just me or is the pro life representitive jusr pouring water there i just can t understand her argumentation it s empty drivle she cant  even deffend her opinion in an argument then how can she stand behinde it
if you go into a pharmacy and ask for a plan b pill guess what you can buy one for around 20 and the best part of this is you dont need a fuckin prescriptionwhooooo
ex leftist from texas here no applause please youll embarrass me pro abortion women are skanks with that notsofreshfeeling and the men are womanizers im sorry i mean birthing people izer nizers good times blackmailed biden to the shuffle board away
i guess the festering part isnt referring to democrats
just remember that we warned all those people who either didnt vote or voted for the rebublic that it would destroy the usa you understand that this was donald trump you chose donald trump blame all those morons who voted for trump and helped this happen
this news sucks yea all yall are pro life until u have an unplanned pregnancy dont get all happy when u know youd be terrified if u had to have a baby u cannot take care of
god forbid those who wanted it to be illegal go trough a situation where they got themselves into and cant get out  so many situations that can happen and unfortunately the help wont be there shame
let me get this straight so the media calls people activists when its convenient and fits the narrative right and the supreme court just gave the states back their individual lawmaking capability correct so people in california are protesting and throwing temper tantrums because other states dont want to do what nazifornia wants to do and they are upset because they feel their personal freedom is being taken away  which its not in california so they think its ok to take away my personal freedom to drive on the expressway without being impeded or are liberals so driven by their emotions they cant understand logic or are they so open minded their brains are falling out of their heads so they cant process facts and laws for anyone proabortionmurder have you considered how fortunate you are that your mom had different beliefs than you otherwise you wouldnt be here to harass others who might actually have similar beliefs as you and throw temper tantrums and complain mother teresa said i will never attend an antiwar rally if you have a peace rally invite me she understood the difference in what is in the hearts of protestors pure anger and evil bye felicia
cry harder demons life wins
we stay smoking on that roe pack 
448 99 years is crazy lol imagine millions of women in prison 
this is very funny lol your asking to have the right to kill a baby 
and yet women get pissed about rights or choice yet men have no choice but all financial responsibilitymen have no rights now you know how men feelhows it feel ladies suxs doesnt it men should have right to financial abortion equality rightor is it only equality when it benefits women
im sorry but to have abortions when most countries arent having enough babies to replace their own populations seems insane its not a human right to kill babies  thats insane
women are outraged then again its mostly women that are in favour in the video lol
 thank you jesús for this victory
this dude is confusing rights with privileges
"anyone ever read the publicly available roe v wade ruling 
left leaning people seem to think that theyre not allowed to have an abortion any more fucking idiots"
in 2020 over 6100000 babies were born in the us  of the millions of women who gave birth successfully about 861 died in childbirth  so the for the mothers health stat is verrrry low  source cdc
people who are happy about other people being forced to birth a child they dont want could kill them and will ruin their bodylives are evil they like to hide behind their religion they just want to control women like cattle i will not breed for you if you want kids have them dont force others to
it is disheartening to see how people are vocal about having a right to kill a human being who is unborn their rights demand tearing off a living heart by ruthlessness of forceps in a place where it should have been its safest place those sissy tears of promurderers should meet the real tragedies of life that brings those genuine droplets
are the new born children not americans with rights
the women are pissed firstly you are murderers and not women understand that
"unfortunately the new republican supreme court are doing their damnedest to destroy this country  
if thinking about how many shootings and mass killings of innocent people we have had bothers you then just wait 
from the date of the supreme courts irresponsible ruling of roe v wade 
in as little as 8 to 10 years youth gun violence  will have increased 10 fold     no one will be safe  i dread to think about the impact this irresponsible decision will have on society  especially in a country that lacks necessary and even the most basic and common sense laws when it comes to gun control  
guns are too easy to obtain anyone can get one 
yet a womens autonomy is no longer her own the right to choose whats best for ones own self will now be decided by the state in which she resides wtf
bringing another life into this world is now chosen by state laws that vary state to state 
   due to the huge number of unwanted pregnancies that so many women with be forced to birth 
  its going to be huge
and the majority of these children will be born into poverty  
  take into account the statistics and the number of children that are currently neglected and suffer some kind of abuse  in america
 then try to imagine the huge increase in that number and imagine how many children will be neglected  and or abused be it mentally physically or sexually one year from now 
  the increase in the number of children effected will start to become noticeable  literally one year from now
 it makes me sick and incredibly sad that the crime rate and mortality rate will continue to increase in america due to the lack of gun control laws
 in addition to that  we will start to see the crime rate and mortality rate  increase greatly in less then 6 months time among american women  due to stress  panic hopelessness and pure desperation  
  everything has a cause  effect
 these are just some of the devastating effects that are to come 
all caused by the supreme courts decision to taking away a womens lawful right to choose whats best for herself"
if they want to kill a child they should also be charged with murder 
if yes to abortion no to child support that will be equal rights  if she has a child without the mans agreement no child support and thats the equal rights
watching ugly women cry about not being able to kill babies is def a new low
wow americans seriously need to change their constitution or else anything that wasnt in the sphere of public life in 1776 gets to be seen as anticonstitutional haha losers vote trump again see what happens this time
im not strong either way but the reaction on the left leads me to celebrate this ruling with extreme vigor  cry more left wing nut jobs it motivates me even more to vote red and encourage those around to do likewise 
it took nothing awaysupreme court just said states have the exclusive right to decide if its legal or not
thats cool look heres a donut 
"ah the united states once the envy of the west alas no more

the bible belt has taken over"
woman are more educated live longer work easier jobs commit suicide less they have it easy
the skanky woman are pissed
abortion shouldnt be what liberates women while promoting sexual immorality
plain and simple solution  keep your legs closed
republicans kill you on the front end democrats kill you on the background 20000000 black babies
not really 1970 was worst for some
selfish
once the male and female cells fuse its already an independent being
both sides a sea of fools
i cant lie i love to see these feminist crying also this news channel is trash
"contrary to popular opinion the vast majority of women who get abortions dont do so because of rape incest or the possibility of passing on a deadly disease to the child

here are some examples of the main reasons women get abortions

1 i had a abortion because the baby father dont want me no more 

2 i had a abortion because the baby father is not financially stable

3 i had a abortion because i found out the baby father has other kids and i wanted to be the first babymama 

4 i had a abortion because he is married with a whole other 

5 i had a abortion because i got too many kids already 

6 i had a abortion because my parents say they not gonna help me raise my child

7 i had a abortion because the baby father hurt me so in turn i killed his baby 

8 i had a abortion because i dont know who the baby father is 

9 i had a abortion because i dont want to be tied down with a child

10 i had a abortion a few times already and im not keeping no child if the father not gonna help take care of it

these women constantly screaming my body my choice but judging from these examples they not not making very good choices so its due time someone take the responsibility of having some checks and balances on this irresponsible and reckless behavior"
where is this socalled right in the constitution
if i cant kill them  i just wont have them
"make sure if you get arrested to take it to trial only 7 of criminal cases go to trial if everyone goes to trial it screws the system that should prevent these people from getting too crazy with arrests important do not waive your rights to a 90 day speedy trial

along with that make sure to record everything and livestream when possible if you dont want to be recorded wear a mask 

also green laser pointers that spread out are only 10 bucks free shipping when they use tear gas and rubber bullets like they did in los angeles and arizona"
so now our foster care and orphanages are gonna be crowded with more families in poverty more single mothers in need and many deaths from athome abortions nice going supreme court whos going to support all these new lives the states not to mention if a woman has an ectopic pregnancy do we just leave the woman to die because her only option is abortion to live rape victims need i say more no one gets to control other peoples bodies and you definitely do not have the right to force a woman to go through with a pregnancy she is not ready for or wants the right to privacy extends to personal items well my body is my most personal item and the government has no right to infringe on it
"fyi for all these room temperature iqd liberals making fools of themselves per usual
as long as you continue to reside in your high crime high homeless democrat managed crappers abortion isnt going anywhere  but ya might want rethink any possible moves to the greener pastures of arizona florida  texasor anywhere else for that matter"
"who would have thought america in some states would go backwards 50yrs  take away civil rights from a women to have the choice about her own body  life
without medical intervention a premature baby wouldnt usually survive without medical intervention a woman who cant get pregnant wouldnt become a mother without medical intervention after a miscarriage a woman might die from poisoning its ludicrous in this day  age to deny medical help for terminating a unwanted pregnancy
most unplanned pregnancies the woman has the baby termination is a difficult decision but it needs to be a womens right
best thing to do is get a termination within a state where its legal  in those states that its not legal a ongoing go fund me could be set up for disadvantaged woman to pay for fares  accomodation
dont let the rats that use religion to take a womans rights away some priests have been known to impregnate nuns the church gives her the choice to either have the baby or they organise the abortion  the nun can continue with her vocation"
these protests never solve anything
"dont like abortion
then dont kill your baby"
i think its up to the baby to decide if it wants to be aborted at least wait for baby to grow up then ask if he or she wanted to be killed
look at all the skank ss bitches complaining that they cannot murder an infant thats pretty sick
look at history satan has been throwing ideas into the minds of powerful people for children to be killed since years before christ and after children were sacrificed to idols and it seems that to this day he throws this devilish idea into the minds of many people
what is a woman 
the bootlickers suprised the boot is now firmly on their throats they were acting as cheerleaders during covid for mandatorycoerced vax now theyre suprised they are the ones being treated like livestock funny and sad in equal measure
it seems the left is so passionate about killing the unborn these days sickening
glad they stopped these baby killers at last
helping moms where since when they are the main group of people to shame single mothers struggling families etc 
another summer of mostly peaceful riotsi meanprotestsyay
pro choicers never protest a mans right to choose go figure
that 1k6k ratio give me a lil bit of joy
abortion is not a constitutional right
half of these women identify as men loll
men can have abortions
this also takes away medical privacy
i get sad when i see women happy about this and sick when i see the men you dont get to say what happens with my body a separation of state and church that is what our country is built on
roe vs wade god please dont lead the way
jesus christ not even trying to hide your bias here channel 4
"the reporter says the tribunal took away the constitutional right to abortion
it was overturned bc its not on the constitution how are these ppl supposed to be journalists dont they feel disgusted w themselvs lying like that"
well pro choice can sit in jail and prison if they want to abort a baby
im so happy that these sluts are angry yay
yay im so happy
60 of abortions are white women
remember when the vax was not ur body and choice
"for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved romans 1013
he that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy proverbs 2813
have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions wash me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest psalms 5114"
remember when you satanists said trump was dumb hang tight 
the notion that abortion is a constitutional right is patently absurd being born is a constitutional right because the constitution clearly states everyone has the right to pursue liberty and happiness being aborted pretty much exempts that now doesnt it
where were all these women when governments were making covid vaccines mandatory and they just went along with it my body my choice 
new jersey is pro choice supporting abortion since the  1940s come to nj all those who need reproductive freedom
i hope all the anti choice women get unplanned pregnancies and the pro life men have unplanned pregnancies lets see what choice they make behind closed doors
love how they make it female vs male when there is towns of women who support abortion also funny how quickly they remembered what a woman actually is haha
i love watching ugly feminists have a meltdown  and baby killers too
thatll put a halt to their gallop 
"dr  levatino performed  over 1200 abortions listen to his description of the procedure  pro abortionists im not calling you with that cute name pro choice listen hard
"
less murdered kids a good thing 100 of the time disagree move to an island of supervillains
"yeah take that women who get raped
now you must keep that baby how dare you want to have an abortion"
now theyll have less rights than before serves ya right
conservatives want live babies so they can train them to be dead soldiers  george carlin about prolife conservatives
if you step back for a moment and look at this it seems pretty gruesome people crying and angry because they can no longer kill a baby in any state they choose  of course there are states which welcome you to go and kill your baby in their state  i read that many large corporations will pay your travel expenses to a kill state for an abortion  unless a person was raped or something horrific like that if we choose to not be responsible in the use of contraceptives and consent to being with a partner which turns into pregnancy then buck up and be responsible on what your next step will be  stop blaming the supreme court for their decision  they made a responsible decision  your turn to make a responsible decision in your life  i am a proponent of choice  its my body and i will do whatever i want to my body including getting a covid shot or not  do not separate these things its all about my body my choice  however in my opinion people protesting etc is stupid  you can still kill a baby in your womb if you made a dumb mistake just go to the states who will facilitate this for you
425 why ask a bald guy about abortion why are men involved in abortion issues none or you morons get it both the left and right are just idiots
there is no such thing as a woman or man we are all beep bob boop i am a bip boop boop boop bop respect me
"can avoid the madness if only you 
 did not get drunk then get fooked

do not lose control thy self"
killing babies is not a right  what an idiot   for many years slavery was legal didnt make it correct
thumbnail is so funny
how is having an abortion is a right so you telling me its ok too kill a baby wow
they want to bring a theocracy to the us  its insane and they want the orange pos trump as their leader  frightening
all these people gonna go back to work the next day and this will all be forgotten
i just came to watch ugly women cry over something theyll never have to worry about 
i hope this will happens in all latin america i mean the end of ab0rti0n
once you know youre pregnant its already a human being a month old fœtus is human being im sorry to say that getting rid of him no matter how you put it its murder  theyre actually fighting to have the right to murder or keep their babies  this is sickening  there are always mitigating circumstances  like if a doctor can establish that the mothers life is at stake  but even in that case  of the baby has a chance to live some women would rather die and give the baby a chance to live   when i was a kid i learned woman was synonymous to love and tenderness  these senseless reactions just break my heart
we are dancing on the grave of roe v wade what a chad
106 to 127 no one cares there should be no right to kill a baby u it so dumb and god say it murder to kill and look what u are doing what the heck this is a great day for the us no more abortion
no more organ harvesting blood sacrifice or child killing sorry satanic cabal times up
are there so many billie jean in usa
look at how evil and sinister these pro choice people are they seem bloodthirsty the genius move of donald trump has got to be respected
as a previously unborn fetus it is hard to be outraged
hiring someone to kill your children should be very illegal because its illegal for anyone elseyour child isnt a choice at all you had a right to create the child and you did itdo you want to legalize killing a human being because of the inconvenience of your actions if so will we next target the disabled
they should only make abortion legal for transwomen 
for all those baby killhas out there just keep yall legs closed problem solved
yay its illegal too kill undeveloped humans
the choice to kill babies is devil
there never was a constitutional right to begin with thankfully the adults are now in charge of the court
"the court has over ruled  opinion 75 of the american public  abortion is a fundamental right  for women theres gonna be a huge network of  people who will  take women to  pro choice states  we will fight and  we will  object to  this ruling   this woman is spewing bs with no care for the  health and welfare of women  women will die  without abortion care they will die for what most religions dont consider a life worthy of funeral services 
this horrible woman thinks he values feelings and religious thought need  out rule legally those of all other women"
such misinformed individuals to the point were they are being manipulated into thinking and acting in this way abortion kills a million babies a year which is insane to me before all of you liberals come at me most abortions occur because of the womans choice and not for a valid reason like assault or the womans life being in danger
dude im prolife and choice pro life with myself and partner and pro choice for everyone else im religious but at the same time how am i suppose to parent everyone else from committing sin its impossible
has anyone else noticed that most if not all of the crazy woke freakouts over roe v wade are middle aged white liberal men and middle aged white liberal women from the video footage neither demographic seem capable of scoring a date much less get pregnant
channel 4 news  propaganda machine pretending to news
cultural brainwashing 
64 million babies dead since 1973 the killing babies business has slowed a bit
abortions were never a constitutional right to the idiot woman speaking in this news segment
liberals now migrate to sodom and gamora states leaving free states to prosper amen
channel 4s comment section passed the vibe check  america still has the most liberal abortion laws compared to all of europe  ny and ca you can abort up to birth  its not right
for anyone who doesnt know they where trying to push abortion up to the third trimester basically before the babies are born i dont care about a blob of cells but that is fucked up
the supreme court whose very purpose is to protect civil liberties thats categorically false its also false that the court follows public opinion the scotuss job is to interpret and apply the law to cases before it which it just did smh channel 4 is a joke 
032 this news organization just told a blatant lie to all viewers abortion was never a constitutional right leave it to the british to not know a damn thing about our country
democrats and liberals never disappointhere are your true insurrectionists
send the national guard to some of these cities
anyone see where blantifa assaulted that pastor on the streets in la and got away with it
"hahaha i dont care one way or another about this issue its a female thing and women have always treated me like slime
still its nice to see feminists and their simps running around like a bunch of rabid psychopaths great entertainment"
"all the women standing up for womens rights were not aborted women we dont give half the population the ability to kill the next generation 
thank your mom for not believing in abortion you wouldnt be here if she agreed with you"
dear god how many abortions are these women getting do their vaginas even still function at this point
what an asshole president
these women arent technically women though they are angry entitled shits
as a woman murdering an unborn child is absurd its not a child and its not murder if its smaller than a heart and doesnt even have a heartbeat yet what if someone with a uterus is raped without the right to abortion she would be stuck with her rapists child but just because abortion can be made illegal now doesnt mean that people will stop having abortions they would just stop having safe abortions i have another question if a 16 year old is raped and cant financially support the child if they want to keep it what are they going to do they know they will not be able to fend for their child without any support or money would the prolifers be there for the mother when the child is born
if woman have the right of abortion then men should have the right to do a financial abortion
"men are necessary 
the world we all live in is build and maintained by men"
i read the constitution and i cant find anything on the right to have a abortion so you might want to print a correction as the report is wrong if youre a reporter facts should take first place or in my mind
no one has freedom to kill either it is a life or it is not determine that line and only then seek a legislation
sheeesh 99 years in prison
i love how the entire narrative is built around the idea that women are destined to have tons of abortions due to letting tons of strangers bust inside them
"im a brit and apparently i know more about the constitution than americans
the constitution says americans have the right to privacy not abortion ffs take responsibility"
there are two rules created in error by our government in its early days that have been a disaster 1 the fillibuster a clerical error in the senate 2 power of judicial review by scotus which was the result of an error in the judicial act of 1789 that allowed marshal to use the marbury vs madison case as an excuse to appropriate the power he wasnt given in the constitution
"wrong it just goes to states to decide many already allow abortions states decidenothing was removed 
why does media lis so much  states rights"
"prolife  lets protect and ensure life to the innocent
prochoice   i am terrified"
what constitutional right  which law
014 yay pro  life supporters celebrating like its 1989
do you want to know what time it is ladies its coat hanger oclock looks like now youre going to have to take accountability for who you spread your legs open for i remember there was a day when a womans virginity was a gift to a man now they just hand the most important thing that they have the gatekeep for and they just handed out like candy
pro lifers shouldve  been aborted
i have no idea why people are so upset about the roe vs wade decision   its not like we outlawed dumpsters
should be a crime punishable by death 
"kicking 
screaming 
crying 

all things an aborted child will never do"
common america l as always
roe v wade was never a constitutional right it was a majority opinion of 7 justices on the supreme court only the legislative branch can make laws the constitution does not give the right to abort
what will hillary clinton eat for breakfast now
prayer is powerful please pray for the people who have demons inside them to ban the demons from their body forever in the name of jesus please pray for all the people to ban all the demons and evil spirits taking over their bodies minds and hearts forever pease pray for them to receive and turn into the holy spirit god and jesus pray for all the lost sheep to return home to jesus their shepherd i pray for them follow me if you want to do a powerful group community prayer live pray also alone daily please

das not a black peoples issue
i feel sorry for anyone that lives in america their laws are so fucked
protests  riots  the big6 media prop a ganda machine spits out  perhaps true in ca  but in the heartland  bible belt we celebrate 49years of oppression for motherhood is overa shortage of rage an abundance of joy in 27 states poised to slam the door shut on a chapter of misery  in our nation 2 chron 714  if if if my people turn from their wicked ways then ill hear from heaven forgive their sin and heal their land jer 2911 he has good  plans for america scotus we thank yall   godwins
whats her name listen to how she talks shes delusional and she sounds like shes in a a occult
man the supreme court is really dirty for this
they do have women out there like an occult mental and stupid and just wired and all the wrong ways that support womens rights being violated and taken away and put into the hands of the sketchy state
"do fetuses have the right to life

the argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong
i will simply assume instead of proving that your murder is seriously wrong
i will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder
finally i will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issues to which this analysis of abortion ethics may lead
the symmetries arising from the analysis of the main arguments on both sides of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult
consider the following standard argument against abortion fetuses are both human and alive people have the right to life
therefore fetuses have the right to life of course women have the right to control their own body but the right to life goes beyond a womans right to control her own body
therefore abortion is wrong
the fetus right to life does not include his right to use someone elses body to preserve his life
however an opponent of abortion may point out that a womans right to use her body does not include her right to end someone elses life in order to do what she wants with her body
in response one might argue that a pregnant womans right to control her body is not much if it is wrong to take any action that ends the life of the fetus within her
however an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus right to life does not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses
the consequence of all these symmetries seems to be a stalemate
but if we have an attitude then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of rights a fetal right to life versus a womans right to control her body
one could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control ones own body in the case of abortion because the loss of ones life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control ones own body a respect for nine months
therefore the right to life prevails over the right to control ones own body and abortion is wrong"
the right to privacy only extended to pregnant women it was never a right it was a ruling
i ask a simple question as a christian and that is why are the majority of christians not pro choice
its not legal to murder someone
a nation destroyed by its enemies can rise againbut the one which crumbles from within thats dead
sodom and gomorrah
so like is that a dude in your thumbnail
i cant believe humans are mad that killing is illegali am for womens rights but not for murder
liberals have been scathing to the justices a little pay back is do them hate fueled wokist
9 months pregnant and its not a problem one
their are too many people in america already it gonna be worst
i remember when the proabortion side was so virulently opposed that they wouldnt even allow a pamphlet to be given to woman that explained abortion and also gave her other options prior to a procedure that was absolutely ridiculous so i dont feel bad for their side right now they refused to meet prolife people anywhere in the middle and even advocated for partial birth abortions
honestly just have your partner wear protection or have a hysterectomy or vasectomy its not that difficult i do think exceptions need to be made for rape incest or when the mothers life is in danger or the baby has major quality of life issues due to medical reasons not financial issues
this is a good change to end all the unjustified murders
stares rights the same propaganda pit forth prior to the civil war  states rights to  own slaves
were these the same polls that said hilary would win in 2016
keep fighting a womans body is hers and hers alone  we are so sad and angry here in australia for you this is just backward and wrong
if white women vote for trump and other republicans again its just more evidence that abortion is not something they want to have as an alternative if they get raped by their twin brother or have a baby with fins not arms
pro choice is the majority opinion of us citizens more than 8 in 10 americans believe abortion should be legal
"when roe v wade was passed in 1973 women had their husband to support them and the children that they created in their marriage so whats wrong with that model
the children will have their biological father and mother as well as their biological grandparents for a lifetime and the cycle repeats for the next generation and because husbands supported their families less people should not be a burden to society in the form of welfare
furthermore marriage is good for every economic class of women especially for poor women"
finally i had a female abort my would be blessed first child  and i offered to raise the baby on my own and had no choice in the situation between her parents and her i think about the would be child all the time im so happy people dont have the right to kill babies honestly what do you people really think it is seriously seriously
the left is evil and truly demonic
"in the guise of equality evil cannot and must not have equality with good 
its not a right nor protection for womens for her pregnancies to be murdered to do so is unnatural it pits women against her unborn baby
abortions are unnatural and perversion like homosexual marriage and adult men marrying little girls  its evil  
murder and sexually immorality cannot and must not have equality with life and purity"
peaceful protests by baby killers
the prolife movement is ready to step up for progressive policies republicans and democrats both dont care about progressive policies this country is ran by corporations the corporations own our politicians youre living in a dream world lady 
welp time to get the tubes tied 
abortion is not a constitutional right get it straight
watching this video enraged me this is so wrong im usually one to believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion but choosing pro life just makes you look like a joke
love seeing them cry
theses comments do not pass the vibe check
i bet half of these pro choice protestors are vegan because they want to save animal life and avoid using plastic for the same reasons yet when it comes to a child  the world has gone bonkers
this british woman reporting is so ignorant its frustrating the supreme court didnt overturn the right to abortion they simply said abortion should have remained a state decision this should have never been involved with the us constitution
killing babies is wrong and immoral
satans minions really make themselves evident when you make it harder for them to kill the unborn im appalled at the ladies who should be old enough to know exactly who margaret sanger was i mean even if youre pro choice after researching that woman youd think more people would be at least thinking ummm maybe we need to revisit this whole planned parenthood thing its kinda the same as the gender fluid stuff where the pioneers were sick men like alfred kinsey and john money if you read about those men and still think this gender fluid ideology is good theres definitely something wrong with you its unfortunate how many people are so easily brainwashed by evil people and terrible ideologies
those who advocate for abortion should stand by their convictions step up and abort themselves problem solved
damn imagine being one of these anti choice women and being brainwashed by the patriarchy  dumb motherfuckers
abortion is a huge sin killing babies  is something they proudly encourage and support if theyre saying its their bodies they cant do what they want then those doctors who are mostly men have the freewill go not perform these abortions too matter of fact any person with morals will not condone this
its a roe vs ease donation link
"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

go shave your eye brows you libtards"
the hoes are indeed quite ornery
whores are mad that they cant murder anymore
cry harder lol
are they all are protesting to kill a baby or save a baby
its easier to spread your legs responsibly than cross the state to get a legal abortion lol
damn the chick narrating  this story doesnt understand at all they couldnt find an american correspondent to make her lines make sense
women should have the right to vote but should they vote gavin mcinnes
liberties are u fuckin stupid this is about killing later term babies
the constitution and supreme court gave all of you the firing arms to fight against tyrrany its your business how to exercise your right
most of these women wouldnt touch a man with a 10ft pole
you put an image of a dude crying over roe v wade on the thumbnail or is that just an average ugly progressive woman lol
taking care of your young whether its inside your body or out is deeply engrained into the brains of almost all mammals for you to take pride and joy in the killing of your young your mind must be so twisted beyond repair
your title is deceiving they didnt overturn the right to abortion they ruled that states will take control over the management
no bias here move along
figures with a filthy chomo in office im sure he wants to populate the us w unwanted kids who will live a life in an abusive broken foster system and group homes
i cant get pregnant anymore but thats bullshit its only going to make them more dangerous making anything illegal never stopped anyone
"psychological issues
need to be resolved 
when someone thinks they have the right to commit any violent act including 
rape murder and
procuring a miscarriage"
applause to justice thomas
wow the women who are pro life are beautiful nice intelligent well spoken and reasonable while the women who are pro murder are  nasty ugly and obnoxious
nobody is gonna tell me what to do with my body its not your body its the babies body
there was never a right given in the constitution  giving women the right to murder children
last time i was this earlyliberals still didnt know what a woman was
"so no mask
thousands of people close contact
i guess covid isnt a thing any more"
people should be allowed to dismember babies and cause deep emotional wounds so men can have their way
thank you god for overturning the murder of babies god is in control
on the basis of which law do legislators and judges believe that they can limit the natural right of every person to selfdetermination they have no legal basis for doing so because the natural right to selfdetermination need not be granted nor can it be denied all cases concerning individual privacy are part of that natural law i have serious doubts about the quality of law schools in the us
the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
so uh dont support women look at lisa rutledge as a leader and allowing sheriffs to profit personally off prisoners do not support women
this news reporter is so biased its unbelievable the number of inaccurate statements about our laws was incredible abortion is not a constitutional right
"why cant you claim an unborn child on your taxes
the law is you have to wait to see if your child is born alive"
can anybody tell me whats the positive side on antiabortion  i mean is there a merit on banning abortion  coz i cant think of anything good on banning abortion
dont support women look at lisa rutledge as a leader and allowing sheriffs to profit personally off prisoners do not support women
its interesting how crazy these people act yet the pro life people are so calm and nice pro abortionist act like lunatics just by common sense alone id rather be with the normal people then the crazy left
some of the convulsions of screaming and crying by these people who are upset should be reminded that if an unborn baby whose about to be aborted could scream they would both sound similar
my god the yanks are so dramatic
last wed 62222 i was touched by god to pray for overturning roe v wade or abortion by us supreme court and two or three weeks before with ps ruben and our church during prayer meeting  praise god for the victory    that is why the more you come against god for being wild the more you would lose  do not wrestle with the most high god the two young women protesters at lakewood church should have never despised gods churches his bible and his prophetic voice and word  if i were joel i would rebuke them harshly to stop them  god has sovereignty and power above all   it is no joke i am a major prophet of god i saw the harsh judgment of god towards the rebellious and prideful people after the grace period  abortion is an abomination to god romans 1 it is murdering  it means you both brought gods wrath on yourselves  very dangerous situation  stop  you women are foolish  god created them their bodies belong to jesus not them   i am here to warn and protect you abortionists and protestors from going to lakewood church to protest again but the lake of fire  got it  that is love of god to tell you all truth  when you do not know something and the negative consequences of it  keep quiet and be humbly pray  that is my advice  call on jesus our final judge  he may forgive you
"its a sad reflection on humanity to see such a pathetic rabble get so upset about the killing of unborn children 

but then perhaps this is what we should expect after decades of trendy education media brainwashing poisoned water and food

as for these so called journalists i dont know how they sleep at night"
pro lifers are worse than the taliban they hate real freedom and women pure evil
the reporter is an evil clown liar she is a demon
its not a constitutional right to kill a human all these angry people are alive killers its not a womans right to kill mass murder
"are americans dumb if we completely ignore the discrimination against womens rights and only focus on the childs aspect this is still a catastrophe many of these children will be the result of incest or rape or even rape against a minor who do you think is going to love these children most of them will end up in foster care and we all know what thats like in the us plenty of physical abuse sexual abuse and so on not everywhere of course but its overwhelmingly common the mothers who decide to keep and love them will probably struggle with trauma and have a hard time taking care of their children people who have grown up with parents struggling with mental health know it can have huge consequences on their own mental wellbeing 

then we have the children who are the results of a faulty condom or two young people not being informed about protection they might grow up with parents who love them above all in most cases though the father wont be present considering most women opting for abortion are single in addition its very likely that the mother wont be able to provide for her child since she didnt even have the money to travel to another state for an abortion in other words the child will have a pretty rough childhood 

but hey as long as the child survives birth it doesnt really matter if they suffer the rest of their lives right 

i hope all of you who are prolife are ready to open your wallets hearts and homes for all the children you have forced into the world"
y dont all these abortion protesters go out and  march against  the b i d e n government
all these women anti abort what if they get raped and dont want the baby anymore shame

leftism is a mental illness
im 100 prolife theres been a good effort to support women who have chosen life but now more than ever we need to do better we need to make adoption more affordable we need to do a sweep of the foster care system we need to make sure that mothers and fathers who choose to keep their children have the resources they need to raise those children free school lunches example small example now is the time that we stand up and show what it means to really be pro life lets let them all know were not just probirth but we are prolife in that we are prosafe happy life and we will do everything possible to make sure that that happens for every life
white women freaking outnow deal with it your votes put these white men in power

i wish so bad all those abolish abortions people get handed a flyer announcing yay  every pregnancy will happen now we are raising your taxes several hundred dollars a year to support these unwanted pregnancies happening and also inform them to stay tuned because they will soon be watching underground footage of homemade coat hanger abortions happening throughout the country  yay
i expect all pro lifers to put their money where their mouths are in including the republican justices to support the forced births dont just open your mouths roll the money or cut your genitals
"stop crying and denounce your citizenship
 just stay absent
  go to a different country and then think about starting a family or no"

im pro life glad this happened hook up culture please whats funny is that people cant educate themselves to fully understand what happened government taking their rights um no you stupid bitches theyre have the power back to the states too the people to choose whether abortion will be legal or not abortion is murder and there is so many misleading facts that the left is showing to the usa abortion causes more health problems not birthing a child also abortion doesnt change your financial status there are plenty of resources so idk where theyre getting that they cant im a 26 year old with 4 kids oldest is 8 plus im latino from east la i dont have issues those who want to abort a child just straight up doesnt want the responsibility they cant woman up and admit that they use excuses
proof america evolved from lower order briton  proof of american exceptionalism    typical biased non journalism from england
stfu this reporter needs to go home
you cant get pregnant after that vaccine you all took anyways
unborn lives matter
there are many opinions in this matter all respectable  this is a decision that impacts woman so they are the ones that should have the largest influence in this issue  but there is a small problem we do not even know what a woman is in 2022
why do the nationschannel 4 cnn msnbc etc conspire and the peoples plot in vain the kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the lord and against his anointed saying let us break their chains and throw off their shackles the one enthroned in heaven laughs  the lord scoffs at them he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath saying  i have installed my king in the supreme court
the eyebrows on that monster sheesh
the number one cause of death in pregnant women is homicide usually by the babys father a pregnant woman is two times more likely to die from homicide than hemorrhage or pregnancy induced hypertension i wish someone with medical knowledge had a say in this get ready we are about to see a huge increase in deaths so much for pro life

thank you jesus ban abortion in every state

that so not what justice thomas said he said that these issues need to be decides at the state level  this entire news cast is an absolute lie  every word this assist said is absolutely incorrect
"im terrified lololol im terrified and pissed ahahaha women can be victims and aggressive at the same time

these were the same people that said take a jab or else what a joke

this is why christine blasey ford tried to frame brett stop believing all liars dontbelieveallwomen
our rights are being stripped awayand this is just the beginning gosh that sounds familiar where have i heard that before 
look at all the angry liberals in joke bidumbs america how can we find a way for them to blame trump for this 
wow this news channel really lies the majority of americans did not support roe being upheld the american public agrees with this ruling ie that each state has the right to determine its own laws pertaining to abortion
serious question did the us actually vote on this or was it some people in the court deciding for everyone
reporting like this is why no one trusts the news media
this is on the level of overturning dredd scott and like the overturning of that abomination the overturning of this one isnt the end there is a long road ahead
the abortion industry is not about rights or freedom its about pushing eugenics and profiting from it it has been  about eugenics  from the start and like every institution profit motive is never far away
funny they say my body my rightbut they tried to force me to get the covid 19 vax and said i have no right to refuse the jabs

missouri has banned abortion like you cant ko your unborn baby anymore
i cant sacrifice a baby
i bet all of you white chix who moved to tx  fl are reconsidering moving back to ur blue cesspools now
thats funny i thought men couldnt speak on the issue i guess thats only if you dont agree
you know what doesnt help man for abortion and a woman for antiabortion
but women are protesting against it as well and have been the main advocates what do you call there rights
why is killing a human life a liberty is that not the definition of murder
this has nothing to do with rights  this is about the dismantling of a corrupt and evil system
why are men even speaking on this  or commenting 
if you wanna kill your baby leave my state and dont come back i love this
why silence that wonderful heartbeat  i am so happy about the outcome
121 there will be no function in society without babies and the babies are dead gay community and abortion rights is ending the world for caucasian people tragic and sad gay and abortion rights are human made up theorys that goes against the creation of life

"abortion is not a constitutional right 
misleading media"
if women have a right to opt out of parenthood men should too mybodymychoice mymoneymychoice
the reason the supreme court overruled roe v wade is because they consider abortion as ending the life of a living human being  if that be the case i think the government needs to reconsider the fact that  you cant claim an unborn child on your tax return because the government says its not a person  sorry mr government but you cant have it both ways
the majority dont support abortion
what about the rights of the children 
there is no constitutional right to abortion it leaves the issue with the states more totally biased media
i cant believe people are crying because they cannot kill babies  we are living in the days of noah and the days if lot  people need to turn their hearts to god while grace is present
this is sick i never saw people so angry they cant kill their children
i used to think the bbs was better than american news programming but  i just i have a copy of the constitution right here in front of me please explain where i can find the section about a constitutional right to abortion i mean you said it like 10 times its gotta be in here right
we will make it a crime in all 50 states to kill a baby
this has triggered the fight to a whole new level and we will see countless protests
say what you may about president donald trump but he wasnt dumb after all
the reporters obviously know nothing of our american system courts dont make decisions based on majority rule we are not and never have been a democracy we have god given rights that the government cannot infringe upon abortion is not one of them in fact abortion is murder of another human being with their own dna whose life started at conception according to science
"i wonder if these prolifers will be jumping for joy when america becomes like romania under the communist savior of babies ceausescu

children of the decree ceausescus law that saved millions of babies from the murder of abortion


probably yes since human life loses all value to these people after its born"
"no matter how many chicken bones and lemon juice you use you will not find abortion listed in the bill of rights

the media just keeps telling lies its unbelievable"
bout time we overturned it it was wrong in the first place we need the scotus to rule abortion is murder science backs this or do lefties not like science anymore thats right they despise science with their 374 genders
love the thumbnail keep crying crybaby
"mandated cost of prolife legislation

any state that rules against womens rights to abortion services must provide free maternity healthcare for all its resident pregnant women in all hospitals private or public of their choosing in the state plus five years of mandated support services for the child and mother for daycare food health and pediatric care for the childchildren born in the state 

as the government and the law are being used to deny women these rights so must the government and the law be used to create mandatory oversight to ensure the women are not discriminated against in any hospital based on their minority status in addition there must be comprehensive scrutiny laws enacted in the state to guard any discrimination and hate crime in general

the decision to deny women the rights of their bodily autonomy must be paid for by the states that deny those rights 

drafted 06282022  aob41862"
there was never a constitutional right to abortion
yikes he literally said many women had enjoyed killing their babies satan actually does enjoy it and the sacrifice of children is at the heart if satanism abd always has beengoogle it
these creatures are so hideous why would they ever worry about getting pregnant
its not pro life vs pro choice its pro life vs no choice for the baby and fatherentitled much
thank you president barack obama justice ruth bader ginsburg and senate leader harry reid  the three of you made it possible for roe vs wade to be overturned
learn to keep your legs closed if you dont want a baby its simple when are women gonna learn
"and i am absolutely terrified

"as a woman no one can deprive me of the right to abortion the united states is so bad i feel honored to be a chinese you may not know that the us government slanders china every day and uses the chinese people to slander china the ultimate victims are the american people yes they have been brainwashed come out and see the world marry a loyal conservative and responsible chinese man there are many such men in china the best husband to his wife in the world is a chinese man he buys a house a car and takes care of his children
 mature women only need an honest reliable and loyal husband which can only be understood after experiencing pain
girls come to china you will live like a princess"
now ban riots and protest make that the death penalty
gods is the creator of all thingshe knew us before we were born
abortion is murder praise god they have struck it down

societal decay prayer god you blessed me with being pregnant  i dont want it plus i intend to get an abortion  kill my baby please help me to find resources so i can kill this child because roe v wade was overturned  i feel helpless  hopeless  i believe for you nothing is impossible

"oh

a bunch of women scream and cry because they didnt get their way 100 anymore

color me surprised"
it is okay if women are denied abortion they can now give a nice gift to their government they can drink smoke and do drugs during their unwanted pregnancies and abandon their defective babies to be the responsibility of the state which banned them from having an abortion the state may ban abortion but women can still drink and smoke like they are not pregnant and gift the state a baby which is addicted to alcohol nicotine and drugs
these women sure want to be able to sleep around and kill whomever they want glad they were stopped
"im a woman for context  im befuddled as to how theres women literally shrieking shaking  crying because theyll no longer be able to yeet their own offspring 

also where was this energy while this admin wanted to force covid vaccination or else you risked your schooling your job etc the apoplectic brainlets today are the same who wanted people like me fired  ostracized for refusing to be coerced manipulated  jabbed i guess my body my choice is selective  only applies to those wcertain opinions
i dont empathize wthose who wouldnt do it for those like me so cope  seethe"

theres no liberty in killing babys  rights being stripped away  bull  the right to kill a baby  thats called murder
by abolishing abortion they saved all the woman in the world 
"hahaha these reporters are unbelievably dishonest  people are so so sick of the manipulation of truth yet they continue what a clown  
60 million babies have been slaughtered but questioning this constitutional right is going backwardsbeyond understanding"
meanwhile russia is on the brink of causing world war 3 and a nuclear holocausts and the middle east is re arming there are hundreds of millions of slaves in asia today but this is what gets people crying and losing their minds  get a grip with a side of responsibility
yes court protected the unborn child from murderer and killers
there never was a constitutional right to abortion
the left are truly evil and demonic
it wont last when thousands of kids end up in care which will cost a fortune for the government and the dollar will drop dramatically
its illegal in sc now lol make you cunts responsible for the babies help create
why are they cryinglolits easy just close your legs and make better choices
my body my right what about vaccine mandates  welll eeeerrrrr
taking away rights of women more like giving rights to babies who are too innocent and helpless to speak for themselves
if fauci bill gates justin trudeau and boris johnson together with their cohorts were foetuses i  would be pro abortion in fact i would be prepared to carry out the procedures myself as they are not i dont hallelujah the prolife lobby amen 
"the dangerous part is the medias roll in this its the states right to decide it puts the power back to the states 
in many cases ive seen is abortions after 6 weeks will be illegal in many states not illegal across the board as the media wants you to believe 
also having members of congress here is a violation of their oath of office because you dont like the decision doesnt mean you protest the action as maxine waters and others have done"
ive never seen someone cry because they cant kill any more children
feminists are just screaming prostitutes who should be killed immediately before they kill more children
"onlyfans instagram ticktock twiter  models  and cheating wifes are not longer able to hide their irresponsible acts aborting innocent lives what a shame they cant keep selling their bodies on social media or hide their affairs to their husbands not they have to be very very carefully
we finally coming to sense in earth with what we doing i am happy this has happened "
how about fixing the social ills that have distroyed the family structure first
evil feminists turned the greatest gift in humanity the ability to create life and turned it into a horrific burden on the mother and normalised the indiscriminate killing of babies for contraceptive methods and any criticism is discriminatory regardless
seethe cope sneed
what a shithole country
there is no such thing as the right to kill a baby
abortion should be abolished everwhere it is murder it is evil
this is disgusting to watch
moloch jew in the thumbnail
all the murderers are upset
let the little children come to me for of such the kingdom of heaven is made
apparently the aussie news doesnt know our constitution
my message to stupid women protesting overturning 
yo based black guy
basically it should be difficult to end a pregnancystrange how the left support the opposite ignoring the baby to bes human rights
im surprised that the reporter didnt loose her temper or choose which side shes really professional
democrats have not been this mad since they had to free their slaves
you the man trump
the supreme court went against the will of the people is irrelevant they went with the constitution if they really wanted to go pro life they would have ended it by applying the equal protection clause to the unborn such bias
wonderful news at long last the silent holocaust of 50 million babies has at long last been decisively ended the american lefts culture of death will soon selfdestruct from the inside out 
"abortion is not a constitutional rightits murder

wonder how these people who are for abortions would feel if they were asked  if their mothers had a late term abortion with them  and they were survivors of that abortion  ended up having mental or physical repercussions of that decision their mothers made would feel dont think theyd like it too much if they did have the mental or physical abnormalities to live with for the rest of their lives
i wonder where these people were with their my body my choice when a certain govt mandated medical procedure was being forced on me a few months ago
i love your saying that roe v wade abolishes the right to privacy essentially first of all that right has been established in quite a few court presidents second reasonably if abortion is a right it is so far disconnected from the right to privacy that when i had a college professor who is himself a former democratic candidate for political office and i brought up that roe v wade was decided on that basis he didnt know that it makes no sense whatsoever to say that you have a right to abortion because you have the right to privacy
need to pass more laws in texas that makes it unbearable for these subhumans to live here so theyll leave
wow i really appreciate how the reporter was so unbiased true professionalism
the  democrats have just been handed the midterms if everyone gets out  vote blue  
ive had a revelation suddenly after 70 years im for  abortion because i just realized the people that arent pro abortion and get the majority of abortionsby far are the people i wish didnt exist let them get as many abortions as they want in factspeed it up
so this means if someone rapes me i have to keep their baby wow f u trumptards thats why your supreme court justices passed another law that they and their immediate family can use your tax dollars to provide security detail which they will need 247 ofcourse nice win trumptards
 the democratic party loves to encourage violence theyre pretty much encouraging abortion such a sad party to be in  president bill clinton was the last decent democratic president we had  what happened to the democratic party theyve become angry bitter and encourages violence every chance they get i think its the only way they think they can win  thats why theyre supporters are so angry bitter and violent just saying

"its really simple 
its all and always about race 1st time in america history whites are the minority race and that is what they always feared thats why abortions are illegal in red states and abortions are legal in blue states with minorities this was all planned for obvious reasons thats it"
they arent prolife they are prozygote when women have tubular pregnancies or a zygote dies in the womb etc do they care if that woman dies from not getting life saving surgery thats why in no way are they prolife so quit calling them that

this reporter is big mad shes also not good at hiding her bias terrible journalism
all of these idiots that support abortion should be forced to answer what an actual woman is  a biological woman  bc weve seen time  time again that they cantwont do that
"it is mindboggling to see women crying because they do not have the right to kill their baby

what kind of society do we live in where we make it normal to have the right to kill a newborn inside a mothers womb

were in the 21st century i am so thankful that the law has finally caught up to science"
abortion is murder but i dont care
if liberalscommunists and demoncrats are so interested in democracy and as they always say they are the majority why are they afraid to let democracy work ie let the people vote on it state by state
"if these people would put that much energy into raising their kids the world would be so much better off

"i understand the fetus could be a potential life but as soon as a child is born all care leaves this world how does that make sense

instead of saving a life the mothers it will most likely ruin the life of two the unwanted child and the nonconsenting mother

i see that people write that when a fetus appears the womans body is no longer her own

but it is the foetus is in her body it doesnt own it just by existing
no one should own somebody elses body in any way 

im not a slave to a fetus

i refuse to be"

"i love how they are saying womens rights and choices are being removed

as a woman its my choice to use contraception and not have to rely on an abortion to correct my own irresponsible decisions regarding my body 

there are very few other cases that abortions would even be for"
oh so terrible we cant murder babies anymore by the millions the horror if a womans life is at risk due to the pregnancy then i understand abortion in that case but theres no other compelling argument for it thats actually justifiable
70million babies if they had a voice what would they say this people are evil
"there are many women  crying and completely upset  because they do not know how to prevent unwanted pregnancies the older ones obviously know who is going to take care of those babies
do not get pregnant
on the other hand
 there are specific medical and or medicolegal indications for abortion"

the issue is abusing abortion most are careless and dont tell their guys to wrap their tools or take plan b
"in the same time the court rule in two cases

religious community members talk god and abortion
 
"
im sorry but what about the rights of the unborn they are just as valid as the mothers if you dont bother to use contraception then you cant use abortion as your contraception
and just like that everyone knew what a woman was again
stupid pro lifers  ah well thats the us for you you have to share the space with others whos opinions are different  both a blessing and a curse
"abortion isnt the solution providing care for the baby and the full needs of the mother goes handinhand 

the lefts idea of caring for the life of a woman is by promoting abortion for any reason like this socalled reporter said the rights idea of caring for the life of a woman is by offering baby products mental health counseling childcare adoption resources etc for free via nonprofit life clinics which primarily serve the needs of young impoverished soontobemothers in the inner city

why is that so hard for the left to grasp"
idiot liberal democrats insist on the right to murder children so sick
chanel 4 is straight out biased
"took away the constitutional right to abortion 032

thank god for president trump
not even a semblance of unbiased reporting
killing a baby isnt a constitutional right it goes against everything the constitution stands for
why now something aint right
"dear women dear feminists for your information men have always been in danger to be made a father against their will in those cases there is hardly any personal autonomy left since you have to pay and care for a child although you did not want to

women have benefited from the privilege to be able to undo their mistakesaccidents after the fact whereas men always have only had the option of contraception

also plan b the application of which is only the womans chioce continues to exist

how could it ever have been fair that a potential father has 0 authority in the decision about plan babortion but 50 responsibility for the child how have women been able to infringe mens right of personal autonomy and not care at all for decades but now thes are going nuts because some of them lose one of two undo options 

this now is the perfect example to show that women are extremely privileged regarding the societal empathy they receive where were all the protesters fighting for mens rights of family planninglife planningpersonal autonomy also it shows that women hardly care about or empathise with men like they care aboutempathise with each other they are equally egoistic as men"
lost a beloved grandchild through abortion does it give me rights to overturn abortion certainly not
very biased very very biased
horrible reporting fake news like this is why so many british people have misconceptions about the us
the supreme courts didnt and cant take away anyones rights all the rights you have as americans is in the constitution they are just there to say you cant interpret the constitution in any way to fit your narrative and say its your constitutional right so the supreme court has to do what you demand thats not how it works until you put a bill through the house this might be the trend of america on abortions one moment its a federal law the next its not based on politics the constitution shouldnt be a political game or tool its in there or its not thats it
god is good abortion is not
not a constitutional right fake news
"womens rights womens rights whaaaaaaaaaaa

arent you the same confused mentally ill dumbasses who couldnt even define what a woman is a month ago"

funny how the antichoice idiots think that this will reduce abortion sorry assholes you only made it unsafe in fact if you fools have other conservative views guess what you are going to lose even more when the majority wake up like japans attack on pearl harbor you have awakened a sleeping giant and filled her with a terrible resolve
"to all of you nitpicking democrats  the american taliban did not vote for pennywise because they liked him they held their noses because he said he would give them the power oppress you if you dont do the same you will slowly but surely lose all of your rights wake tfu staying home and pouting about bernie on election day wont stop them

a heartfelt fu to all of you who said that our handmaid references were overthetop paranoid hyperbole apologies accepted if you get 3 or more of your progressive friends registered to vote 

on the plus side this crisis could be used as the impetus to rally enough sane americans to finally end the electoral college andor make the senate reflect the will of the people instead of a radical minority that live in red states these institutions were created solely to get slave states to join the fledgling union any excuse that is made to keep them has now been proven to be outweighed by the negative effects"
yes as a mother i do not think abortion is a way to fix sexual irresponsible actions but the getting  rid of something that yes is the personal choice is absolutely wrong  no one is talking about the background of roe versus wade they  forget about all the back alley abortions  a woman would get when it was not legal and died from or having to carry then give birth to an abusers child or pregnancies the are so unwanted that the child will end up thrown out like trash a found dead or barely alive i remember all the news reports i am a 56 year old woman mother  grandmother wife and daughter a choice is  your own if it doesnt do harm to others yes a fetus will not live but no others have the right to tell no one what they should do  i had an abortion and also chose life
no mention of vasectomies here its only a vasestome not a vasectoyou

"yeaaah except no it doesnt lol

this title is a full blown lie  you can still get abortions each state just have the right choose now jesus christ  lol"
ok so outline me what women are worried about  tell me why you want to protect the right to kill a baby  because you are a junkie and you should not take care of a childhmm well maybe thats your life change you needed  you are too young well maybe you should have thought of that before hand  pregnancy will kill you well that is 00001 percent so if you are that person than ok and also sounds like you should take responsibility for yourself if you knew ahead of time

so wearing a masks or getting the shot should be choice too right that shouldnt  be forced on you to get the jab
chose your character   liberal woman 2 looks 3 strength special move mental gymnastics   conservative woman 3 looks  2 charisma special move based defence
actually women have more rights than men do when it comes to reproductive rights if these feminists are so prochoice then they would be for men being able to financially opt out of an unwanted pregnancy
it was never a right to begin with and the entire thing was pushed through the courts on technicalities the tenth amendment is a right however and its very clear where abortion belongs
prolife women jumping up and down in excitement thinking its just about abortions fucking idiots celebrating their rights being stripped away when their babies miscarriage  and they become felons and go to prison for it maybe they will understand then

trump make america great again 
bunch of idiots crying go make me a sandwich
what a lie   look the fight isnt against womens rights  its against the right to fornicate  murder   its that simple whorish people  the right to fornicate without consequences is what the liberal wicked folks want  they want to sin without being held accountable  responsible for the consequences it brings  most abortions 999 percent are based on purposes of convenience  theres no reason to penalize the baby for the crime of the father for those whove been raped and impregnated  just do your child a favor spare hisher life and deliver himher and offer himher to adoption   theres plenty of families that cannot bare children of their own who desire to be father and mother to them
a majority of people against abortion are women

you are allowed to kill babies as long as you use a gun preferably a concealed one
abortion is murder abortion is not a constitutional right let the individual states decide if one wants an abortion they can go to where it is legal prolife citizens do not want to have abortions conducted in their state
these people are just a bunch of baby killers we need the sacrifice instead of common sense and resposibility  what about the civil liberties of the life you createdi understand why you say my body my choicebut why dont you say my body my responsibilityso how about its your responsibility to not have a child if you dont want one  how about we promote responsibility instead of a quick fix by killing a baby   see the thing is its not about taking away womens rights its about not killing babies you fucking crazy women
"so my body my choice is suddenly a thing again i thought you guys gave up on that when people were forced to get the experimental jab  you supported it for profit 
do you still support people getting arrested for inciting violence you people on the left implicitly boldly  blatantly call for violence yet no one gets arrested but on jan 6th trump never called for violence or suggested anyone enter the capital and you lose their minds  waste millionsof tax payer money to produce hearings for show its so obvious that democrats dont play by the same rules and continues to blatantly break laws without shame news flashamericans from all parties are getting tired of your hypocritical ways  dirty antiques november is going to be a house cleaning that is long overdue"
liberals got violent because they didnt get their way crazy who woulda thunk
abortion is not legal in half the states an illegal and a half the states that is a blatant lie you are putting on your news program this is not what is going on it is up to the states to decide via vote this is an assumption hes making because hes talking about a worstcase scenario but to tell everybody that this is some sort of definitive outlying of abortion is the definition of fake news you are lying through your teeth when you make that statement
ohh my god cant do abortions anymore
the abortion camp owns this your own fault the 50 yrs you took rare and safe to 98500 elective abortions in a 100000 and right up to the day of birth you lost the debate

handmaid tale in america so disturbing
"the women are pissed
literally 30 seconds earlier
woman expressing they are happy with the ruling"
if there was ever a moment that truly showed our public school systems failed our youth let this be a shining example  i have to constantly remind myself that not everyone has a brain capable of logical analysis and that some are indeed slow andor special ed  these people seem to fail to read the fine print of what has transpired  the supreme court didnt ban abortions they merely gave the power back to the states to decide  even then most arent banning them outright but banning them after a certain time frame  a lot of these people are demonstrating a condition known as blind by emotion or bbe  where they are so emotionally invested that they lose all sense of logic and reason  its sad
simple dont get knocked up
trash utter trash report
based make it a crime everywhere
ok now lets make it illegal for men to get vasectomies
there is no constitutional right to abortion that is a lie  truth is americans forced to pay for these abortions are illegal and now they are no longer force to pay for this slaughter of the innocents
what the suprem court did with roe v wade was sent it back to the states it is up to each state to decide if abortion will be legal or not hopefully we the people will be the ones to decide in our state by vote i wonder if people are so bad inform or uninformed base in what i hearing in the liberal media people are bad inform
"roe v wade wasnt a ruling on abortion

it was a ruling on privacy that assumed abortion was a legitimate medical procedure

all the courts sid was say woah wait a second we dont have any laws about this  we cant enshrine it because we dont have the laws to act upon which is their duty

cope and seethe child murders"
i dont know if people are disinformation or bad inform in the suprem court justice overturn on roe v wade base on what i have been seeing and hearing on cnn abc nbc msnbc news and even what i listen biden said as he was trying to read the teleprompter it is a  combination of disinformation with bad information and a clear show of brain washing to protest about something that didnt happen and a insensitivity to violence to push a narrative that fit their agenda instead of information
"i have been hearing a sudden spike in birth control ummm why havent people been protecting themselves from pregnancy in the first place 
i mean thats just irresponsible birth control has been free in clinics for years now"

to women in states who are going to be forced to have children make full use of welfare of your current state  full use
"dear reporter its not taking away a freedom to kill a baby its taking away the perverse right to legally kill a child if a person can be charged with with double homicide like scott peterson was then the killing of a baby in the womb should matter if the woman lives a great day for children its their fight its their right

why not report on margaret sanger and her desire to kill off the black population through the means of abortion ill be waiting reporter lady"
i had one night stand with a woman who had abortions
"you know your body your choice includes body responsibility and if you are a woman and arent intimately familiar with your cycle then do you truly love and respect yourself
the easiest thing to do in this world is to take responsibility for ourselves and ladies this includes knowing your cycle and acting accordingly the chances of getting pregnant are zero if you simply use logic know your cycle and live accordingly include your man also wearing a condom every time regardless of cycle

one easy step to body freedom

question is do you love yourselves enough to take responsibility or do you need to continue making bad choices"
stop calling it womens rights its not your body its not your choice it is textbook murder
babyphobes seething rn  love and the miracle of life stay winning hatred will never stop the birth of millions of new lives goo goo gaa gaa to the haters
the moment you realise that the islamic militant sorts and rightwing americans are simply a retexture running on the same matrix code 
i think you should start with all the doctors that have a boarded so many babies in the past and abort them off this earth and the politicians that made it legal
even though rha sun god worshiping band iron maiden has the lyrics in a song that says to kill the unborn in the womb 2 minutes to midnight lets take the word abortion out of the sentence and make it kill or murder call it what it is quit sugar coating it
loving vs virginia isnt deeply rooted in out history either maybe we can repeal that
"legalizing abortion decades ago didnt solve any problems because it caused many people to think lightly of getting rid of an unwanted baby
however
making abortion illegal again or difficult to obtain wont solve any problems either it will only cause even more division violence and hatred

it might sound like a good law  but good laws dont necessarily create good people"

when have you ever seen cnn cnbc msnbc or any other american news outlet reporting on british policy or politics why dont you earn your ratings and report on british issues like the blatant hypocrisy of the british labour party and can i add theres a lot of mis characterisation in this awful journalism theyve not made abortion illegal theyve handed the reigns over to the state who are elected officials and legislators elected by constituents of the states they live in"
"it amazes me how the left in america have twisted this whole thingbinto something it isnt

firstly abortion isnt a legal right elsewhere in the world despite what pro abortionists say not every country has a constitution eg the uk

secondly all tbe supreme court did was say abortion is a state issue not a federal one meaning the decision is  made at a local level not a federal level

the supreme court did not ban abortion"

jesus hates abortion except when he carries them out in rev 223 
"jesus is indeed lucifer the morning star which is why isaiah 1412 lists lucifer as the morning star and then jesus calls himself the morning star in rev 2216  the reason christians fail to see the obvious is because they are brainwashed by their churches into reading the bible backwards and reading the new testament before the old testament  we read books from front to back for a reason and that is because you cant possibly understand the end of a book that you dont understand the beginning of  and it is not even possible to fully understand a book from reading the last quarter of it  with that being said  adam and eve were not first and the 2 stories of creation in genesis are not about the same creation as the christian church teaches  god makes people on the 6th day of creation in genesis 126  then in genesis chapter 2 god rests god sanctifies the 7th day and then the lord god of israel creates adam and eve on the 7th day of creation  to work on the 7th day that god has blessed and sanctified is blasphemy which is what makes the lord god satan the lord of this world  that also makes clear that adam and eve were not first they were made second  doesnt the 6th day of creation come before the 7th day of creation  the family lineage that begins with adam and ends with jesus is the family lineage made by satan the lord god not god  thats why isaiah 1412 lists lucifer as the morning star and then jesus calls himself the morning star in rev 2216  jesus was lucifer in the flesh not god in the flesh  jesus is lucifer the morning star  go to my channel for more details

that new world order that alex jones and other gop christians pretend to fight is really the goal of christianity otherwise known as the new earth isaiah 6517 isaiah 6622 2 peter 313 rev 211 to be ruled by the new jerusalem  the new earth is where the nations are destroyed and massed together for a world government that will be on the shoulders of jesus  well isnt the new world order a world government as well  and gee new earth even sounds exactly like new world doesnt it  that is not a coincidence the new earth is indeed the new world order  its all right there in your new world translation bible if you actually bothered to read it  

the gop already used their nra lobbying dollars to rewrite the 2nd amendment in 2008  the gop and the koch brothers rewrote the constitution with the citizens united ruling  now the gop has five more constitutional amendments planned  that makes seven constitutional amendments in 9 years for the gop  anyone who cares for the constitution would never vote for the gop ever

the media in the country is corrupt it is all right wing fascist military industrial complex run prochristian proisrael propaganda plain and simple  when has any media channel ever allowed someone like myself to biblically challenge the christian religion  never because if someone like me had access to major media channels very few people would be christian cbs was founded by westinghouse a major defense contractor  nbc was formerly owned by general electric another huge defense contractor  and this is the liberal media huh  pfftt hardly

no most americans dont support killing babies
"the number one cause of death worldwide 
is killing unborn babies 
that did not have a choice"
abortion has never been a constitutional right what about the right of the unborn
hey all you women that want to kill unborn humans just have the operation  take out your uterus this way you wont be a murderer
america land of the not free and not brave cool
"my country feedback 

they seem awfully touchy about this abortion issue dont they over reacting and overacting
why all the over reacting and overacting

whats up with that 

this isnt the first law in our history to be repealed

sincerely
gospelgirl"
look out guys there gonna start peacefully protesting
im just amazed liberals figured out what a woman is
so right to privacy exists now but vaccination status was mandatory 
roe vs wade 1973 was advocated by margaret sanger a racist white woman who supported eugenics the elimination of the negro population now finally the stain of roe on americas conscience has been overturned by black scotus judge thomas clarence history will look back on this important day as important as abolishing slavery
trump really cant stop winning my man
abortion is wicked
at least men can still have babies 
states cant regulate guns but womens rights on abortions with no exception to incest or even rpe  ok america call urself a free country why dont ya
abortion isnt a right 
because women are pied funny i just saw hundreds of women who were crying tears of joy in celebration 
236 no sista were not going back to 1970 there are now around 20 forms of contraception to fit every lifestyle female contraceptives according to the aca must be covered in full whether the woman has a private plan a government plan or is on medicaid no excuses the barbaric days of abortionasbirthcontrol must end
"hey foreign journalist

there is no constitutional right to abortion there never has been that was the entire point of the us supreme court decision roe was always based in bad law even liberal legal scholars concede this the scs job is not to legislate policy but only to interpret the constitution try educating yourself also there is no violation of womens rights here this has always been about the essential human right of the right to life to not be killed in the womb but be born an unborn child is not part of a womans body it is a distinct human being with its own unique genetic blueprint no one lost any natural rights with this correct ruling but countless millions of people over many future generations just gained the right to life"
the ignorance and dodging of the people in this video makes it impossible to take seriously
do these channel 4 british news station have any clue as to how america works
i cant believe that the reporter is too stupid to understand what the ruling really did so her scaremongering is basically just her intentionally lying
funny how a woman is speaking on behalf of the prolife movement and a man is speaking for the prochoice movement i thought men dont get a say
wow the propaganda language is think with this news station
imagine meeting your maker and having to argue that you fought to allow the killing of children
same people that are against murdering babies are the same people that will skin an animal and eat it except humans are animals too peoples hypocrisy really blows my mind
never forget trump is responsible for this
its going to cause backalley abortions
we should not be stripping away a womans rights
im a republican but this right here really does not sit well with me
you are all sick people if you think killing a beating heart in midterm late term or wtv is okay and that the babys body is yours choice im sorry to disappoint but your body is carrying the life you want to kill if you wanted to do that you should have done it in early stages
womens rights or child rights
you know accidents do happen and sometimes people might accidentally take a certain antibiotic that cancels out the birth control or they may have been raped but they should not be forced to give birth to a child that theyre not financially able to take care of or that they never wanted number one in overpopulates the country and number two it puts too many kids into the system that dont even have a family remember that child will grow up one day and it could possibly be a murderer stop looking at them like their children we have got to control population
abortion is not a contraceptive you have plan b you also have contraceptives to not have a baby theres also tubal ligation you have more things today than you had in the 70s dont be stupid
if you want abortion just take your female innards out and then you wont have to worry about having a baby because if you dont want one then you surely are not gonna be a worthy mother now
just vote in your state why is that so difficult to understand
abortion is not a constitutional right channel 4 i have a question to you how much have you been paid to say bs like that
im crying laughing not tears
this channel isnt even trying to fake impartiality
what about the grey areas women who may die if they go through with the pregnancy women who were raped and dont want the child the possibility that a very sick or disabled child will be born if the pregnancy proceeds these are reasons that put things in a completely different light it is not a black and white issue its really not
left should have worked with the right but once you say a women has a right to have a abortion all the way up to birth just turned too many people off
im sorry you have to do a better job of shutting your legs after a drunk night at the bar
im excited to see the efflux of people with substandard morals exit my state 
its a good thing this happened im glad it happened in my life time and i got to see it no one has the right to murder another human being
boy they really want to torture and murder babies
woman against woman its nothing about woman rights its about human rights
channel 4 thinks not killing babies is taking away freedoms sick
hopefully we can get trump back in office 
now we are finally bringing god back to the states 
im a democrate but i will never vote again democrate women in the usa are the most organized mafia more powerful the police mafia women have made the democrate party the femanazi party all the laws today are antimale antnatural men are being destroyed in this country even fathers day is a joke these antimale laws must end
"for all you depressed winey liberals relax you will still be able to kill your babies since you live in blue states  in fact please do since we dont need future liberal woke people 
on the other hand red states will increase voters because we are not having abortions 
a baby heartbeat starts after 15 weeks  this is a fact for all you baby killers"
gay marriage is next
they should survey orphans if they would rather be killed or have their lives imagine fighting to kill your kid
"trumps choices dont want you to be able to kill a baby
bidens choice doesnt even know what a women is and thinks were to hard on paedophiles and trumps the bad guy"
how a woman could get two abortions herself and then take that very right away from other women is disgusting
such balanced unbiased reporting 
we live in a society where the the supreme court believe anyone and everyone  that purchase  a gun will make the right decision  but a woman dont have enough  sense to make the right decision when it comes to a pregnancy
my god the thought that a baby about to be delivered can no longer be subject to having a pair of forceps thrust into its skull and its brain sucked out is unconscionable  we demand partial abortion  too bad the protesters mothers didnt about them
you body your choice well abort your body stop killing babies  gods abomination the shed of innocent blood remember religion dont save only jesus christ saves
and lets not talk about the dads that want to keep the baby if they dont wanna have a chance of getting pregnant then dont lay in the bed its that simple stop getting in bed with every man that u see duh
as a news channel please report the news not express your own opinion 
better pick a better man to lay the bed with unstead of fuckin low life men 
i cant believe they went through with it you republicans are sick go shoot yourselves
i guess this means they actually have to be responsible now
"the prolife movement is prodeath and more people need to recognize this important fact

the same justices and politicians who weep crocodile tears for embryos are the ones who sentence thousands of the elderly and children to die  how prolife are they really when they refuse to protect people from covid and guns  the blood of thousands stain their hands disproving their rhetoric about caring for life

we need to vocally label conservatives as the prodeath party and directly call out people like brett kavanaugh and clarence thomas as the heartless treacherous wretches they truly are  dont let these hypocrites claim the higher ground on the cause of saving lives challenge them and ask how many people died from their other actions"
they way to fix this is make a law no one is allowed to have kids unless a licence  if welfare you are not allowedonly if you have money  lets see if they like this law instead i a have a funny feeling they would scream no more welfare entitlements
i see nothing but cry babies crying over not being able to kill babies
hilarious how only conservatives comment and watch i am conservative i love god and ya and i think that killing children is horrible
no such thing as constitutional right to kill your own child
the complete evisceration of roe v wade by the reactionary justices on the supremely political court of the united states clearly validates the sad reality that the united states is no longer the land of the free  the home of the brave
people are crying over not being able to kill babies
there are 1000s of forms of birth control abortion is so archaic and barbaric
until one of these womens children get pregnant after being rapped then they wont be so happy womens rights being taken away certain people need to be voted out of office  im going to fight until i die
there never was a constitutional right to an abortion its not in the constitution and the judiciary cannot make law the decision ha been returned to the states where it should be democrats are just enraged they cannot murder and dismember babies freely anywhere
all you have to do ids go to vegas if you want abortion the ruling is a joke its like putting a fence on the mexican border they still can cross by the millions
hahaha great news all these emotional crybaby liberals balling their eyes out cry babies hahaha
everyone who is for abortion has already been born
seriously these people need to all be deported to the rock from which they crawled out from under there are literally no bigger losers on the planet
good  the supreme court dont want yall womens babies blood on their hands u keep that on your own judgementdayiscoming
there is simply nothing more satisfying than seeing the liberal left angry and upset i just love it 
time to keep the legs closed and peckers holstered  no glove no love
93 of abortion customers do it for no reason without any victimhood
womens rights  you mean human child sacrifice
"what about the mans rights 
 takes a man and a woman to make a child"
"if a company sends an employee to get an abortion in another state please make it public 
"
"small minority group of women are upset all ive seen was women who were happy about the decision

trump 2024"
nothing was taken away that future person that might save lives because of the life he or she chooses to live is now protected just imagine a woman sleeping around with no protection and going to get an abortion for somebody who might have saved her life
"terrified that they have to be responsible amazing
now they can force the ja6
no longer your 6ody or your hoice
they have you right where they want you
take a few steps back
this was not truly what you think its a means to an end of your freedom
i would expect another pla9ue soon"
woman shouldnt have a voice
what good is bodily autonomy if you cant stop your body from getting pregnant in the first place
if they band birth control they should also band vasectomy for men
i hope that all those woman celebrating this decision adopt at least five kids from those abusive orphanage
abortion is not a constitutional right why would you say that the first and second amendment are rights protected by the constitution which is why they fail every time they try to take them abortion is not a right the majority of this country was okay with abortion when it was safe legal and rare the minute they started celebrating abortion pushing abortion up until the moment of birth wearing it as a badge of honor and demanding taxpayers foot the bill they lost you did this to yourselves
its the supreme pleasure to watch this snowflakes meltdown oh thanks god
"yeah i wish everyone who is pro
abortion had parents that aborted them then we wont have to hear from all these democrat proabortion cum dumpster sluts "
women protest and want everything banned now but wont protest against their favorite hollywood celebrities who are pdos  rpe kids and women
wow this reporting is completely neutral said no one ever
the fact that channel 4 excluded the fact that a majority of americans oppose 2nd and 3rd trimester abortions and democrats advocate up to birth shows everything you need to know about media
"roe v wade overturned every supporter of killing unborn babies loses their mind and acts like a hysterical toddler 

if we hadnt taught them that crying and acting irrational will get you whatever you want  a lesson most children learn by the time theyre five  they might be dealing with this like adults"
no matter how you cut it  abortion is an abomination
women do have a right to choose but that choice should begin in the bedroom not in the clinic maybe now men and women will be a bit more cautious about who they sleep around with
as someone who is both pro life and pro choice i am totally disgusted by the pro life campaigners still out on the streets celebrating their success if they were truly motivated by their faith rather than their rightwing political views they would  if they were true christians   be spending time in quiet contemplation giving thanks for their perceived victory conversely pro choice campaigners have a legitimate right to demonstrate after this retrogressive scotus decision
my body my choice funny how the left was singing a different tune on vaccination mandates
babies are dancing with joy in heaven
damn that thumbnail are those eyebrows or caterpillars my god
gotta keep those babies so the repubes can have them shot in schools and complain about them being freeloaders what a joke that country is
what i dont understand is why women are fighting roe v wade no one is forcing them to have abortions
guys dont worry you can still get a abortion youll just go to jail if you do it its still your choice though dont you think this goes past your right to choose
channel 4 are so dishonest i feel i have to right this  just so people know  the supreme court did not ban abortion abortion has not now become illegal in the states all that has happened is the supreme court decided it is not a constitutional right obviously its not and that state governments are best placed to determine their own laws when it comes to abortion my liberal friends dont worry la ny dc and all the other blue states will still continue to kills baby right up to the point of birth i know this will disappoint you but republican states will most likely put a time limit on abortive to the end of the first trimester you know  like here in the uk thats what really happened
i love how these crazies say that men are the ones pushing for thisbut the prolife women in this video were the most excited 
the crazy thing is that the right to bear arms is in the constitution and the right to murder unborn babies is not let that sink in
it was never been a constitutional right read the constitution for pity sake
you dont need me to tell you that an unborn child is too small too poor too weak too innocent for a liberal  to acknowledge its existence as you already know all this  considering god created the heavens the universe everything and  owns everything can you just imagine how small how weak  how poor how wimpy how pathetic  a liberal must appear to godi assure you god loves the weakest poorest youngest oldest people on earth every bit as much as he loves you and i
its all about choice why not choose to close your legs or choose birth control before you get pregnant why not choose to be responsible  dogs breed indiscriminately  are you no more than a dog
it all boils down to liberals want to kill babies out of convience of a woman  the only reason this was even an issue  is because the left comapigned for abortions on demand up to birth if you want to blame anyone  blame the shout your abortion crowd the lina dunims of the world saying they wish they could have had the opportunity to have an abortion the fact is the decision is now at the state level if you want to kill babies move to democrat sanctuaries if you want to skip that nuisance  where a condom at the state level their can be discussions about when abortions are permissible likely they will deem it ok in the case of health of mother incest and rape if you think they wont you are being disenguous  just imagine the campaign slogans of people competing in a primary do you really think that someone will win or hold their seat if their opponent paints them as someone that will now fight for an abortion for a mother if she will die if the baby is borb wake up people
horseshit forced birth is evil
while showing women celebrating that it is gone
god their breaking down in tears because they no long have the right to end a life
to all those fking liberals this is what happen when you play stupid and forget what women is 
they are so dumb they report its a constitutional right no remember it was 5 unelected justices who gave you federal abortion law 50 years agoif you dont like the fact that 6 unelected justices returned the law to the states remember that we put up with it for 50 years now its back where it belongs the dems say they love democracy so much but they argue against this very democratic process now the people in each state will decide
this is dark day for usa  poor america  sending love  from uk 
"its should be equal right for both parents when it comes to abortion  child support because the baby has half of each parents dna if this is not the case then manwoman should have no say in these matters when a pregnancy is involve 
ty"
next they will be protesting that they cant murder school children no difference liberals murder is murder
gods gonna nuke this place
jesus coming soon its too much seen in this world 
so women are now upset they lost their right or choice men have no say either way and should have right to financial abortiononly fair right now you know how men feelhows it feel ladiessuxs doesnt it
this isnt about the fetus at all its about taking womans rights
hey women out their who want to murder babies get some contraception or keep your panties on murder should never have been an option
trumps last gift to america
life liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
so what this means is women arent going to be able to engage in promiscuous relationships women are going to have to be more selective with the men they choose good
the curdled cream of society
"pro abortionists are worse than slave owners

at least the slaves got to live"
good decision give a chance to unborn babys they have a choice as well
two words the pill  it works and has for decades
this is amazing
if the woman has the right to choose and wants a abortion the man should have the right to choose to get full custody and the woman pay child support
a woman has never been allowed to do whatever they want with their bodies you can swing your arm around all you want the second it strikes and kills another you have crossed the line
pro life men are fucking sick mother fuckers but what is worse is another woman who thinks it is okay to force other women to have fucking babies  the post roe idiots make me fucking sick  it is not okay to force your religious beliefs onto others
are these women crying because they can no longer murder their unborn children
the fact there are women crying over this only leads me to believe they had goals of killing a fetus in their future and now they cant and they hate it
wonder how many of these anti abortionists are in favour of the death penalty for children and against school lunches
not to sound petty why do the people who are for life seem normal then you go over to the pro abortion side and you see green hair blue hair red hair goofy clothes just goofy looking people in general they look like barnum and bailey circus a big giant busted bag of skittles abortion is murder im happy about all this
"america be like  
political religion in the middle east is a scandal look what they do to women they are uncivilized barbarians we cant let that happen
also america  
let fundamentalist evangelists rule the united states and take away womens rights
french people  
"
same people that wanna put your child in a mask at school for seven hours a day cant put a condom on for three minutes think about that 
its not constitutional it never was this was a proper decision
you have no right to an abortion and no there is no majority that supports abortion those polls are taken in strict liberal states
forced birth is what were talking about  its going to kill many thousands of women and destroy far more lives than it will supposedly save lets call it what it is forced birth it will be a disaster for our country we already have one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world this is the opposite of pro life its pro death forced birth is wrong on every level many states have zero exceptions for rape or incest this is a literal death sentence for thousands of women
they overturn roe v wade because states rights  then they over turn a new york gun law overturning a state right  now they have suspended your miranda rights  what rights are they going to take next
for those men who are pro life an alternative solution is to give all males vasectomies say at age 14 sperm samples could be frozen how do you feel about that
how would you antiabortionists  sleep at night if you had to put in the forceps and pull the innocent baby out limb by limb crush its skull with the forceps and pull out the skull and brain piece by piece
yeah 99 years for abortion right desicion
and i hope trump will desmantly evry news channels for ever and create new news
and evry men whit these liberalist cunts are simps and losers
they should let the babies decide if they want to be aborted or not
and these liberalist people shoud be put to camps for reeducation for normality
i would like to ask this man how many times has he paid for a womans health care and how many times has he babysitted a child for free
nice job supreme court evry woemen who make abortion shoud be jailed for 50years for killing child
what are the rights of men what are the reproductive rights of men and fathers
they are crying because they cant kill babies channel 4 news is simply fake news no attempt at objectivity
most whites woman voted for trump thanks for fucking over the rest of us
"libtards  

me  "
leftist women are a cancer on the planet
2nd class citizen try being a woman in china latin america or yemen those hardworking toughasnails women would put these pathetic spoiled excuses of a woman to shame none of those prochoicers would survive outside a 1st world country despite whatever laws get passed it is a haven compared to those countries privilege is invisible to those who have it its time to actually be responsible for your choices
i laugh at all you women who want to kill babies i feel sorry for the innocent unborn not women who want to kill their children
this is so biased  yeah for america and the rights of the unborn woo hooo
the united states is a federal system this means if an issue is not covered in the us constitution then it defers back to the individual sates thats all this ruling corrected that abortion is not a centralized  government decision duh
its funny how proabortion people all have prolife mothers for if it wasnt for their prolife mothers they wouldnt exist
finally this witnesses of abortion sect is cancelled thank ktulhu
the world is celebrating this may spain argentina etc follow your lead for once im happy about news coming from usa
greatdelighted to see some meltdowns from the cohort that no man would impregnate in the first place
i honestly wasnt a trump suporter until i heard that his team was responsable for the grounds of this overturn god bless those men they lost the battle they won the war
its amazing how these same groups of people who previously denied what a woman is now suddenly can defineadmit what a woman is
there never was any constitutional right to abortion there is no amendment to the constitution that states you have the right to murder your child
cry about it waa waa boo hoo i cant scramble baby brains any more
first of all it was never a constitutional right because it was never in the constitution  and it did not outlaw abortion  it only turned it over to the states  in these states that they are protesting in will not outlaw killing babies
how is abortion a right  its not
cope
 so many other issues that need to be addressed like gas and everything else that has doubled whatever happened to let people make their own decision
no more rights for women 
protests no longer work action now every women need to stop and this country down they have the power if women stopped working across this nation for just a week  watch how quickly things would change the constitution was written by the founding father s not the apostles christianity is a religion not a political party how dare men dictate what women can do with their bodies guess we need to cut off their viagra
the supreme court is not meant to protect civil liberties its meant to determine whether something is constitutional if abortion is to be required via the constitution it requires a constitutional amendment the decision is correct regardless of your opinion on abortion
killing is not a right its a crime
"i love when americans talk about the constitution like its what they must follow last time i checked it did probation you know your 18th amendment i dont see many people screaming about getting that back any time soon if you want to get rid of basic human rights then lets put back in those restricted ones i already made up a slogan for it

make alcohol illegal again its simply just perfect its the bestest best slogan that ever had sloganed

cant wait for the day"
quick get a picture of a jew crying for the thumbnail
i only clicked on this video to see liberal tears
demonrats are gonna openly run on packing the supreme court now they are gonna use this to try and get the votes they want in the supreme court
"woohoo america is turning back to jesus
god has truly answered our prayers 

prolife"
what about protecting unborn childs rights why does an innocent child have to die
its about time
i dont have to go to prison if i get convicted because i decide where my body goes mybodymychoice
does anybody still watch the amateur media cbs nbc abc cnn msnbc 
im eagerly anticipating the day when scotus will address the constitutionality of the leftist college administrators imposition of speech codes that are flagrantly unconstitutional
no one ever seems to mention its your own damn fault you got pregnant in the first place your poor choice shouldnt allow you to kill someone
its not just your body when you have a child in it  not hard to understand
"pinktsunami
rainbowtsunami

there is an estimated 20 million lgbt population in the united states

there are an estimated 332 900 58 women in the united states

there are an estimated 40 million women in the united states that support abortion rights

listen up   this does not include the families that love and support these americans

that is a powerful amount of voters that republicans want to nullify their rights

 we have a powerful voting voice  a lot of voting power and we can vote to remove abort republicans from all types of elected offices   
where do we begin   start at the local level and move up all the way up to the republican congress

republican senators and republican scotus have made it clear that they will restrict womens rights now have sights on lgbt rights and that has begun with striking down roe vs wade 

 republicans from all levels of government across america have picked a fight to beat women and lgbt in submission

 republicans from all levels of government across each state in america want to rule our bodies and take away our rights to choose

i say to you all we will fight 
  we must abort with our votes every republican in every position in public office   it is not enough to walk and march across america   now is the time to do grassroots campaign    lets elect people into office that will protect women lgtb rights and fight for us at the highest levels of government   

vote to abort all republicans that now hold office    the senate is a good start

we have the power we will become a force to be reckoned with and will not get pushed around anymore by these selfserving republicans 
 vote republicans out
"
i dont view abortion as a choice and a right i think its always a tragedy  senator joe biden 2006
"restricing abortion to not be avalable right up untill birth is not a ban on abortion 
the amount of people that say my body my choice that supports vaccine mandates is just crazy"
"women are discriminated because you females empowered males who are now females over your own rights 
yup its an oxymoron sad that females empowered males to be females and now biologically born females have less power than nonbiologists females and now they complain that females in america  are crying  and screaming oppression"
prolife does not force you to have babies
each state has its own laws on abortion womens rights is still alive these liberals and democrats just want all or nothing
ah the return of back street abortions that killed both mothers and babiesgood job
i like how in the beginning of this video the broadcaster claimed there is no longer a constitutional right to abortion there was never a constitutional right to abortion it isnt mentioned in the constitution it never was stop lying about the constitution
there will be no functioning society because of women this birthing people going to reduce herself to useless while real women go about their lives living responsibly and contributing to society rather than fight for murder on their hypothetical unborn child get a grip
keep crying
strange to watch people cry because they put restrictions on killing babies
where were all these protesters when the government locked down the entire country
"oppose the withdrawal of womens abortion rights in the usa through an order of the supreme court
all india democratic womens association aidwa strongly condemns the recent order of the supreme court of the usa which reverses the right of abortion available to american women for the last five decades through the judgment in the roe versus wade case this judgment which had allowed women to opt for an abortion in the first trimester and under certain circumstances even in the second trimester of pregnancy has now been overturned by a majority decision of the supreme court allowing the states to impose their own restrictions depriving women of their right in the matter

it is feared that strong antiabortionist lobbies will prevail in many of the american states and push through harsh laws making all abortions beyond 15 weeks illegal and punishable and imposing severe restrictions even on that the moot point in the matter is that the power to decide in the matter is being transferred from the woman concerned to the state authorities

aidwa sees this as a dangerous turn towards antiwoman antipoor rightwing reaction within american society which will particularly hurt women from the more vulnerable sections in the us and young adults among them who are anyway denied health and reproductive rights and rights to safe contraception now they will be deprived of the right to safe abortion as well and may be pushed into taking recourse to illegal clinics jeopardizing their health and even their lives

aidwa expresses solidarity with activists within american society opposing this reactionary judgment and asserting the right of women over their bodies"
jose vela does not seem to grasp that under the constitution it is perfectly acceptable for one state to declare certain acts to be criminal while other states do not it is the states primarily that pass criminal laws and these laws presumedly reflect the will of the people in that state thats precisely what the constitution provides in order for a crime to be federal there usually has to be some nexus with interstate commerce so the primary authority for defining what is a crime and what isnt is the state legislature that vela doesnt know this is amazing
how about allowing the father of the child to actually have a say when it comes to the future of that unborn baby i find it hilarious and shocking and disingenuous that women scream all day long about how its their decision and their decision alone hello until you are able to conceive a child without the help of a man and i will point out a man born as a man not a transgender man then a man has a say in what happens to the future of that unborn baby now granted a lot of men may not care and will decline having any input but at the very least a woman should talk with the father of that unborn baby and get his input allow him to express his decision and she needs to take his thoughts and feelings into account while making that decision i would say that he should even have legal grounds to give input on the future of that unborn child so tired of this bullshit so tired of women screaming about how its their decision and their bodies girl you didnt get pregnant without that man he does have a say in what happens to that child at the very least if you make a decision to allow that baby to be born and if a man doesnt want it to be born and wanted an abortion then he should not be liable to pay child support for 18 years its only fair its all about you ladies then stop being disingenuous and keep it all about you the father of the child doesnt get to be part of the decision then the father of the child should be absolved of child support you cant have it both ways
bs it is not three justices  given the opportunity the left would install three appointees with their ideology  the issue was that roe v wade was unconstitutional and scholars on both sides of the isle have acknowledged this fact
you are the father
lol all these crazy libs weeping love it of course they never shed a tear for the killing of unborn babies oh well you have plenty of options to have that baby murdered so no worries just go to the state next door
my body my choice except when its about the covid vac then u either take it or lose your job
why some women crying and some cheering
finally accountablity for baby killers
congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
fifty years of womens rights in america overturned in an instant  what shamelessly biased reporting the court decided that  the legal reasoning of the roe vs wade case was based on weak and spurious arguments as a result it is up to the us states to legislate on abortion because it is not a subject mentioned in the us constitution
these people are fucing lunatics their mad they cant kill babies
"what baffles me is they talk abt womens right to kill babies bcz they couldnt keep there little cats to themselves  or be reckless 
talk abt freedom to murder many young innocents lol"
the supreme court has effectively divided the nation further pushing people balkanizing the american landscape  america is on its way out of a unified nation
and now foetuses have more rights than actual humans society has just got 100 times dumber
liberal demonstrations across the united states protesting the overturning of roe v wade are quite hilarious and entertaining to watch
its like people dont realize condoms exist
killing babies is not the solution to any problem
but women dont like or need men so they wont be getting pregnant anyway
provides more targets for school shooters
right to life
now lets see how many lives are lost by women going underground to find an abortion clinic
abortion was never in the constitution you lieing bastards
its june and the snowflakes are meltingbut its not from the heat
is the creature in the thumbnail with the bushy caterpillar eyebrows male or female hard to tell
"345 thousand babies killed each year by abortions and selling their body parts plan parenthood
any one think its strange that all the signs were already made"
that shoudve happend 49 years ago
say goodbye to roevwadeand justice for all unborn children
aww poor woman crying in the thumb nail oh no now i cant kill babies i cant be a real woman any more
"here lies the problem

one side believes abortion is about killing babes the other believes its about women rights

both have a point 

i agree 1000 on my body my choice if any woman wants to get a boob job or butt implants i support that its your body your choice

however you can do anything with your body as long as it doesnt kill a born or unborn member of society 

i believe this is a fair compromise"
ive got news for these idiots who are antichoice abortion will never end all it means is more women will die in back alley abortions  i hope that once these antichoice women and their husbands or boyfriends get raped or are a victim of incest enjoy watching their rapists baby being born
liberal meltdown lol
lol imagine being devastated that the right to kill children was taken away haha
is it so hard to use contraception everyone wants to go bareback
abortion is murder
he bible says love thy neighbor but trumps farright homegrown terrorist new motto is hate they neighbor there will no longer be any peace and love as long as those fanatic hooligans control our once loved america before donald trump our nation is so divided that it will never be a leader of the free world fight back against those hooligans destroying america jan 6 2011 gives video proof to that donald trump wanted a coup that nearly happen if it hadnt of been for people up holding their oath of office true americans donald trumps evil plan would have worked a dictator would have taken over america as he wanted he wont give up with the continued lies as he learned from criminal roger stone as he pardoned like so many others he wants that power back as the republican party wants donald trumps supreme court is just the beginning do we want a russian america or america as it was before donald trump jan 6 2011 was worse then pearl harbor or 911 because it came from within dont let the socalled religious creeps tell you differently they are not of god those people follow the devil like donald trump he never represented all of the people because he never lived up to the oath of office he swore upon to represent all of the people  he lied as he does today to keep his power it was all about him no one else he knew people were stupid enough to believe him because of criminal roger stone only criminals get pardoned listen to the facts not a dictator
i wonder how many of these woman really read what the rights are
its that time of year again when democrats start looting vandalizing and burning down their communities hahahahaha
polls show most americans support abortion were those polls done by the same clown who said joe biden will win by a landslide
i think states should pass a law that if you are prolife you now have to adopt a child and take responsibility of telling others what they can do with their bodies im so sick of people telling others what to do and talking zero responsibility in that action
watching these deranged satanic mobs having a meltdown makes me so happy
if abortion is legal then men should have the right not to pay child supportmy wallet my choice
killing unborn babies is a right
pro abortion always will be  i hate kamala harris but i guess im stuck voting for her  why cant we have a jill stein  where is camille paglia  why cant pennsylvania make up its mind on abortion  why cant it make up its mind up on marijuana while children overdose on heroin in the streets  where is bill maher  the slimy used car saleman of hbo  the voice of libertarian divorcees
good news 
if im forced to have a kid im going to make that childs life miserable im going to take pills to make a die
nobody is talking about the rights of trans women to have safe abortions
these violent abortionist monsters are the vilest form of hypocrite in one breath they claim to be humanitarian humanists in another they fight to cruely and violently kill off the human race
satan lives in these protest
why dont the radical women just get hysterectomies  they dont have any problem with men getting vasectomies or with even giving gender reassignment surgery if there even is such a thing to children   apparently there are people who are incapable of understanding that constitutional rights apply to all born and unborn
you are biased trash nowhere in the constitution does it say that americans are entitled to hoover out fetuses for convenience ffs anyone that pounds their chest in support of this practice are repugnant
whaai have to drive a bit to murder my child what a dark daythe protesters do make a good argument for retroactive abortion
"maths time 
under 1000 women die in childbirth each year 
this is consistent a with only a slight change if abortion allowed or disallowed
 since abortion allowed about 1 million babies aborted each year in america 
if america allows abortion for 100 years they will kill  the same as 13rd of their population  
abortion is not a contraceptive option ladies thats what this is really about"
if you domt like it move to a murder and evil state 
a woman still have their rights  they have a right to keep their clothes on
a massive shortage of baby formula in the us and the supreme court says make more babies america is insane so many starving babies on the horizon
thank god for donald j trump
abortion is not a constitutional right it is mentioned 0 times in the constitution
abortion isnt an constitutional right end of story marxists go home
nothing worse than seeing young teens of this new sensitive generation protest against abortion pathing the way for a dark future for themselves
democrats are free to move back to abortion states please do thank you
there is no such thing as constitutional right to abortion  get your facts right  and the supreme court did not totally ban abortion  they only reverted back to the states legislatures as representatives of the people to legislate reasonable and justified abortion which is actually terminating a life of an unborn child that also have a right to life as bestowed to all human beings by our creator  these people should understand and respect the states that dont support wanton abortion
no where in the constitution does it say we have the right to kill children
channel  4 news is just another left wing outlet dont expect any objective journalism on this channel  but as a man i believe i also have a right to have a say in this debate seeing as men  can get pregnant too according to the left
this overruling is absolutely outrageous shame on supreme court
a truly historical day for helpless children brilliant great news
were putting the life of women against future leaders this is sick women want tooo much of everything
baby murderers have a big ego dont they they wanna fight for their right to murder babies what a sickening thought which they want to make it a right disgracefully satanic
"taking away a womens right to choose
oh great  so you can define woman now"
whats sad about all this is there will likely be another rittenhouse case by the time all this is over does no one ever look back at history and learn
it wasnt turned over in an instant u can still get an abortion
"god bless america  trump 2024 
enough with these snowflakes"
"this was recently posted and is something for the
supreme court to consider
can a 13year old girl adopt a baby if she wants to
no obviously not are you nuts
what about a 15year old girl can she adopt a baby if
she feels like it
absolutely not
how about an 18year old girl surely she could adopt a
baby right
still no no way
what if shes 20 no longer a teenager a 20year old
can definitely adopt a baby if she feels like it right
actually no
hm weird why not there are 400000 children in
foster care why cant she adopt at least one of them
she just cant you have to qualify to adopt a child
rigorous background checks home visits proof of
financial and mental stability etc its a whole thing
cool
but if she at 14 gets impregnated by an abusive ex
boyfriend who shoved her out of his moving car and left
her for dead she must carry to term give birth and just
figure it out somehow
yes that is correct
but shes only 14 
she will figure it out she should have been more
careful made better choices
so to punish her for her poor choices we force her
into motherhood which weve established shes totally
unqualified for and now we are suddenly comfortable
with a young traumatized girl caring for a vulnerable
little screaming human being that is wholly reliant on her
for survival
yes absolutely such an unexpected blessing"
being a woman is the hardest thing to be in todays society
so americans can have guns as a constitutional right but they dont have the right to deciding what happens to their bodies
how can people be ok with killing babies
proof that the us is a country full of whores who cant keep their legs shut
there was never a constitutional right to abortion
"they be like
i am so pissed off right now i cant get pregnant just to kill the baby anymore how else will i feel powerful killing kittens and puppies because they get more attention than me is so 2nd thru 12th grade aaaaaggggggggggghhhhh i need my narcissistic supply"
this supposed pro life crowd is not pro life theyre pro forced birth and control of women this isnt your life its not your choice and quite frankly you all dont care what happens to mother and baby afterwards the poorest women in society from deprived backgrounds will be most effected by this disgusting ruling quite frankly why would any young girl want to be born into a world where she has no say the lack of shame from the anti abortion crowd is disgusting
"good job america
this is bright day of america
america become vergin from this law"
americans are so far behind the rest of the world its so sad in debt misinformed and living like its 150 years ago america as i know it wont be around for much longer i think someone will overturn these people and take that land back and i wish i could have been there to see that
its just about control and oppression of women
surely if americans cared about life they would have a proper health system like every other developed country in the world and stop people running around with automatic weapons the richest third world country on earth
stop being a bunch of hoes then
i like how the interviewer was scoffing and talking over the prolife advocate but she wasnt saying anything to the prochoice advocate
if she comes to britain she will get her abortion on the n h s free r a
point to where the constitution of the united states says that we can murder unborn children to excuse sexual depravity
outside of rape sexual abuse and the life of the mother being under threat i dont believe abortion should be legal keep your legs closed
womens bodies are their own not their countrys
us is not more free country unfortunately
"this is scary

home of the free what a fucking joke"
in many countries they abort only female embryosmaybe that is why there are born 107 boys to 100 girls
wow i was told the bbc is garbage now but actually worse this news channel is leftist scum
on this morning ten years from now there will be thousands of american children making there way to school who only exist because president trump decided to protect them
she is on video admitting she lied and nothing happened but an agenda
cope and seethe
no women from red states should be allowed into blue states to get an abortion no registered republicon women should be allowed to get an abortion in any blue states no evangelical christian women of which there are many should be allowed into blue states for an abortion we all know conservative women have the bulk of abortions but until they come out of the closet stand up for themselves and vote appropriately they need to take their pregnancies to term those born should then be required to be placed into conservative and republicon households to raise if the mothers are unmarried then any one of the supreme court justices who voted for this ban should be listed as the father on the birth certificates they should then be sued for child support
you dont have a right when you have a baby in the wombits not your body your choice anymore when you have a baby growing inside youabortion rips out the baby in pieces and it suffers it is murdershut your legs thats your choice 
baby killers are despicable how can you reason with such serial killers
happiest day of my life 
the best news in fourty years  these millenial  feminists are nuts  murdering babies 
its so sad and unthinkable that this would happen in 2022 so many delusional zealots out there if god existed he wouldnt want a world where people idolise him to their own suffering and the planet is essentially his baby factory in absence of people caring  for moral standing of the people who already live here
unborn babys lives matter
why are media so focused on prolife supporters these people are a mass minority and why are they so focused on the hypothetical situation where other rights are repealed women will suffer and die as a result of these ruling babies will suffer and die as a result of this ruling that should be the story
welcome to the british media where they are eternally committed to bias partiality prejudice and a complete lack of objectivity
a bunch of lunatics crying for the camera
i guess these abortion guys dont know the meaning of not in thou shalt not kill
lol cry me a handful bunch of losers
so murdering a baby is a womans right evil people evil
"copy and pasted please share

im not promurdering babies

im probecky who found out at her 20 week anatomy scan that the infant she had been so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organs

im prosusan who was sexually assaulted on her way home from work only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later

im protheresa who hemorrhaged due to a placental abruption causing her parents spouse and children to have to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or her unborn child

im prolittle cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11 year old body isnt mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal

im promelissa whos working two jobs just to make ends meet and has to choose between bringing another child into poverty or feeding the children she already has because her spouse walked out on her

im probrittany who realizes that she is in no way financially emotionally or physically able to raise a child

im proemily who went through ivf ending up with six viable implanted eggs requiring selective reduction in order to ensure the safety of her and a safe amount of fetuses

im prochristina who doesnt want to be a mother but birth control methods sometimes fail

im projessica who is finally getting the strength to get away from her physically abusive spouse only to find out that she is carrying the monsters child

im provanessa who went into her confirmation appointment after years of trying to conceive only to hear silence where there should be a heartbeat

im prolindsay who lost her virginity in her sophomore year with a broken condom and now has to choose whether to be a teenage mom or just a teenager

im procourtney who just found out shes already 13 weeks along but the egg never made it out of her fallopian tube so either she terminates the pregnancy or risks dying from internal bleeding

you can argue and say that im prochoice all you want but the truth is
im prolife

you dont get to pick and choose which scenarios should be accepted

womens rights are meant to protect all women regardless of their situation

roevwade prochoice abortion women womensrights mybody mychoice mybodymychoice

"why dont they grow up learn to say no

constitutional right fake news
they didnt make the procedure illegal for birthing people look up any democratic tv appearances for reference aoc cant even say pregnant woman  it left it up to states which means the court left it up to the voters it has 81 million plus votes guaranteed based on last election 
they love screaming my body my choice but when you ask theyll all in favour of the government forcing a jab on you
they didnt exactly pick the brightest of the bunch to defend the overturning of roe
trump does not feel a thing for women who have abortions look this up  he has been quoted quite a large amount of times for saying women who have abortions should serve prison timehe does not know a blank thing about abortions he is the biggest fool in the world trump needs to serve prison timenow
this does not violate womens rights abortion violates babies lives by killing their life do women have a right to kill babies no thats like saying a gunman has the right to shoot up a school  quit playing game using misleading words  perhaps all you baby killers secretly applaud school shootings  abortions and school shootings results in the same atrocity
"sustainable communities are you kidding me the right want to be prolife for a clump of cells but not probaby or child to ensure children dont go hungry not profamily because they shoot down family leave no access to affordable housing all you are doing is making more kuds born in poverty and a rise in child abuse and neglect when parents are stressed and cant afford to care for them not only that but parents who never wanted them to begin with that breeds abuse as well

this prolife woman is a fucking joke"
babies have rights now
your body is your choice the body of your child born or not yet is not
"fascists nobody should tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her body

stopping the killing of  babies is not going in opposite direction of freedom
how dare this woman narrator saying killing a baby is a right

rightousness exalted a nation but sin is a reproach to any people god is with america abortion is murder murder is murder dose not the unborn have rights

look if you dont follow the bible to a t dont correct people and be like it doesnt say that in the bible bc imma just hit you with that do you carry you cross daily do you actually read what youre saying are gods words or does it just sound nice coming out of your mouth at the end of the day if you dont want the baby just give it to a foster home bc of your scenario so heshe can live a shitty life and probably repeat the cycle or even better raise it when youre not able to because of the abusive relationship youre in or the fact you got raped and youre only 15 now you have to raise a kid thatll be 18 before youre 35 all because of prolifers think that their opinion should overrule a constitutional right
wow what a lying headline and people actually believe this if its not in the constitutionwhatever it defaults to the tenth amendmentif you have a pocket version of the constitution and can readthe tenth amendment gives the power to the individual states the right to an abortion  has not be overturned what a bunch of simpletonswho havent read the us constitution
so sad they mad because they cant murder their baby what does god think of this these woman our beside themselves what about the babies life dose not the baby deserve to live people get darker and more selfish everyday
why why not focus on the mass shootings going across america
whats that poll you cited where you state the majority of people want abortions in the us because thats simply not true
so many ugly angry females i approve
the same women who cry about roe v wade being overturned are the same ones who condone trans men competing against biological women in sports
the right to a babys life trumps your right to kill whatever you want cope and seethe 
june 24th is constitution day needs to become a new national holiday

well wellfor those women that like to play loose loose aint gone be no more just going to the abortion clinic better start taking accountability for that area and start making your flings wrap it up lol
keep your knickers on or use contraception very biased report
its not in the constitution of the usa abortion
for all the toddlers watching this video the justices on the supreme court are supposed to act by the constitution not by there political views so most likely if the scotus is not bs than there was something wrong with row v wade when it was introduced in 1973
their very purpose is not to protect civil liberties the scotus is there to protect the constitution  against all
thank you to all the supreme justices and president trump
greatest scotus decision ever
life is a human right the right to murder is not a right
if the protesters were aborted we wouldnt have protests now would we
"hey correct your report

abortion is not in the constitution"
the civil rights for women have not been done away with woman still has the right to vote a woman still has the right to medical attention
lol  my body my choice  lol  aint nobody trying to dump a load in any of those nasty bitches
feminists lost yeah womens right to murder
usa they are back to the dark ages laughing stock what happens to victims of rape morons
will the jewish people love a 45 year old catholic polish women as their jewish messiah thats how i already revealed myself back in october my name is magdalena this time if thats not enough proof that jesus was a messiah then there is another one everything god showed me and told me happened outside god is not inside the churches and he is not against the abortion time for change in america is now
abortion isnt a constitutional right stop misinforming people
being so evil that you are angry that you can no longer murder innocent babies on the tax payers dime
they just want to kill you all anyway now they can do it without remorse
"now democracy can work through this people
not through unelected judges"
well time to schedule a hysterectomy
hahaha who knew that in 2022 millions of americans plus few judges at the supreme court can be so primitive and backwards damn the aliens looking down on us must be stupefied at the ferocity with which some humans are fighting against evolution and progress  and all this because of the weakest link in human dnathe need to invent gods to worship and give them excuses for their bad decisions in life 
heres an idea to all those all upset over this decision  ever heard of birth control contraceptives  swallowing  having your tubes tied   biden and the democrats are making very inflammatory remarks which are putting peoples safety in jeopardy and should be held accountable for their  violent rhetoric
some of these idiots really dont care  meaning those who support abortion they just see it as a reason to show their stupidity and their asses   bunch of brain dead mentally deficient sheep
sick purple hair women love killing innocent babies
"theyve gone against the will of the people
justices are supposed to interpret law not create it it doesnt matter if they go against the will of the people if roe is bad precedent justices arent supposed to go along with it anyway just because most people support the outcome"
abortion is like murder it takes a soul for pleasure
lame reporting  so biased
having to drive one state over to get an abortion must be really hard
real women are happy
the best way to end this fiasco would be for all the women made to give birth to these unwanted little cabbages would be to leave them on the steps of the supreme court you forced us to have them now you fucking raise them
the thumbnail is priceless
"not including exceptions for rape incest and life of the mother in jeopardy isnt pro life its just anti woman targetting contraception gives the game away contraception prevent abortions
so this was never just about abortion oh gay rights next hmm who has less abortions than gay people nobody

this was never about life
this was never about abortion

its a theoretical power grab 
plain and simple"
well get to berlin calm down there ji joe ha
nope the majority was very pleased

im moving to alabama to be a coat hanger salesmancoz business is about to be good
im pro choice but chanting its a human right just sounds so bad
sleepy joe killing babies has nothing to do with rights why not die first

"nice to see that america is ruled by talebans
a fucked up country where the right to have a gun outweighs the right of a woman to decide of her life clap clap clap"
"so a girl gets pregnant through rape and she has to keep it lol a woman has the right to choose what happens to her body

the us is nuts happy 4th of july everybody "
terrorist supreme court great nation
no one gives a f about what biden thinks
" an estimated 62 million 
abortions have occurred 
since roe vs wade decision 
in 1973

39 roughly 2418 million
innocent so called 
black babies

have been 
butchered  murdered 
in this henious manner"
"this is about human rights the critical point lies where the law considers a right arises on account of one being human  according to the law in short it is the law that decides when you or anybody else is deemed to be a human being pro  abortionsists have just lost at a federal level 
im sure that there must be much more to it but essentially pro life relies upon ethics whilst pro  abortion relies upon the law suppose the law were changed tomorrow and demands that a person only achieves the status of a human being on reaching the age of 1 year and 1 day  
this is the law which pro  abortionsist rely upon "
thank god  lets get our country back  trump 2024 
they want to ban abortion more than guns
the majority of the american people are pro choice how is it possible that the least majority ruling passed thats not democracy they will slowly but surely take away your basic human rights
incredible  who would have thought the same people who want to kill babies just because would become violent  take away the democrats slaves they start a civil war you make killing innocent babies a little more difficult they riot
this british hag isnt bias at all 
theres gonna be alot of dead women on the back streets of america well done how dare anyone tell any woman what to do with there bodies im irish repeal the 8th and we will repeal it again i can not believe america has actually done this
my body my choice its not just your body anymore once your pregnant
you never had the right to abortion
they wanna stop women aborting kids but wont protect them at school makes sense 
this is really the world we all live in  this whole situation desensitizing the idea of killing a baby whether your pro choice or life its messed up
"abortion is the only law in the world im aware of that may condemn the totally innocent to death abortionist appologists will cite rapeincest disease as excuses to abort a baby ok  ill give you every rape disease incest and will ask only one thing in return  that you give me every child that would otherwise be born perfectly healthy except for abortion and without being subject to those inhibitions ive mentioned
a deal would prevent 96 of abortions deal "
"excelent finally america does something right
hopefully this insidious method of infant killing will become a crime in all 51 states"
this is what you get for making us deal with biden  ha ha
"and i saw the dead small and great standing before god and books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life 
and the dead were judged according to their works by the things which were written in the books
the sea gave up the dead who were in it and death and hades delivered up the dead who were in them and they were judged each one according to his works 
then death and hades were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and anyone not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire revelation 201215 nkjv


today while you are still alive and able may you repent from your sins believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that jesus christ is your lord and savior so that through him your name will be written in the book of life 


for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him 
should not perish but have everlasting life 
for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved john 31617 nkjv


jesus loves you he died on the cross so that you may have life 
please dont ever forget that"
my body my choice but a while ago these jackasses were forcing people to get a stupid vaccine
only fair they take away gun rights
"ive had my fill of pro  abortionists telling me with glee that it is their right to take life away from the womb designed to nourish it your turns with your laws 
say on"
stupid humans they need to  go to war bums
this is a religious agenda forcing beliefs on someone else will always be wrong god has giving us all the power of choice  our actions will be judged at the end next itll probably be contraception because its wrong according to someones religious agenda
boo hoo selfish entitled snowflakes are melting
i kill a pregnant woman its considered double homicide please tell me how you can kill a child its not your choice to murder a child and if it is then we live in a very dangerous world
the woman that advicted for this actually had her kid and said she regretted even getting this whole movement started
why are liberals crying i honestly dont get it you can still get an abortion in a blue state more importantly you can use birth control and not get pregnant
looks like the souths gonna breed more idiots with this trollish law they gonna have to foot a massive rise in welfare payments too uneducated is the way republicans like em
now u need to think before having coitus
and all the ignorant weep
the power and love of god will always always triumph against evilfor the real innocent
the pro murders are all upset if its your body your choice then dont get pregnant there are only a couple of reasons for abortion and it has nothing to do with birth control murders go to prison for murders but women killing there babies are ok you people are sick
what about mens rights and a babies rights
stop screwing strangers raw and letting them bust inside you
not all women are for abortion not all women think abortion advances womens rights i am not pissed she does not speak for me
idrc about abortion but this is funny asf
this is so biased terrible reporting from channel 4 britain has succumb to the woke mob i guess im very shocked at america though they did a lovely thing yesterday i just hope it stays this way as for channel 4 im never taking this institution serious again
the supreme court is illegitimate
theyre all so eager to go to place where you can unintentionally get pregnant and then just leave all accountability on the operating table why not just be a responsible human being in the first place and you wont have to worry
why are lesbians so concerned about abortion
women are crying cz they cant enjoy raw doggie anymore 
all i can say is you made your bednow lay in it stop asking for hand outs
so simple ladies keep your legs closed act like ladies and do something productive with your lives all this crying and complaining about being able to kill your own child in the womb speaks volumes about your character or lack thereof
there was never a constitutional right to abortion thats what this entire case is about it has nothing to do with religion or reducing the amount of abortions the original decision was not the legally correct one abortion regulation belongs in the states not the federal government state elections will now have a lot more relevance and people will need to do better research on the the people they elect who are directly responsible for making laws america will be fine vote wisely for the people making the laws in your state
how anyone could consider this unbiased reporting is beyond me
this is when the fan begins
"first they came for the black community
and i did not speak out
because i was not black
then they came for gay people
and i did not speak out
because i was not gay
then they came for trans people
and i did not speak out
because i was not a trans
then they came for the women
and i did not speak out
because i was not a women
then they came for me

to speak out for me"
"unfortunately this mass butchering of babies will likely continue in the democrats demonic blue states in california and new york out of defiance it might even increase overall though the infanticide numbers will almost certainly decrease and those numbers are almost too horrific to comprehend
since roe became the law of the land in 1973 63 million innocent babies have been slaughtered sixtythree million lives were snuffed out almost all for convenience purposes every life saved by the supreme courts dobbs decision is an innocent and precious life"
now i understand why god chose trump as president hallelujah
god bless all prolifers
making abortion illegal is the sort of thing the taliban would do america land of individual free choice  hahaha
this will be reversed
they should realize every unborn child has the right to live the same way the people marching against the ruling has a right to live meaning no one aborted them if they were aborted they wouldnt be there to march period  they should look in the mirror  realize that its selfish when you have many women that cant have children  adoption exist its alright to save the whales  all other wildlife but not a human being thats the most illiterate unethical thing to do on earth humanity should be ashamed of itself especially if youre in support of abortion humans not even satisfied with the gift of life
all the proabortion have the right to protest as they are alive to do so
so season 5 of the handmaids tale has finally landed in june  i live in romania where for like 50 years abortions were banned due to ceaușescu regime search for it so many women died due to unsafe abortions and many unwanted kids were born that fat lady speaking is disgusting  what a time to be alive dogs have more rights than women in usa
first it has nothing to do with the constitution  now someone cant get drunk screw someone in a bar drunk and throw the baby in the trash can
channel 4 lefties deliberately misinterpreting facts so they can shtt stirr up as much hate fear and confusion as possible  just another working day at the left  misrepresent act the victim and bin the facts
gigabased supreme court i am ecstatic over this decision
"it didnt abolish abortion it made it state by state so know you need to use your votes in your state to keep it a state law

and abortion is not a constitutional right idk where they got that from "
apparently not even overseas universities can teach reading or critical thinking so sad
we outlawed murder and its still happens we need to legalize murder so it can be done safely sounds logical 
this is definitely gonna increase lesbianism in women

"the silent scream

 warning this documentary is not recommended for sensitive people

the documentary the silent scream released in 1984 contributed to the abortion debate in the 1980s

dr bernard nathansons classic video shocked the world he explains the procedure of a suction abortion followed by an actual firsttrimester abortion as seen through ultrasound the viewer can see the childs pathetic attempts to escape the suction curette as her heart rate doubles and the fetus girl opened its mouth in what nathanson calls a silent scream as her body is torn apart

the clip begins with an ultrasound of the fetus girl who is about to be aborted the girl is moving in the womb displays a heartbeat of 140 per minute and is at times sucking her thumb as the abortionists suction tip begins to invade the womb the child rears and moves violently in an attempt to avoid the instrument her mouth is visibly open in a silent scream the childs heart rate speeds up dramatically to 200 beats per minute as she senses aggression she moves violently away in a pathetic attempt to escape the instrument the abortionists suction tip begins to rip the babys limbs from its body ultimately leaving only her head in the uterus too large to be pulled from the uterus in one piece the abortionist attempts to crush her head with his forceps allowing it to be removed to dehumanize the procedure the abortionist and anesthesiologist refer to the babys head as number 1 the abortionist crushes number 1 with the forceps and removes it from the uterus


"
im dying over the idea that this is the time to enact progressive legislation to assist pregnant women the trigger laws have been lingering for some time and the agenda even longer theres been more than enough time to create the type of environment that encouraged women to avoid abortion if you think some backwater state like mo is killing themselves to put out paid maternity leave increased min wage low cost college low cost daycare early childhood education or even healthcare for these women then i have a really nice bridge to show you if your probirth i expect you to start emptying your wallet in support im f fetus mean that much to you than show jesus how much you love him by doing your duty as christians otherwise youre just another disgusting hypocrite who imposed their will on someone else without their consent
love these lefty meltdowns
now go arrest all those involved in the murder of children in the wombdisgusting low lifesand the women who aborted their child
the most vengeful member is clarence thomas uncle thomas still remembers women like anita hills complaint and representative bennie thompson 2014 who called him an uncle tom the january 6th committee coming after his wife now everyone is going to pay
thank god these snow flakes dont make laws
your body your choice well does that mean rapists and murders have a choice too
even murders have their own choice does it make it right
murdering babies for money is unjust if you not want a baby then dont get pregnant
whaaaai cant  murder my baby without spending gas to drive
amazing you may actually have to take some responsibility for actions that is like criptonite to liberals
"liberal tears 
"
my body my choice doesnt matter once u put another human in harms way for your own selfish gains
on a positive note we now have a clear definition of what defines a woman if you can have a fetus inside you and you can choose to terminate that fetus then you are a woman because as of the yesterday we were all unclear what a woman was especially for the democratics
in 1970s the us was able to go to the moon
"pro life should be the way right
if abortion is ok then it should be ok for people that want to  die with the help of doctors"
"i give you one guess which states are more touched by teenage pregnancy those states will now see an increase in teenage mom school drop out and poverty 
blue states will be fine they will maintain abortion safe legal and accessible 
republicans acting against the interest of their own states imagine that"
dumb poor people v rich smart people 2022 colourised
all those guns and the only ones that get shot are children a nation of sycophantic cowards to let those judges keep walking

"more fake narratives being created and controlled by the puppet masters  
the more divide they create the better things are 
its a endless sitcom and the government is the lead actors"
stop killing babies u cream gobblers
there wouldnt be a functioning society without women  mam society wouldnt survive without kids
all ya gotta do is keep your legs closed or use protection whats the issue here we are all adults and sensible right guess not 
"it is the right decision because it is not the role of judges to create and amend laws in a democracy but the role of the nations democratically elected representatives in the nations parliament to create the laws and regulations the electorate voted for and remove the laws and regulations the electorate voted to repeal or amend

in the usa it is not the duty of judges to create constitutional rights but the elected representatives of the usa

with the original roe versus wade judgement the supreme court loaded with left wing activist judges usurped us democracy laid out within the us constitution  i recall the critical words of the 6 to 3 vote judgement of the current supreme court to the effect that the courts judgement correctly returned the decision to the nations elected representatives to legislate what was right for each state in the absence of national legislation and for the us congress and senate to legislate a nationwide law  something the democrats holding the house the senate and the presidency can do and should have done decades ago but didnt do because they like the fact that activist left wing supreme court judges holding a majority on the supreme court can undermine us democracy whereas the right in the us believe in judges that interpret and uphold the law as it is defined us congress and senate and the congress and senates of the individual states       the issue has been to the existing elected representatives of each state and the us congress and senate to decide and for the electorate to use their votes to elect representatives that will implement the abortion laws the electorate want locally and nationally 

in the uk it was the nations elected representatives on a free vote in the westminster parliament in 1967 on a private members bill introduced by david steele mp that created legalised consensual abortion in the uk  the time limit set for an abortion in 1967 was 28 weeks based on the age of a viable foetus because it was deemed unacceptable to terminate a viable foetus as killing a live aborted foetus outside the womb was murder       since the uk abortion law was passed in parliament medical advances mean the age of a viable foetus has decreased considerably and sooner or later the existing law will be modified to reduce the time limit for an abortion to match the current age of a viable foetus     in 1990 the human fertilisation and embryology bill 1990 reduced the time limit to 24 weeks in line with the then viability age for a human foetus combined with removing some restrictions on late abortions where there was a risk to life for the pregnant woman and severe fetal abnormality was identified          in the 2008 human fertilisation and embryology bill 2008 debated reducing the the time limit for abortions from 24 weeks to 22 weeks or 20 weeks based upon medical advances reducing the age of a viable foetus but voted to retain the 24 week time limit

the uk experience is that the national parliament is the right place to openly and publically debate and decide on controversial issues like abortion like it did in 1967 with the 1967 abortion act and openly and publically debate and decide on changes as it did with the 1990 and 2008 human fertilisation and embryology acts"
im divided on this issue and i respect both views and the rights of individuals to back one way or the other if you are for abortion id ask you to contemplate 3 things then if you are still pro abortion fine 1 research and understand the medical process that occurs and the way in which a babies life is ended 2 accept the possibility that you could have been aborted had you been inconvenient  how do you feel about that 3 accept that 50 of women who do abort their child are deeply troubled by what they did for the rest of their days this issue is far more complex than it appears and politicising it is a very sad thing
cope and seethe baby killers you dont have a right to kill children  tell moloch to get his tribute in another form
biased much channel 4

"illegal to have an abortion but perfectly fine to gun kids down in school

"chanel 4 opening with a stupid statement just so you know the supreme court is not there to protect civil rights its there to rule on what is constitutional or not the legislative branch voted in by the people are the ones to protect civil rights get it right

1973 justices and of casey pulled this nonexistent right out of their empty black top hats if you want it there then persuade your fellow citizens to amend the constitution"
"my country feedback 

welcome  to the human race
everything and everyone regardless of race color creed ethnicity national origin gender age spirituality orientation is under strict scrutiny now
no one is exempt no one is exceptional
the proliferation of tragedy makes it necessary to scrutinize even those in our nation who may be entirely perfect in every way
everyone just has to tough it our without whining forgive my candor and frankness
this is a tough transition period for the whole nation including our nations capitol
many of those who have led privileged lives are slipping from grace
it is because of the proliferation of gross darkness from our nations capitol from border to border and from coast to coast because of all of the tragedies one tragedy followed by another and another the darkness is exposed long is the way and hard that leaders up to light john milton paradise
hate is hard on everyone not just asians
so what if white people dont like you asians even jesus said think it not strange when people hate you and undervalue you count yourself blesses when people hate you if jesus christ said  it thats good enough for me

these days being a progressive involves murdering your unborn baby chopping your genitals off and taking children to story time read by a pervert in a dress
what about childrens right to live murder is not legal
it was never a constitutional right
maybe i missed something but cant you use protection to not get pregnant so what are these women crying about
"ive noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born

ronald reagan"
the rights of all americans are slowly being taken away wake up people before it is to late
doing good deeds or trying to change certain things doesnt get you into heaven let others that choose abortion deal with god themselves that is not anyones decision to make he who is without sin cast the first stone god gave us free will to make the decisions we choose to cause in the end we will face him on judgement day if you are judging women on their decision to abortion be prepared to be judged as well by god as you judge other you will face the same judgment in heaven when your time comes
finally fetal lives matter glory be to jesus
this channel is a rag 
women in the womb now have rights  american woman here and i am relieved
it was never mentioned in the us constitution hence its up to the states to decide
who gives a sh it about this british channel stay off our land this doesnt concern you 1776 let us remind you 
imagine crying because a baby will live  hotgirlsummercanceled
liberty to kill a baby stfu morons
no more f u kingno more f u king if you want a weaner then go find a fake one if you want a weaner then go find a fake one no more f u king no more f u king   while chanting down the road with a group of people and a drum roll tshirts soon be made
wow so much for journalistic impartiality no wonder why this video has so many dislikes
how tf are we going back in progress
the scotus propaganda should babysit for poor people then
i hope america isnt planning on leading the free world with this ruling nobody is following you down that road
she lies not a constitutional right we are a step closer to stop abortion completely stop the lies not constitutional right just murder
this happened because trump was a serial liar and lying supreme court judges lying under oath should be in prison
cry me a fucking river comparing it to normandy how dare you make such a comparison you jackass
hey all you religious nut bags if you dont want abortions then dont fcking have one keep your crazy religious beliefs to yourself you dont give a fck about these unwanted children after theyre born but youre obsessed about them before it its sad to see america go down the toilet but down it goes anyway
as a german its just scary to hear americans still make wwii mentions on the weirdest occasions hopefully this guy knows that europe is a lot more progressive than his third world country with a gucci belt your country is delusional
"its about time america stopped willfull murder of the innocent
thank you prez trump"
now the supreme court should ban assault rife cause it take a childs life too
god bless the usa
good bye woke culture  and good riddance
this is just like that movie the handjobs tail
god is punished you for killing babys 
shouldnt it be a womans choice over her own body 
completely wrong take on scotus taking away rights from women they actually are giving rights back to the people to decide on how to handle abortion going forward and in doing so giving rights to the unborn who have a right to life just as anyone alive today
nowhere in the american constitution does it say anything about abortion so they arent losing any rights you take away our guns you aint getting abortion
the conservatives love all life until it starts school then their only advice is duck and cover
"let the freaks breed  
no more murder for the irresponsible"
great step in the right direction for america
forcing a women to give birth to an unwanted child will have devastating effects on this country
use protection and you wont need abortion  plain and simple 
that thumbnailoy vey
"then jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples the teachers of the law and the pharisees sit in moses seat so you must be careful to do everything they tell you but do not do what they do for they do not practice what they preach they tie up heavy cumbersome loads and put them on other peoples shoulders but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them everything they do is done for people to see they make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called rabbi by others

but you are not to be called rabbi for you have one teacher and you are all brothers and do not call anyone on earth father for you have one father and he is in heaven nor are you to be called instructors for you have one instructor the messiah the greatest among you will be your servant for those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted

you shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or in the earth beneath or in the waters below you shall not bow down to them or worship them for i the lord your god am a jealous god punishing the children for the sin of the parents up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments

if my people who are called by my name humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked ways i will hear from heaven will forgive their sins and will heal their land

and when you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others truly i tell you they have received their reward in full
but when you pray go into your room close the door and pray to your father who is unseen then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you
and when you pray do not keep on babbling like pagans for they think they will be heard because of their many words do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him

this then is how you should pray

our father in heaven
hallowed be your name
your kingdom come
your will be done
on earth as it is in heaven
give us today our daily bread
and forgive us our debts
as we also have forgiven our debtors
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from the evil one

for if you forgive other people when they sin against you
your heavenly father will also forgive you
but if you do not forgive others their sins
your father will not forgive your sins

matthew 57 niv bible gateway we can use google search
these are the teachings
the righteousness of our lord jesus christ our god
repent and start doing what is right
if you abide my teachings you are really my disciples
then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free

yet a time is coming and has now come
when the true worshipers will worship the father in the spirit and in truth for they are the kind of worshipers the father seeks
god is spirit so his worshipers must worship in the spirit and in truth

in the new heaven and the new earth
only righteousness dwells
may the spirit of our lord jesus christ our god be with you all"
liberal commies got worthless biden and republicans got right to life

this british reporter should verse herself on the american constitution
"this was never a constitutional right
theyre just stirring up the crowd"
nice to see c4 being neutral killing a baby is a womans right apparently
c4 is doing most of the festering it was never a constitutional right  simply a correction late term abortions are evil i hope they restrict them the question is when is a baby a fetus at what point are you saying that you can no longer kill it at present its legal up to full term in some states which is abhorrent
ohhhh noooo you mean i have to be careful about not getting pregnant now  this is outrageoussssss
great day for the us and the world
want to get your rights back vote democrat in november
chanel  4 obviously  have no  clue  about american constitution
beautifully bias reporting
hard to believe that killing kids was wrongcrazy right
womens  rights to abortion 
"wow biggest klan rally ever so many  kkk ladies there
over half of abortions are black
since 1973 over 19000000 dead black babies and these people want to keep those blacks from even being born"
womens right to do what exactly  kill their baby i swear usa is morally bankrupt
how can you defend killing a baby because you dont want to be a responsible adult  pure murder
this will only affect poor women and girls who have the misfortune to live in the wrong states
oo boo you cant kill your baby any more 
there was never a right to abortion  give it up already 
looks like whole nationss population on steroids 
this is sad i wonder if many americans will move away now
i believe we are witnessing the beginning of the break up of the union
hoes mad abortion was never a constitutional right nowhere in the constitution does it say someone has the right to end a childs life
lets remember the case brought before the court was a state that had a 15 week ban 15 weeks is more than enough time to deal with a pregnancy but that wasnt good enough it was the liberals who brought this to the supreme court
if a woman is raped should they not be allowed to have an abortion 
"you say this takes away rightsno it has given them to unborn babies

great day for the unbornbad day for those that seek to murder them"
its the same people advocating for disempowering women who are also proguns interesting isnt it
cringe watching liberals
"its not a right keep your legs crossed and youll have nothing to protest
see how simple its called responsibility but of course you dont want to hear that 
it makes too much sense"
news flash roe vs wade has been obsolete since the 80s   do your own research casey  vs planned parenthood  btw  rbg thought row vs wade was a bad law and said so many times  stop believing what you are told and learn how to think for yourself
they say abortion is murdering a human but then they are happy for everyone to have a gun backwards country horrific abortions are a right for every woman and its disgusting to take that away from them
two sides of the story womens rights vs the unborn babys rights to life remember only the women can express themselves here the unborn babies who may well have a bright future cannot
for every prolifer hand them a child unwanted that wasnt terminated by abortion they wont take the unwanted child and yet they will tell others they must just what we need more unwanted kids roaming the streets if we think the jihadists in the middle east were a threat to the world these right to lifers are worse prolifers have bombed and killed people in their quest to control others trump strikes again with the support of majority in the supreme court which has fallen from grace
time to learn to swallow ladies
"its great news to hear  that roe v wade is being over turned
its about time you stop the killing  of the innocent 
i here a lot of women and girls say its my body my choice yes that sounds just about right from a sinner who doesnt know the real truth about what they are doing 
it was the almighty god that gave you the opportunity to be born and to inter his world  but you cant see beyond your selfcentered wicked heart   to show mercy to the unborned
woman has always wanted to choose what is not right for the family  it started in the garden of eden the great rebellion yes i know you dont believe it but it is true even if you die not believing any of itit still will go on with are with out you 

there are many women and girls who have chosen to do the right thing and show mercy to unbornbut there are still many spiritual blinded daughters of the almighty god who have chosen rebellion your rewards will come faster than the wind and in that day you will call for mercy  but because you have not chosen wisely there will not be any for you in your time of troubles
roe v wade is a tool used by the devil to kill as many unborn as possible to stop the plans of the almighty god but it have never worked 
he the devil tried to stop the almighty god in the days of old egypt   when the  pharaohs of egypt was killing the first born of the children of israel to stop the almighty gods plans but it did not work 
so if you are one of those who wants  abortion youre working for the devileven if you do not believe  this devil exist he the devil is working in you every time you decide to kill the unborned childyour murderer by the almighty god standards"
"yall so prolife but dont think about
the lives of the mothers or orphans
or foster children or the poor or the
abused kids whose parents didnt
want them yall just care about the
fetuses you didnt help make wont
raise and wont think about once
theyre born save it"
i cant understand why women want to kill their tiny helpless babies stop humping everything in sight and your problem might go away
um all they said was this was a legislative issue not a judicial one
same people screaming my body my choice had a different opinion when it came to the vaccines feckin hypocrites just use contraception abortion is not birth control its that simple
i had a coke bottle stuck in my rear and my father found a man who removed it in a dusty storefront take that sc
you notice these protesters women mainly are speaking in terms of themselves and not defending the aborted lives its not about the aborted livesits about their decision making and no longer having the ability to clean up their reckless actions that led to legalized murder
women rights what about babies rights
i have boxes of coat hangers 18off today
i mean not killing people sounds pretty constitutional to me sound pretty unconstitutional to be able to choose to kill people
this is all donald trumps and that turtle mitch mcdonnell fault packing the court with these underwhelming and underqualified justices just to take away rights prolife and proguns  assault weapons lack of universal health care for poor people all at the same time  this law is going to significantly increase the amount of poor abuses children in foster care system for sure
how did i guess left wing channel 4 would be against this ruling  they are literally killing a baby its not right
028 no the purpose of the scotus is not to protect civil liberties that is a lie the purpose of the scotus is to determine what laws are and are not constitutional
our countrys people is too damn focused on other peoples lives instead of their own live your own life worry about your own life stop trying to run someone elses does my decisions affect your household no cause u dont know me you dont pay my bills you dont raise my kids i dont ask you for a handout or help so everyone needs to mind their business stay out of a womans decision goverment trying to tell parents that if their child is trans its abuse on what they decide for their child but when it comes to schools and education parents have the right to decide with covid its your body to decide but abortion its not your body stop being hypocrites
the sexual revolution has failed its failed everyone men women and children we need a counterrevolution a revolution of love life truth peace nonviolence and hope
"my body my choice really
then why do you force everyone to get the covid vaccine"
could we please stop saying this is about womens rights and womens bodies its not men can get pregnant too
protect yourselves at these protests proud boys and the like will be there to push some buttons i trust the protesters will behaves not so much the other side dont despair this is going to backfire on the court  more republican woman are on row wade side and red states will turn blue for the next three elections our only issue now is the alt right will take by force what they can not win we may need to armtrain ourselves or be run down
uneducated and the left media and the leftist states just dont want to do any reserch to find out the truth it was never a constitunal right it was never backed by more americans more americans do not want killing babies legal its simple just do some reserch the media must stop lieing and dividing america more than it is
"take responsibility baby killers  womens rights to sleep around without consequences or contraception taken away  
cry me a salty river "
so happy
why is a white man talking about abortion it has nothing to do with him so he needs to shut up
my body my choice nah not really the man should have a say since he is 50 why there is a baby in a womans womb also the baby has rights
why is there a jewess  blubbing on the thumbnail  does this affect that sect at all
i am enjoying their pain so much hopefully we can take everything democrats value from them
why should your religion decide what women do with their bodies this shouldnt even be up for debate america is going backwards
abortion is not addressed in the constitution therefore it falls in the category of states rights each state can decide their abortion laws independent of the heavy hand of the federal government deciding what are the rules and regulations
the right to choose is freedom

what unbelievable trash this report is
lots of violence lots of rioting
channel 4 is leftist trash
how are they going to sell baby parts
winner winner chicken dinner baby their tears fuel my powers
channel 4 is fake news
look at all the indoctrinated idiots look at the guy comparing this to the normandy landings these people are delusional and without common sense theyve allowed themselves to be fooled by politics and religion
an oldfashioned constitution that does not really care for equality and freedom sucks i feel so sick incest and rape are no longer treated as something worse than a woman deciding about her life wtf is this country doing justices who were not elected by the people are now enforcing their will on said people women
how is abortions a womans right and child has not even the right to life
watching these murderers cry brings so much joy
there is no constitutional right to abortion
"there will be no functioning society without women
so stop killing them in the wombs"
privatize abortion in all cases except for cases for rape and danger to mothers health problem solved
this is disturbing women crying that they may not be able to murder babies anymore in their state degenerate democrats
what do you mean by woman
i love it
it was never a constitutional right it violates the constitutions right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
only the crazy women are pissed the rest of us are good with the decision
democracy  1 roe vs wade  0 
religious people are rlly something else shoving their beliefs down our throats
abortion is murder go throw a temper tantrum because you cant kill an innocent life 
abortion was never in the constitution
great day for america go supreme court
how dare people have accountability for their actions 
im pretty sure god wouldnt be ok with killing a baby bible says he hand formed us in the womb but he allows freedom which can sometimes suck like when it comes to killing a baby in the womb
travel to california  get your abortion and visit disneyland before going home
they go on about womans right yet they dont give a toss about their rights when  allowing  biological men in their sports and locker rooms
the face on that thumbnail is some bulletproof contraception
644 that many women had enjoyed there you said thats why its gone because
women taking away other womens rights fir self determination sad day in america
these people dont realise if their parents had an abortion they wouldnt be here to protest
this is disgusting  it is such a step backwards i could understand the views of prolife if they focused on the existing children that are suffering and need help on top of this many women have been abusedraped or subject to abusive relationships where the child would be at a detriment what about them this negatively impacts poor women  the most marginalised women this is not progressive at all sorry this is just ridiculous
abortion lives fucking matter in the name of the 6 religions and blacks and whites
this reporter is a pandering idiot
you can see a massive split in america right now that country is prime to explode
finally something good in america
"this is a a very welcome and humane decision  the mass slaughter of babies must stop
roe v wade was an evil antihuman pronazi proinfantacide progenocide and satanic decision
to see feminnazis crying in our streets because  the courts have restricted their right to murder  is a sickening sight  their monstrocity and mendacity  is incredible"
abortion is not murder  in most cases it is an act of mercy for the woman as lots of things can go wrong with contraception and mental illness  all you are doing is making women go through pregnancies they do not want  there will be suicides over this  what about rape
"can we just sweep aside the overly emotive language about foetuses a cluster of cells entirely dependent on the woman is not a human being it is not a child gun violence is the number one killer of actual children in america and the trumpists are as we speak still expanding gun rights 

the us is a country that like saudi and pakistan still practices the death penalty mosty on poor people of colour who could not afford decent legal representation hundreds of people who later turned out to be innocent were tortured and killed trump oversaw more executions in his final days of office than any other president

so please dont pretend that americas protracted violent display of religious fanatism resulting in this supreme court debacle is pro life"
thank god men have gained basic human rights now they dont have to let the women dispose of their baby they also helped make
abortion was never a constitutional right get a grip idiots

"the only reason why this has happened is so the alphabet people can have more children to adopt

youd think the news would have a better understanding of constitutional law dont you idiots have legal experts please point out the amendment or something in the bill of rights that guarantees the right to have an abortion im for common sense abortion laws so why doesnt congress pass one
the woman are pissed  not all of them evidently most notably those who dont believe you have the automatic right to kill another human being
back in her country where things arent so easy my mom had an illegal abortion that couldve cost her life you guys are only stopping legal abortions and putting women in distress in great danger but i guess life or death situations only matter when were talking about a little cluster of cells
abortion is the contraception for slappers anyone with a brain would use a condom or birth control pill

"hey you retards abortion is still legal it just changed from federal control to state control

literally hoes mad
change is coming liberals need to suck it up and accept their own advice
ultimately this discussion is actually about unborn rights not womens rights spoiler alert in a free and fair society with equal protection under the law there are no rights specific to women period especially not at the expense of other peoples rights in this case mens and babies
abortions are not womens rights and its also not a constitutional right
stone age court

biden looks like he was still on the bicycle lol the confusion is unreal
use condoms   how stupid are you people not women want the right to kill a child but the unborn child got no rights  remember if your mother used her right to kill you before you were born you would not be there to want your rights  wake up  it is against the intention of the world
what amendment in the constitution has anything to do with abortion its not a constitutional right
0032 the supreme court whos very purpose is to protect civil liberties took away the constitutional right to get an abortion it was never a constitutional right thats what this whole thing was about if it was then it would have gone the complete opposite way
yall acting crazy we got way important issues then this bullshit 
"the religious nuts are in control disgusting
it is time to protest every day until womans rights are taken back

dumbest bbc commentary yet and that is saying a lot  abortion was never a constitutional right moron

just before midterms what a timing
how big of a pile would 600000 dead babies make   monsters
so what if a 12 year old girl is raped by a family member gets pregnant and wants a termination but its illegal do these people honestly think she should be forced to carry her rapists baby because i certainly dont
its not a constitutional right for abortion read the constitution
this is what happens when you dont understand the constitution of the united states abortion was never in the constitution just a bad ruling along time ago that was corrected
look at the bright side after biden and the democrats are gone from affecting american politics for a long time in the next election more supreme justices will be pro life
why biden not throw putin into the blame pot too
welcome to gilead 2022
we have sat back and allowed the schools and bent msm to turn our children into freaks that turn to violence when things dont go there way and joe blames trump as per usual
now all we need is another republican president of america
"it is a dark day for womens rights throughout the world it is a shameful day i as a woman am no longer legally a human being 
i have nothing else to say"
i support overthrow dont kill unborn children
this news is completely wrong abortion was never a constitutional right news like this is why people are stupid about the laws in the us

us men never had any rights to opt out of fatherhood responsibilities after conception now women in half states wont either getting closer to equality
sinners in the sun 
the irony of this clearly proabortion and prowomans choice outlet interviewinf opposing sides where antiabortion side is a woman and proabortion is a dude
"most of the woke feminazis that are screaming for abortions are lesbians
its something  that dosnt even  affect  them
they are just screaming  narcasistic banshees"
absolutely terrifying
watching this news report intro you wouldnt think it was about killing a human baby these news organisations are nothing more than political activists
blame trump for everything lol i love it they make themselves look so stupid then some european moron thinks abortion is a right lol
women are pissed i only see happy women
i seen alot of happy women
"jesus christ is our saviour he died for our sins was buried and rose again the third day 
jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life

and just like that the left knows what a woman is
except it was never part of the constitution so stop reporting lies
even in nazi russia abortion is a basic human right i guess usa has less human rights than russia
welcome to north korea oops i mean usa where unelected 9 that stay for life can strip away human rights from half of the countrys population how embarrassing
the beginning of something great just happenedthank god
thank you president trump your right to not have a baby comes before you spread your irresponsible legs be a responsible adult stop killing babies
personally i think its the power of the tongue all this over exaggerated talk of women oppression when it could always be worse and now the universe is following suit and its becoming a reality welcome to worse ladies 
land of the free
"ah yes save the children 

and yes when libs loses they riot the cities like babies"
"leftist womens rights are at risk
conservative all right then what is a woman
leftist errrrrr im not a biologist
conservative if you cannot define what a woman is how can you determine theres a risk to them
leftist youre a racist"
think of the rights of those innocent powerless unborn babies
"that prolife progressive woman is im afraid to say living in fantasy land
does she really believe that what was holding america back from universal healthcare higher minimum wages statutory sick pay or paid family leave was abortion
in what universe does the republicandominated prolife movement now go ahead and pass those laws they coopted abortion rights because it was an emotional issue its way easier to stand up for the rights of an unborn baby they cant demand anything from you actually doing something for living breathing woman is not on their agenda"
baby killing will stop in states who care about babies the left has controlled the supreme court for years now the shoe is on the other foot get over it i rejoice in this decision and the saving of childrens lives
"slave owners  pro choicers
           its not a human"
how about stop being sluts 15 weeks is more than enough time to take responsibility
"well its like this 
 maybe the government should just pass a law that  if a woman wants to do that  her life should be taken as well  more room  a job for some one else "
you women crying over the overturn of roe vs wade are disgusting supporting the murder of babies when you have a duty and should have an instinct to protect makes you a monster
welcome to ceausescus romania oh wait its the land of the free absolutely ridiculous decision hello long needles hello illegal abortions 
20 of babies in usa in 2020 were killed by their mothers  930160 abortions 3605201 births  ill remember that next mothers day
you chose the guy you let him in you need to hold yourself accountable
the news commentator should go do her homework there is no constitutional right to abortion if it was it would have been upheld in the supreme court this is the reason it has been sent back to the states for it to be made a constitutional right it must be legislated for in both the house and senate and the courts will have to interpret as law
lol and they blaming trump
"everyone should worry about overturning the federal reserve act of 1913 and take back our country from the private bank sector 
printing more worthless paper dollars than ever before"
the land of free sad day for humanity
america country for the lucky few by the lucky few of the lucky few it didnt even see democracy from a train let alone meeting one
fifty years too late for the millions they murdered
finally the supreme court got it right your going to have to travel to other states all of you baby killers
the land of the free and the home of the brave  kinda feels like gilead to me
so let me get this straight americans ban abortions because apparently terminating a foetus is murdering a child but americans dont ban guns despite having a school shooting like every other week america is a weird place
well all seems to be going wellgun laws race abortion thank god we have politicians that look to implement laws and rights that make a better society rather than popularist career promoting policies
taking away the liberty to kill unborn children a very good thing the report is very biased in favour of abortion in the way it was worded
you know and i think that i can speak for everyone including the worthless cowardly democrats women no longer have the ability to kill a baby  if the  freeloading deadbeat cowards need someone to blame keep the past virginia governor ralph blackface northam on the top of your list  he fueled the anti abortion movement when he allowed virginians to abort a baby up to 20 minutes after birth as part of a sensible birth control plan  a racist fool   when you look up the word backfire in the dictionary you will see a photo of ralph blackface
ooo america what a backward and dystopian shithole youre slowly becomingshame to watch this
"phenomenal news

millions of children wont be murdered with impunity

hoping it doesnt stay here and it continues into a full federal ban on murdering unborn babies"
roe vs wade wouldve been left untouched if the democrats have not started demanding the right to abort babies up till the moment of birth and to kill them after
breaking news  to counteract the loss of great numbers of children shot and killed in high school the us has banned abortion in the hope this action maintains a sufficient prison workforce
whilst the world takes two steps forward america takes three steps back
the rights of women but trans in women sports haha the left is full of it
i truly cant believe people scream and cry for the right to kill unborn children the west truly has lost it
it was never a constitutional right that is incorrect
ladies  all this means is that youre going to have to actually get to know a guy before you let him bust in you
have you heard the saying keep it in your pants
liberals start sentences with i the anger
"typical 
a load of bible bashing hypocrites forcing their views and will on american women
the same bible bashers who conveniently overlook the thou shalt not kill
commandment when it comes to the death penalty 
shame on each and everyone of them"
could america become anymore shitty  than it already is shootings every week and now abortion is abolished
how popular is rbg now she should have retired earlier but these justices are so selfish
ladies dealing with male entitlement in the dating world now have a very good reason to tell him to keep it in his pants and treat you with respect
can we just take a moment to think of the people who are going to have to consider the attributes of a potential sexual partner as a mother or father and life long partner before barebacking with them thats the real issue here
  so now these poor babies  will see  lifeand not be ripted apart  by these inhuman  demons  
so thankful to be in canada the best country in the world where womens rights are protected whats happening to the usa its going downhill fast
"the chanel 4 comments are  discussing killing of a baby is not freedom or a right but murder  all the media  and journalists are all liers  and agents  of evil  leading and encouraging  people to do evil 
but you will not go unpunished  forever you sons daughter of satan"
"809
mf yall want nothing to do with the mom or the baby after you guys literally wanted to do jackshit about the baby formula shortage but now you wanna say something about helping moms get tf out of here u just wanna manipulate the crowd and look good so i can fucking sleep well at night i am fucking 16 years old and having to fight for my rights so if anything happens to me im okay at this point i rather get my tubes tied and not give birth at all in life"
its amazing to me that people are mad that they cant kill kids anymore imagine that  mad because they cant murder their own kids pure evil
praise the lord
abortion is murder you have no right to take a life 
if its your body and your choice and your choice was to get pregnant why would you want to get rid of it
abortion it should be illegalin some cases should be legal
oh no think of how many children wont die oh the inhumanity would someone think about a womans ability to casually kill
uk and usa are abominable nations do not take the mark of the beast vaccine jesus is coming soon real real talk
50 years of killing babies was enough
such black and white views from both sides jesus
welcome to the united states of gilead
"this is what a country capable of voting a moron for president gets and all those drooling backwards conservatives clapping their chopped hands in glee watch out the same retarded mentality you are so happy about today may later find you in a minority group that needs to have its fundamental rights stripped lets see you clap your hands then
the usa hammers yet another nail into the coffin of critical thinking 
yeeehaaa untermerica"
"a great day i hope abortion is banned in every state
jesus is king
trump 2024"
women know they rely on relationships for men for their survival  it takes allot of character to parent  with fewer countermeasures in those relationships to paternity the demand for women to improve their character is going to increase  its not easy for a person with a poor character to hear a demand they improve
its not a constitutional right show me in the constitution where it says abortion is a right
what are these protesters mad about they can still kill their babies in over half the country how about abstinence just using it for birth control is barbaric
abortion is murder
maga king life wins salty army we are legion birth control cross your legs
what at the root of all this  does it stem from fundamentalist christians
arms heads feet ripped out this is genocide
the very same crooked politicians who 12 months ago were forcing vaccine mandates and covid passports on people now are demanding my body my choice be respected the naked hypocrisy of them is breathtaking
"abortion is profoundly anti women three quarters of its victims are women half the babies all of the mothers

mother teresa"
lets fight back with combat screw the gop
nobody has a right to do evil bullshit
that report was a bit strong quite a lot of seething and fearmongering but few facts and no explanation of scotus decision making beyond orange man bad
does contraceptive exist in america
another is satans work
crazy america is going backwardsno words
the antiabortion uprising claims to be progressive yet is in favour  of a completely regressive movement
save the baby humans
"thus is just the beginning
"
"a constitutional right that has been in place for half a century
quite untrue the whole point of the ruling is that abortion is _not_ a constitutional right  that is it is not a right that is guaranteed in the constitution  and in consequence roe v wade was wrong in constitutional law to hold otherwise
all the ruling says is that the us constitution which of course does not mention abortion and says nothing about it explicitly likewise does not say anything about it implicitly either and so in consequence abortion law is a matter for the democratically elected legislatures of the individual states to decide
as such it is a victory for democracy it is not for unelected judges to be imposing laws on us citizens that is the role of elected politicians
the us left which has done nothing but bleat about democracy these past 18 months is exposed as hypocritical in the extreme as soon as democracy anywhere in the world for that matter yields a result it doesnt like it starts rioting  or worse"
interesting that republicans want to protect unborn babies which theyre happy to have die while attending school through mass shootings
a country where a woman cant make her own mind up and have an abortion and the same country that allows a minor to buy a gun really need to think again usa home of the brave land of the stupid the supreme court is dictating to the electorate
glad to see that season 5 of handmaids tale has been released
president biden has the lowest approval rate of any president by the way
prolife women always look beautiful and peaceful im not here to talk about the baby killers with their coloured hair
do you know that the majority of women didnt want the vote because it would make them eligible for the draft but men voted to let them vote against their will because it was what was right just cuz the majority wants something doesnt make it right
trump did his damage back to the middle ages actually back to the dark ages keep women in chains let women be ruled instead of being equal now women will be unable to run their own lives make their own decisions and be in control of their own bodies
ummm thats not what the supreme court does it interprets laws it only upholds civil rights insofar as the laws and constitution do
im happy it doesnt go their way  they have to use condoms now   if they think babies are  worse than hiv they should use condoms or prevention pills   even their famous tantra technics can help them
what funny is is that if you asked one of these leftist protestors  who are fighting for womens rights what a woman is they would probably be unable to answerand also if you are that against having children there are many medical ways not to have one
something to think about dont abortion clinics and guns do the same thing how can we complaining and get all butt hurt when a school shooting like sand hook and texas kills our little future then we then we go to pieces when the courts strike down a plan that goes in and kills our kids are guns and clinics not the same thing
oh no i might have to be careful and responsible with my own body 
imagine if all those protesters were aborted by their mothers
abortion is wrong case closed
this is a failure of successive generations of education in america i see it happening in the uk too
110 i am terrifiedthen 5 seconds later showing a video of her acting like an aggressive chav
i really dont get it how do you dehumanise a fully formed person with experiences and thoughts but humanise a foetus
garbage inaccurate partisan propaganda i dont know what else i expected from the comrades over at channel 4
after 50 years now america has a conscious they dont care about fetuses why now what could it be
hot girl summer cancelled haha seriously might make people more conscious of who they lay with
abortion is not now or ever has been a constitutional right so stop saying it is
djt deliberately appointed three conservative justices seriously he was the president and it was his constitutional duty to appoint conservative constitutional justices not liberal justices
finally the constitution being upheld next is the unconstitutional gun laws on the books give us back the rights our forefathers fought for
build foster homes rn
this worries me because the rest of the western leaders looks up to america  it might be a possibility that other countries will try and follow americas lead im pro life and pro choice i think woman should have a choice but i think killing the child is bad but its not my business what other women choose to do if american governments focused on preventing rape and incest and bridge the gap from wealthy to poor and make contraception easily available then abortions rate will fall without having to make it illegal its all linked
americans are deeply divided over values such as gun control abortion rights lgbt rights health care and other social and political issues sometimes it seems this is not a real nation just people with different cultural racial religious backgrounds california and nyc share much more values with europe than with alabama or oklahoma
i actually agree with the decision life over death
never seen women cry so much for the right to kill babies
womens rights are being taken back 100 years women need tomobilise but last night in arizona police threw tear gas at protestors the us is becoming a right wing fundamentalist fascist regime thank you trump
well done america more kids to shoot 
"the thing is women having the right to control their uterus wasnt the thing stopping people passing any sort of utopian laws making society a safe and well supported place  to choose to have and raise children 
nor does removing womens right make them any closer  unless you think itll galvinise women to kick out and lock up the greedy corrupt misogynists who would rather remove rights from women than give them
if you want to pass free quality pregancy and birth care for all affordable housing garaunteed full child support payments covering all costs till gratution compulsory reversable with a partners consent vasectomies for all men equal pay for women etc then get those laws passed then indeed many of the valid reasons for choosing abortion will no longer be an issue"
"dont worry libtards youll still be able to kill your baby in a blue state this just removes the law at the federal level 

actually it should never have been a law in the first place federal law must be legislated not dreamed up by justices"
"you must have that baby and when you do youre on your own ohand well help more sickos get assault weapons to massacre it in school in afew years time

lol at least theyre solving the migration crisis too what sane person would want to live in this place"
so america happily takes away the right to a safe abortion but doesnt bother to ensure that children can go to school without fearing that theyll be shot into a million pieces am i missing something here
these are the people that were demanding mandates for vaccines how ironic 65000000 babies killed since 1973
i hate the people cheering for the elimination of abortion especially the woman who are cheering because they wont be cheering if there right or laws that effect tme become revoked is america just going to become a handsmaid tale
this is taking the choice away from woman jesus shouldnt make that decision it should be the woman herself
the united states moves closer to merging with the taliban every day
indian constitution gave women right to choose since 1970indian supreme court and indian government have raised the ceiling of abortions from 20 weeks to 24 weeksindian judiciary and government is working towards safer abortionsfamily planning and women healthcareironically western countries still feel the need to lecture india and south asian countries on liberalism and human rights
"cost to have a baby in us 10800 provided no aftercare is needed 

all this does is put people into poverty and the kids you have forced them to have 

well done idiots"
libtards are angry they cant murder their baby
but what is a woman
pass a law making it illegal not to wear a condom see how the men like that
lol sorry guys you cant murder your baby anymore
give choice to women
a woman has the right of ownership over her own body
no woman may be allowed to kill exceptions are obviously acceptable  in case of rapes or serious health problems nevertheless every human being must be respected while on the other hand pussies may never be faced as a green card to murder innocent human beings because responsibility inheres to womens liberty
live from austin texas tells you all you need to know from jose
"this people kill each other they are extremely discriminating poor people that end up on bad shape on life in bad conditions those people that hate so much immigrants and love conservative hypocritical ideas are the people that is trying to obligates people to carry pregnancy not desired

those things are outrageous"
and just like that libtards can all of a sudden define what a women isuntil the subject changes
aaah forcing women to bare children they have no support for very cool america
pro life woman did well to stay calm and logical when she was clearly the one under attack
america is coming to its sense 
whats up with fucking religious schizos in the comments why are people so fucking anti abortion because their fucking imaginary friend is absolute cretinous backeards country america is this is what happens when you let disabled people get a vote
glory to god and love to presidente trumptrump forever
"the socalled pro life movement are 
tick one
 ignorant of the needs of others 
 uneducated about biology and medicine 
 unaware of the sociopolitical implications
 fanatical religious fundamentalists 
 misogynistic hateful extremists
 all of the above"
imagine crying because you cant kill your own offspring lol
i havent seen democrats this angry since we ended slavery
glory to god the victory is the lords
lol more support for families why there are many family dont even have financial support and better insurance why there are so many homeless in this country i guess people are used to it
which womans right are we talking about here
hear the lying news pleaseplease show me in the constitution where it says abortion is a right  abortion was made to control the population  it was never a constitutional
hope that his same will happening in my country  this is miracle from heaven thank you trump also
"abortion has killed more people than all the wars in history combined together from the time of ancient egypt to today 
if abortion was registered as a cause of death it would top the charts above everything every year
at this point in many countries its an issue of maintaining population numbers without having to resort to mass immigration to compensate for it most countries cant replace dwindling population numbers with immigrants"
crazy when you see these girls annoyed when all they need to do was keep there legs shut
same liberal morons cant even define what a women is
probably time the us did become 2 separate   countries let the republicans build their religious caliphate or whatever they want to do at least the other half could then progress as a modern liberal democracy
my body my choice except for covid shots shots shots boosters boosters boosters huh
killing babes is not womans right
"
time to make the churches pay their fair share of taxes that will generate billions of funds into the economy to pay for these poor babies that arent wanted almost 1 million abortions a year will turn into a lot of unwanted babies that the church tax will provide care for its time amen even jesus christ paid taxes"
a fight for the unborn accomplished
so now its a state issue and not federal
land of the free ey
"they havent made abortions illegal dumb fucks states get to decide their own laws its not federally mandated 
the overturning of roe v wade does not mean no one can get abortion in the us the media are just making out that it is for clicks and rile people up as usual"
wellthis is going to end well
this thing is the best thing to do so it will go back to state and the people in it to decide so if you like democracy you should be happy today
this makes me so happy stop these awful devils from killing kids we need to protect our children not murder them
the us needs a second civil war the two tribes within that country are completely incompatible
funny story norma mccorvey which was the real name of jane roe actually became a prolife activist later in life even though it was her case that led to abortion being legalised
"the republicans are going to push very hard to make abortion illegal nationwide 
where do they stop"
im vegan we have people kill baby animals behind closed doors i find this obviously hypocritical and lacking self awareness because ultimately we are a very selfish species
all news on planet earth is stupid all the time
the leftist screams in despair as their right to murder unborn infants is threatened
old white baby boomers still thinking they control the legal killing of babies
make it a crime to kill a baby bingo
scotus isnt beholden to public opinion they are beholden to the constitution polls dont decide the constitutionality of a given case only the constitution and legal precedent
"killing babies is a lazy contraceptive
for the guiltless"
this is what they dont think about more  homeless  more abuses kids that are not wanted the state  well have to open welfare offices   for sure theres no opportunity for a lot of these kids that are being forced to come live in life without even able to have a home most of them will have drug addict mother will the state better have a nice bill for them they have to pay them once a month
americans will regret this decision its idiotic and the only reason people want it is just because the republicans want it not because they are prolife well its a sht show and we outside are enjoying it
no greater evil than abortion
its actually kind of easy to not get pregnant
"abortion and guns are not in the bible the woke have no knowledge of the meaning of a
constitution or are the woke just trying to destroy the constitution
remember the family its religions and cultures are the foundation of our civilization
in god i trust and my gun is my safety government is elected by the people for the people
land of the free home of the brave midterms people take america backmaga
in a country run by a geriatric jackass and a global swamp mob my gun safety is with me

the shadow world government is trying to run our countrys into the ground
wefesg  you will own nothing and be happy
the biggest enemy is ignorance and the fake msm propaganda is the new form of education
the social media internet and fake msm have worked on indoctrinating the citizens of the world

who ever believes in the traitor puppet crime boss joe biden and the swamp mob are losers 
americans maga push back the new world order big reset america falls the world falls
crime boss joe biden the traitor is just a puppet of the swamp mobsters
the geriatric joe biden is their tool and has been instructed to take america down the toilet and
the us dollar has become the toilet paper america has a one way ticket to being the
united states of venezuela with crime boss joe biden the traitor

like him or not trump told the truth the swamp will do all it takes with lies and propaganda 
the global swamp mob are applying western liberal globalist rules to the world tyranny
the fake msm will not report the truth they are just puppets taking orders from the
sick puppet masters in blackrock once blackstone

citizens of the world keep your eyes on the ball the mobsters are distort the truth
let us have the courage and outstanding morality standing up against the totally selfish dirty
powerful rich global oligarchs elitists and puppet politicians who have no moral compass
all upright peaceful people can contribute and do their part however small  speak out just do it "
look at those rich white maga b1tches celebrating who are going to fly to another country to get a rape baby aborted in a heartbeat fck1ng hypocrites
what a day the supreme court voted to protect the american peoples right to live
"its a good thing that they did this it gives an opportunity to the whole world to observewhat happensin next few years its better to learn from others mistakes then your
own"
choose contraception before abortion
accountability is wuhman kryptonite
wtf is that thumbnail rofl
the hos are mad they cant get a monthly abortion anymore 
this is a godsend for the biden regime  this is their only redeeming feature
"i support the decision women have been taking the p about abortions for too long but i do worry that they will seek another way illegally which isnt good either
women shout my body my choice what about the babys body babys choice to want to live
i celebrate this with the pro lifers"
the fetus is the hostage of the mother it depends on the mothers choice whether to save or kill
abortion should be available but not easy to do
a clear lie most women in the us fo not support abortion
if republicans were doing this over any issue democrats would call it an insurrection
in my opinion in this day and more enlightened age commonplace abortion should not be necessary except in special circumstances of rape and confirmed extreme deformity where the mother decides that she cannot continue to carry the baby abortion for social reasons or for convenience disposes of a life that of the unborn baby in the most casual cruel and dismissive way we cannot justify spending millions saving a premature baby whos wanted while placing a premature baby whos not wanted in an incinerator we cant offer bereavement support to parents who have lost a baby through stillbirth while turning a blind eye to the traumatic extraction of a developing little human education is the key so that men and women engage in considerate sexual intercourse respecting each other and being mindful of the possibility of creating a new life this new life must not be dismissed because it is too tiny to defend itself against annihilation this is my opinion
"so to confirm a tiny percentage of abortions are due to medical reasons

we need to protect life thats the unborn if you care about lives of women then you should be anti abortion for more women die then will die in childbirth"
the anchors sound just as stupid as the protesters there never has been a constitutional right to abortions
thank you lucifer
well this is how fascism enters america just wait and see what other rights they are gonna take away next
i think women should have free will to do what they want and what they do not with their life if they get and abortion that is their business we dont need laws put up just because of peoples opinions
why tf are women fighting so hard to kill a baby you hose cry over a dying dog but kill a baby
how embarrassing the passage of this law is part of the war of religions against each other they pass a law to protect the fetus women are seen as a bag in which future soldiers should grow but in the case of the hundreds of thousands of children who fall victim to violence and war every year children who go to war by force children who work on the streets children who are trafficked for sexual purposes and organs and dozens another catastrophe the legislators and men of god are dumb and blind sorry i forgot children victims of sexual harassment in the church more than 300000 victims a year in france alone church leaders may need more children to meet their sexual needs maybe handmades tale has already started
my body my choice huh they werent as inspired with such statement when we were talking about covid vaccine  what a circus 
i was adopted at the age of two weeks i could have been aborted perhaps the proabortion harridans might care to explain to me why the life i now have should have been dependent on the whim agency and convenience of the woman in whose womb i was conceived
you pro life hipocrites make me sick you care so much about a fetus that isnt even human but dont give too shits about the women and her choices i thought you idiots care about all lives so what about the womens lives the facist unamerican traitor low life piece of trash supreme court makes me sick they should all be ashamed of themselves i hop karma gets them and all you facist selfish scum who support this we as a democracy is over good job scumbags
makes me so sad to see young women being anti choice
woman think killing a baby is part of womens rights
two wins for the right in a week thank you president trump the rule of the left is coming to an end
the interviewer is a foolshe cares about the womenwho goes to be to have fun and wants to violate the right if an innocent being who never called for itand the fools in green being pro arbotionif their parents thought the same on themwhere would they behumanity is too lazy to thinki stand for pro life
wow what a primitive country usa is im so glad i dont live there
wow people youre angry that youre not allowed to murder children and then you still think youre good people
a lot of corporations have said that they will help a woman get an out of state abortion if necessary which is great however if that isnt an invasion of privacy i dont know what is
pro choice are not pro women but pro destruction and chaos
i was in college 50 years ago when roe v wade was decided by the supreme  court there is one huge difference between then and now that i have observed now both sides are speaking up there were a lot of people against abortion outside the supreme court today and supporting the decision i noticed many of them were women and there was a large crowd supporting abortion too the huge difference is 50 years ago i never heard one single anti abortion woman dare to speak up in fact on my college campus or anywhere else did i ever see any anti abortion people speaking up they existed back then but because they were such a tiny fraction of the population they kept quiet back then the pro abortion women were a lot more militant and violent than now they would have attacked and probably killed any woman who was vocal on my campus who spoke up against abortion those against abortion back then actually feared for their lives i knew a girl in my college who was a very religious christian and very against abortion i asked her why she didnt protest the roe v wade decision she told me are you nuts if i protested the decision i would be killed by some crazy pro abortion woman back 50 years ago anyone who was anti abortion did not dare speak up or they would have been killed by crazy nuts pro abortion women times have changed and the anti abortion people are vocal now and dont keep quiet in fear of their lives
thank you trump
why is biden giving trump credit for this doesnt biden know that is what trump wants 
this just in ugly fat women that no one wants to have a kid with are outraged that baby killing is no longer allowed
beware britainwe have a govt that openly attacks our independent judiciary and is full of catholics 
gods will is done let the people of the states decide on it not the federal level theres a reason the us is called a constitutional republic
we are going back into the dark ages womens rights are getting taken away this is so terrifying and so messed up and they say theres freedom in america thats total bullshit
this is a democracy though lol what a joke america is
we care about liberties so much that we impose you to have your baby we just dont care  what will happen to you and him after those 9 months
why is not upto someone what they do with there body why is it even a question the states got no right to tell you what to do
june 24 will always be remembered as the day the unborn got their civil rights sexually irresponsible degenerates will no longer use the law to legally murder the unborn
a child is really the greatest from god when you sit  think about it
they love abit of drama in america
ha ha i dont care about abortion but i do like seeing these college kids so upset
these protesters are the same people who are fine with forcing vaccines 
what about the babys choice  save the babies
yeah rally the left right before the midterms what a joke our entire political system is corrupt our politicians do not care about us or our views they are bought by the highest bidder and legislate with bills that are literally written by their lobbyists this change only symbolizes a need to divide us further so we dont see the rotten mess theyve turned our institutions into
as a pregnant man i find this attack on mens rights very disturbing
women might finally have to take responsibility for their actions for a change good news if women want to be promiscuous and sleep around they will have to ensure they use effective contraceptives  quite simple really  but hang on a minute   what is a woman
ok c4n you have covered this us news issue can you drop it now does not need another 10 minute segment again any time soon
man i wish our money goes back to gold
two things a women can do if they dont want a baby one get fixed two take out your urtus yes a women should have a right but if the problem is you dont want kids well just think because stress is just going to make you lose your mind
why the dramatic over reaction it hasnt been completely banned its simply been moved to individual states to decide so if youre in texas you wouldnt have liberal beliefs forced on you and if you a liberal living in california they still give you the right to murder your unborn child
why isnt there ever any attractive females at abortion rallies 
wonder how they would feel if they got raped and pregnant truly a tragic day in america thats what happens when you let religion deside human rights
"there would have been no holocaust  or overturning of roe v wade but for the catholic church
to understand where christian nationalism is taking the country read god and the fascists by karlheinz deschner 1965 german gott mit uns"
soon your children will be killed no more
women say its their body its not their body its gods body
your body your choice then start choosing to not sleep around
this is disinformation you dont understand constitutional law its called democracy  and the supreme court is following the law youre welcome
womens rights have not been overturned
no rights were overturned at all  man these crazy politicians and the media outlets they own need to stop with the hate and divisiveness just to win elections      
the supreme court if doing very little for kid dying of guns viloence at schools but they go in do this do they realize we are those ones growing up in this generation not them
its never a right to kill anyone especially a little innocent baby prolife
thank god and thank donald trump for this scotus decision
"abortion is murder
thank you supreme court for safe guarding the rights of the innocent
praise god "
terrissa is a blooming idiot
isnt it wonderful that this barbaric awful law is now gone forever now females will need to face their responsibility for promiscuous behaviour head on no more baby murder for convenience thank you donald trump for setting this up wonderful
sluts should keep their legs closed these rats will get what they deserve
i thought unelected officials without term limits governing over masses without representation was tyranny now these unelected officials supreme court give power to legislate abortion laws to the states to elected officials who represent people and suddenly all of these so called democrats are against it people have the right to self determination the right to self governance if you dont like the laws vote dont support tyranny as long as its tyranny in favor of your political beliefs
i have never been so proud of my nation  the future is now for america we are the prolife generation
"dear crazy women
murder my child and your next my fury my choice"
it was never a constitutional right
republicansconservativesprolifersdeplorablesevilfolks acc to msm are the ones taking care of these unwanted children they are mostly the ones donating volunteering and to be frank are also the ones who are mostly burdened by the taxes and it is not even close i used to be pro choice but it went from a just cause to downright insane genocide preventing folks to be fully responsible with their decisionsactions it used to be mothers in stable marriages who are having problems supporting their large families the occasional health prone and victims of crime which wont even crack the thousands nowadays it is mostly hs and college students more than 50 million babies killed every year and this is just a super mild estimate because the actual numbers are not reported because it will definitely paint a dystopianlike andor very grim picture it is crazy that for so loooong we allowed millions and millions of babies to be flushed down the toilet burned and left to rot in the groundsewers ready for the rats and worms to eat there should be limits to all these madness
you guys cant fix the gun laws but can take away woman rights 
wow genuinely shocked by this what a sad day for americans i cant even imagine the negative consequences that will arise from this
this makes me sick im am only fourteen i dont know what could happen to me in the future what if a baby is forced upon me and im am forced to give birth to a child that i didnt want i hate this generation it sucks i get abortions can be sad because your getting rid of a baby but ur taking away a woman right some people make me sick to my stomach this is not the world i wanted to grow up in
america regardless was made through murder rape  slaveryyou reap what you sow the crows have come home to roost
noooooo dont you guys how many more black and brown kids will be brought into the world now the glorious white race will soon become extinct if the lesser races cant quell their own numbers
as a pregnant man i find this attack on mens rights very distressful
talk about an unfactual report the court didnt take away the constitutional protection of abortion because there never was one
nowadays only two regimes make laws backwards taliban and america
isnt this reporter her own birth control
bro where was this fight when they pushed medical procedures on the polulation
im 19 and already know abortion is wrong everything that makes me angry abortion gun violence gay community forcing stupid laws people who say i dont believe in god americans need to stop acting so ignorant and get right with god god is real 
200 years ago the majority of people thought that slavery was ok somehow its immoral to misgender someone but it should be perfectly reasonable to dismember a fetus thanks old british fart for steering me in the right direction
and just like that the democrats suddenly know what a woman is
 when was the last time a womans body had two heads two hearts four arms and four legs
why not sterilise the inferior and economically worthless working class men that would eliminate the need for abortions
"erectile dysfunction is god telling men they have no right to have children

men who dont earn enough to raise a child should be forcefully sterilised

sterilising men would make abortion unnecessary"
bravo to those god fearing scotus judges abortion is forbidden in christianity thank you to scotus judges for standing up to those baby killers
sorry baby killers 
unprofessional reporting you didnt have to tell us which side you are we just need the news
all because people dont wanna wear condoms america goes into a riot as if they live in china
i have a serious question if a mother is carrying a baby but through testing they find out the baby has brain defects is a mother allowed to get an abortion because of that eventhough this law passed
some really disingenuous and blatantly false reporting going on here  the purpose of the supreme court is to interpret the constitution not protect civil liberties  second abortion was never a constitutional right as you put it you will not find it mentioned at all
"every child in america should be armed with an ar15 so they can protect themselves

but us conservatives oppose arming children because they are hypocritical elitists"
i presume the supremes are socialists as they expect the taxpayer to pay for unwanted babies and also allow churches to  steal money from the taxpayer
picture of prodeath woman crying because shell be slightly inconvenienced in killing her own child in her own womb
300lbs and ugly big mad for some reason
i am sorry to be disrespectful but as a tv you shouldnt be handing the microphone and giving the microphone to such a stupid selfish and narcissistic woman she doesnt fucking get to choose through her little movement of backwards bitches what other women want to do with their bodies
as elon musk said biggest threat to civilisation is population collapse this will greatly help civilisation in the long run
the supreme court made the right decision its not the womens choice its just plain murder babies have a right to live
"ahaz was twenty years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem sixteen years and unlike david his father he did not do what was right in the eyes of the lord 2instead he walked in the ways of the kings of israel and even made cast images of the baals

3moreover ahaz burned incense in the valley of hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire according to the abominations of the nations that the lord had driven out before the israelites 2nd chronicles 28"
your modern western whorish women that want to keep their whorish lifestyles and make babies and have convenient ways to get rid of them instead of being responsible and taking care of their babies
i am a christian woman and not an advocate for abortion but i do believe that there should be some instances where it is allowed for example children getting pregnant as a result of sexual abuse rape if a pregnancy is too dangerous for someone to continue with in which case you would need medical clearnace and so on but i will not agree with women using abortion to get rid of a child just because it doesnt fit into her life that part is a no for me
this is not talking  away any freedoms  its giving a little fragile baby a chance at life why is that so difficult to understand dont sleep around folks
limiting of freedom id say millions of unborn children just received some hope of freedom
aww nice to see some wholesome gals there theyre gonna become loving moms in the future v
thats how we roe 
take note the majority of pro voice protesters are white white women furthermore black females are the highest in abortions  so are white women for killing black babies what happened to blm
glory to the almighty god
why are they celebrating 
"womans right to choose 

notice how they stop there

 what they should be saying is
  a womans right to choose to kill a human life"
not in the constitution nowhere in it  it was never a constitutional right it was a court ordered right
thank you my god for the victory we respect your commandments you will not kill  thank you my elohim for giving us the torah because holy and we keep every commandment that you commanded us in the name of yeshua amen  biden get ready when you settle accounts with god what you do on earth
"to die is poignantly bitter but the idea of having to die without having lived is unbearable
erich fromm"

thank you my god for the victory we respect your commandments you will not kill  thank you my elohim for giving us the torah because holy and we keep every commandment that you commanded us in the name of yeshua amen  biden get ready when you settle accounts with god what you do on earth
"gawd this is terrible reporting

abortion was never protected in the constitution roe v wade in 1973 was the incorrect ruling

abortion is relegated down to the states where women can still organize and vote in prochoice candidates"
lol take the l leftists you have office but you wield no power
its sadistic to for force a baby to be born to a childhood of abuse the amount of parents who are addicts alcoholics and druggies trying to makes money for their drugs by prostituting their own baby out to pedophiles not only being sexually abused but physical emotional and spiritual too what about the damage being raised in with parents who have a physcialneurologicalmental disability does are going going to personally raise that baby and no its not gods will for a baby to be shared around be the local pedophiles
so democratic that a tiny group of unelected officials have rhe power to strip freedom from millions of americans
why is it that most of the people that are against abortion are people you would never fk even if you were drunk
huge victory in the war against women
soon the streets are going to be overrun with babies carrying assault rifles
what about the rights of people in the womb
maybe all those in favour of abortion should have been aborted
we will get to berlin how ironic the us didnt even fight in berlin nor did they capture it it was the soviets hope your case against abortion will turn out the same way
ever noticed that all those in favour of abortion  have already been born  and now want to deny that right to others
finally less hoes on the streets now that yall scared to get pregnant
"would you get an abortion
absolutely
what if the baby was black
"
lol but let me get this straight if man can be woman and woman can be man why are these pro choice activists talking only about woman thats transphobic  using their own logic is hella fun no more roe v wade for yall 
to the women remember in 2024 if you want trump enjoy having the rest of your rights stripped away this is his fault
democrats havent been this angry since the time republicans took away their slaves
but if the chick was raped
the demons are sad today
please see that the enemy only want your money even if it means the death of your child these people are not concerned about your health
marry before you carry  there are real consequences to decisions that you make 
"glory jesus christ 
for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this age against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places ephesians 612"
"this is great the devil worshiping murderous libturds will move the f on out and go gobble in the dirt in lib shatholes  furthering destruction in the already destroyed public areas of the demoncrat run states
thow shalt not kill"
ehem its not a constitutional right
finally moral sanity is being restored the most fundamental right is the right to life the taking of innocent life is never a long lasting  healthy solution
im grateful for the abolishment of legal genocide of the unborn
the reporter is brainwashed
grow up use a condom duh
what is a woman
democrats havent been this mad since republicans freed the slaves
if you want to kill your babies just go to a blue state
so worthless are the idiots who live to control and take away the rights of others and these idiots have no empathy just a need to hate and control someone all the time a sad day in america that these hateful controlling bigots think they  have won just watch them spit on homeless veterans telling them it is their choice and starving homeless babies they could care less about pathetic bunch of gossip mongering misfits if they dont want an abortion dont have one they get narcissistic supply from controlling women i am not standing in front of your house telling you not practice sodomy that is your choice
i support the decision of the us supreme court respect 
women can chose to close their legs those crazy people dont speak for me when they say  women life wins this is a country under god
"what are they talking about   there is no such thing as women anymore 


what are these people talking about 

there is no such thing as womens rights  since there are no longer any women"
"itll be interesting to observe how all of this affects sexual behaviour in america will girls delete dating apps from their iphones will more girls want to become boys
also america and afghanistan are now on a similar footing ie no automatic right to abortion and both awash with guns"
the science proves babies dont have a body
no means yes
now its about liberal tears vs maga tears politics is all about outrage these days because politicians dont want real solutions they want run neoliberalism at the expense of american people
047 id like to see what her reaction would be if she gets a pregnant with a rapists child blue states must block out of state abortions only blue state voters earned the right through their vote
what in the fucking handmaids tale is going on
"liberals dont care what happens to a woman after abortion such as the extreme guilt and even suicide that happens  

conservatives are the only ones that really care about the baby and the women"
thank you president trumpyou save many babies from being killed
wow  the us really is heading back into the dark ages 
"after the supreme court announcements the radical left did some demonstration and screaming in the streets
 questions
this is not protesting this is intimidation and harassment
going to justices homes with cóctel mólotov is disgusting and its a terrorist act
baby life does not matter
if teens do not want to have a baby its better for them to prevent getting pregnant
killing an innocent live baby is a murder
 biden its a sad day for the country and the court
the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk"
pro life till the baby gets born then it can go f itself on the free market
lib tears 
now we all just need to ban cars so we can have horses back in the street
"what about rape victims or child rape victims what about if the baby is so disabled it has no quality of life
these pro liberals have no clue"
"1 afghanistan women rights overturned
2 american women rights overturned"
channel 4 biased much
assholes trump is guity for everythingor putin
murder is not a right and it was never a constitutional right
freedom for babies
tbh  if you dont wanna have kids use  protection   theres so many damn ways to not get pregnant i think is so damn selfish to want to abort just cuz  without condom it dont fell the same     if ure rape or got pregnat is a abusived relationship  medical reason  or the fetus is sick that it souldnt b just cuz ure not  ready to  be a mother take care them    just my opinion
im glad they overturned it
wow this broadcaster does not understand how the system works there is no abortion right in the constitution 
women are now accountable for their actions  they cant simply kill the life inside of them because it suits their purpose  great verdict  life is precious and not to be treated lightly
the people chosen pro life or anti abortion folks really dont care about the women who have to carry the pregnancy why even have these anti abortion people on your platform
this woman is a huge liar it was always bad law finally got corrected of cause when democrats had super majorities they never changed the law more people are pro life
i love the that persons face in the thumbnail hahaa priceless
that wasnt the grave of roe you were dancing on that was the young women who bled out from this decision
myself and my partner had a child we couldnt afford another child so we took necessary precautions to stop that happening and still do to this day women stop men cumming inside you and you wont have to abort poor children
great day the reporter is so angry confuse lady she trying pushing her agenda to them
no more black babies to kill in most states
dont worry about to killing barbies if your dont want to have babies remove your uterus
"ohhh of courseblame trump again 
this is whats called liberal backlash"
trump wins this fight square and fair
wow i havent seen democrats this pissed since we took away their slaves
abortion is a human sacrifice in the name of womens liberation
a victory for unborn babies 
america what a disgusting country congratulations for treating women so badly would never want to visit your disgusting country you are not the greatest country on earth
"thank you hillary clinton 
thank you rbg  
trump 2024"

reporter killing is not freedom if you believe in liberty you should believe in right to live you people dont believe in freedom phonies
what is to become of us liberalsthey defined themselves by the mass homicide of the unborn untermenschen
ppl upset that babies will be saved what a twisted world shut up and stop killing babies
"i just cant wait to see the people of the united states in 25 years
children of junkies children of incest children with trisomy
they are already well on the way with trump
long live progress backwards  "
conservatives want live babies so they can train them to be dead soldiers george carlin
the hores are so mad 
that woman answers zero questionsfrustrating
"demonrats trump finally did something you can accuse him of
you hate him because your demonrat party told you too
today he gave you a reason to hate him for something he actley did
you think he cares"
that ladies said she is terrified soooo when that baby starts getting cut up i wonder how they feel
"feel free to call me ignorance stupid uneducatedetc whatever but i simply think this way is that what if my mom somehow or my parents had changed her opinion i would have disappeared
if you dont want or need your babies you can give them up for adoptionwhy killed them dont you think they would want to live too"
im 14 and i know a lot about life and abotion is wrong babys dont need to die smh 
"here are some reasons a woman would want to get an abortion
1 health in some cases if a woman gives birth she can die to due health issues

2 money and expenses not everyone is in the middleupper middle class baby supplies are very expensive diapers clothes formula medicine even the hospital stay not everyone can support both themselves and their child

3 they just dont want to not everyone is fit to be a parent and when someone who isnt fit for parenting becomes a parent that can just lead to problems with the child they may be neglected

now you may be saying well you can just put the child for adoption the foster care system is extremely flawed more than 7080 of the children in the system either dont get adopted or never find a permanent home and by the time they turn 18 they can no longer be supported in california alone there are 60000 children in the system right now

4 rape and trauma if a woman gets raped and is impregnated by their rapist it would just be extremely traumatizing rape alone is traumatizing enough but if someone gives birth to that child then it would be even worse child birth and motherhood should be an amazing moment life being created from a loving relationship but when a baby is born from something so horrible the child can be a reminder of that traumatizing experience

would you force a woman to give birth even if it costs her life would you force a woman to give birth even though they wouldnt be able to provide for the child would you force a woman to give birth even if that child was the result of rape would you force a woman to give birth then put the baby in a flawed system 

abortion isnt about killing babies for funsies"
freaking liars half the population is against it and you know it
"you cant even define what a woman is 
now you are complaining about womens rights "
how fucking dare you take my citys name in your disgusting creed berlin is was and always will be a city fighting for freedom and in flux in moments of oppression but we know whats what and taking away a humans right to make decisions about their own body and their future opportunities has nothing to do with that berlin spits on you sir and this decision pthh wtf united states in case you didnt know your country is over over you are no longer the leaders of the free world youre not even close and hopefully never will be again
"the conservative backlash against wokeism whining protesters pronouns and genders critical race theory
it is brilliant "
this does not end abortion you morons it goes to the individual states to vote on
theres nothing in the constitution for abortion scothus acted properly and with so many screamers complaining about womans rights where are the rights of the unborn child
the unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for they never make demands of you they are morally uncomplicated unlike orphans they dont need money education or childcare they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships and when they are born you can forget about them because they cease to be unborn its almost as if by being born they have died to you you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth power or privilege without reimagining social structures apologizing or making reparations to anyone they are in short the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe
blah blah you know roe v wade states that that an abortion needs to be done before viable life  for example california that is now 24 weeks that bill the evil servants of satan the democrats voted for in the house and senate would have allowed abortion up to the moment of birth  disgusting evil people
rights you mean right to murder babies
we cant kill our kids now dang smh lol
"theres a few different aspects of this that deeply disturbs me there are others which im happy to discuss but the one aspect that does chill me is how we can take away freedoms of what women can do with their own bodies the other aspect i find deeply disturbing is that 61 of women in the us agree with abortion thus the dismantling of roe v wade isnt just eliminating freedom of choice for the individual but also undemocratic 
choose to have an abortion or dont its not my choice and shouldnt be anyone else is choice other than that individual"
why do all of you prodeath people look like cows with purple hair i doubt youll ever have the need for an abortion
the united states supreme court does not write the laws it only interprets the constitution  nowhere in the constitution is abortion mentioned as womens rights it is guaranteed in the constitution that everyone has the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  that means all life
childeating tribeswoman as the cover image typical taking away the chosen peoples food supply
"this is so wonderful babies now have a chance 
love from oz "
thank you jesus for answered prayer
what an incredible day for the unborn
what is everybody fighting about youre letting the babies grow up to join gangs anyway so both sides win and everybody should be happy                    grim
the roman catholic church has consistently condemned abortion  the direct and purposeful taking of the life of the unborn child in principle catholic christians believe that all life is sacred from conception until natural death and the taking of innocent human life whether born or unborn is morally wrong the church teaches human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the creative action of god and it remains for ever in a special relationship with the creator who is its sole end god alone is the lord of life from its beginning until its end no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being donum vitae 5
ok fine the one in the thumbnail can keep her abortion right the world doesnt need more looking like that
smas a brit who lives in north america can i just apologize for channel 4s massively bias reporting
this is fantastic news
they need to pass out xl magnams
you already dismantle children at robb elementary
make abortion unthinkable roe is dead forever  millions of babies will be save now my body my choice is a lie and evil claim at the cost of killing babies in the wombs
it is about time they stop letting  murder happen
this going to rile up pro choice voters insanely this is what the democrats needed to be honest
i just think to many people all up in everyones business on what they decide to do with their bodies not your business not ur body pay attention to your own lives no one elses god is the judge not you
they should all duct tape their mouths
now its still for those ladies to start a militia
cry liberals i wanna see those sweet liberal tears haha
 people mad they cant kill babies this world crazy
feel blessed that this day has come in my lifetime
woke west lol didnt western women declare war on all men good luck fighting billions of males worldwide
lol at them blaming trump
american women should move to more progressive and developed nations than the us the us has become a cesspool of division and narcissism
english channel 4 hahahaha so leftwing
i love it when people dont get their way 
what happens if the mother is severely sick and will die if the baby continues to grow
just move to a state where abortion is legal   problem solved
always entertaining to see libs cry
god this is obnoxious reporting in mississippi it is legal to have an abortion up to 15 weeks although this may be banned now but in other states like florida it is 12 weeks in france it is 14 weeks in portugal it is 10 weeks in germany it is illegal but still allowed with a loophole until 12 weeks
"no one actually understands what this decision is it is an excellent legal decision

the whole point is that the scotus is not a political institution roe v wade gave people a right that was not legislated if you want a law such as legalized abortion then the proper path is to ask you law maker to pass a law that involves due process

roe v wade had no due process and yet it performed the function of law making

the decision simply deemed it improper and ask that if the public wants that right go and ask your law maker to do it because the function of scotus is to interpret the law and not making them

and here are people throwing a big tantrum simply because they heard some people saying they overturned the abortion right when it is nowhere near that case

if you want abortion vote for it dont ask judges to do a politicians work"
i find it very difficult to side with a healthy adult women who has the choice the power and agency the unborn has zero choice has no power no agency and is totally at the mercy of its mother
"its not your body
 its a child inside
your womb  that body is not yours you dont have the right to murder that tender voiceless helpless child"
killing someone was never constitutional
big victory the baby murderers have been stopped every life is sacred and shall be protected love prevails praise the lord
about time we stop the baby killers
between 2010 and 2019 625346 abortions happened yet 400 children have been killed in school shootings i dont see the level of outrage for 1570 times more children dying in abortion clinics than schools
these are the same people that say our democracy is in peril the supreme court is our democracy in action and now they dont like it
thats good stop abortion thats murder  wake up its your body but the baby is not your body thats a separate body you have no right to kill it 
in colorado you can kill your child at 9 months  you might as well give birth and  strangle your child to death
shut up poopy pants
maybe these vaginas should consider contraceptives
abortion is not a constitutional right
women dont have the constitutional right to kill their children time to have some responsibility folks 
it is time to save life because some of the best people weve ever had in the united states from rape even though rape is wrong and it should never happen dont murder the baby dont murder the mother go after the rapist
when the judge got smart and said well im just going to give you choice just like god did you got the choice to be right or you got the choice to kill and you dont have to have a baby to kill birth control is murder each one of us were predestined aided by god read your king james bible look up this verse he was still in the loins of his father when melchizedek met him
women rights arnt being stripped awayjust the baby rights is being heard cowards cant see that its crazy to see elder woman think its okay to take a childs life its just crazy to see
at 231 that woman is speaking what im feeling this goes beyond abortion this is about womens rights
this will be so fun to visit in a year this is nothing more than fear mongering abortions will still be legal in over 90 of all states
god said theyll shall not kill that he wasnt the god of the dead but he was the god of the living that all babies are a miracle from heaven no matter if it was rape or not
praise god for donald trump and the scotus
choose what say it choose to kill babies
the scumbags in the media twisting these diluted minds by saying abortion is a constitutional right which it isnt  they can still murder babies in states that allow it this more reason to bring god back in school
channel 4 news promotes baby killing
the nonsense from this news anchors is incredible nobody should have the right to kill babies
dont be a cry baby  pun intended 
its so funny her saying we will not dismember children em how many kids are dead this year alone due to ur precious guns
the baby is not your body therefore not your choice
lol more tears than when trump won
almost everyone is talking about the right of the woman to terminate her unborn child its her body and this is the most absurd thing when the child she has managed to conceive deserves  the right to live if you have ever entered abortion room and have seen the deadly equipments used to end an innocent life youll shiver if you have a heart abortion is murder
if you agree with this i hope you get pregnant against your will idc
this is garbage there was not constitutional right to abortion this news is deceiving or misleading at best
we can barely educate the children we do have
killing babies is not a womans right today is a good day
im pro life so is god why do u think he has given us everlasting life as a free gift u must accept it because our god is pro life
"oh no  no more killing babies 
monkey pox infecting the gays 
guns are legal  thank you jesus "
"you pushed it too far you wanted to still kill after  birth

lets keep it real abortion was really made legal because was targeted females of color and  planparenthood was started by a woman who was in the kkk
biased channel 4 baby killers teach women not to kill babies
this is what abortion leads to  its 2055 artificial intelligence analyzing the babys dnabrrrbrrrranalyzing probability of the baby being over 6 feet tall looking like johnny depp and not being bald nor overweight as an adultbrrrprobability 23 woman damn well i guess ill abort this one maybe ill have better luck with the next guythere must be responsibility otherwise we will be heading towards a society we wouldnt want to live in
if abortion is moved to the state we can pick the best president to run usa  not an abortion president like bill this has the dems terrified one of the few things dems have is playing abortion card to distract from destroying usa
a lot of upset baby killers being put out of business a great day in american history indeed
let the accountability start 
imagine wanting rights over other womens wombs and rights to choose if they want to procreate or not
babies should say goo not become it 
legalizing abortion is like saying i have such strong emotions that you get to die putting feelings above life itself a win for the sanctity of life not the sanctity of your feelings 062422
"_abortion is murder_
simple as that"
this narrator is so biased   take your polls and stick em up your tunnel of a cobwebbed womb
thank you trump
america is tweaking
hallelujah   murder aint a right
"so let me get this straight
they ban abortions claiming life is precious and that the unborn babies are innocent but then wont change or restrict gun laws that lead to the deaths of innocent school children
so basically once the child is out the womb its fair game until then it must be preserved  have i got that right do not claim to value human life if you are willing to let mothers die because they cannot terminate a pregnancy why is the mothers life worth less than her unwanted and undeveloped foetus"
"this decision was perfect  following the constituion to the t
the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people

us constitution  tenth amendment  library of congress

and thats exactly what they did  case closed"
hold it increasing minimum wage creates inflation and devalues skilled workers shes off on that part women need to gain skills to make more money
isnt it ironic that all the protestors are people that have been born
its just sad poor american women poor america more oppression from the freest country in the world
pro choice in the name of womens rights is counter intuitive 50 percent of the time they are killing other women
dam these losers because they cant kill babies anymore
i havent seen democrats this mad since we took their slaves
seeing these monsters cry is outstanding  no more killing helpless babies
alright its official now damn women in china actually have more rights for once it was a right its not like abortion law force everyone to do abortion if you dont want to abort then you dont let someone else have that choice you can argue this is a step towards life but this is definitely a step away from freedom
now women and female children who are rped will have to give birth to unwanted babies it will add to the other many children in systems that are unable to be placed this will also lead to more maternal deaths  this is going to create many problems with women going back to using coat hangers to abort pregnancies now it has been stated that contraception is next to get stopped so if you are a married woman forty and up who still has a menstrual cycle face the risk of getting pregnant or just refusing to be touched by her spouse for fear of getting pregnant i guess if the men want to be intimate with their wives they will just rpe her and take the risk of getting her pregnant like they were doing before the 60s this is just the beginning of taking many rights away from americans they took the right for woman to choose without considering the things i just mentioned they just say any woman who gets pregnant which is completely wrong mostly men made this decision when they are not women and cannot get pregnant even if they are rped
129 lol whats that reaction its beyond my comprehension
please i need to see more liberal tears   they fuel my joy   d
so all this just so women can travel and get an abortion elsewhere or those that cant afford it get a backstreet operation and put there life at risk im sure that makes all the pro lifers feel better smh why force that upon anyone else if your against abortion thats fine dont get one but others shouldnt have that right taken away from them you dont know the scenario they are in regarding their life
"what a beautiful day

ding dong roe v wade is dead

happy junetyfourth"
i like the fight for preservation of life and all what i dont like is that their support only extends as far as the baby is born after that its all your problem this will never work people who have the means to raise a child but dont want to for whatever reason wont be stopped from terminating the pregnancy this will only hurt poor people and if ends up succeeding in a few years time youll find yourselves in a very unpleasant situation
they have the choice to give away to adoption or orphanages better yet take birth control seriously abortion is murder its clear cut
this is a womens issue  only women should be allowed to vote on it  it was a majority of men who voted to overturn it  how dare they
there will be no functioning society if women kill babies for convenience
you all baby killers should stop and listen for a moment
the women that disagree shouldve been aborted them selves
"wow you mean women will now have to be responsible  accountable for their sexual decisions 
 no more getting abortions at the last second just so you can continue club hopping instead of taking care of your baby lol "
thank god some women have a body count over ten they use it as birth control
this is actually good clearly they havent been shown what happens to the babies or fetus later    experimentation
no way the thumbnail has to worry about getting pregnant
damn he got 3 justices up there my guy lol
"if these people had an anthem it would be this also this is a huge overreaction the right to abortion hasnt been taken away those powers have simply been handed back to the states it actually probably works out better that way for them as it now means that its no longer possible for their precious abortions to be outlawed across the board in the future 
"
great day
why do all the libs look like freaks from the star wars cantina bar
victory for future babies
"i understand why abortion is wrong and it is but what this means now is that young women who get pregnant will now start killing themselves either by accident or on purpose

this overturn will eventually be overturned 
after a few hundred thousand girls die trying to perform a self given abortion yeah it will again be a right"
lol that monster ruth vader is rolling in her grave
and im sick of these people saying what if a woman is raped yes thats bad but its worse to kill that baby put it up for adoption to a loving family
wah   i cant use abortion as birth control
jesus is lucifer they both stand for free choice
murder isnt a civil liberty and abortion was never a constitutonal right
99 years in jail are they mad
i support banning abortion not because its fair but because its unfair to women yes thats correct women can have their fairness when men get theirs
every female that i sleep with is getting pregnant  take that obama
i hope all those pro lifers get raped and get pregnant
my body my choice wtf im so sick of women only thinking about how being pregnant inconveniences them thank god its finally illegal for women to stop murdering babies
it wasnt their choice or my choice when it came to the jab and something being stuck inside of me but yet now all of a sudden its a big deal f you people in your hypocrisy
"separation of church and state is paraphrased from thomas jefferson and used by others in expressing an understanding of the intent and function of the establishment clause and free exercise clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution which reads congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

lets ban religion"
dont read the comments save yourself
june is now life month
ban abortion or we will not pay child support 
what is a woman
as soon as the old people who overturned roe v wade die it will be reinstated as soon as possible a featus isnt a child until its born learn about it its not your body its not your choice
how about these christofascists just f right off their position is rooted in their insane religious beliefs but con outlets wont tell you that at least my kids arent in a hillbilly red state full of evangelical nutjobs
under his eye  gilliad is happening
"if riots happen then the full weight and power of the government should come crashing down on them nowhere in federal or state law does it grant you the right for violent protest but it also says you cant incite violence do you hear that aoc and maxine waters
i am absolutely convinced liberals were deprived of oxygen at birth and then dropped on their heads i have never seen a group of individuals so delusional and susceptible to coercion in my life"
disgraceful that the reporter keeps scoffing at the prolife campaigner bias reporting at its finest
a majority of those women seen crying here probably dont have any intention of having children they are just a bunch of radical authoritarian nwo feminazis
roe verses wade i thought that was how mexicans got here wow the reality
dont be a foolwrap your tool
there they go  the leftie liberals freak out  live with it baby murderers you wont be murdering 850000 children next year like you do every year you evil bstards
i liked it when america didnt behave like the taliban
if such a majority of people was against the overturning why so many states banned abortion right after is this news or just another media attempt to shadow the true positions of the majority
this isnt going to stop abortions its just going to stop the safe ones so many women are going to die from abortions in alley ways
i dont understanddoesnt just mean that right leaning state will ban it and left leaning state it will be allowed and maybe subside it is it just political theatre
"yet biden wont end the filibuster democrats are feckless obama couldve codified row v wade when he had a mandate
and wtf is a progressive anti abortion organization thats an oxymoron"
"women have the right to do what they want with their body 
wrong   
when a life is conceived inside the womb then its not only that mothers property but its babys property as well as  its dads sperms donner  property 
its like an embassy which is located in host country but ownership and responsibilities are shared "
bunch of cry babies
a happy day but the  wont sleep 
so lets still overpopulate the world with even more kids that are not wanted genius idea 
women have rights to be supported and cared for in pregnancy 
1st its a new gun law now abortion rights america is going backwards next the ku klux klan will be running for office
how long will it take for planned parenthood to get on the phone to states like texas and load up planes with public school girls to wisk them off to the nearest butchering state during school hours without their parents consent but with the full cooperation of the schools  λεσβοομοηδονικα
it his disgusting a woman has no right to abort a baby if she doesnt wont it were are they human rights to be honest i wouldnt never date a woman who as child or two with different men why men like me go to work 5 or 6 days a week to feed someone elses b child thats what they are
if your body your choice what about a mandatory vaccination
"it is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live as you wish
mother teresa"
i dont really care about rights and all that but i dont understand how people wanna protest abortion was illegal while consuming animals are not how do babies in the stomach with no limbs and the brains are not even developed have the choice to live but not animals that never really endanger us
life is precious 
first more guns now abortion abolished america is so broken
"great news for the unborn 
thank you america lead the way"
shut up brit yall have problems of your own and what you meant to say was this time the supreme court decided to expand states rights
just remember these are the same nuts who would cry if they saw a cat being mistreated yet react this way when they hear they cant kill children shocking how these people act and shows what conditioning does
best news in years
america has fallen into madness this is a sign of worse things to come
this amazing  baby got voice no more munders hallelujah hallelujah 
this guy is the reason hollywood stars and california people are moving to austin texas
abortion was never a constitutional right morons
the left is finally able to define a woman
this beautiful praise god  blessings and peace  this amazing thank you jesus 
womens rights what is a woman
"if  as the lady says  we are going to make a more life affirming culture they could start with the headless corpse children in texas
could ya stop that from happening 
well  at least we can all carry a concealed weapon now
this is like the hunger games and handmaids tale franchises merged "
if its your body and choice men should not pay child support
nothing like biased reporting
great news
this is very biased reporting
we stay smoking that roe pack
i mean what are these karens cheering for its not like anyone is forcing them to get an abortion how does this impact their lives besides the fact that they now have their inane religious beliefs imposed on everyone else
"why is the court pouring gasoline on the division in this country 
are they purposely trying to start a civil war 
are they so religously delusional that they think they are going to usher in the second coming of christ 
they lied under oath 
thomass wife is involved with trying to overthrow the government and her husband has unlimited power over our lives 
whats wrong with this picture "
no more my body my choice for women its time to enforce my wallet my choice for men and give men the option for default custody
the child deserves the choice to live
wtf is wrong with these people for the woman in texas right now i need you to stay strong your government obviously is in shambles and im so so sorry you are going through this let abortion be legal dont forget the underaged raped woman have you imbeciles lost it have you fucking lost it have you let texas become a breeding home for rapists and pedophiles
but killing to protect yourself is ok  self defense is ok carrying a gun is ok but abortion is murder the math isnt mathing the usa is a mess
voteblue votebluetosavedemocracy votebluetoprotectallofourrights votebluetoprotectwomen
it good no to evil messed up people who kill there own kids
say no to abortions
a lot of states want to ban abortion the majority of the us population are in populated cities where they are going let abortion continue like california and new york places like texas and florida want to ban abortion because the majority of the population want to outlaw it so it was a good job by the majority of justices in the scotus to give the rights to the states
donald trump  praise god for him 
just think twice before you sleep around 
if you think this only affects abortion you are naive my friend this is so much bigger than that it goes into right of privacy just read the damn case
unwanted pregnancy  safe haven laws dumbass 
its going to backfired pro life warriors
hear ye hear yeharlots you now must keep your legs closed
"roe v wade was a bad legal decision this does not mean abortions are not illegal they are determined by the local communities this is a win for civil rights the dems just want power at the federal level like good socialists

they cant afford to drive to another state but can afford repeated abortions"
liberal tears keep em coming 
in india and china women are aborted 100 to 1 is that ok
who needs isis or the taliban if you got home brew ayatollahs from the us supreme court
they can just go to dem states to kill their babies the presenter is almost suggesting that women will be using coat hangers to abort thats not the case at all
refuse to restrict gun control to save the lives of children being murdered in schools yet happy to restrict womens rights over thier own body to apparently save childrens liveswhat a joke of a country the backbone of this policy is on religious groundsa fictional book written over 2000 years ago the self proclaimed  land of the freethe usa is nothing more than a social experiment gone badly wrong
if all the pro choic protesters were abortedthere would be no problem
prolife fatso is pulling the wool over the viewers eyesconservatives care a hoot about people and her suggesting that there will be redeemable work done to help families and women out is hot and stale air
"to all celebrating and flooding the comments with this trolling bs youre genuinely disgusting

this has nothing to do with any serious  legal thinking it has all to do with the justices personal opinion guised in legal opinion abortion has a lot more elements to it than just a straight abortion but i wont even sit here and explain them because you all dont care you just want to control women and since youve won you can stop acting like its about anything other than that"
they should use all contraception instead of just  aborting  it will make the women think more the state may be  trying to increase there child population as the numbers must  be low due to all the abortions
well ladies and gentlemen it took him nearly 35 years but mitch mcconnell has finally borked biden and all on his watch too ouch
the party of death is dying this is glorious
baby rights now
why do they scream to kill babies
im appalled at horrific transphobic slurs being yelled in the streets by masses of bigoted transphobes  men can give birth too and being a woman is a constellation   they are erasing the existence of a horribly marginalized community  why cant they be outraged over the rights of birth giving persons  this is transphobia on a level we have never seen before  this hate should not be left unchecked  arrest these protestors for mass bigotry  the hate just cannot be left unchecked or be allowed in any way shape or form  im so fing outraged at the hate that i have found myself in an uncontrollable rage
shame on you for this biased reporting im pro life 
what sort of garbage biased reporting is this
a whole lotta girls gonna be takin it in the butt now 
liberals crying in the comments 
there is no right to murder
"first the decision on bearing arms and now this roe v wade decision theres a big shift happening  

edit i presume you guys have heard of the 10 year old victim who had to cross state lines to get abortion help and the laws being written up to make that movement more difficult"
trump is the man
"ahh yes further proof murica is a theocracy masquerading as a democracy moving into a full blown totalitarian theocracy this is about nothing but control of women in society by implementing a minority bullsht ideology onto society spitting on the first ammendment itself 
soon it will be ban all contraception ban all lgbt relationships and then ban all mixed race kids if they can force a ban on abortions then they can also force abortions on mixed race kids
also want to know how these christians have never read their evil book or know nothing about their religion 
going against their imaginary sky daddys orders while claiming they know what saod sky daddy wants god is the most aborticidal monster in all of fiction lol

life begins at birth with the first breath gen 27
fetuses are not persons ex 212225
fetuses should be aborted as proof of aldultery numbers 51131
life is not sacred  deuteronomy 28 1824
god will rip open pregnant mothers 2 kings 812
god will kill unborn fetuses isaiah 1318
god will dash infants to pieces and rip open pregnant womenhosea 1316"
abortions in states with trigger laws arent going to stop by the way well done for endangering the lives of so many women who will now be forced to resort to dangerous methods  the women who cant afford to travel to other states are more likely to be minority ethnic so much for the first black supreme court justice who has now made a grossly damaging decision for his own community
my body my choicewhen it comes to anything related to covid19 right
great day for democracy  let the will of the people in individual states decide what is appropriate
this is brilliant what the usa needs is more guns and more unwanted children
is there real journalism anymore the commentator is so biased what a joke
only promiscuous and evil people supports abortion thank god that good defeated evil
"yeeee  what a win for this country 
proud to be an american just in time for july fourth  "
perform your own abortion then poor doctors
i wish biden didnt call himself rc
killing babies are not a right
"man is not intangible by the fact that he lives an animal would also be entitled to such a right insofar as it too is living  mans life remains inviolable because he is a person  being a person is not a psychological but an existential datum fundamentally it depends neither on age nor on the psychological condition nor on the gifts of nature with which the subject is endowed  personality may remain below the threshold of consciousness  as when one is asleep  yet it remains and we must refer to it personality may not yet be as developed as when one is a child yet from the beginning it demands moral respect it is even possible that personality in general does not emerge in acts because the psychophysical prerequisites are lacking as happens to the mentally ill  and finally personality may also remain hidden as in the embryo but it is given from the beginning in him and has its rights it is this personality that gives men their dignity it distinguishes them from things and makes them subjects  one treats a thing as if it were a thing when one possesses it uses it and eventually destroys itor said for human beingskills it the prohibition against killing human beings expresses in the most acute form the prohibition against treating them as if they were a thing

romano guardini"
good day for america  if woman say their body their choice than make the right choices
stop lying about what this ruling means for women this is being used to divide and segregate americans more than they already are it has not made abortion illegal period it has never been illegal thus simply means women cannot use it as birth control on demand responsible women use birth control to prevent pregnancy there is no need to have an abortion unless the mothers life is in danger or other serious things like incest or rape be responsible and stop making unwanted babies grow up and it is a lie that the majority of americans want abortion to remain used as birth control the majority believe it is wrong to offer abortion on demand for any trivial reason why cant you be responsible
state rights just got expanded and yes being born is a human right
abortion was forced on states they used the courts to circumvent the people the court simply gave the people the power back leftist are only screeching because they used a legal loophole instead of doing things correctly
praise god almighty  exodus 2013  thou shalt not killproverbs 61619 these six  the lord hates yes seven  an abomination to him  a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devises wicked plans feet that are swift in running to evil a false witness  speaks lies and one who sows discord among brethrenpsalm 1273 behold children  a heritage from the lord the fruit of the womb  a reward
"i am gonna buy billions of dollars worth of popcorn 
























this is going to be interesting"
when a gun is more protected then women
killing a baby is not a right its just women being idiots and not using contraceptives
the taliban won
the scotus is not intended to back the will of the majority their job is to uphold the constitution which what they did with this decision
such dishonest framing the supreme court didnt take away a right here unless you think brown v board took away the right to attend segregated schools or to ride on segregated public transportation if anything the court expanded the right to not be brutally murdered in the womb
thats not right theres women that get raped an now there saying they have to keep the baby what a terrible day in america women deserve that choice
"324  a constitutional right thats been in place for half a century

it was never a constitutional right thats precisely why the sc ruling was overturned the tenth amendment is quite clear on this issue"
murder is not a fundamental right sorry try again you people are absolutely out of your f minds this has nothing to do with womens health just about spreading your false narratives weve had enough and its going to stop trust me on that you are all absolutely wicked
president trump is a great man he is the author of this great progress a pillar of hope in the fight against degeneracy absolutely wonderful
check out all the irresponsible chicks that think its oppression to wear a condom or keep your legs close who also think they are the only women dirt bags always think they are the only true humans did they see all those other women rejoicing
theres nothing in the constitution about abortion its the correct ruling    now individual states can make their own laws theres nothing wrong with that everyone needs to chill out
i know american media sucks but sounds like its worse in britain more than half the country supports a 15 week abortion ban and 4550 support a 6 week ban the united states was a huge outlier in allowing elective abortions for 24 weeks
right honey you want a bunch of old men in your state legislature to have control of womens bodies i think you may need to be placed in a highly structured enviornment
its a shame women cant choose to terminate their baby out of convenience
great day for human life
happy to kill to protect happy to protect to kill right 
tje justices who voted in favor of this should be dragged to a gallows and hung in public
the best thing america has done in a long time however you put it regardless the circumstances  scientifically abortion is murder as simple as that everyone is here to defend women but no one wants to defend a foetus who will do everything to survive watch some videos by ben shapiro on abortion and listen to some ex abortion doctors
thank you president trump and scotus 63 million aborted babies salute you
trump still winning
cry yourselves to sleep libs
great day for prolifers white women have the highest number of abortions in america in a declining white population this measure will increase their numbers im sure the sc is aware of this
so who is going to tell the reporter that abortion is not a constitutional right
we need to help the pregnant women get thru the pregnancy and be able to make the choice wether or not she can care for the child instead of taking the easy out of murder
"why is she so afraid all she has o do is

a keep her legs closed
b use correct and effective contraception

somehow i think they just want to kill babies"
god bless america
i love the thumbnail pic
infringement of privacy
god says abortion is murder do you think you know more than god
this is what you get when u elect people like trump what if he get backs to power then good luck with ur democracy
america is fucked up
"this is home of sarah notice anything 
sarah told her partner to cum inside her in the heat of passion and is 5 months pregnant sarah was hoping to get an abortion when she got around to it despite her partners objections but now thanks to row v wade being over turned she must now travel 2 hours interstate to kill the fetus"
woman dont want to have a kid lean how to swallow
dred scott and plessy vs fergusson preceded this decision but sounds like shes from the uk
funny how most of these baby killing bitches look ugly and fat  
a lot of men will dump and run now so be prepared to be single mom after one nightstand
how do you defend womens rights when you cant answer what a woman is
034 which part of the constitution was that again
the usa is not a single huge state we are 50 states where each state makes its own laws  im sure liberal states will approve unrestricted abortion while conservative states make it for medical reasons only  r vs w infringed on fathers rights never taking into consideration the fathers right to a child that is half his  this decision returns the power to the states where it belongs
biden cant even protect baby formula or tampons  and he sure does not protect this country  biden is a goner going down hill faster and faster and it shows  loser ville crime family bidens
its not about womens rights  the white population of america is declining steeply this is the revise of chinas one child policy dont get fooled by the smoke about women rights  america is going to be a black and brown spanish speaking nation in the next 100 years if the dont act
this ruling doesnt make abortion illegal just goes back to the states now if youre state makes it illegal theres a problem
just look at this proabortion crowd what are they woried about the only way that these hags will get pregnant is by artificial insemination
how will the forced births be enforced
abortion is not a right period
"so let me know if im wrong english btw but has the court made it ok for states to make abortion illegal basically



if thats the case why do they still have gun licenses they shouldnt be a thing imo and guns shouldnt be sold to the public"
satan punching air right now
i cant believe the insensitivity of every news channel and media outlet no one has even mentioned the grave impact this is having on transwomens right to an abortion 
glory almighty forevermore in jesus christ name amen father thank you for everything in jesus christ name amen father thank you for providing and protection may the most high have mercy on us beautiful day today in jesus christ name amen 
the government doesnt care about children because they wont ban freaking assault weapons but want to force people to have babies lets turn the tables on men and control their bodies and see how they like it
boohoohoo now we cant act like a bunch of prostitutes 
meanwhile downtown at walmart you cant buy a knitting needle or a bottle of gin for love nor money
abortion is not a womans right abortion is murder stop making up lies when has murder ever been a right
the bbc also spent a lot of time interviewing the redhaired greenscarfed proabortion activist couldnt they find any other proabortion activists of actual childbearing age
this man talking from texas seems to me that he can take a nife and kill a babe
so about the rape victims
just when i think america cant be more retarded they do this
but isnt it democratic to make it an issue you can vote on locally
"sit the f down for abortion rights abortion banned completely and without apology 
 we will erase even the memory of roe every copy of roe will be ripped from the books and be burned while even mentioning roe will be punishable by death the whole world will never know that it ever even happened"
what about the babys right to a life
"seems reasonable instead of judges in robes issuing laws and decrees from on high pass laws back to the states and let the people decide for themselves through their elected politicians im sure youd rather that than a scotus that decided it was going to be illegal across the nation to have abortions its the most democratic way of doing it face it its just not a constitutional right it never was roe v wade got smashed through on shaky grounds even rbg agreed leftists have been panicking for 50 years about this because they knew full well as soon as the scotus was dominated by constitutionalists rather than activists roe v wade would be overturned thats why theyve frothed at the mouth over trump  theyve been looking over their shoulders getting away with it for decades

its the same as if you wrote a garbage essay at school the noob teacher without a mark scheme gave you an a thinking it was brilliant then there was an audit of the essays and an experienced teacher with the mark scheme gave you a c its a mere correction

people need to chill out about what it is to have rights you dont have a right to someone elses resources or services you dont have an inherent right to a doctors time expertise drugs or treatments i find it funny the exact same crowd who were a couple of months ago and even now have been literally forcing people on pain of losing their livelihoods to take unproven vaccines are now all about bodily autonomy the hypocrisy stinks to high heaven"
biased much here lol thank god for 1776
the pro life woman is ridiculous  she wont answer a single question
women are going to leave red states mark my words
"what right to abortion
is that wording in the constitution
the right to murder a defenseless unborn baby
thats a right "
black peoples are the ones that suffer the most because of abortion
a victory for democracy 
channel4s biasness on full display the only thing the supreme court did was to give back the regulation of abortion back to the people and their elected representatives instead of just letting the federal government do it for them this ruling basically said no to big government overreach
this segment is absolute bullshit
more kids to be born to be shot at school
thank u trump for fighting for what is constitutionally right 
all we want is to terminate kidsis that much to ask  some leftist
best day of my life
they should exercise their rights by keeping their legs crossed
i really enjoy how seething mad that reporter in the first part is 
the court has decided that it is the states power to enact abortion laws and not that of the supreme court the ruling doesnt abolish abortion it only gives states the power to decide the laws and the court consists of women and black people so shut your mouth
leave all the the unwanted babies on the steps of the supreme court you wanted us to have them you fucking raise them
"norma mccorvey alias roe v wade she was roe she no longer living abortions clinic were only in low income area why is that because women in low income more likely get pregnant more due to protection how sad to abort babies up to time of birth that is under the case of murder babies in the womb know and feel the death and then they sale the baby parts for money that evil
god forgive all sin except rejection of his son jesus having aboration is not the answer god is the answer we as women wont go threw the full term because of having a big belly cant afford  the child its not the baby fault it we as women who just dont care remember god loves all"
happy to see possible future murderers crying 
last time i checked it takes two people to make a baby only one of them a woman it amazes me how blind america is to call abortion rights an exclusively female issue
cold blooded murder  guns dont kill abortionists do
any of these people preaching for the right to kill a baby need to look up serial killer dr kermit gosnell the abortionist who killed thousands of babies he would literally induce labor and snip the spinal cord of a living babies he did this thousands of times
i have 3 words for those judges  you disgust me 
crying because you cant kill a baby imagine
i live hearing the sqealing of demons who love death of the innocent
pro choice women on the video does not suffer the risk of needing an abortion anyway
get this british lady out of here do news on your own country
"oh how i look forward the next generations of unwanted children that have no morals or principles  running amokeventually robbing people for 2 and a buscuitall the disabled children that have live on the system and hand outsputting a strain on medical supplies
also i like how this was almost perfectly timed as the jan 6 hearings are wrapping uphere come the dogs and ponies"
thank god roe has been turned over to the states 60 million innocent children have been murdered may roe be destroyed forever just as slavery was abolished
amazing how the same people who can not define woman are all about womens rights now lol
all this behavior is still illegal and will work the opposite way to what you deranged people plan your version of democracy is that whenever you get what you want it works and all is well whenever not you riot like animals well not anymore youre losing in case you hadnt noticed riot away you filthy animals 50 years of murdering babies and dehumanizing anyone who disagrees with your insane views like champs all up in smoke
"this is an example of the outrageous harms which religions can achieve  
if your someone rapes you how do you explain that to a child which you are now legally bound to have what if its a familly member who rapes you 
what if having a child kills the mother
its is a persons right to determine what happens to their person 
religions are blind to the logic and have no concerns for life when they are supporting warfare between nations"
unbiased channel 4  the result if you have state media
baby norma mccorvey the plaintiff in roe v wade never had the abortion she was seeking she gave her baby girl up for adoption
the supreme court whose job it is to protect civil liberties just extended those liberties to unborn babies
sleepy joe complaining about trump had me laughing  
abortion was never constitutional it was simply a federal guarantee
oh no lefties cant murder babies
dont these proabortionists wonder why theres not an issue with plastic surgeons hair stylists etc thats changing your bodythe reason is those acts dont involve another human life a woman still has the right to choose a condom birth control abstinence adoption etc abortion is not birth control
hallelujah the lord has spoken 50 years of killing babies is finally over im so glad i live in a red state thats gonna overturn it as soon as next week
i detectd extreme bias from the presenter towards the prolifer with snorts of disdain when she speaks seems like the presenter has something in her own past
the journalist is disgusting
when is the red dresses and white hats coming in then i cant imagine it be too soon s
the death decree curse over americahas been broken
this is not about women rights its about teaching man and women to be responsible its not ok to have a hot steamy night and think its ok if i get pregnant ill have an abortion be more responsible
i really hope australia criminalises abortion no one should have a right to murder the innocent
"we missed our onramp

in 2016 we missed our onramp  the one that would have taken us onto a new plateau of democracy
imagine if after the election we had been watching a gathering of the likes of emmanuel macron angela merkel justin trudeau and hillary clinton imagine if we had no brexit no donald trump and a gagged and hogtied vladimir putin imagine how most of us would have felt with the trumpians putinites and an assortment of other white and christian nationalists and petty dictators left to lick their wounds and complain about the american political system
but instead we picked a side road that took us down dark and dirty paths where no selfrespecting human being and no proud american should want to go and even though the election of joe biden gave us new hope a world of corruption is still laughing in its beer at us and plotting to take us down the road to perdition as fast as it can and no one seems to be doing what we need to do to stop it
perhaps the whirlpool we are swirling in now is one we deserve maybe it was our karmic fate that we should make such a grave error in judgment but when a large portion of the nation does not vote and a third of the country votes to sink the ship of state and then attacks our capitol building what can the rest of us do but wring our hands pull our hair and weep for the folly of our fellow americans and what we know we may have lost
hillary oh hillary we left you twisting in the wind and all that many of us could do was blame you for our sins
woe is a people who do not recognize what is good for them or see the path they should take to an open road of freedom and wellbeing for all and instead follows a path to anger resentment hate and possibly the ultimate death of their republic
hillary clinton said that we are stronger together trump said that we need a wall to be safe walls do not make us safe they divide us and make us cowards walls do not make us great they make us weak walls do not protect us they make shadows for us to hide in until the walls come tumbling down and were exposed for who we are
and who are we is donald trump who we are or was he just an aberration if he was just an aberration and doesnt represent who we are and if as hillary said were stronger together then it is past time for us to show who we are
if the true vision of america and what it means to be an american does not include the likes of donald trump then we had better straighten up our backbones and do what we need to do to permanently ban this imposter and interloper from the peoples house and send him and his ilk to the exits before the infestation he brought to it returns to destroy us all
then we will be back on the road that will take us to the onramp that leads to where we belong as a free people in a truly democratic republic 

jrb"
why is the crazy host biased to killing babies
"this is the first time the supreme court has issued a decision going against liberty

dredd scott am i a joke to you"
whats with democrats obsessed with murdering babies liberalism is a mental disorder oh and theyre miserable evil people that wishes everybody was as miserable as them
hes are crying because they wanna keep fcken and killing lol
the hippie with the green headband is gonna be devastated when she realizes that she doesnt speak for all females
copelibtards
why abort when you can shoot them in schools america you now officially have more in common with the countries you fought against well done
"i think its a difficult ruling to make  i get both sides of the augment but there are times when abortion is needed
when the woman is raped
when the foetus is severely disabled 
when the women my die
when the girl is too young
when the baby wont survive 
the fetus is innocent but theres always grey areas and exceptions"
"back to federalism
just as the founding fathers intended
god bless this supreme court"
divide and conquer we are all be played and we are falling for it
50 years of womens  rights still remain
land of the free huh 
look at these children of the devil bawling because they cant legally murder unborn black babies
"why is this channel defending murder  i thought you were better than that i am pro choice people can do whatever they wish the government has no business in that decision 

this ruling does not outlaw abortion but puts it in the hands of states and the people where it should be"
oh dear what a biased report why cant ch 4 report it in a balanced way the anger of the interviewer was so unprofessional
"the supreme court didnt take the rights away you never had it

124 some women are pissed but there are plenty of women in the prolife side also you wont have children anyways so in one generation the problem is solved"
evil is defeated with good this day  life has won over death and darkness  anywhere where there is anger there is death
the supreme court took away the right to kill and murder innocent life
baby murder isnt a right sorry
how about careless women take responsibility and use contraception instead of ripping and dismembering a living feeling late term baby out of their guts
"sorry  what about contraceptions ladies
i know in some case it can be difficultstill what about contraception to avoid to go through this"
this is devastating for birthing persons rights
this is a good day for unborn babies in the us
if it is the will of the people then  get to decide within their states
since when killing babies is a part of civil liberties especially in the age of diversity and inclusion  how is it that some people  based on their location  age  and abilities are excluded  dismembered  and killed  
idiot joke biden dumbass satan constituents will never win
pro life and pro guns  protect unborn babies and then shoot them when their in school only in america
we gonna take away rights of women to have abortions but dont worry we might be able to increase the minimum wage later on what a fucking joke these prolifers dont give two shits about the lives of the people they are taking rights from
pro abortionist weirdos
stay out of our politics or we will interfere in yours
this has nothing to do with a country caring about the life of unborn children especially when they have no problem ending the lives of blk children this is about a particular race birth rate declining and the fear of becoming a minority their plan to mainly terminate the lives of blk babies backfired and started working against them
"those comments are useless and insulting to the economy of united states americans homeless as reach to all times higher than the western world and nobody wants to hire anyone how much can owners pay for minimum wages those people dont have common sense minimum wages should be much lower than to  7 dollars per hrs instead that this capitalist system increases the minimum wages and shots down the industry and put people into the streets and those successful capitalist moves to a philippines indonesia india china vietnam and manufacturing those materials were labor is 3 dollars per day great disfunction system that americans have created and still want to increase the minimum wages
that wrong and americans society needs to start to manufacture in this country"
nothing and i mean nothing is more disgusting than a liberal progressive white woman
"thank you god
thank you god
thank you godno more killing babies and murdering unborn babies"
great news baby murderers on suicide watch 
abortion will always exist in one way or another its noones first choice all this does is drive it underground and make it less safe for the in most cases vulnerable women involved
63 million killed since roe
"in other news 
wire coat hanger sales are on the increase as are the number of dumster babys"
"im tired of all these prochoice bigots implying that only women can get pregnant 
abortion is just as much of a mens rights issue as it is a womens rights issue this is 2022"
so in texas you will get up to 99 years in jail for having an abortion so if a woman was god forbid raped how many years would the guy 1 to 20 years max come on woman deserve better their body their choice just like it goes for men
i dont know why channel 4 news thinks we care whats happening in america can you please address the rwanda immigration plan and when the next flight is taking the refugees now thats real news put the uk first
channel 4 news is bullshit fake news
"the right and privilege of driving have to be licensed to certify eligible and competent drivers for the safety of others the institution of marriage has a very similar function a commitment to posterity that should not be degraded
the primal instincts of procreation are a very powerful force otherwise the species wont survive and there needs to be an enormous amount of direct responsibility and personal investment by every generation to socialize and develop those little new barbarians to join the civilized society
another way around the abortion issue  
alternate enforcement of personal responsibility is done with the implantation of longterm contraceptives at puberty of both sexes unless a bond is posted that pays for an accident this performance bond insurance would provide financial support in the event of a divorce which would be costly for highrisk people there would be a provision of parental liability for serious parental malpractice substance abuse during pregnancy liability for deciding the gender of the progeny that later feel enormous regret
no need to kill protohumans"
soo its un democratic to let states decide if the people vote in a state not to have abortion then its just democracy
accountability is finally here 
"in the animal kingdom 95 of animals dont even kill their own young
these people are lower than animals
how sad how deranged how pathetic"
upset by loosing a right to kill a babythose people are so stupid and sick
people get upset when  we talk about the holocaust   wake up you liberals   abortion  is a holocaust   praise god it is finally  coming to a end
it never was a constitutional right 
look at these looney lefty cry babies go home you are pathetic so glad with this decision god is good
a momentous day in american history
this is a non issue for responsible people
its not a right to kill your baby
the ignorant celebrate believing funds for mothers bbs are avail wout roe nonsense pigs have more rights  gov subsidies than women mothers  infants oddly guns have more rights than all
lol the girl with tape over mouth she thinks that isnt a good thing nobody wants to listen to her crying
you lost people cope and concede god has won this day
"yey devolution and more democracy now people can vote for what abortion laws they want in their state
this is democracy "
these people who wanted roe v wade overturned are stupid abortion will not be abolished all that will happen is that women will end up having illegal abortions and risking their lives
"just to remind you america was exponentially better off socially mentally economically and even in health back in 1970s

so when these people try to paint the picture of regression its actually the opposite this is a progressive decision"
were going backwards all the way to idiocracy
millions of lives destroyed you say you want the baby to live yet when the baby is born what will you do to help it theres plenty of people out their who are not only ready but can die giving birth you say adoption saves lives yet you havent adopted you say put them in foster care yet you have no idea how hard and cruel the system is to childern there are kids kids who have been sexually abused and assaulted and who are being forced forced to undergo the pain of child birth ya know this is just all ok until it comes to you until all this happens to you and you would look back and want to change your decision about abortion but you cant its not about the baby its about being controlled by not only a government but men
so ironic the land of freedom lacking of what made them so big incredibly sad for this new im glad my country has legal free abortion up to the 24th week
weird peoples
the crying faces make my heart so happy
im dying to know what the brits have to say about this 
"is incredible how much rage is out there if women doesnt want a child simply use the precious or if somehow they change their mindsimply use the day after pill  that is available in all the country but still the ruling of today by the supreme courts is protecting women rights for 12 weeks after women become pregnant and still not enough for those privileges womans 
yes united states  is returning to the 70 s 
and im glad that this is happening  during the 70 s americans had cultures and morals values took 50 years for the court to recognize and recover from this past 50 years great day for americans and great day for the greatest president of united states donald trump may gods bless donald trump and the americans whos enforce the law"
 so politicians are deciding what a women should do with her life health mind and body
flesh tax on the poor what the actual fck does that even mean
biased reporting
oh its trumps faultwhat a jokeabortion rights were never voted in by the people brainwashingno more miracle makeup for those drag queens using aborted baby body parts no more natural flavors in foods with baby cloned kidney parts
"50 years worth of womens rights _sic_ in america overturned in an instant

and _245 years_ of slaveowner rights were overturned when the 13th amendment was ratified in 1865

your point"
something unites all those protesting on both sides of the argument  they werent aborted
im not even against abortion but you were ok with handing over bodily autonomy last year with experimental injections did you think things would always go your way you called it freedumb i believe
is this the land of the free 
how does it abolish right to privacy
religion should not play a part in politics too many people use it as justification without actually thinking about it properly abortions should be a choice some situations should call for it without hesitation some situations maybe there needs to be some sort of consequences to both parties involved make other people think twice
praise the lord
how many of these confused women would give their life to save a child  babies life inmurder is out
lol the pro choice person is a dude
another sick backward step   a womans right to choose   evil religious right   believing in god is beyond delusional 
increase in backstreet illegal abortions sad
i dont know why any of these historical pro choice women are even concerned its highly unlikely that any man would dare get anywhere close for them to be at risk of getting pregnant
"loudest voice is those who born
iwant2killbaby"
"praise jesus 

all those who support abortion should repent before the wrath of god fall on them"
yes this is the same as segregation you all are delusional segregation is bad so is killing a baby
get yalls tubes tied god bless the unborn innocent
"typical humanity in a nutshell 

youngsters taking part in a protest where they find it trendy to go along with opinions on a matter they have never experienced for themselves

highly religious comments about how gods word has been spoken in its truest form a victory for the will of christ himself 

idiots declaring the decision as a modern day normandy landing

people saying that amongst putins wrath coronavirus war in the middle east going further back to 2 world wars slavery murderous caliphates concentration camps disease auctions and serial mass murders

and they are actually saying abortion rights overshadow it all as the single worst thing to ever happen or exist

really is that the collective intelligence of the primary species on planet earth

ok sure we should be happy actually happy that one day soon it will be a life sentence for a young violated teenage girl to refuse the prospect of putting herself through suicidal terror fear and haunted memory just to bring an offenders child to term thus gifting humanity with a deviants prodigy

wow 
as if i need any more proof that humanity needs a reset"
gods in charge
"i love the joy on everyones face that knows how evil the past 50 years have been
no more sacrifices to luciferian secret societies"
that thumbnail is just pure gold lol and got to say ch4 have out done themselves for bias reporting in this video
"shame on all who support abortion
we live in a wicked and delusional generation
"
america should balkanise the left and democrats hate everything that is american it would be better if they just formed their own country
9 supreme legislators with lifetime appointment mental system
thats it back to the stone age i hope every single one of these women protesting on the side of the overturn suffers really suffers
the usa must be the most fucked up society on the planet horrid place
why is no one addressing the fact that science is very clear on this a fetus is not a person period
a dark day for sure while its ideal to create laws based on religious ideals the truth is usually not a good idea people have different perspective on things and not only laws have to be fair theres usually a good reason not create a law based on religious beliefs while roe vs wade started on rather selfish note it turned to a critical law in the constitution of women rights the other laws the supreme court are going after just as important these laws were put in place for good reason without them there would be consequences affecting everyone the supreme court needs to be taken aside and talked to about these laws or replace with people who are at least willing to listen
crazy god followers again ruining everything
can u imagine being distraught that you cant kill babies
this is a very bad decision
ive never really understood why antiabortionists think they should have jurisdiction over somebody elses body what has it got to do with them i mean fine if they dont want an abortion then great dont have one i am in favour of abortion but i dont try to insist that antiabortionists should have abortions even though i think it would probably be for the greater good of society
clarence thomas just said that contraception is an error that the supreme court has a duty to correct now that roe is overturned
you know how common postpartum depression is even with women who wanted a baby people who wouldve gotten abortions may end up taking their own lives or the babies life anyway people barely know what they want until they are almost in their 30s itll end up forcing people to wreck their mental health and in turn the babies if anything restrict the amount of time they can have an abortion but fundamentally the right should remain
constitutional right  the constitution makes no reference to abortion typical c4 misinfo
oh no the girl on the thumbnail is crying because she was told that being able to kill a child is her human right oh but no sorry youve been mistaken  we all have a right to life in fact and a human beings life beings in the womb  its where we all started  so we have a right to life and a right not to have our personal autonomy infringed upon thats our own bodies inside a womb there  so no nice try at propaganda though channel 4
people really ming your own uterus as a man you shouldnt try to control ours
distributing free fire extinguishers does not prevent fires  people should learn how to use matches  when a woman undergoes an abortion she suffers both psychosocially and physically  abortion shows boys that they can continue to have fun without feeling the slightest responsibility  girls and boys need the right education  girls can choose to have an abortion but they can not force the doctors to commit murder and throw the 6 month old human being in the trash
this is awesome news praise god forever so sad people crying to be able to have the right to have their baby chopped up into pieces and put into a freezer democrats have brainwashed people and turned them into a fornicating generation with no respect for themselves or for their children pray the states have the votes to ban it nation wide
the correspondent is so abundantly biased in her reporting that it is laughable
when 50 of caucasian women get their tubes tied lets see how fast they reverse the decision but on a serious note since they say it should be left up to states and citizens why not then require that states put it up to a vote this would allow citizens to have a right to vote on the individual issue instead of living under dictatorship by having a governor tell a woman or couple what they have to do with their bodies if the voters of each state sign a petition in large numbers then it will have to be voted on as a ballot initiativeamendments if not vote them all out so they just overturned roe but then will do nothing to ensure safer streets via gun violence for those same embryos what a schizophrenic set of decisions
no this is the right decision no person women or man should have the ability to kill their child life starts at conception
puts that whole trans woman thing in perspective now huh 
can we finally call liberals domestic terrorists when they start looting  burning cities this weekend or is that term reserved for only conservatives still
"now who has to make sure that a condom is in use before intercourse  
oh the choices"
"thank you donald
thank you mitch
at last a supreme court that respects the constitution
god bless this supreme court"
now ban channel 4
"so unborn human beings cant be murdered on the whims of the irresponsible 
excellent  "
"you cant argue with experts ch4 thats what you told us over covid this was the supreme court they understand the law far better than you
congratulations to all the progressives that got this old fashioned law changed"
ah i feel so sad that they are not allowed to kill babies anymorenotttt
a sad day for the usa but on the bright side more kids may lead to more school shooters
my body my choice also applies to the baby
its a complicated issue
"2021 if it saves just one life
2022 nooo not those lives"
these pro choice people are baby murderers
very biased promurderreporting from the channel 4 here
"wonderful praise god may god bless america for a small step in turni g back to him 
they may by gods grace learn to keep there legs closed and stop murdering babies
well done supreme court god continue to lead you
god bless"
ban whores then you fkn dribblers
are abortion rights destroying the us progressive movement of clinton pelosi
"today ive never been prouder of my adopted country
first bruen and now dobbs
what a glorious 4th its going to be this year for our 246th birthday
god bless this supreme court
born british proud texan by choice"
just know that without roe v wade  our country would be full blown communist today
it wasnt a right to begin with classic lying media
reporter the view is that you cant ban abortions you just ban safe abortions strange how the left is never using the same line of reasoning when it comes to banning guns
america is not a first world country
my wife is not pissed she happy it was overturned
no judge should have a lifetime position for obvious reasons retirement is there for a reason 
330 bias much terrible reporter
seems like america brought a piece of the taliban home with them theyll be stopping girls from going to school next
to all pro life americans now you know what propaganda news against you looks like huh
hilarious
this is a great day for humanity its bizarre that the people who are pro choice for children to go through severe operations to change from male to female or female to male are probably the ones who would take away other childrens right to life through abortion one thing both of these actions have in common are that they are an attack on children
reporter the supreme court has gone against the will of the people no actually the opposite has happened now people can vote and have exactly the kind of abortion laws they want in each state
"ive noticed that those who are for abortion have already been born
now let the salt flow"
america just turned itself into a christian caliphate
"this bristish reporter needs to stick to covering the royal family stuff
and stop giving out phoney info 
  read the us constitution and the bill of rights"
"seeing as it goes to the states what about the states committing and trying to legalise infanticide
what are they doing with baby parts"
abortion is an abomination and a sinlong live father godgiving life is no jokelet god decide who lives or diesabortion is child sacrificerepent jesus christ is coming back now
i am pretty sure that passing the progressive policies first would have been the correct order all  the republicans are going to do is vote down everything that the lady mentioned anyway
this biaches screaming with joy dont even realize a constitutional right is taken away which is very sad shame on  you woman shame on you
american civil war 20 incoming
they are screeching like harpies
close your legs or use protection stop using abortion as contraception
they are going to protest expecting the same results as 2020 but this time around all the shop owners got guns now
what liberties or rights does the unborn child have
literally millions of lives saved due to this decision
channel 4 stop with the lieshave u no shame the right to abortion does not exist in the american constitutionthats why roe v wade was overturnright to abortion it os not a constotutional rightthey send tje power back to the states
there never was a constitutional right for an abortion
these pro life people are the most ignorant karens youll ever see no point in getting their point of view on this because its pure ignorance  and pettiness
holy moly god help american woman unbelievable 
"its like taking normandy beach

bruh"
we need progress we need michelle o in there right now
rip tinder app
i hope channel 4 give such bias in favour of all murderers in their future reports
this report is such bs and biased
they talk as if they are banning completely when they are actually just letting their own states decide instead of the government getting involved that is in nature with the whole point of the american experiment
this is ridiculous  america is supposedly founded on individual freedom and liberty  come again
this a fantastic step forward for american democracy now the states themselves get the chance to set their own laws for their own women on this issue
britain next please maybe we can have replacement levels of reproduction if women cant use murder as a contraception
im one of those babies who was meant to be aborted but my mom was too far along i was never meant to exist and i wish i hadnt taking abortion rights away from women doesnt save babies it just makes life harder for the mother and the unwanted child especially in countries where socioeconomic safety nets are non exist ie usa if you dont want an abortion dont have one
who has more rightsdoes the right to lifea baby have more right and the already alive female pregnantto freedom of choiceits a terrible legal crazinessi am not a justicei would hate to be these judgesi believe in life and a push to educate women and men on the need for good birth controland really good state run nurserysand child careso the women on state incomeget a chance to get an educationworktrainingto get a feeling of accomplishmentto end the cycle of povertyafter school programsbetter schools in urban areas in generalencouraging men to stay connected with their childrenget more men of color and ethnicity to be role models for the young men without dadstreat everyone with dignityand respect
guess certain gals wont be able to sleep around so freely anymore or use actual protection the amount that use it as contraception or to scam people etc is most likely insane one step closer to actual equality i guess
abortion should be regulated people need to be responsible for their actions
abortion isnt even in the constitution
748 whos this beast
being antiabortion has to be the cheapest form of morality around  you dont have to pony up any money to help a kid have a decent start in life you can just sit back in your easy chair and selfrighteously condemn others for difficult life choices its really the perfect republican issue no skin in the game
i bet the taliban are happy with this
utterly sad and disgusting
3rd wave of feminism is a cancer
left wing pricks 
american freedom at its finest
60 years ago our congress hid like rats rather than make a law regarding this   obama had a majority in both houses and was too afraid to make a law regarding it now the left wants to blame the supreme court   it is not their job to make laws blame your lazy congress whichever way you believe
the false balance in this report is disappointing
"get your facts stright 
abortion was   never  a constitutional right "
love the meltdowns  
the correct decision anything not covered in the constitution is left up the states or the people
"this is literally democracy in action people can now vote to make it legal or illegal and put whatever restrictions they want on abortion on a state by state basis or get abortion passed at the federal level of course that wont work because as of now at least half the country either doesnt want it to be legal at all minority or wants severe restrictions on it majority 

most people have no clue what roe v wade was about or why it made zero sense constitutionally now itll actually be up to the people thats called democracy"
all women who support abortion in the us need to imidiately withhold conjugal rights for all their men and maybe a mass hunger strike will change the minds of these far right bible bashing men when they see their own daughters and grandaughters starving to death women in the usa need to show these crackpots that belief in a made up god that enforces their idelology on all the women of the usa
wow  america the land of gun care and health control
america land of the free as long as the religious nuts allow it
there was never a constitutional right to abortion in the first place
a great day for humanity a bad day for irresponsible women and adrenechrome consumers
americans eyeroll
how can anyone force a woman accept a baby she doesnt want babies would end up abandoned
"funny how they one minute care so much for a fetus but just loosened the gun  laws where you can carry a combat weapon to a school  and shoot everyone 
the woman should have the right to choose its her body"
this will divide america further i wonder if there will be huge protests
"this is the will of god
no more murdering babies
other countries will follow i pray"
i feel like my milks coming in fifty years worth
rip american dream
mmmm its sad to see a modern country cave to religion
are you kidding me this will not stand
vote these radical judges must be gone
they have gone against the will of the people i am not sure this dumb woman understands the role of the supreme court  hardly surprising as it is garbage for bird brains
what screaming banshees
"uk tories bill of rights will allow them to rewrite human rights too
 the lords cant stop it because they never block these actions if it was part of an election manifesto"
i wonder why all those obsessed lesbofeminists are so frustrated there is no chance any of them would get pregnant anyways
go babies    mine that channel 4 salt haha
so a woman can die and thats just fine
and men continue to be free of responsibility while women suffer more and more so messed up
the inaccuracies in this piece is unbelievable
loli would like to remind amerikkka that 53 of white women voted for trump good luck with the fallout
when you rely on man made laws values change over time and are not stable
heading for civil war i reconamerica is just a   mad crazy bowl of steaming soup
they will continue to oppress women
the women are pissed lady 123 well not in my  name im  really 
im not against the overturning  it but it is slippy slope because if it is a crime  there are going to be more back alley clinics which might be more dangerous for women
the republicans are very similar to the talibans in they way they approach the rights for women
no to vaccine passports mandates or lockdowns
this is outrageous
this is not about prolife its about antiwoman
rwv was bad law in the first place rights dont come from the government they come from our humanity and our creator read our constitution
shouldnt this have a triggered warning 
supreme court did no such thing all it literally did was look at the constitution and nowhere could they see a right to abortion mentioned anywhere so referred abortion back to individual states to decide on their own abortion laws  for instance oregan still has the right to abort up to 9 months as sickening as that is
usa government evil dictator sales guns too killing each other europe laugh at usa
next is what forced veganism
misleading azz story lmfao it means the state decides i personally believe all black women should have the right to choose now the right to choose tomorrow the right to choose forever 
why is clinic escort a thing
a country going backward because of primitive superstitious waffle man made all gods gods made idiot children into fools for life
fairy tale believing mindless zealots dictating their idiot beliefs onto others grow up kiddies
excellent for two reasons 1 the constitution says nothing about dismemberment abortions and these ugly leftists in 1973 simply made it up exactly as they did in the dredd scott case where another dem appointed judge upheld slavery by claiming that the obvious equality provisions of the constititon did not apply to blacks as blacks were merely property like a horse is property of course nothing in the constution mentioned slavery or suggested that blacks were slaves rather it guaranteed freedom for al men equality leftists like to make crap up that is not there ditto for abortion  not mentioned in any sense and the founders knew of abortion and debated it and decided through a vote not to address it one way or the other 2 it is up to the people to debate the issue and to decide for themselves on a state by state basis wheteher to allow it generally or in some situations and not others or in all that is democracy jail those judges tha lied for 50 years and cause so much harm

i am confused i am not an american isnt ametica ment to be a democracy but so many people are against thus but have no say the discion is being made the court gaving a abortion ia such a person thing seem like a basic right has been taken from you they not going raise you kids and help feed it when your broke they have no idea of the trauma of being raped and having to liturally carry that if your against abortion fine don t get an abortion but don t push it other people their ife thier choices
and a year later abortion rights are being enshrined into state constitutions all over the country amazing result for the pro choice side i guess the pro life side isnt the force it thought it was they just had a fundamentalist sc to do their bidding sc doesnt lead if the people wont follow

"it is a womans right whether or not to get an abortion 
no one elses  so shut the uck up"
the abortion right should be banned  hello abortion is immoral  and unconditional  think about it the first amendment garentees certain inalienable rights the right to justice peace life liberty and the pursuit of happiness how is abortion going to protect the rights of the unborn children and what is the difference between an unborn child and another child or someone who is over 90 so keep your pants up no unwanted baby and for as rape is considered most rape ends with your own body miscarrying anyways

"right to life antiabortionists have just made their entire platform null and void through their willful support of euthanasia they are now the biggest hypocrites on earth
canada has legally murdered hundreds of thousands of seniors disabled poor and destitute canadians through their euthanasia program prolife has not only been outrageously silent about this legalized murder of innocent people a lot of them actually support it
the prolife antiabortionists have not said one word against these legalized murders proving that they really have zero regard for human life once its born they dont care about children living in abuse or poverty because theyre born to a mother who neither wants them or can afford them at no time have they ever supported the women themselves once they give birth to these unwanted children nor do they care what happens to the children and now their hypocrisy is blatantly obvious for the entire world to see through their silence and apathy they have fully supported canadas murder euthanasia program
you dont get more evil or hypocritical than that
antiabortionists are the original karens and every last one of them wants to control women and none of them care about any form of human rights except their own narcissistic control over others
they absolutely support murdering innocent people just not unborn fetuses"
"some of you folks are sick use a condom 
fighting to kill prenatalpreborn sentient human babies is a disgrace

i hope you people one day will experience the same death you seem to advocate for"
crazy to think that they are so pro life but yet still have the death penalty in a lot of states what hypocrisy you cant be both pro life and pro death all at the same time what a joke that country is

biden administration is being investigated for human trafficking killing babies for sale of organs selling kids for sex   stokes  jolly ltd professor richard kellogg jolly teaches businesses ceos politicians government democrats how to traffic research myths and facts about women and children sex trafficking  leave the women alone  pro  choice 
the militant antichoicers will stop at absolutely nothing until they finally succeed in enshrining the patently odious concept of fetal personhood throughout the american political landscape  thankfully this extraordinarily unfortunate political development will never become reality in canada
fortunately the recriminalisation of abortion in canada through legislative andor judicial means will not see the light of day  evidently abortion has long remained a proverbial thirdrail of canadian politics

were like 8 billion people i dont think we need more people also thanks anti abortion now we might get higher risk of death for some poeple or babies or babies might be born with certain difficulties and now if someone gets pregnant they will be forced to become a mother unless they travel to another state this flat out sucks for women and a little bit for some men too because i doubt they all would wanna be a father
doc is mad because he loses a paycheck
what about abortion rights for men anyways a woman named sydney ladd not only didnt inform me that she got pregnant she aborted it as well
yeah i agree one if not its going to happen afraid to make my own campaign i actually feel
forcing a women to carry a fetus against her will is involuntary servitude
scotus is forgetting the 13th amendment to the united states constitution states readsthat neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for a crime where the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction
when will we women vote for conservative and twisted men issues as they do 
when will we women vote for conservative and twisted men issues as they do 
"heres an easy way to make sure the supreme court takes up the idea of maybe we should have gone ahead and let rovers his way stand
make it mandatory for every single male on the u s supreme court that made that decision to be castrated
also an email governor that passes such a horrible law make sure that theyre castrated
when they realize that theyre about to have everything chopped off
they allow legal abortions again"
this is such dishonest reporting the right to murder your child wasnt revoked it was just sent back to the states per the constitution roe was based on a lie anyway if you want to murder your child  even after birth  there are moloch worshiping states like virginia and california imagine being redraced mad over not being able to slut around and murder children without consequence
people who against abortion should be sent to north korea that country suits ur mindset
its just sa now
one of the greatest days in modern american history
men need to keep their business out of this what do they carry their life isnt on the line
praise the lord prayers really do change things i admit i never thought id see this there hope for the world after all
america can ban abortion quickly but wont ban assault rifles being sold to lunatics the whole world is laughing how how the country is run
that is wrong how a woman cant get an abortion but the phscopaths have a right to buy assult weapons with 100 round drum magazines to shoot up schools no wonder the rest of the world is laughing at america
"dont abort your child 

youll feel relief now but in the future youre guaranteed remorse guilt regret shame depression and even despair every time you see the beautiful smile of a child"
abortion is murder and as a man i have the right to say that because ill directly be affected by this
unborn should ideally have the right to the womb its their home where they are supposed to be
thank god
0 states made abortion illegal its just not a constitutional right women can still kill their babies
it depends with circumstances
i dont agree with legal abortion 
"change the system socially  men should sleep and stay in another bedroom   women are fertile only for  a few days of the month  avoid having a physical relationship on those days  
also babies and small children should be close to their mother at night  not  a horny adult male "
abortion is mentioned in the bible but it is not mentioned as a good or bad thing
american dream lol where people can have the most freedom
china number 1 even in here we can abort babies usa have no human rights they discriminate  all non white people we should group up and fight against usa most evil contry in the world
abortion should be the choice of the women themselves period
i am so happy that i dont live in americai feel terrible for the plight of american women
very good decision
abortion is against the human rights
not anti or pro abortion however i do question why is abortion being used as a contraceptive being that there are so many more options available to prevent a pregnancy
great
god bless usa 
a woman cant impregnate herself but men will gladly make laws to deny her a choice in decisions about her own body
its unbelievable that those against abortion to the draconian point seem to be ok with giving their children guns to take to school to murder other children
godblessounation
government pushing this pretty hard there probably planning a future war
"i am so sorry and scared with what is happening in the usa over a womans right to choose if she wants to have a child we are at a cross roads in society populations are declining in socially developed countries and we have been propping up our traditional systems for economic growth through the use of immigration we are moving towards a point where if we are to continue to grow our economies we need to either tackle the declining birthrate or develop a better system of importing labor one that benefits both the countries sending and receiving populations
our greatest asset in the uk is our knowledge and the amazing systems we have developed to deliver it our schools colleges companies and universities that train our young people i am a firm believer that by growing our education sector we can solve both these issues
if you are in the uk when you vote in your local elections please remember to check you are not voting for a prolife politician as we do have them in the uk"
great 
the government is right  remember the first commandment  thou shalt not kill  that includes your unborn babies ladies you cant just kill them if you want to its against gods law
i would like to suggest an enormous classaction law suit to make the supreme court pay child support for the children who are brought into the world under duress and a multitude of challenges for the womanand usually only the woman put their money were their mouths are  it would be shot down but it would shed light on what they claim are their christian beliefs and concern for the fetuses
on my pack of cigarettes it says smoking can cause my unborn child to die if antiabortionists are serious about saving fetuses then they would also have to treat smokers like criminals that would mean no more smoking in the red states like kentucky and virginia where the tobacco grows just another example of republican hypocrisy
good now girls can learn to close their legs the next bill should be the removal of child support and the punishment of paternity fraud women need to be held accountable and punished for their actions
so safe sex is not a thing anymore huh interesting maybe wait for a real relationship or marriage then have a child why are women and men surprised that sex  having a baby ignorance is not okay people neither is killing a life because of the consequence of having sex good maybe men and women should be more careful now with whoever they have sex with i agree with no abortions im prolife 
nice less work for me
the unborn child is alive and deserves the right to live god doesnt make junk or mistakes every child is precious in the eyes of the lord why would we give women more rights than the innocent unborn child do you think the unborn doesnt feel pain in the womb i assure you they do i have studied abortion and its procedures do your research its not as simple as you think one procedure puts an instrument into the womb to scramble and kill the baby during this procedure it has been observed the baby backing up and trying to move away from the foreign object the unborn child senses danger and trys to protect himself i have witnessed doctors telling their horrific abortion stories of removing arms and limbs of the baby it is barbaric and wrong
praise god the unborn child is safe
if you dont want kids give them to us they will live good life simple and happy one 
pro choice all day everyday  love too every women world wide going through together were stronger together we overcome  wales uk  
lol abortion is so dumb
its americas own fault
yes hahah finally some good news
abortion is murder i state the obvious because people deny the obvious look in detail at 1 the stages of development of a foetus week by week and 2 the methods actually used to kill the babies and you will understand more what it is there is no right to kill we dont have a right to kill newborns for instance they can be put up for adoption if necessary but not killed the same logic should be applied for poor defenceless babies in the mothers womb
hope this kids will have a good family
ofc they all have rainbow flags and rainbow hair and cat ears
also legally and ethical religion is irrelevant prolife wanting to ban all abortion is unrealistic  although rare there still exist that abortion is needed to save the mothers life why isnt this brought up
what was the reason they turned her away with trauma how does abortion help with that
prochoice would need to prove that keeping abortion is part of the constitution since it isnt you cant reoverturn the decision
doctors should protect and respect life such disgusting doctor to kill innocent lives hell for you is welcoming 
i love the song jesus loves the little children
god answered our prayer prolife all the way
as a kenyan health worker  i should say in our constitution though its is unclear when life begins  after conception  in our laws every kenyan woman is to protect life of the unborn child and will only be carried out if the pregnancy poses a threat to the expectant mother here the issue of is not tied with womans rights because the right to life overides it
americans are so sensitive about abortion but at the same time dont care about women and children dying in the war on terror
"yes abortions can be said to be right because a pupeteerage and a feeling and an emotion is a invite to have a message be profoundly enforced
ex a outsider of a group or in a group individualized trying to escape an existence is using a persons body ex woman  female her sheetc to birth a hopeful continuance suggests an unseen critiquer and a judger and a measurer etc to enforce a prevention al mimicking of inbredism and or hazardous breeding so that a starve of simulation of practices suggestive to tribalism ignorance deceitful intentful predatorial and reckless mating  babies being used as weapons against persons families etccan be stopped the only persons that would be angry at message posted would be deceitful intenters probably involved in some type of criminal activity
also abortions prevent regrets second doubts fear  worry and overpopulation attending and humn slavery  also sex slavery and unnecessary not authorized science experimenting  forced choice action of organ stealing etcdrop the microphone now depopulate"
"guys abortion may be illegal soon if you accidentally get a girl pregnant make sure shes an antivaxxer
instead of paying for 18 years of child support youll only have to pay for 3"
america is so funny they ban their own abortion i just watched a video about witchcraft by witches shave your head and get in the closet i swear they do it on purpose im laughing they are so stupid
"back in the day i had halfway convinced myself that the 10weekold clump of cells i aborted wasnt human yet until five years later when my sister said out loud on her deathbed she has a soni can see his face yeah god revealed to her the baby i had secretly aborted which opened my eyes to the reality of a fetuss full humanity in the womb from the moment of conception there are no secrets with god and he will expose them when the time is right

before i formed you in the womb i knew you and before you were born i consecrated you i have appointed you as a prophet to the nations 

jeremiah 15"
but why is it illegal now i dont understand this decision
if you cant speak for yourself democrats will kill you
and it will impact women from poor backgrounds mostvilethey wont care even if these women kill themselves for having to have a child they dont wantdoesnt sound very pro life to me
finally
this is misinformation abortion was never a right maybe stick to covering news i your own country because this shit should be flagged
good i hope its banned all over the world 
"i  used to work at an abortion clinic and i saw some extremely messed up shit there which is why im so antiabortion now i remember a 23 year old woman came in 7 months into her pregnancy and said i dont want this stupid baby anymore kill it and the doctor said okay and he put jumper cables up her baby hole and connected them to a car battery and let it run for six days straight 
after every successful abortion the doctor would shout take that baby and  push a red button that made sirens go off and confetti fell from the ceiling and wed all get maccy ds for free"
they want women to have back alley  regardless be nice in our comments
yeah mistake by the court regardless women are going to have abortions
i wanna hook up but they let it out how they willing to do it it was awful how they murder unborn kid i care but most of the wholes guys dont care just whatever privacy from 
great day to be a male adult in this great nation of the usa
they still have the right to have an abortion they just mad because the federal government isnt paying for it they need to stop lying all they did was kick it back to the states to decide just like the constitution says it should be woman are still in control of their own body and someone needs to speak up for the unborn human being that some people are okay with killing why is it okay to have an express lane to kill babies in the first place perhaps we should focus on why that is
i have question if women can abort the baby cause its their will so does that mean men dont have to pay child support this is just question so dont give to me
"by right to abortion you mean the enshrined right to murder babies 


yeah youre that low"
by deatrice moore i have to agree with justice kavanaugh its not about abortion its about controlling women attempting to make them virtuous according to christian belief and morality delegitimizing any and all forms of birth control forcing women to engage in sex for reproduction only giving men the right to determine family size forcing women to be house wives mothers and home makers only reducing the ability to seek higher education and employment outside the home forcing women to stay in relationships that may be unhealthy for them and the children because they are totally dependent on their husband for support decreasing single parent households thereby increasing the number of traditional families read and comprehend the meaning importance and ramifications of the 1873 comstock law which remains on the books last enforced in 1996 has never been repealed or overturned it is currently enforceable in 21st century america
best solution abstain from sex
"all this for an unwanted unborn fetus who if survives till fullterm may aswell be dumped in the foster care at birth just to grow up without a loving parent a caring family a protective home
 have an underprivileged povertyridden lonely childhood

and even worse that vulnerable child could be abused raped  end up getting pregnant by age 10

then she will be forced to carry the pregnancy even though a 10year old child is mentally  physically unfit to endure pregnancy  childbirth

the very people who claim to be her lifes advocate before birth will no be longer  concerned whether she dies due to pregnancy complications
because a babys life in only important in the womb  will no longer valuable ever since she takes her very first breath in this world

sensible people can see how wrong all this is
there is no point in proclaiming to be a prolifer if you cant  guarantee a quality life to all the unwanted babies that were forced to be born due to your decision  irrational beliefs

better focus on the welfare of orphans  children of low income families that are already alive"
for anyone who supports abortion is a disgusting human being killing the unborn thats twisted and using the most lamest excuses for it
why american women protest and cry to kill their baby stop having sex or cut out your whomb geez
it dint even do anything lol
abortion is a terrible thing you cant kill your own kind it is immoral im glad that many states have banned abortion
somebody should remind the us supreme court justices that our constitution begins with we the people and not with we the states
my body my decision everyone else needs to stfu and mind their own business
best day ever  abortion should be illegal muder is muder period
if its the womens right to choose to have the babythen if she chooses to have it the women should be the one who paysas the man had no say
poll what is the best thing about abortion
"my dr denied me my tubes tied 
in abusive domestic and threatening circumstance he was aware with csections one baby after another forced sex too soon and caused me un necessary scar tissue pain etc
drdenied me
what about my right to my body"
ok u r taking away this right wht can one do if after giving birth mother decide not to take care of baby nothing then who will suffer baby rather then these rights should be there everyone has to live with human dignity i m not saying this in favour of women i m concern about poor baby
when one of them gets rapped and be told u gotta keep this kid i wanna see what they gone say after that
some used it as birth control  sad and wrong
so a woman with down syndrome who is either unwilling or unable to care for her child is forced to have it zero chance our repugnican lawmakers will fund social services for the childs care are women still permitted to abort when downs is present the effects are already so damning and the future reprocussions daunting
we need change and biden out of the whitehouse
"the movie 2001 a space odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion a space odyssey is a fetus in the womb the clint eastwood dirty harry movies was angry calm it seems nasty but its a good police officer angry calm is how a women chooses abortion 

everything in motion  makes one error your supposed to park the errors where it doesnt matter or you play wack a mole with errors its intelligently designed that if you try killing god you will always make one error a movie is in motion so you have to park the errors where it doesnt matter 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind that why hal computer eye is colored red so it still has artistic integrity  2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made it only has one error to park you cant do better than that"
there never was a right to an abortion in the constitutionabortion is murder  and if you watch the procedure you will agree  people dont realize that sex is not something to be careless about if you want to see less unloved children then teach your kids the difference between right and wrong  dont have sex before marriage
the funny thing is that they only care about babies just when they are in the womens womb but once they are born they dont give a st about them 
if abortion is legal you wont able have these children born out of chance and circumstances that we can make out as pedophiles for wanting to live a normal life like the rest of us how we would be able to identify people by knowing them more than they do if they dont existwheres our sincibilities and us as a people if we dont have that
200 years in the future well look back and be disgusted at how killing the unborn through choice was ever normalized just like 200 years later were disgusted at slave owners smh
this is rediculous
make a swift reverse this is out of controll and we all know what these harmfull decisions will result in get it together american govt my heart goes out to all these american woman and there families who support them just wrong
if you dont like it dont have sex you are willing to do the deed but you cant deal with the consequences  so a unborn child should die because you are irresponsible  bull thats not for women thats for both women and men im tired of hearing people complain a unborn baby shouldnt die because you think sex is just fun grow up and protect yourselves
"hello may i share an old testament verse with you from daniel 714 and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations  languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed  also can i share isaiah 535  but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him  with his stripes we are healed

this is so disgusting i bet the rich wives of these powerful men wont ever have to worry about this pathetic
statistics show that countries which prohibit the rights to abort have higher abortion rates than those who dont statistics have also shown that abortion rates are on the decline due to better education and contraception making abortion illegal will actually cause it to rise again among poverty and crime rates we all want to reduce abortion nobody wants unwanted pregnancies making it illegal is not the answer
sorry bbc no more sacrifices to moloch
"cann we focus more on the problem of fertilizing chimp embryos with human genes
we do not need human chimp hybrids spending the money on that rn when our children have little odds of being able to have water in their 20s is ridiculous i feel like roe vs wade is a distraction from the real problems if you think abortions is the real problem in the world rn get ready to be traumatized"
if it isnt right its not a right
"if you look up crisis pregnancy center in your area it will either be an place to kill children abortion clinic or a place that gives aide to women in crisis pregnancies food diapers clothing and in grand rapids someone who will listen to her fears and be there for her the number of organizations that help womenfamilies with crisis pregnancies is enormous  abortion clinics would lose money if their clients were more familiar with them the pregnancy resource center is one of many in grand rapids michigan for example

abortion clinics make more money when people are afraid less money when people have hope

most people who have abortions will parent differently after their abortion because of how they have suffered what a horrible nightmare for millions of women some suffer right away many others suffer later on some seem to be fine for decades everyone is completely different

having an abortion cannot be a nonviolent act

that means that abortion hurts women i grieve for all my friends who have had the courage to tell me about their horrific experiences

our greatgrandmothers would roll over in their graves if they knew we were averaging over 1 million abortions per year in the united states"
it looks to me like the democrats think that women are irresponsible sex machines i dont think so but if you are a irresponsible sex machinesget your tubes tied there problem solved if youre willing to have an abortion surely getting your tubes tied solved all abortion problems if you want a child in the futureuntie your tubes
great   if your mum had illegal aborted you  pro abortionists  you couldnt be around  christian ronaldos mum want to abort him but was not successful  
its insanely funny how these same pro lifers are also proguns which are eventually responsible for the deaths of hundreds of children like make it make sense
being prolife is not about the baby its about spreading misogyny and patriarchal propaganda look at the way in which these pro lifers talk about women theres hatred  dripping from their words like theyre angry we have any rights
since religions have caused the abortion problem as women  we should not be letting them take our tax money allowing them to be a non profit organizations they attacked our liberty also since they entered government that should disqualify them we need a tax revolt
they never think about poor woman cant provide their kids
its time to make being an ace a religion women should just takes vows of celibacy and practice total abstinence they can take care of their needs better by themselves lets see how these people feel when they dont get some in the years to come if they get any at all with how bitter most of them are then again that might just lead to more rape cases you really cant win if youre a woman huh
simple solution stop spreading your legs 
"jeez what is wrong with this world  whatever happened to taking responsibilities for own actions you dont need to shout n scream just to get your point across its unethical i can understand where both parties both male and female are coming from because once iv been that child inbetween two parents both squabbling over each other after they split however it doesnt have to be this way as you can both have what you want and still be happy 

for the women to get men to be more responsible for their children get them to pay for their kids up until their 18 or after college plus this will encourage absent fathers to bond with their children and take the load of pressure off of you

for the men youve got your whole life to yourself and have your own space without the added stress on top and you dont have pay for your child when they become an adult and if you want to be apart of your childs life then you can as the offer is still on the table

and for the young teen parents out there you can study at home and let your parents bond with their grandchildren or just let a friend look after them


and for the people who have been raped or forcefully been sexually assaulted contest for dna profile of the rapist get them to pay you money for the abuse they have done to your body as this will allow serial sex offenders to never do it again as their actions have consequences"
"all these gross comments proves it women stay away from men
they dont care and just acuse women to kill kids

avoid men and then yoill be happier and free

call me whatever you want for such a comment men and women socalled prolifers are now forcing us against a wall again

so drastic measures need to be taken
men blame us for everything anyway one more reason to never have one close to you
men says cant trust women then dont trust men either"
"i cant wrap my head around women actually wanting this
skilled women lost due to being forced with having kids skilled workers scientist knowledgeable people dying and getting in dept to bring more kids to the world when we have dire and serious lack of spaceressources on earth

prolifers arent pro life theyre f insane"
"was there a constitutional right to own a slave when slavery was legal

there never was a constitutional right to abortion in the us abortion was just legal and it obviously shouldnt be as it kills vulnerable human beings"
sorry dr willie parker  youll have to find somewhere else to kill babies
god wills it
"it was moscow mitch who made the decision to lie and abuse his power 1 of 2 of those supreme court picks shouldve been ether obamas or bidens mcconnell told obama its an election year and he cant pick but got trumps pick a month before the elections 
that is a bunch of bs"
"and these are the very people who cry and moan when their privacy is invaded but its ok for them to go and invade other peoples privacy unless you plan on paying and raising that kid mind your own damn business
thanks to these morons the increase of welfare and other goverment programs are going to go up"
personally i think men should have the right to financial abortion its the woman job to make sure she doesnt get pregnant and if man doesnt want the child he shouldnt have to pay for it but i will say some women are simply not strong enough to have kids women have massive privilege today child birth is now safer than its ever been i would like to know how many abortions are done for medical reasons  or because the child wont be quite perfect or maybe a  child is to much of inconvenience  maybe men will stop doing stuff because it to much of an inconvenience and then the world will grind to halt and women will learn the truth basically you are just along for the ride
"my thoughts on this
just keep abortion legal women can die from giving birth which is very harmful and they could be young women too and if a women wants to keep her child or sacrifice her life for her child she will it is their life their childschildrens life so they can do what ever they want they produced the child they can decide what if they get pregnant against their own will and she doesnt want to be a mother yet or too young to give birth but then again she could just put the child up for adoption just keep it legal"
show me where it says abortion was ever a right in the constitution
elon musk wants more humansrest you can understand how capitalists control the government
because of the dire drop of the birth rate in the us the government should provide every women with new baby born an 800 monthly incentives and for every women who doesnt want baby government must encourage her by sending a letter of incentives as a monthly reminder for every married couple to have babies in order to recieve monthly incentives and for every unwanted babies women can deliver them to the government special offices around the country to recieve a huge reward and incentives like the government is buying the unwanted babies
people need to learn to love and be less selfish and hoes be more responsible instead of being popular rich and fuck around and party all the time abortion is a sin
they can take birth control to preventing  rather then abortion they suck babie throw      in the toilet
why is it always the ugliest women protesting for something dont you have something good to do

three supreme court judges  who lied during their confirmation need to be impeached or  fired  the us does not look after babies after they are born  mitch mcconnell stated that they dont have enough babies to be adopted out three court judges have made abortion illegal they want a civil war they want blood on their streets these judges need to step down they want women to be subservient they dont want women to have a choice  birth control now banned they want women to not have a say even though they vote   now they want to stop transgender gay people from the legal right to chose well there you have it the us is now a third world country thanks to those judges and the way the republican party has shown what they really care about  from bc canada

united states of america 
our aussie helen reddy is turning over in her grave over this
oh no the building with pyramid and 8 straight line whats that 108ooops look like bldg from the back to the future movie jokies
what they want to achive with this  cause it seems like there are enough people in usa
no right to your body no right to abortion no right to give birth when u want
all these christians in the usa saying that abortion is murder and a crime against god the bible says sin is sin and all sin is equal telling a lie  is the same as murder and thinking about murder is the same in gods eyes and commiting it how many states in america will not allow abortion but still have the death penalty this is hypocrisy is it not i hope the government has a plan to put extra funding in to help children as so many more will be living in poverty i hope they are already starting to make sure their are more good quality foster homes and make adoption more accessible
i pray for the unborn babies to have another chance in life women are not the only living beings in this world unborn babies still deserves to live if the mother doesnt want the child just give them away for adoption the unborn babies have also the rights to live i understand the pain of women of being raped and not prepared but abortion is not the only solution women are not the only ones suffering there are innocent children out there being abused for being born from a mistake women need to understand that and no we do not blame the woman who got pregnant nor guilttrip of them getting pregnant  we need to understand the truth that we are not the only ones suffering the unborn babies are innocent and deserve to live too
"good luck with all the extra babies coming from minorities growing up in poverty
i bet there will be many new einsteins and hawkings coming from there"
man should really be careful
why are the unborn being denied life how is it that pregnant mothers want to play god and kill what ever baby they want and keep the ones they want  it not moral your mothers its a life your taking out your own flesh and blood a tiny beautiful baby that could have made you happy but never got a chance cuz mommy killed it may god have mercy on your souls
how can you make a better world out of killing your own children cuz thats what your doing killing murdering your very own children this is not a right no one should have the right to kill use contraceptive and why should tax payers pay for it
abortion is murder
they have no business call those bunch of self serving biased freaks a supreme court ridiculous how those people even passed the bar exam let alone were given such a privileged position they dont care at all about the law they only care about themselves and their personal income it is a travesty that such an institution could evolve to such a state of antisocial dictatorship it is not based on any proper values
"watchbirth control methods can still possibly be used for women in all states

birth control pills

even in states where surgical abortions have been banned birth control options can still be a viable  option for women"
this is just the beginning 
banning abortions is not stopping abortions its only stopping safe ones
i have a weird take on this i am 100 pro choice however you are still killing something but thats not necessarily a bad thing cuz the world is too overpopulated the earth reached carrying capacity we are running out of freshwater the oceans are dying and a quarter of the world is starving to death overpopulation is the worlds biggest problem
the antiabortion activists who are disingenuously arguing that their decision to interfere in a womans right to choose is about social justice rather than religion is absurd
some even want to ban condomes 
we choose what we want to choose for the abortion or not they will still have children but not to ban the abortion if there are rapists out there what will it ever happen to them what are they how can they take away our freedom is it because they allowed to do what they want with us and try to forces onto us what will our future be

shameful regression of civilisation women have lost their rights over their own bodies and lives back to the stone age everyone
for ignorant individuals like maycøre science not me has proven 18 days after conception a heart beat can be detected after 6 weeks brain signals can be detectedembryo spontaneously moves around 5 to 6 weeks after conceptionafter 8 weeks the embryo can squint point toes make grasping motions and have jaw movement the diaphragm is fully developed around this same time of 8 weeks allowing intermittent breathing motions to begin anybody who says these functions dont represent a living being is just being wicked no more excuses for evil behavior and practices we need to do better as humans  this is absolutely sickening
good decision
"the thing that im most grateful in my life is not been born in this country

have people wake up and abandon it asap"
it shouldnt have been allowed to begin with how can we consider it a victory after millions of babies have been killed
ladies get you some evening prime rose and vit c with rosehips start taking about a week before your period is supposed to start if your period doesnt start on time increase how much your taking your period will come on within a week your welcome

stop singing jesus and all bible bullshit no one believes in magic
then we see their reactions
im lucky that im in nj they still legal their
no woman has the right to kill an innocent baby whether its hers or not
this country is twisted asf women want the right to murder children with impunity and truly believe a father has no voice in her decision the argument that a woman carries a child so she has all the say  in whether it lives or dies is complete bullshit its not just your body if theres another body inside of you  nobody should have the right to just decide on a whim that they can kill a baby extreme circumstances  i get it  you want to dodge responsibility or dont want a baby with a certain mangtfoh  women actually think thats a right  its not  that wicked ass decision was rightfully reversed  this place is doomed as it should be
congrats everywhere else youre officially more free than the united states
"heatbeat fingers curl

why care inhuman"
well let me put my 2 cents about prolife vs abortion there was the time when arranged marriages were laughed at it seems that people are now for many reasons  finding out the hard way that current mentality on i choose whom i please no longer works for many perhaps going back to old ways to arranged marriage where by not just you but your parents are also part of the arrangement is probably more morally and religeously right then going about your own way doing anything to please yourself attitude and in the process cause a big political issue not just for americans but many other countries do you see where we have deviated now with arranged marriage parents play pivatol role and strenghen family ties with one another as well in arranged marriage dignity of female is protected by him before marriage and he becomes responsible before and after marriage this enforces the rule marriage before kids is probably the better way to go about all i am saying is that we must look down way down to the crux of the issue and not debate on the issue prolife vs abortion whuch is at the surface of all issues because that is only a bandage remedy
"thank god children may now have a right to existence to those who thank children are inconvenient
instead of teaching promiscuity maybe now theyll teach responsibly
f off  gth"
hey america welcome to the middle ages
so lets say they woman is rapedor victim of incest aw thats an extreme case ok but it exists is the woman now forced to give birth to the perpetrators baby lol
holy bible 18 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the lord 19 husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them 20 children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord 21 fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged
holy bible 5 mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry 6 for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience 7 in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them 8 but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth
so glad to see so many logical moral decent voices in the comments speaking on behalf of those poor little babies who cant speak up for themselves its really simple dont have sex before marriage if he cant wait then he isnt worth it idc how much  he has dont marry a piece of garbage ummlets see what else damn i guess thats it dont have sex before marriage  youre  its almost like people have these things called tradition for a reason 
lol right to an abortion disgusting
women that have abortions should go on a national register so men can know in advance that this person kills babies if it doesnt suit her lifestyle
senior female in high school ranked in top 2 nationally in a sport gets recruited for a full all expenses at college and picks 1 with right wing laws  she  uses birth control to control severe period issues a team mate finds out and reports her for 10000  she is arrested and spends up to rest of her life in prison  this is the reality when idiots on scotus have zero reverence for law and constitution and decides cases solely on their delusional fascist political and their church mandated edicts    if you have miscarriage or still born due to medical reasons you fcn go to jail but you can carry a fcn gun and murder someone because of imagined threat   they are not saving lives they are cold ass fcn killers and it will get worse 
lets see  if pregnant mother goes to hospital and there are serious medical emergency issues  if treated the doctors go to prison if not treated because of idiot laws and motherchild dies then doctors go to prison or death penalty  if it is a goper there is reprieve for doctor as it will be treated as nonabortion if required  only options either doctors go to safer practice or hospitals refuse to treat pregnancies  fcn repuplican right wingers create chaos then tell us to shove it up our ass  and will never accept their created consequences
the only deverstation it causes is that it takes away babies from adoption agencies
why you carry in the pregnancy if gonna you make aborted
shame on you for killing the babies
the fact that these people are so emotionally overwhelmed with happiness about someones rights being taken away makes me shudder
i was pregnant at 17 a few months before the end of year 12 i was going to have an abortion but actually miscarried the day before which was a blessing even then i still had guilt like it happened because the baby knew i didnt want it but even now i still think i wouldve went through with it my life wouldve ended id have no chance at university or any meaningful job its not something people do lightly in australia 12 weeks pregnant is the limit i couldnt believe that abortion was legal up til half way through a pregnancy in america my god like abortion should be legal but not past 12 weeks thats just wrong
wow so glad to live in australia even ectopic pregnancy which causes death is banned wow how many women will choose not to have children id have been one i have three kids but id not do it if i lived in america death by ectopic pregnancy i dont think so
abortion is technically killing someone if u dont want a baby just use a condom nothing stops u
abortion is messed up just like the people that want it abortion is murder and why kill innocent children these days people are messed up man
biden how about u teaching the el salvadorian president how its done clamp down these criminals that operate in ur soil good american spirit seeks justice so in effect gang units should b anti terrorism units remember insurgents get smoked out they hole no wait they in ur soil jeez
oh god watch this b
its still a baby i dont care if you were rapped name me one other crime where we punish the perpetrators child and not the perpetrator whats that there are none you dont have to keep it but you do have to carry it cause its not your body the part you want to kill is the babys body
"its so crazy how these women or i will call them animal want to kill a child this is not human or women right its just stupid
fuck these people who support this abortion they a killer who fighting for this and there dogs who support this 
its just sad how someone is fighting for this bullshit to kill a child"
i guess sterile men will be the most wanted ones for dating and sleeping with  at least in usa xd
ok make abortion legal but charge 500000 for that procedure no medical insurance should pay for that it has to he out of pocket
a moral wrong can never be a civil right
wrong the right to abortions was not struck down you incessant liars
i am proud of india for not banning abortion
stop send ellen taylor vampire stern family garbage to us
abortion is the mothers choice  if they choose to get rid of that baby that was an result of r or just women who didnt want  to have children  im sorry but i find this new rule disgusting wrong   im a person whos never gonna have kids or want kids
sorry ladies feeding starving children out here is a bigger problem then having rights to terminate just because you didnt protect yourself now im not talking about those who were assaulted or have health concerns no im talking abbot those ladies who are reckless and have no care until its too late and think they can just go abort a baby becatse they were reckless
"rights are things humans are given by god hence a government cannot truly give or take away rights but simply affirm or deny a citizen to exercise those rights that are already inherent

there has never been and never will be a right for anyone to kill an unborn human being in order to end a pregnancy

however there has always been a right for human beings especially the innocent to live

we must care for both women and babies and we must bring masculinity and fatherhood back

love the woman love the baby love the man

love all three"
"the propaganda that a womans bodily autonomy rights include the right to have her unborn child killed is the greatest most nefarious and most sinister act of what i would call the government being a simp in the history of the world

because telling women or anybody that they can do anything they want even when those actions harm other people is an act of pandering to them illogically and unjustly and this is what being a simp is

womens rights made many good things happen it was right and just for us to rectify situations such as unequal pay sexual assault and rape and other inequalities between men and women 

however selling the killing of the unborn as a womans right is the greatest act  of being a simp conducted by a person or group of people in world history it is mass deception at its worst"
"so itll all go underground
fkin disgusting
dangerous
wait for the rise in unwanted kids abandoned

crazy people"
"abortion is infant killing babies has rights too
righttolive babieslivesmatters"
the usa 2021 had close to 700000 legal abortions in a year  wheter you are  for or against it  these are crazy numbers nontheless 
no sex befor marriage would be a better womans campaign
about time end legal murder
its so obvious this is not about the government being prolife its about the government being pro power  and obviously threatened by china they feel they need to up the population 
this is like the handmaids tale come to life controlling what women do with their bodies
wow thats so messed up  you guys are living in mediaeval days where abortions will be done with coathangers in doctors back rooms off houses
good bless the men and women black and white supreme court judges a just decision was reached by the most diverse supreme court judges yet
this is actually a good step at least now younger women will think twice about contraception
for me this is not about abortion its about how the supreme court and how the us is out together like a patch work quilt
"questions to the womens 
how can you claim to be a womans with emotions and pleasures  if you refuse to have baby  its crime to kill indefensible human  its truth is your body but each one of used on others body to born and let you born  amazing god he wraps the baby inside  emotions and pleasures"
those people got nothing to do too much time on their hand
seing all those women celebrate this news with so much passion like its the most important thing and they cant see the fact all women had lost something way more important like deprivation of their right to make decisions about their own bodies and lives  that is going to effect their whole life is just terrifying
abortion shouldnt be banned abortion should still be legal under certain circumstances if the baby isnt going to survive if the mother cant physically have the baby safely if the pregnancy is threatening the mothers life or if the pregnancy was the result of rape those are real legitimate reasons for abortion where the mother would actually need it
"lets just all move to canada  
its already so much better there"
right to abortion struck down really you flat out liars
they going crazy in america
women should put more effort into preventing unwanted pregnancy why dont we hear more talk about this for all the stress the cost involved and effort to go to another state seems to me people ought to be focused more on preventing it in the first place i see the efforts to create funds to fly women out of state once pregnant i have yet to see a single effort by the same folks to establish free birth control programs for all those women i hear about who dont have access to birth control andor they cant afford to pay for birth control its always been one of the primary arguments ive heard from people defending abortion so wheres the efforts to get these women free birth control seems to me it would be hugely more cost effective and youd reach a lot more women than any effort to fly them to get an abortion not to mention arent democrats all about the green energy agenda surely you wouldnt want to add to the carbon footprint flying millions of women to their abortions if you could just prevent as many as possible preventing pregnancy doesnt appear to be a priority weird
goodluck because soon as they dropped out these unwanted children orphans are gonna sky rocket
its sad that they just only care about unborn babyfetus but not the living children right now
lets ask pro lifers to take care of all the children then 
ahahaha this hapened for a reason that god made so dont get made now because you wanna kill babies whats wrong with people
maybe some people should at the very least read our constitution once in their life before spouting ignorant responses
the women who supported the ban of abortion i hope they go through the most difficult hardships of life and raise a child they never wanted  the child will grow feeling  not loved and not wanted will probably suffer from  malnutrition and might kill their own parents for giving birth to them  oh wait that has happened before in the past
"you want to be salty leftists then you should have played the game better you focused only on washington as if that is the be all and end all of politics youve never been able to do the long game not like us youve always put the primacy of what youre feeling over the ability to see the bigger picture we told you that youd live to regret it when harry reid nuked the judicial filibuster we warned you but you did not listen all that mattered was you wanted something and there was an obstacle in your way and you wanted to get rid of the obstacle but us we worked for this for decades we played by the rules elected prolife republicans not only on the federal but the state and local level as well we advanced prolife judges we advocated we used lobbyists to shape and alter policy and frame the debate we began working at roes downfall before the ink on the ruling was even dry we labored patiently for more than thirty years to bring about this exact moment and god is it sweet 

we played the game of thrones and we beat you you hear me leftists we beat you you dont like how defeat tastes then you should have realized that political influence does not begin and end in the white house while you were focused on winning the presidency we swept you out of dozens of state legislatures and governorships while you were focused on the supreme court we nominated conservative judges to the lower courts too many to count its so funny watching you open your eyes seeing your horror at the realization of just how thoroughly youve been outmaneuverednot just today but for many many years 

and in november were going to kick your ass all over again god willing there will be a red wave so great it will take you years to recover"
question for everyone here i have a neighbor who is prolife and since apparently prolifers are at war against women i am worried for her safety i tried calling the police but they dont do anything would it be better for me to call the police to help her or just go there myself and save her
i luv how societies are still trying to figure out wats right or wrong and an illiterate man told us wat to do 1400 years ago
why are you alive when is death not a promise of your coming
the lawyers now need to take this matter to courts as a matter of selfdefence if those central states american bogans want to imply that a woman violated by rape is murdering a child through abortion or that a woman at risk from death through physical or mental health complications is commiting a murder by protecting herself then they are forcing this to the next level of evolutionary debate  what is a fetus the fetus is a parasite it consumes the womans food it makes the woman ill it tricks the womans body and mind hormonally and it can kill the woman by overgrowing and squashing the womans vital organs therefore the matter of murder by abortion is also a matter of selfdefence by abortion make no mistake it is those power abusing churchy bogans that separated the two and created the woman vs fetus discourse by implying murder and this reasoning now is the consequence
"dear americans some of you think this law is not right for your freedom
so kindly read mine comment fully  if u have gutsespecially non supporters

so im going to tell real stuff what actually will happenes if abortion continues

so the answer is nothing

oh my goodness gracious our elected officials will now determine if abortion is regulated in our state this is exactly what our elected officials are supposed to do that is why we elect them scotus finally sent this issue back to the states which is where it should have been all along your title is misleading and incorrect perhaps you should look into things more closely before reporting on them
i dont understand do they expect the kids that will be born from that decision to be okay like they cant even keep children from abuse now they are adding more to the problem
what will be next will de woman be punished if she miscarriage to it is the natural way for the body to abort the child
"when you speak much about speaking on womens right and right to choose consider these too 
1like toddler or adolescent the terms embryo and fetus do not refer to nonhumans but to humans at particular stages of development
2 no matter how much better it sounds terminating a pregnancy is still terminating a life
3 the onetime choice of abortion robs someone else of a lifetime of choices and prevents him from ever exercising his rights"
so it is better to have the baby you dont want maybe get depressed and maybe end up killing the child
my body my choice what a disgusting quote in this day and age women who dont want babies should be taking contraception its lazy irresponsible females who are literally using abortion as a form of contriception shame on all of you to feel its ok to kill your own baby is mind boggling
even when you try to be honest you still stinky liars arent ya bbc  george orwell would vomit if he knew bbc  british brainwashing commies
for gods sake this for gods sake that boring
i love when anti choice people say they want to make abortion unthinkable and obsolete because as a pro choice pro abortion person id love if we could live in a world where the only children born are children that are wanted and are children that come about via planned pregnancies i want every child to have parents and extended family that loves and support them i want every child to feel supported by the greater society regardless of their gender and sexuality i want there to be no child abuse of any kind i want every child to have an education and a proper job that pays a living wage i want every child to come into a world that has secured a future for them id love to live in such a beautiful utopia

all abortionists and those who wanted it should have been aborted by their mothers since its ok anyway
abortion had become an excuse for immoral sexual acts it is clearly an act of murder against an innocent hopeless unborn life it is frightening how great and horrible this killing of unborn babies are god almightys truth and justice reigns for trillions of babies murdered in this horrible wayits selfish and arrogantno matter how men and women try to make it their human right to kill babies and fetuses made as beauty condimentssickening
honestly im so glad i live in europe in my opinion america is fucked up
calling abortion a human right is like calling a slavery a form of employement its so ridiculously outlandishly false and awful it shouldnt even be disccused as such
where would you be today if your mother had decided to abort your dumbass  think about that
banning abortion will not stop abortion it will kill many women because of unsafety methods children cant give birth they will die on their beds or they will suffer from it this is a big trauma for all victims im glad living in europe but it is concerning that young mothers end on streets with their babies the spirale will go on those babies will get molested will suffer and have hunger who is gonna help them when women have support and the right age they will not consider to abort they will provide their children with love but how when they are rapevictims victims of a violent and abusive husbands boyfriends poverty no man should talk about killing babies those men are willing to bring misery into the world barely adopt most of the kids end up in hands of abusive people usa has so many homeless and poor people more concerning i love my country switzerland we have excellent help and everyone has in our country health insurance for the poor it is covered by our government those girls cant not even have a save csection how they will pay the medical bills so much wrong in some states of usa
this is bad and good at the same time  imo people should control having sex before marriage and use condoms not creating the mistake to kill an innocent unconscious human and on the other hand feel sorry for poor people and man who will pay for it and women who will take care of it and the children who will grow up knowing i was not wanted by their parents and sometimes wished to be killed
the republican supreme court are rape and incest supporters i think they are demented what amy doesnt get is when they get all they can from her she will be gone too same for the women that support this insane crap the women in this country are not free we are disrespected as we always have been since the beginning of mankind i think justice thomas is a dirty old man with too much power and i think the rest of them fit right in there i had an ancestor that served as justice on the supreme court as well as his son they would be ashamed of this court instead of gaining freedoms we are losing them i will never understand why little men with little penises think they should be telling everyone else what to do with their lives they work for us we pay their wages there is no place else in this country that the employees tell management what to do they dont pay our bills or suffer our struggles these disgusting republican justices have no idea what the average person struggles with in this country they are ignorant of the people they are supposed to serve or they really dont give a damn probably the later of the two we need to vote and get so many we can make abortion part of the constitution as well as voter rights and marriage equality we need to outlaw assault weapons so the people in this country are safer
would a woman say live won today  into the face of a woman that got raped or a woman that dies if she gets the baby
maybe you should be less religious and more human i cant believe this is happening in 2022
why dont they focus on giving young girls birth controls instead of always fighting over abortion get them all on brake controls and then they wont have this problem
"good thing these pro abortionist didnt get murdered by their mothers out of inconvenience even if its a product abuse its not like the kid is the one who abuse you but im pretty sure majority of these unwanted pregnancy comes from poor judgement between a man and a woman if you dont want to get pregnant then dont engage in sex so stop whoring out

good for you america for not killing your sons and daughters just because its inconvenient of their lives to raise a kid"
          about us abortion laws
yes a free country
none of this would happen if men just kept their pants on im a man btw
imagine your parents having sex and giving birth to like 15 kids and they die in car accident and what if there are like 20 more families whose guardian die due ti health issueu or anything else so welcome we have 300 orphans directly in a month which might could have only be 30 if these genius ppls could have understood
america is going to be another china or india just bcoz of this mentality that childrens are gods gift these countries had major issue of jobs illiteracycrime welcome usa in our community 
shall the throne of iniquity which devises evil  by law   have fellowship with you they gather together against the life of the righteous  and condemn innocent blood  but the lord has been my defense and my god the rock  of my refuge he has brought on them their own iniquity and shall cut  them off in their own wickedness  the lord our god shall cut  them off  psalm 942023
this is an attack on the state by the church in defense of religious freedom there are those who believe that only god can justify any laws of any type imposed upon society they will contact god and get back to you with his response we only need one book mike flynns favorite trumper call the religious right evangelicals multibranded christians fundamentalist anarchist and zionist armageddon enthusiasts lds adventist catholics jehovahs witnesses and pseudo devout jet setters and various holy water grifters dime store spiritualists accompanied by a gaggle of bible thumpers heck maybe its just everyone with taxfree status all of their religious liberties have long been violated by the concept of church and state remaining separate dont we all realize that the laws of men condone evil  americans will not bow to earthly kings the black robes  will deliver us to his kingdom the women of this country have little to worry about other than how they look in a red veil progress is a word but this crap is time travel in the opposite direction orwellian has at last arrived please see our vineyard line of beverages barefoot and pregnant rose was just declared half off by the jack leg court formerly known as supreme this is a medical issue and theres no way around that so the women of this country deserve to consult physicians not just listen to guys who want to play doctor it is an absolute insult and negligence in regards to womens healthcare to allow unqualified officials to deem it acceptable to endanger the lives of  and be complicit in the mistreatment of women thomas and kavanaugh should both go blank themselves and stop trying to blank everyone else okay i think im done now roar ladies
"ive wondered why people get to decide what a human being can do with their body its not theirs
i dont know why but this reminds me of slavery
but at the end of the day im just a kid watching adults repeat mistakes over and over
doesnt exactly set a good example for any of us"
"approximately 1 of all abortions result in the mothers death

since 1973 to present 44 million abortions have been performed in the united states

thats 440 000 women who have died getting illegal abortion 

you had the impression it was completely safe right 

you paid them approximately 1000 to kill your kid and they killed you and your kid  your choice  

did you even consider the fact that you could die

did you consider the fact that they could screw up your uterus

did you consider the fact that you will regret that decision to kill your child  for the rest of your life"
"women celebrating the fact that they just lost one of their rights
the usa is going backwards"
i always thought the us had a constitution that disallowed religious belief to sway the country seems not
this is so ridiculous they really dont care about the consequences for the women maybe they arent in the right state of mind to actually give birth and properly take care of one of course there are many more reasons on why they could be getting an abortion every baby deserves a life my ass it will probably be put up for adoption and end up not being taken in because the centres are overfilled with others that wont be adopted either they wont have a bright future i dont live in the usa so hope you guys will do well sending lots of love 
doctors are crying because theyre running out of business
it isnt termination it is killing the baby in the womb
if liberal facebook and youtube would allow what abortion really is really does show the aborted baby youd have less baby killing
you would think they would make an exception for rape and incest i just find it odd that they didnt
its quite simple if you dont want to get pregnant try going on the pill even better try wearing a condom what you selfish tarts are doing is murder its know different than some one shooting a school up murder is murder to all women try keeping your legs closed permanently 
another smart move from the usa what a shock
"be precise broadcaster

it should be 50 years of murdering defenseless babies 

the constitution does not favor such evil 

let them stop having sex since they are not ready to be responsible

it is a crime against babies in the womb why because it is murdered you make look good by calling it abortion

your body your choice which part of the baby did you create the baby was formed in your womb by the holy spirit good or bad means that got you pregnant job 334 jeremiah 15 psalm 1003

god put the seed in the man the man put the seed in the woman and the holy spirit transform the seed into a babygirl or a baby boy

6 weeks in the womb god the son  breath into the baby nostrils and he or she becomes a living soul the womb

complication is a different situation that could lead to the mother living and gods creation in the womb returning to heaven 

we all are the seed of god his image and likeness genesis 12627 genesis 42526

satan is the greatest deceiver and liar that is destroying the human race revelation 129 john 1010 john 844

get pregnant when you are ready to be a father and mother"
atlast women get equal rights as men no abortion rights for both
sleepy joe get out of office already
im not american but im so sorry this is a huge setback
so glad i am europeanso much for the us being the leaders of the free world it just looks more and more like gilead
hmm sounds like injustice
no one should have the right to tell a women what to do with her body take away abortion rights but its legal for a women to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes
in my opinion  abortion should be allowed as long as its done within the first trimester of pregnancy and only people with certain circumstances should be able to have it done
its a womans body and right damn you people
well this is why left leaning media has lost credibility with most people who run on facts and historical precedent rather than emotion and identity politics bbc used to be a fairly unbiased source of news there is not now nor has there ever been a constitutional right to abortion the privacy argument doesnt stand up to even the smallest amount of legal scrutiny what happened was a gross over reach by one branch of government was corrected and the issue was turned back over to congress and or state legislatures where it has always belonged congress both houses controlled by the left has the power to codify roe but they wont because abortions after the third trimester arent as popular as the left would have you believe if the left had left mississippi alone in banning abortion after 15 weeks two weeks later than france btw the supreme court wouldnt have gotten involved but hey bbc dont let facts or information get in the way of your push for on demand abortions up to birth personally im going to stick with bill clinton on this one safe legal and rare try selling that instead of hand maids tale and youll find allys on the left and right
the baby unborn is not a live its the mothers blood
017 abortion guaranteed by the constitution im not advocating for either side here but isnt this a lie i thought that was the whole point that abortion wasnt in the constitution to begin with
weed has been illegal for years i just feel like if people want an abortion we are just going to develop a certain street market of sorts in its place idk how a woman could live with herself if she was raped and then was forced to keep the child i would want any politicians head after that speaking honestly
"about interrace marriages you mean as something that should be federal not state by state if so fair enough and im sorry for overlooking

as for constitutional amendments that should be just one way to do it not the only way ok guys"
"the us the country where you can buy an ar 15 with age 18 where woman can engage in hardcore porn with 18 but its not allowed to drink a  beer at age 18
and the newest where even an 11 year old girl even if it got raped is forced to carry out the child and raise the genetics of her abuserwhat a shitshow the us is"
its her body her choice yes its her body but so what every single one of us was once in a womans body using that logic that would make you your mothers property and she has the right to decide everything concerning you from the moment your born until the day you die if all your mothers reasoned that way you proabortion people wouldnt be here commenting your rights on youtube
now america is like the taliban regime of huge catholic religious country so sad a countrys  political system should not be interfered by a particular religious belief
absolutely disgusting to see people celebrating scotus antidemocratic act after they lied to congress and the american people women will die because of the antilife gqp judges no surprise rapist brett hates abortion black women will suffer the most from this truly just another form of white supremacy destroying the usa as they strip rights away from women from rewarding rapists republicans do nothing for actual poor children or those in the foster care system it has nothing to do about protecting kids or life
its better to never born rather than die everyday where you are unwanted
the usa the land of freedom this shows you how people want to control people the fact that there are people who think the usa is the best country you need to think again history is being recycled here i feel sorry for you all there is no free
when you support abortion you support baby murder ban it all 
"no offence to some of you americans but you really do live in a fucked up country
health system homeless gun laws  god worshipping freaks etc
glad i live where i live"
any joke can be funny with the right delivery except abortion because there is no delivery
"the united states of america has so many problems
why dont they address them guns health
i assume abortion rights issues are relevant to
a very small poor and depressed portion of the population
just when you think the world cant go crazier"
all children deserve to grow up and decide for themselves if they want to live
when bacteria is life on mars but a heart beat isnt life on earth   tom mcdonald  from people are so stupid song
"abortion law change is that to stop abortions bcos that means less population and we already suffering lower levels per generation but higher debts to keep the  ponzi scheme alive they need a larger population to take on the new debt to pay off the old debt and on and on we go until now this is the end of the road watch that video to see i think the abortion law is this reason

it also sounds like the original law dates back to 1971 too when the ponzi scheme started when they removed the gold standard 50yrs ago now the population is shrinking and the debt is higher than ever who will pay it off stop aborting babies you monsters 

it makes sense doesnt it

search the video end of the road that will teach you all you need to know on the currency ponzi scheme a monetary completly backed by debt but now we are so heavily in debt we cant take more and we cant pay it off so we need a baby boom let them pay it off or shpould i say americans pay it off since the  is the main player"
usa is restricting the rights of women going back into progress
that girl aint wrong people still going to do it one way or another
742 million people in the usa have not had a single dose of a covid ake vaccine  another 157 million have refused a 2nd or 3rd dose according to cdc
after so many weeks you wanna know how they do the abortion the pull the arms and legs off crush the head and pull it all out these lot are being brainwashed
report prince andrew  ghislaine maxwell were so intimate she had full buckingham palace access but then so did jimmy savile eh charlie boy
okay so im not saying the people that think abortion is wrong are dumb but if we didnt have abortions the planet would have been overpopulated and then what im just saying the stuff that happens in the scifi movies they  could happen in real life people will be only to have about to have like one child but what if they want a whole big family and they have to kill the other kids and trump is not a woman he doesnt experience was women do like being sexualized because of their chest and butt so i call bullcrap for trump to say god he intended for this to happen and thats why i wanted hillary clinton to be the president instead of him its just not right
abortions first all other rights will also be taken the us is diseased with a sickness called religion
after so many centuries women are still considerred half human and second to men sad
"life must be respected in all of its forms whether in the womb or outside womb
its not a wise decision to promote abortion laws by raising the issue or rape medical emergencies and teenage pregnancies etc real truth is 90 of abortion kills healthy viable babies just for the comfort of couples or profit of hospitals or companies"
so anal penetration will start or the sale of condoms will increase 
in mexico it is legal to have an abortion is not punishable
is the western media sleeping or blind when hindus and sikhs are getting killed double face and standard of the west hypocrite west
"why would the government force people to follow some rules that have them triggered in frustrating anger this is one of the reason why i got frustrated they just had the right to demand their responsibility for themselves and others 
but you had your rights to say atleast they didnt force you to sew your mouth"
"the only reason the bbc still exists is because its taxfunded

i cant wait for the licensing agreement to be repealed"
as a woman if you cant control your own body thats too sad isnt it must fight
"no wonder why america has the reputation of being ignorant stupid and tunnel visioned
its 2022 and your leaderspeople that make the important decisions still cannot understand the simple concept of free will 
they would rather sell guns to you all so you can all kill and hurt eachother then give someone a right to chose if they want to have a child or not 
how can your leaders turn a blind eye to the school shootingsgun violence that consistently happens in your country
that kills children and every other age everyday
how can you jump and scream about abortions yet people die everyday because of your gun laws
when i think of america i think  
stupid ignorant views characters based on race unworthy sells soul to devila dollar no dignity no grace unworthy confused blind distracted"
so abortion is illegal but its okay for people to buy guns and stuff and kill people i dont understand americas logic
 woman will die from botched abortions she argues that women will die but children who are murdered thats okay
maybe a strange thing to say but if those people that cant get abortions die cuz of it cant they sew the pants of the suprime court and if a prolifer gets rped and ends up prego shell have to bring the child into the world and destroy there mental health to do that
then why not make a law for these pro life people to adopt these unwanted babies and take care of the baby i mean they are so loving and kind and i know they will make wonderful parents
birth rates are declining in america and have been for  years this is much bigger than peoples feelings no children means no future
what about if a girl is assaulted what if a teenage girl is rped and gets pregnant and cant afford to care
"all actions have consequences to be clear people have the right to choose however if you choose to kill you will suffer the consequences of that action the question people need to consider is one moment of convenience worth that consequence furthermore if you act on your right to choose to do something others should have the right to act on their choice to prevent you from doing it or act on their right to choose to punish you for doing it 

this is why we have laws and why those laws should reflect the highest moral standards of the society they serve a law that simply protects a right to choose is not moral as morality is something that can be chosen we can choose to follow the laws we can choose to be moral these choices can be arbitrary but like all choices acting on them have consequences an arbitrary law will not be just and by default becomes immoral law and morality need to be absolute to promote order and deliver justice without absolute laws and morality we will have chaos and injustice

abortion is not moral because it is both an action and a choice to commit that action abortion is in fact immoral because morality will determine that an unborn baby has the right to live just as you or i have the right to live therefore if a law protects that choice then the law becomes unjust and ultimately immoral

this is a bit of logic wordplay and i hope it promotes some critical thought feel free to choose to listen to it or not but your choice will not change morality no matter how much you seek to justify your actions"
and also this is just a attack on woman as are men still allowed the snip
america the new chinacome to the uk for them you all welcome
im not american but even i can see you guys need to get rid of these bible bashing nutjobs in your country
how would a baby feel when it grew up and was informed  it was conceived by violent rape or incest
hey prolifer here we finally got rid of abortions now we need to execute men who masturbate i mean we are just protecting one to three lives at a time when we ban abortions imagine how many more well prevent when we stop ejaculation cock rings should be mandatory for all sexual experiences
as if i already didnt have enough anxiety about birth control accidentally failingif i get pregnant im still going to abort no matter what it takes yall happy now
thou shalt not murder
how can abortion which is an act of taking ones life even be considered as ones right abortion is a result of a conscience totally blocked by selfishness
at this point i wonder what other nations think of america
"for me this is largely a battle between two extreme groups religious fundamentalists on the one side and modern feminists on the other 

one group is advocating for a complete ban and the other group is demanding abortion on demand 

i think both groups have something of value to say on this issue i dont believe the issue is as binary as the protesters make out on both sides it is for them of course however there are options that dont entail either of the extreme positions obviously i am talking about abortion permitted in some cases and not others 

i would find it difficult to endorse an abortion because a pregnant woman was recently offered a promotion at work and decides to change her mind about the pregnancy so she can earn more money on the other hand if a woman who is ill and is going to give birth to a child with profound disabilities i could not condemn their choice to have an abortion i know these are extreme cases but this is my point extreme cases are not common by definition but they definitely can happen and probably do  given the size of the population 

i hope the debate turns away from the two extreme positions to having an ethical and political discussion that acknowledges gray areas and attempts to develop a policy that takes everyones thinking into account

meaningful dialogue is extremely difficult when emotions are so high and people are so certain of their position its understandable"
ffs this is awful 
if u cant be responsible adult female dont spread ur legs without protection the government have the right to protect unborn babies from iresponsible adults
congress cannot over turn the ruling of the supreme court and the left knows it
"so i can hear all the religious folks waving their god around saying 
  oh no well give you the abortion not a problem

but meanwhile all the doctors are afraid to do it because they know  theyll get persecuted by the law
  this is because theyve got a fire under their ass from all the religious types with their big god

tell me again when do we get to persecute all the religious folk they got that crucifix thing you know theyre into it

dont stop 
dont stop

the truth is religious foke  wave their big god around while they molest children

 dont believe me
 look at all the news reports of all the pastors  molesting children 

its a neverending stream 

theyre all a bunch of pedophiles with their big god  accusing and persecuting others"
"in america

5year punishment for rape 15 year punishment for abortion they think this law will help the unborn babies but they are forgetting that until the baby is born it is in the womens body so the unborn baby is nothing but a part of the womens body just a fetus and what about the underage girls dying because they cant bear the pain of labour or the women who got raped and needs to abort the child us is trying its best to kill women mentally and physicallyand toxic men are a biggest part of the problem as it so easy for men to get off everything they dont have a fair punishment for rape dont want to pay for child support and they act like they have done nothingthey have not ruined and destroyed the life of women at all seems like the dark age of america has already started and its time for revolution otherwise we cant even imagine the number of women dyingeveryday in america because of emotional and physical pain and it seems like us will keep making dumb laws until women has no right and freedom at all in us"
this law is worst without abortion ur killing more woman and baby with that law and kids wont be abandoned do they want kids to be out on the cold or be in the orphanage america shouldnt be like china look how they country turn out with so many people
united states of amerika  keep this up its fun to see you run in circles makes us see how good we have it when we see things from you
they will care about a woman getting abortion but once the child is born they will leave them alone and let them suffer
people that are pro abortions always use rape to defend their arguments but the truth is abortions are mostly done by women who cant keep their legs close and use protections now you be blaming the fetus growing inside of you abortions could also weakens the uterus of a woman this law is clearly to protect women
there appear to be about eight states effectively banning abortion which to me seems absurd however many possibly most states have generally more lenient abortion laws that the uk do people really think that it ought to be okay to abort babies on demand right up to birth there appear to be seven states where there is no limit on age of gestation where an abortion can be given on demand is it not murder to kill a fetus that is sufficiently developed to survive outside the mother
at the end of the day a government using your body as a resource without your consent is a human rights violation end of this is the government using women as incubators their autonomy be damned its a human rights violation keep your religion and your faith out of my uterus
the thing is women have all the chances in the world to not have a baby but of course they make the unborn suffer the consequences of their idiotic decisions
"what a dehumanising experience for women in the usa 
another reason id never enter america ever

my heart goes out to the people in america that wanted abortions and were denied it
what a regressive country"
boycott america if they wont listen to our voices theyll listen to our money
stop abortion use contraceptions
rightly so  want abortions then use contraceptions
sex and abortion will not empower young woman it will empower men like biden its just nasty democrats trying there best to takedown the united states so sad these women are being taken in
america do not stand for the flag anymore take a knee term limits are the only thing thats going to get corruption and political extremism out of the system
look at history satan has been throwing ideas into the minds of powerful people for children to be killed since years before christ and after children were sacrificed to idols and it seems that to this day he throws this devilish idea into the minds of many people
the bbc news does not appear to know us history or us politics concerning this  democrats use this issue to garner votes obama ran on the promise that he would codify the ruling then once in office he stated that he had more important issues to deal with  larry elder did a show on this and showed clips of obama lying and then after elected of him giving women the fu finger on the issue  larry elder also showed an old  clip  of biden when he had a functioning brain he was surprisingly eloquent and though prochoice compassionately stated that more help was needed for sex education and more so help was needed to help pregnant women to be willing to give birth and not choose abortion as the answer to an unplanned pregnancy if republicans took his stance they would mow down the left in elections
"us to 13 year old girlyou cant adopt a child because you arent even grown to take care yourself and arent ready to take careprovide for foodshelteretc
us to 13 year old girl whos raped and needs to abort the childabortion is illegal


its so easy for politicians to make dumb laws and get off everything and continue with their luxurious life after completely ruining and destroying others"
you tricky witches just want to continue with your human sacrifices under the radar to gain power  its the beginning of the end for all of you victims of crime should be catered for only
the religious purists have won
"and furthermore  its not a right if to benefit from it you have to take so something from another human life 
so ask yourselves if your precious entitlement is worth the life of another creature"
oh i hope the people get the right way to live  i was thinking much better way to earn money at home anyone with good idea
"the reality is that judicial precedent is flaky compared to statute law
the us government has ducked the issue for 50 years when they should have legislated the rights properly
unfortunately it was bad law and they would never have got it through both houses"
to me its weird how those antiabortion people can be so anoying cant a woman decide what to do if its her body
ironic thing is that pro life are gorgeous sexy women who would be getting laid all the time and would probably need abortions whilst the pro choice are rough ugly munters who would only get laid by desperate suicidal guys and would not really need abortions anyway funny that isnt it
pretty soon anyways there will be one world government and new world order and new world religion and many people are about ready to bow to the evil man of sin and lawlessness the antichrist
how much is condoms in the usa by the way
"217 
willing of the people 21y and shes afraid of this law oh god help me"
"if you are terrified dont have sex
sex is optional"
women in china have right to choose isnt this a part of human rights
misleading title the supreme court did nothing of the sort all theyve done is uphold the rights for states to have their own law abortion is constitutionally not a federal issue
they say that they dont have the facts when doctors are screaming at them how wrong this is
any woman supporting the overturning of r v w supports tyranny this is disgusting theyre going after the gay community and interracial marriages next oh and the child indian welfare act too wakeup weneedhelp americaisnotokay
"and it could all be solved by having responsability in your life
you dont get pregnant by the holy spirit
progressive feminism is all about avoiding as much responsabilirty as possible"
democracy is definitely going down the toilet women cant get tubaligations without male approval  now no more roe vs wade and talks of no birth control pills or long term birth control the government will now be ruling women so a half dictatorship since men can get vasectomy without having to obtain permission first adoption system that is broke its a very sad day in america and probably for a long time to come
the only reason abortion is being banned is money it costs 10000 to have a baby in a hospital in america babies  money  america is enslaved  nuff said
i feel ashame to be human this is a huge mistake and people are in danger now shame on you  this is a step back to medevil times
so if we need laws to ensure that women are treated as equals does that mean men are naturally misogynistic im so confused
this is devastating
this is so heartbreaking im usually very opinionated on political issues but i honestly dont know what to believe here as a woman i understand how terrifying this is but im conflicted i hate the idea of people using abortion as a method on contraception and it does happen i also hate the idea of coathanger abortions and women dying i hate the idea of having to chose between keeping a child that was a result of a traumatic rape and sending your own offspring into an unjust foster system where theyre likely to experience hardship and their own trauma there will be so many more babies making it harder to find responsible people to adopt them we need to reform the foster system if this is our new reality the jesus loves me people also need to chill we have freedom of religion and if you pass a law like this it needs to be because you think a fetus is a human not because youre a religious extremist
they will want to ban condoms next because they are killing sperms that would of made life
means you want to just enjoy with no responsibility in the name of rights in exceptional circumstances it should be allowed else sustained
its  all about control
the thing is that the free world really needs america right now and america is at war with itself against these extremist religious zealots trying to impose their unreasonable views on everyone it really is becoming gilead and making a spectacle of itself and losing all international credibility at the same time and where does that leave the rest of the world with america lost like this hopefully not regress to the uk and the roots of all this rubbish society hopefully it leads the rest of us to see the fruits of basing a society on pillars of greed and vanity and how like an insidious lie it festers eventually fractures the psyche of a whole civilization to the point they are just at constant war with themselves and cant even function to solve the simplest of civic problems once they become apparent  such as not having citizens shooting up children in classrooms for example seriously please wake up
it gives you stupid pests 16 weeks to get an abortion stop being selfish pigs dont worry though youll burn in hell eventually
i thought this country would still care about women hmmm do tell what is a woman
they are not women they are 
say god not jesus  jesus not god dog
"just keep your leg cross 
why is you go for one knight stand 
you women respect your self 
and do what reall god tell you   not what the filthy bible you have now 
keep your self pure"
i see people saying that they are soical workers and explain and explain how their lives will end up badly and our only solution is by murdering them wow
something else that has been overlooked  is terribly sad is this decision will cause a wind back to a time where unsafe home abortions  death of babies in horrible ways will be increased to millions instead of in safe hospital or clinic situations
"a terribly sad story of forced child birth 

a member of my family was violently raped  tortured then she was forced to have the baby by religious anti abortion beliefs 

it led do decades of sorrow  an abandoned baby the mother was forced to keep the rapists baby but lost her mind from being forced to have the baby 

the baby grew up to have the genetics  violence of the rapist the mother could not cope with being forced to have the baby  it had to be given to its grand parents where it grew up to beat them  threaten them constantly with vicious attacks causing absolute fear terrible scars  horror for life it was a shocking situation 

i dont agree with the vicious way anti abortionists attack women to take away their rights even though they are trying to give the unborn baby its rights instead the religious  riches morel beliefs that forced her as a young girl to have this baby under such trauma are the ones responsible for her terrorizing  ongoing torture  are more responsible for that baby than she was for being raped as a young girl she did not want the baby she was forced

i believe if she had been given the right to choose her own fate over her body instead of being forced to loose her life from anti abortionists instead of a life of sorrow  not being able to ever look at that rapists baby she was forced to have she might have had a life instead perhaps met someone she loved  had her own baby to hold  love instead of being forced to have a rapists baby she was never able to except or love when she was a young broken raped girl which caused her to never have a relationship or love"
im 21 and im terrified ever heard of contraception
"i mean  us  what would you expect from people who believe earth is flat and 5g towers cause covid
its no surprise they will get inspired by muslims and let superstition dictate their way of life "
"to those who write about adoption services being substandard do a bit of historical sleuthing
sure abandoned kids dont get adopted into decent homes 
when roe vs wade became law in 73 by the following year all the gd  funding for adoption services driedup like the vaginal canal of a 60 year old women  trust a nurse who knows"
"what british morons bbc are abortion is not only
 not guaranteed by our constitutionbbc writers  reporters are so brain dead  theyre almost as goofy  senile as biden
 the word abortion does not even appear in it"
your body your choice  then dont get pregnant use condoms take pills you selfish ignorants all you want is to have sex without talking any responsibilities disgusting ignorants
when the world is preparing for war we all know that laws that prevent a countrys survival will be thrown out the window
"some of american women are fighting for thier abortion rights 
hey your lust is the problem"
i like trump coz he oppose abortion he is pro life
this videos comment section is  a battle
it wont stop it it will just make it more dangerous
"230622 us lady who miscarried in maltathe baby was brain deadthe mother in danger of sepsisabortion is illegal in malta had to fly to spain for her health care
     much like the founding pilgrimswho hung mary dyera quakerwho wanted to worship in her own wayrepublicans are palestale malesintolerant and out of touch with reality "
wow god must be sad to see his babies killed if only you turn to god that hell help you with your born babies so you wont have to underestimate his power and kill your unborn babies your conscience which god created in you will follow you all the days of your lives the regret of killing your own babies in the womb a wicked and unrepentant world will face gods judgement someday wake up repent
how about we stop acting like wild horny banshees humping all the time  stop crying about healthcare  healthcare is taking responsibility of your body before you conceive a child then destroy it
why kill the babies when you can use protection during sex it just makes me wonder either the american girlswomen never knew bout protection or they just simply want to kill id rather have a hysterectomy than killing the innocent souls inside of me
america is a christian state hence proved
before exporting democracy to other countries apply democracy to your home
"think about this for a second all of a sudden their decision makes a lot more sense
the unborn victims of violence act of 2004 public law 108212 is a united states law that recognizes an embryo or fetus in utero as a legal victim if they are injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed federal crimes of violence
so you kick a pregnant mother she loses the baby embryo or fetus and its a federal crimebut abortion on demand anywhere in the us is just fine"
i wish those antiabortion protestors get raped and come pregnant ooops i forgot many of them cant carry a child
women say its their body if its entirely true when did they make it if your mother had followed the same ethos and aborted you where would you be its better to live a sad life for not aborting than to commit murder live a freer life but end up in hell torment
at how many months is it not ok to abort a baby lefties
maybe the eu should make rules for all the countries in eu the president is not king bbc
the entire supreme court should be an abortion
so if someone is raped they cannot abort thats just evil
condoms pill dont have sex when drunk
look at all them people that support killing babies you people that support this our blessed that your love ones never had you aborted you can live to talk about it the babies you support to abort can not live to talk about it shame on you its a sin just to support it every time you support it your killing in the eyes of god do you love satan
its okay ladies  now when you are getting your vag smashed just have your cuck boyfriend pull his dick out at the last moment and you wont get pregnant  or you could just use condoms and or birth control like responsible adults but your body your choice huh
america be like that drunk guy trying to get home 2 steps forward 5 steps backwards
wait so what if the pregnancy can risk the mothers life the issue with this ruling is that there is not in between if you go having sex all around and have a baby without protection shame on you and honestly you should be allowed to have an abortion but if you get raped or have a baby that will die at birth or the babies birth can potentially kill the mother thats just not fair theres a lot of issues with this on both sides and its kinda sad tbh
fyi the u s constitution has never guaranteed a womans right to an abortion you idiot
what would you think if your husband has sex with another woman  his body his choice right
ahh the biased bbc of davos clan yall sure can put out some hit piece garbage propaganda and i dont know how you pull that off with the trusted news initiative thing that started to stop the spread of information
prayer is powerful please pray for the people who have demons inside them to ban the demons from their body forever in the name of jesus please pray for all the people to ban all the demons and evil spirits taking over their bodies minds and hearts forever pease pray for them to receive and turn into the holy spirit god and jesus pray for all the lost sheep to return home to jesus their shepherd i pray for them follow me if you want to do a powerful group community prayer live pray also alone daily please
its funny how the pro lifers are only pro life till the kid is born then they dont care if that child is left in a bin or dead or in a hospital loads of people could die from giving birth
"yet this tool bag of a president is set to appoint a judge who is against abortions
"
418 welcome back to medieval times folks jesus is why science stopped hukanity to progress in first place usa its crumbling one day or another sadly
"so if you get raped and pregnant you have to carry the child to term
what the fuck"
they killed in a caring way
life life life   thank you god
lets face it the child of an unwanted pregnancy is already dead all animals need a mother who cares abortion is not saving the child
"and suddenly americans know exactly what a woman is
id feel sorry for these backward losers but they brought it on themselves"
"do fetuses have the right to life

the argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong
i will simply assume instead of proving that your murder is seriously wrong
i will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder
finally i will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issues to which this analysis of abortion ethics may lead
the symmetries arising from the analysis of the main arguments on both sides of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult
consider the following standard argument against abortion fetuses are both human and alive people have the right to life
therefore fetuses have the right to life of course women have the right to control their own body but the right to life goes beyond a womans right to control her own body
therefore abortion is wrong
the fetus right to life does not include his right to use someone elses body to preserve his life
however an opponent of abortion may point out that a womans right to use her body does not include her right to end someone elses life in order to do what she wants with her body
in response one might argue that a pregnant womans right to control her body is not much if it is wrong to take any action that ends the life of the fetus within her
however an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus right to life does not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses
the consequence of all these symmetries seems to be a stalemate
but if we have an attitude then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of rights a fetal right to life versus a womans right to control her body
one could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control ones own body in the case of abortion because the loss of ones life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control ones own body a respect for nine months
therefore the right to life prevails over the right to control ones own body and abortion is wrong"
it seems states are tired of paying for peeps that lay down with no responsibility
life is respected and valued again
so this is the american freedom lmao
what the fuck america
a nation destroyed by its enemies can rise againbut the one which crumbles from within thats dead
abortion rights are human rights
rights arent rights if someone can take them away theyre privileges thats all weve ever had in this country is a bill of temporary privileges george carlin
banning abortion just creates a new welfare state  if you cant trust a woman with a decision how can you possibly trust her with a child
happy for supream court desicion  now boys will thinks before going in with girl and girl also will think 100 times before going in with any boy as if a child is born than they will have the responsibility and cant shrug the responsibility to take care of child  its god justic to the unborns babies who are alive in womb and these females they just go and murder them  god is good  and so the usa court
whats that song  its a manssss worlddd
biden always up there lookin clueless lmao slow speech looks like hes about to fall over lol
my advise is to ignore videos that wont allow comments thats what i do if the public cant post comments on the narcissistic wannabe gods forum then its not even worth wasting your time to visit this one does allow comments okay im prolife and against making a meat market out of the remains of what was supposed to become a human being clumps no thats not just clumps that is the remains of a potential person even a person who dies from natural causes deserves a proper funeral andor burial its disgusting
its not the babys fault  adults lets do better
omg these women are all 26 year old virgins  scared for the world  law politics shouldnt revolve around religious beliefs
well enjoy your rape spawns america
its a bunch of fat woman who will never get laid 
there is no way people are this uneducated
313 actually roe made the us an outlier most countries ban abortion between 1220 weeks france bans it at 14 weeks which means mississippi is more liberal than france the extremism has always come from the left on this issue
seems like america is slowly crumbling away
"in arcansaw they will soon ban invitro fertilization
but no abortions for rape pregnancies

makes sense

whole bunch of pro lifers in the  next 6 months will be stunned at what comes down the pipe next in red states

iud bc plan b gone
invitro fertilization gone

some already are already saying they didnt know there was a bigger agenda

ya theocracy

the only thing contraception contraception invitro have in common is theocrats hate them

they have no idea who they pushed into power theyll freak out when it restricts their life"
theres no excuse for murder
so know no vasectomies for men is this where were headed
a woman carries a child at the cost of her health and future so only every woman can decide whether to have an abortion or not and not the state by banning abortions you will only put women at risk abortions will be done anyway a woman is more important than an embryo and by the way at the stage of abortion someone is not yet a living being
great day to be an american pro life all the way
hold on just a dad gum second there bbc news  the supreme court did not make abortion illegal it remanded the authority quite properly back to the states where it belongs now each state legislature will decide on their laws the us once again is a federation of sovereign states the federal government never had the power to order the states to make abortion legal never stop with the clickbait headlines
why not being more self responsible and not getting pregnant are the womengirls that undisciplined
why not be more responsible in not getting pregnant are you women that undisiplined
you tube censoring my opinion
"amen  unbelievable s of aborted children lets mother pregnant in the first place responsibly reasonability 
aware of how to prevent conception"
peaceful protests by baby killers
men should get a vasectomy till they decide they are ready for kids that should be made standard procedure once abortion is outlawed
"yeah lets gooooo ruining peoples lives and causing adult deaths whoooooooooooooooooooo fuck these peoples lives because its murder and so what if ive never had to deal with it but it meeds to he a perfect world for us stupid women in america yeeeeeeeeeeehhaaaahahahahahaha









as someone from britain i find this so funnily stupid on how there ruining young peoples lives and cant wait for this to end up like prohibition with alcohol  also god damn if someone doesnt want to have a baby let them have an abortion and stop doing what you want think about what other people think"
good news abortion should be a crime
oh yes a law that needs to be looked over same sex marriage are you kidding me
right to abortion care received so killing your baby is caring for him or her the bbc is always biased in such matters
abortion was prohibited during communist era in romania and we ended up to have so many orphans kids in our society and woman can still do abortion themselves at home which is very dangerous and can led to death a lot of woman died innocently from husbandspouse blackmailed social relation is true that is not moral to abort but it is the parents sin it is not something you can have control over it better help people do it right at least
so now there is a definition of a woman thats the most hypocritical response that woman made that the woman is ok being beaten and raped as long as she can have an abortion why not help the woman a safe place to stay or take her in
ok if the governments plan was to create a new type of abortion that is less violent wouldnt they overturn this right after they found that less violent way just asking
"i really cannot overstate how much this both enrages and unnerves me enrages because it represents a massive step back for american society that puts millions at risk and unnerves because it sets a very dangerous precedent if the abortion landmark ruling can be overturned so easily what of the rulings that solidified contraception repealed sodomy laws and legalised gay marriage 

i also find this ruling to be extremely hypocritical the procedure is called murder but the children born are at risk of being murdered in their classrooms and theres never any huge reaction prompted to stop that there is no exception in any case even if an underage girl gets raped by her grandfather it will drive women to desperate and potentially fatal methods of abortion where they can no longer access safe and legal procedures the women forced to bear children they cant care for or dont want it will affect their mental health america is regressing before our very eyes and mark my words it is not going to stop here"
"it makes me sad that proabortion people always want to justify there position by saying that if a person is poor they should not have the right to life  if a person is disabled they do not deserve to live its too inconvenient to care for them  even joe biden what he essentially said is that black babies should only live if there parents are well off do they ever really think about what they are saying  the quality of life should not determine the right to life
they always default to rape victims as the silver bullet why dont we make the death sentence for the rapist and not let the child pay for the sin of the father  how quickly will rape be minimized and how empowering would it be for the victims mother and child to know that justice have been served  prolife can exercise the death sentence because the violator made there choice and if the godordained justice system says death is the consequence for them so be it
 the truth of what the proabortion people really want is for women to live as undisciplined men who wants to practice promiscuity without consequence  my body my choice  i want sex without responsibility  not reality  it takes two to have sex and limiting or dare eliminate unnatural abortions will cause men and women to think twice  if you dont want to have a child with that person you dont want to have child support then think twice thats the choice right there  
theres a difference between a natural abortion miscarriage vs selective unnatural abortion  god gives life and he has the right to take it away no one else"
the bbc dont like democracy
"tellurian stock

please do something about this

souki is big con man

he is been stealing investors money with lies

he should go to jail life time

all the investors lost the money 

souki stolen all the money"
ok i dont like abortions but if its to save a womens life then it should be legal for that case if a little girl was raped it should be legal but a 1 night stand is ur on fault they can go to adoption centers but the little girls and the ones that will lose there life without should have every right to live
in us you have a right to buy a gun but when you are a rape victim or any f reason to have an abortion no what a rotten stupid world eeeew
i am not 100 with abortion but what about rape victims and women that they are in danger and giving birth will kill them shaaaaaaaame
"its called responsibility
if you dont want a baby than have safe sex and there are many ways ano 2022"
i like how she says anti and pro abortion not pro life and pro choice that shit is confusing
stupidity what about the women and young girls that get raped your laws are flawed the new normal all the women are raped so they have to have children from being raped stupidity
women should have the right to choose whether they should cancel their pregnancy or not making it illegal is going to cause more bad than good drugs to kill the baby and damage the mom unadopted kids crammed in homes homeless and jobless young adults kids abused because they were unwanted or caused by rape young teens killed by birth population spikes and much much more this isnt a democratic countrys decision it should be up to the person
in case of rape ok i get it but i know some people that do it just cause they dont like using protection and many other reasons other than being responsible so i think it should be allowed only in special cases not else
hey american people  just a reminder dont worry too much if you cant get an abortion just be patient cause in your blessed country youll just have to wait a few years until this kid you didnt want get shot at school 
women should choose if they want to be mothers or not and get professional help if they decide for breaking the pregnancy abortions is not murder abortion is womens right to live their lives how they want and have proper and legal medical help if needed
i can see how it would be hard for a nation who requires a license to buy a fork to understand making your own decisions
what do pro lifers think about arkansas and michigan banning abortion even if someone has beeen raped
what if a women whos been raped requests an abortion but no one believes shes been raped even though she has been wtf happens to her
its not a right
women will die women will die women will die women will die how is life winning when you have a dead miscarried baby making you septic and the doctors too busy talking to his lawyer to realize youre already dead
imagine your daughter gets raped what then are you willing to raise the child your daughter resents from the father who ruined her life forever
"itll be interesting to watch the blue states in the past some democrats in red states have advocated for the mothers right to terminate the child days or weeks after birth it would be just like them to try to enact this now as a well show you
ill be watching
i guess well have to call it postpartum abortion"
these pro life people are seriously delusional i live in south africa its been legal since apartheid ended and is free in state hospitals i have friends whove had abortions and it saved their lives and mental health
amerikkka descending into christofascism and the yanks wonder why china has come up so fast
life won today 
we should be thankful to donald trump for this
usa is truly backwards old ass people who arent even doctors get to decide over abortion rules the fact that rape and incest is not a cause for abortion is actually retarded to a level i cant even understand
thanks be to godcongratulations people in america
abortion can not be right in ay way it is sin
so how can you guarantee an unwanted child would live in a well loving family and wont get neglect or face domestic violence that every children shouldnt be facing
us supreme courts decision just shows how ridiculous usa is and does live in some other reality in other words outside of this world only totally fools make decisions like that
baby lives matter too it may not be a happy day for fornicators but its a happy day for babies
as if the world doesnt have enough people this will just create more unwanted babies more resource shortage not to mention the medical risks women had to face if they have pregnancy complications
abortion is equal to a murder of innocent child and every women who commit it should be publicly executed
i hope miscarriage on these pro lifers carry and birth dead babies then open your big fat mouth
is there anyone who doesnt know that condom does not prevent 100 of pregnancy   what if a woman got pregnant from a hookup should she just accept this result and destroy her own life if u still think abortion is murder sure get ready to pay childcare or stop having casual sex
this is so crazy people who are against abortion didnt win anything but all the people who are now forced to have a baby or  to get an illegal and dangerous abortion lost everything there are just two options control over a uterus by the state or control over a uterus by women themselves why do people think the state has a greater right in this
close your legs until marriage and this wouldnt be a problem 99 just wanna have a fun lol
"disingenuous at best bbc 

its no longer a federal right but it can still be approved on a state level as far as i know so its not banned"
i think this a personal decision that should be left to the individual to make for themselves everyones in different circumstances in life and this could ruin lots of peoples lives i dont think its a decision people would make lightly to have an abortion but some people just arent in the wright place for children it shouldnt be a crime in my opinion and there probably going through enough without having the added stress of being criminalised by other people who carnt emperthise
"what if an unmarried young girl gets pregnancy which may be an obstacle to her career it means men have more chances to get benefits from various ways am i sure is this announced from supreme court of us 
thank god us supreme court is not in india"
congratulations supreme court just did a good job abortion is evil and shouldnt have been allowed in this country
yay babies lives matter
daily mass shootings with no plan to ban assault rifles laws that take rights away from women a police force that abuses blacks unchecked borders    welcome to america folks lmao 
"life starts at conception not perception

pro life yes yes thank you god ex muslim here after saw jesus lord amen hallelujah hallelujah 
if biological males had to give birth abortion would have remained an unalienable right
handmade tail under his eye
bible bashers are the most destructive people on earth kill religion
oh i just love the sounds of brainwashed drones cheering as they happily give up our rights lovely the best part was when they sang about jesus good to know that christians lose their everloving shit at the very inkling of anyone pushing their beliefs on them but theyll dance and rejoice when they get to shove their religion up my uterus how hypocritically hysterical
the ignorance of people is appallingwell pro life crowds should pay to raise all the unfortunate kids that will be born in terrible situations trump is such an ignorant human he literally just said he knows what god wants disgusting liar son of a rotten system america shouldnt even exist forget about being great again cause it never was you do not build a real nation using slavery and killings as a starting point how can you be pro life and also pro guns at the same time a few weeks ago children died because of guns the system cannot even protect those already born and here it is a crowd saying that is what god wants what a joke
i like how people in the comments are like oh just stop having sex what about men then will they stop having sex i guess not
where are basic human rights
abortion should only be allowed if the mothers life is in clinical danger
thank god for that because its their body but the babie in the wombs life not theirs lives  all the glory to god in jesus name hallelujah and amen
good it is not your right to kill children or peoples with the time you have been blessed with while your on earthlots of hell bound people protesting  the pleasures of the flesh have taken over there minds there forgetting about the wooden box to come 
"great news now how shall we punish women for choosing to do something to their bodies i was thinking life with parole if they snitch on their doctors and its before 16 weeks and the death penalty for abortions after that

thatll make women birth unwanted children or children of their abusers"
you are here today because your mom decided to keep you so shut up and say thanks
the scotus didnt ban abortion
they forgot to mention that if your daughters are raped molested or there is incest in a family that she cant not have a abortion if she doesnt want to carry a sick mans baby so rite there they assume they can take away parents rites at the same time no way it is between daughter  mother  father not the conservatives  ritewing there people that have troubles with pregnancies by the time the dr gets thee ok then she can get help it could be 1012 hrs later by that time she could die this is sick its like now they think they can  decide if you live or die these people dont read they just put out what they want they dont check history out there statics 
the fairy story of free west world is collapsing we soon learn that africa is more free that us
time to raise an army
prayes the lord in jesus name god almighty still is on the throne amen 
abortion is banned the states can decide on how to deal with abortion
the prohibition on alcohol did not work out well i think abortion ban will make abortion even more dangerous because it will be done secretly by perhaps untrained people or dangerous methods going forward the us might become a theocracy
this would not have happened under trump
i can see a load of babies being dumped once they are born 
why womens lives decided by men 
abortions are wrong you dirty scumbags fuck you
we are not a christian nation  separation of church and state  this is sad and wrong  its not about pro life its pro birth  improve the quality of life for those already here  im embarrassed to call this country my home
unborn baby is a human being killing  baby in the woman womb is a murderer
i am so heartbroken why why did the country i so looked up to for inspiration and freedom take such a regressive step im so dejected 
feel sorry for the us this ruling is completely insane and based on what a bunch of religious nut jobs want
my comments are getting deleted by the politically correct brigade you
these dumb a liberals are still tlking about abortion like its a constitutional right
its quite a contradiction  one can never kill a baby outside the womb but can do so  to one in the womb does a baby have a right to its own body too i know its a complicated issue and there are no easy answers when it comes to rape and a mothers life is in danger 
in a country where free sex is so rampant illegalising abortion may not be the right thing atleast make it flexible case by case and create a culture of family values and less free sex then applying the illegal abortion rule will make sense
we live in a very bad time were freaks are taking over the world soon men will be able too bear kids
bbc is lying to you this decision does not make abortions illegal in the usa and i wish that was the case this decision merely allows each individual state and the voters decide whether or not abortion is legal or what parameters there will be only leftist extremists would argue that states should not decide these issues locally
abortion brought the us down on a communal l level a personal level and a spiritual level the country has turned from god and killed many potential human lives this turning from god has caused the plagues prophesied by john the revelator in the book of revelations
fake news it goes back to the state level where it belongs
"my girlfriend was in foster care   she is against it   the system fails them most of them commit suicide    

  free country my ass   the catholics are trying to take it over like they did in the past  its a cult    anyone who wants to come to the usa  dont   its becoming a nazi nation under christian law"
dont get why ppl or so selfish yes its ur body but that its a life u getting rid of a child doesnt life matters its seem like life doesnt matter anymore
"rape  exist
unwilling pregnancy  exist
abortion  illigal"
the populations already out of control anyways this is not good
ok so why are only women mad about this men historically pay for babies anyway
no state health car the right to bear arms criminalised abortion why does one nation want so many of its living citizens to die
pro life advocates are hypocrites  they care nothing about the lives of innocent children if they did they would be out in the streets protesting all the bombs that have been dropped in iraq__ over 500000 children killed in that war  and what about yemen and all the millions killed by violence and starvation and you heard nothing coming from these so called religious fanatics  they dont care about innocent lives they only cheer fervently the militarys catastrophic nightmarish policies in the middle east
abortion is evil if you do this willingly  you are going to hell 100 you just wish that you may never ever been born while yoy are tormented in hell
so shit isnt a shit until it leaves your arse hmmm interesting
the victory being crowed over by the life brigade who if you checked their homes would all be found to own multiple guns is in fact the imposition of a religious ideology upon people who do not share their belief system this despite the fact that the bill of rights explicitly states that the government congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof i guess technically its not congress forcing us to all live according to one fanatical branch of christianitys interpretation of a word here  there in the bible however congress put these bozos into the supreme court many people do not believe the soul enters the body until birth and therefore the foetus is not a live human being
why not to split into two countriesabortion and no abortionholding guns and no guns
i am prolife but denial of abortion in case of rape incest or medically proven severe genetic conditions in the fetus is just wrong
so what happened she get pregnant by alien how you going to explain that
some people are crying they dont have baby they judge god but today god will bless the supreme court leaders 
supreme court judges in america stop dictating on women bodiesof what they can do with their own bodyabortion is women business not supreme court judges  business mind yours   idiots
my body my choice from the looks of those bodies it appears they need to be making better choices

please watch the silent scream and consider the ripping apart of a foetal body due to abortion
"as if people dont have enough to deal with as it is struggling with record high inflation and poverty as the world recovers from an economically devastating pandemic they throw this absurd decision in the mix to even further divide  the nation into more conflicts and protests all based on their personal religious beliefs
idiots"
this begs the 6400 questionwhere is the right to an abortion enumerated in the usc
"abortion is a heinous crime why are these babies victims paying the price for your stupid mistakes and being cut into pieces where are the human rights that you all talking about you all hypocrites i dont  understand why there are so many people against the decision to abolish abortion how can you kill an innocent soul everyone knows only solution to this problem is to stay away from adultery and immorality then no unwanted pregnancy will occur and no innocent babies will be killed anymore you know that there are 20 million abortions that took place in europe this year  so sad 
in islam adultery and immorality are prohibited abortion and infanticide are prohibited islam preserves all rights indeed it is a religion of mercy"
finally some news with progress of our civilization dont want children dont have sex its that simple if youre raped then im ok with abortion
ban abortion 2 legged tuna keep them legs closed you stink
apart from medical reasons i agree with the court 
isnt an unborn baby a human life too
good job supreme court abortion must be kept to the minimum and only cases of emergency when the womans life is at risk i sympathize with women who get raped and end up pregnant but a fetus is a human being and simply cant be killed because he has no voice
women who are for abortion have already been born
women giving birth was fatal not that long ago we have all had it too easy this is a great advancement to reestablish respect for each other and learning once again to take life seriously
i feel like the only reason the bans are happening is bc abortion is basically removing a child like is a tumor and some people dont like that i dont agree or disagree im neutral
a lifes a life who gave us the right to decide who lives and who diesi wouldnt want that on my conscience
use protection the end
"right to abortion
what about childrens right to life"
in korea we have baby box women put baby in the baby box so baby can live the pastor take the baby and take care babies
tell it how it actually is bbc
"human cant protect their children in their wormso the govt help them
why dont we abort these people who support abortion"
"jesus is the way the truth and the life yes to gun control end abortion

human rights and climate change
end corruption crimes drug cartel and terrorism"
the war on the people continues 
"there is no justification to abortion people should take responsibility and be cautious the first place prevention is better than cure
leaning towards the prolife choice"
us has gone back in time  interms of human rights
"the laws here in australia are somewhat different to the us 
my partner and i have been together 27 years nowfrom the moment we got together way back when she stated she never wanted kids shes not maternal at all anyway after a year being together and her trialling a few different contraceptive pillsshe got preggers and she was on the pill her decision was easy as it was only 4 weeks and our doctor agreed on the abortion and after all these years we still believe it was the right thing to do as we both never wanted kids i think that its not selfish but rather responsible as the child would not have been wanted or loved and possibly hand balled to someone else  so it just goes to show that contraception most certainly is not foolproof i still think women should have the right to abort within a certain time frame"
liberals are hurt use some burnol
the 21 year old is terrified because she loves to get smashed without protection lol
its disturbing that not once did they mention that for mothers turned away a child gets to live
so the catholic church now rules even if you are not catholic
how about they give all the unwanted children to the judges politicians who caused this mess im sure they quickly change their mind if they are forced to care for a little human
"you shouldnt know our recent history yet all of america is forgetting very recent history dems have had dozens of opportunities to put this in our constitution led by obamas run up to getting elected a second term where every speech he famously said if elected my very first day in office i will codify abortion then upon winning the immediate reply was its not on the top of my list of priorities i think they never made this a federal law from thinking it would never happen also a little over a third strongly oppose abortion putting of enough they may not be elected but only they know why
and nobody should call this group anything but prozygote now when an expectant woman has a complication she cant go out of state no matter the money like a tubular pregnancy or a zygote dies in the womb now a surgeon wont touch her pregnancy in america now is a death sentence guess theres reasons why no media is reporting these obvious facts and most recent history the dems only answer is for us to vote harder we have why havent you done your job democrats yet all you will hear in any media is its chumps fault or blame the supreme court and these violent prozygote supporters just some truth and history nobody mentions because they all have agendas outside truth seems we are doomed to keep repeating history  to everyone"
wow what a dick this is trumps fault appointing 3 judges who are against abortion
bbc you suck ass
oh my goooood the right to abortion wasnt struck down they just gave it to the states to decide how does a official news channel mess that up that badly
this is absolutely crazy
"the judges actually appealed to the law to strike down roe v wade not christian theology or secular morality the 14th amendment actually does recognise the privacy and individuality of a foetus and because its not possible to hold a foetus accountable for anything you cannot justify abortion unless in cases where its not possible to carry to term and survive 
but i highly doubt any state no matter how theological they are will go to this length the only reason roe v wade was struck down is because the people voted on the politicians to do so and those same people hold a pretty moderate view on the subject but even then roe v wade was always poorly reasoned"
the most dumbest decision by a so called democratic country  just what are the supreme court judges thinking what if the one affected is thier own probably then they will understand and its so important that state and religion remains separate if mixed then hell will break loose
"el salvadors abortion ban i was sent to prison for suffering a miscarriage
by will grant
bbc news san salvador el salvador"
criminalising abortion isnt going to stop them happening its going to send them underground women will start dying because of unsafe procedures or selfinduced abortion and this is the american dream nevermind the sheer numbers losing their lives because of incredibly painful life threatening complications when they will no longer have the right to the cure they need its madness honestly
crazy bible thumpers
they cannot eliminate a fundamental human right the right of a woman to decide for her life and health is still there but those 3 judges could violate and did violate this right and that is a crime its outrageous but im sure it wont last long
god had give strength to these judges to do the right choice
so many beautiful babies are killed by their own mother thats so sad
anti choice people are not pro life  if it was they would take care of the women and the babies once there born  alot dont they care whelst there in the womb once there out they dont give a toss
abortion is murder simple
i thought that men can get pregnant and we have 64 different genders you can identify with cant define what a woman is now when roe vs wade was overturnedall of a sudden the term  woman is alive and well again abortion is just plain murder of a human being in californiaif you shot and killed a pregnant woman its considered double murder how about if that woman is getting an abortion when she got murdered
thanks president trump
its good news for me to see that americas freedom is killing children
not sure where in the constitution it says  abortion is  a right maybe under privacy but that is a reach passing a bill will be more efficient way of making this a law obama had a super majority in 2009 and did not wish to pas the law
let them get as many abortions as they want in fact speed it up its exactly the kind of people i wish didnt exist
if a man cant get pregnant how come they are there  protesting    oh yeah its only men who disagree with you that are bad
rights to kill babies overturned
america where if you get raped you are forced to have that baby just to raise it up and send them to a school to be  massacred backwards ass country
"wow imagine a civilised democracy outlawing child murder 
disgusting lol"
its not just about abortionwhat triggers me is how easily they can come up with their own decisions on womens body
in plain english those imagery rights conjured out of the 14th and 9th amendments by political courts instead of doing them the right way via the congress and amendments are now in jeopardy  the learning point is do it the right way and a supreme court that follows the constitution will not be able pop your balloon maybe the bbc will understand this language perhaps someone at the bbc could obtain a copy of the united states constitution the decision on abortions will now return to the states and the people of those states who elect their representatives where it has always belonged until a rogue court changed that in the 1970s that has now been fixed it is amazing the number of uninformed people making fools of themselves showing their lack of basic understanding of the constitution of the united states least we forget the largest abortion business in america was founded by a racist whose aim was the elimination of those weeds as she put it of the human race ie  blacks asians and anyone not white margaret sanger was a racist funny how most of the abortion clinics were placed in black communities as was most of the babies killed that does not get mentioned as much in the videos
americans are really dramaticthey are protesting to be allowed to kill innocent children that they split their legs very joyfully forwtf these clowns always amuse me
if its life risk for the mom then ok but otherwise use condoms
this small devil woman is still in favor of abortion not knowing how evil abortion is shedding of blood maybe shedding of blood is what pleases the devil but i pray that that ruling must permanently in america small nation will also follow suit to ban abortion at all costs
wonderful god bless america  this rulings will save more lives on this universe
absolute rubbish bbc  lies again  you believe a baby aborted at 85 months is good   madness        give the facts  explain  the case to the viewers    shameful
what happened to separating church and state to all the people bringing religon bs into this
the death rate of women and newborns in states that have banned abortion has risen  this means there will be more orphans  this is just insanity for which there is no explanation
ignorant narrow minded people applauding this ruling
in the usa you have the right to hunt imagine if peta has such a great campaign that they convinced a huge number of people in the usa that hunting was a sin  evil killing animals is a sin having guns to kill animals is a sin so the supreme court sees the arguments and agrees killing animals  especially animals that are not even predators should be made illegal in the usa so this ruling comes down now  you are a gun owner and you can shoot at little targets of people or animals but it would be absolutely illegal to actually shoot an animal with your gun anyone doing that has committed animal murder and thus should be arrested with their gun confiscated if your religion has you believing that this is sin then you might be able to get that law passed in a sort of sneaky way where your supreme court judges lie about past precedent about hunting watch powder good movie
6 political appointees affected the right to decide what a woman has the right to do with her own body 6 people decided the rights of 340 million people this has to change
this is pathetic i mean goodness gracious this stupid country just keeps making mistake after mistake i feel like now is a good time to leave before something terrible happens
its ok if you dont like abortion but your feelings cant decide others rights to abortion thats it
those people who are antiabortion are deranged and mentally unstable this country is fkced up note that reasonable christmas are pro choice
abortion in not right its murder
an elected legislator is not an in built majority you could say that for the democrats too but it wouldnt be reported that way imo
preg mother should have the right to decide their baby do not force them to suicide
our own president disagreeing with our highest court  even if the president disagrees with the decision he should not publicly voice his disagreement
i love babies too take care of and love all people  what about all the unwanted children in foster care  healthcare for all  end homelessness  clean up the ocean  plant more trees  clean drinking water and enough food for everyone  stop making the rich richer  enough for everyone  normalize equality  era equal rights amendment  equality  normalize equality   era equal rights amendment  equality  normalize equality  era equal rights amendment  equality 
same sex marriage should be banned forever too it is disturbing the fundamental gender and bringing so much confusion to ppl and growing children 
"themguns should be banned
uskilling babies should be banned too
them wait what
us we can play this game too"
to all the dumbasses the law clearly stats its up to the state to decide for example if she was a rape victim and dosent want a rape child they can allow her to have an abortion
any you fuchtards ever think about wearing a condom or being on birth control you all about the dumbest people ever
they  slay their babys in the belly just like the bible said
abortionkill replace the word abortion with kill and listen to what she us saying
women need to be protected  except them god damn babies
abortion doctors talking about human rights is like a slave owner talking about human rights
i dont  even know what party im watching anymore i just like watching news
people who protested for womens rights in the 70s must feel so insulted right now
so happy to see roe go down in flames 
funny how they dont ban guns but they can ban abortion
i wonder if illegal abortions are a thing now
all this prolife attitude but everyone can have a gun  just yesterday someone shot two people in alabama because they didnt put mayonnaise on his sandwich at the restaurant  great job america
abortion is wrong  it has good intentions however ppl use it as birth control  so its time to get rid of the law and change a few details

you can argue and say that im prochoice all you want but the truth is
im prolife
their lives
womens lives
you dont get to pick and choose which scenarios should be accepted its not about which stories you dont agree with its about fighting for the women in the stories that you do agree with and the choice that was made
womens rights are meant to protect all women regardless of their situation
overturning roe does not stop abortions it stops safe abortions 
abortion is healthcare"
imagine crying because you want to kill innocent babies
this removes me from watching bbc  its never been constitional
apparently my wifes body belongs to jesus christ so i will leave her alone now
the gop knows they wont win in 2024 and their majority senate and house wont last long so their doing everything they can get away with now before its too late
the people who like this is just f up this again show why usa is not the country to control the world again this is so wrong how can you be so naive
not every women  deserves to be allowed to have abortion some women need to take responsibility of their actions cause its not right to sleep around and to have one after another abortion in cases of emergency and rape yes its okay but when women keep making same choices without thinking the consequences then they should definitely deal with the result that comes with the choices they make no child deserves to die its just so selfish and these women keep making same mistakes again and again without concern of innocent children involved no one has right to end another life with their foolish choices
abortion is not a reproductive right since reproduction has already taken place
"keep those draws on ladies no more casual sex no more do overs you break it you buy it think twice before you do it 
abortion should be for rape kids and incest victims not for irresponsible women who live their lives with their legs open for every tom dick and hank keep those legs closed and those panties on 
its not just the mans fault a woman will only allow concessions to a man when she wants him to have it rape is something totally different so dont go screaming rape and blaming him for every damn thing when you allowed him to enter your home take you to the hotel make out with you in the car and finger bang you this supreme court ruling is a wake up call for those from both sexes who cant keep their draws on and their dicks in their pants"
congrats to the us there will  be a lot of women especially teenage girls suffering thanks to these irresponsible idealists imposing their believes on others
no unborn man will get an opinion on this as he cant give birth something says acceptable abortion basically ignores societys problems   its clearly sad that so meny think its ok   not exactly natural is it  obviously there should be exemptions and so on   certainly rape  its clearly a mess
so abortionist and 2nd amendment advocates fight the same fight now enjoy
jesus loves all the little childrenall the children of the world
because now america woke up after long time they wants to have more population in county just like india and china
poor women they can be raped and  forced to have the child i dont know but i see some gilead in make handsmaidtale
most of the problems in the world are caused by people who abuse sex sex is not a toy its not a game its a powerful enigma but in the wrong hands and with irresponsible use its very very destructive it should be used very seldom
the land of the free       
goto california
ok america is truly screwed up
im 21 and im terrified translation let me be a stupid hoe and not have to deal with any consequences why a stupid hoe you ask because a smart or regular hoe isnt crying she will keep bein a hoe but will bother taking one of the dozen contraceptive methods available or you know just wear a condom
"right to bodily autonomy

what about the jibby jab  

whoever doesnt comply should not be allowed to work buy food and be thrown into a camp 
lmao this is the lefts logic"
"there is no constitutional right to an abortion
its still legal to get a abortion in many states"
biden the worst president of the history of the united estates
more goverment control should have been a clause to allow abortion in cases of rape period  i am not a damn democrap and not very much a republican but i believe there should have been allowance for rapes but not to be paid for by the goverment if you need an abortion because of rape or  if its your life or the babys then you should pay for it youself not expect the gov to pay for it and i really dont give a shit who likes what i said or not 
the us is one of the few nations who are not facing the population bomb china and russia are imploding because they dont have any young people this is a real problem for many nations nations who let abortion rule the day are literally running out of enough young people to run their nation people are an asset to any nation when a nations old people out number the young it is literally dying the immorality of abortion has a high price
"as a trans women in the uk i cannot say there are many things i am happy about with our government

our government being not so closely linked to the church as america however is certainly one of them"
america is backwards and shouldnt be considered a democracy more of a conservative hell
heck no thank god i wasnt born in the us
if you smash a bald eagle egg you go to jail  argument over
the way they call themselves prolife but they arent prolife when a women dies from not getting an abortion or from trying to get one without medical professionals
isnt a womans period technically like an abortion or am i not smart im probably just not smart
religion and politics should have no connection they are too different things
all im seeing are euphemisms the procedure goal is to kill the child no its not to end the pregnancy since a csection isnt an abortion the goal of a csection is opposite of the goal of an abortion when someone says womens right ask the right to do what make them admit the to the actual goal
is right to abortion anywhere in the constitution
a tragic step backwards for women
most times it amazes me greatly the way i moved from an average lifestyle to earning over 63k per month utter shock is the word i have understood a lot in the past few years to doubt that opportunities abound in the financial markets the only thing is to know where to focus
do these people think our country is better off with more unwanted children that seems unnecessarily abusive to those kids we will have a lot more traumatized children in the future
n the future same sex marriage will ban also n america
america the land of freedom and hope  disgusting

copy and repost"
this will only result in the eventual establishment of a new amendment backfiring against the fools who dont understand what safe abortion means to the world and causing untold numbers of atrocities in the meantime
"in the same time the court rule in two cases 
first case you do not have control over my gun
second case i have control over your body you do not have control over your body

the history of abortion laws in america
 
religious community members talk god and abortion

how would an abortion stop someone from beating someone else up
i would love to see the same outpouring of feeling against the death penalty
"so basically in america women have rights but not to their bodies am i hearing that right because the reason england made it legal to stop illegal underground abortions which resulted in more women dying then the foetus she was carrying and some women were unable to have children after those illegal abortions the results were this 25 lived and could still have children 25 lost the ability to have children and finally 50 died from underground abortions men realise most of the time they didnt want to use condoms and it was blamed on the woman for getting pregnant the amount of teenage pregnancies in america is higher than the uk america is 521000 teenagers are still in high school pregnant age 16 years old when in england its 321000 teenagers are still in high school pregnant age 15 to 16 years old some people cant afford children because retail shopping markets get profit for buggies children clothing nappies or diapers for americans cots mosses baskets baby milk and toys the list can go on there is enough people in america in fact there is 3295 million people living in the usa 

also the amount of children abuse by parents that never wanted them in the first place that is cruel thing to do to them and abortions can stop child abuse there were 41 million reports of child maltreatment in the united states involving 

7753 billion people on the planet i think we are good well americans are slowly shooting children and themselves to death with their gun laws"
well i dont think most people care about anybody in this country
my am my sister have it
its all because of the people trump appointed to the court
"this law that was over turned allowed unborn babies of any age before birth to be ripped apart inside the womb with a pair of tongs in order to be removed if you think this was a good law youre dumb or evil perhaps both
how about a babies right not to be ripped apart
"
wow thankful but great news more opportunities
it was never a right  where does it say its a right to murder your child  show me  its murder  theyll just have to go to an evil state to kill their kids now
"tw the problem now is that there will be a rise of women self harming committing suicide going to dodgy  backstreet abortions 

some people get an abortion if the baby is stillborn you wouldnt  want your body to go through all the changes and pain to birth a corpse 


it sickens me because this means children will now have to birth children 

if a woman was rp3d you think its ok for her to go through emotional and physical pain all because pro life 

you can survive 8 minutes without a heart so featus having heart beats doesnt mean anything"
abortion is murder period
in a world which is already so substantially overpopulated this us court judgement is utterly mad and irresponsible
stop having sex if you cant have children
if these wonderful lives of unborn babies can have the right and speak up for their life they will choose to abort their parents
"none of us walking this earth at this moment if we had been aborted are you not happy and grateful that you got have the gift of life

 it is possible to not have to face the choice as to whether to have an abortion or not it is about making the choice to not risk getting pregnant by abstaining

abortion is murder"
its called being responsibleto easy just to end a lifenot quite the same but its like to easy to marry and divorce these days
it is time for all republicans and liberals to get read of your republican representatives this is because you republicans dint do your job and got read of your representatives that are not doing what is best for but for them selfs when the time comes show them what will happen  if they go against the peoples wishes your vote will let those republicans by daring the swamp
if youre not having unprotected sex you wont get pregnant all of this so women can have their sugar walls busted in raw abit irresponsible if you ask me you get blasted in why should you have the right from stopping a baby blasting outta you they love to say woman are special because they can bring life well apparently not they all fighting for the right not too its like if you werent graped than its your responsibility to give birth to that child and raise it you want to raise your legs but not your kids gummon land of the free
"boden his time to make money out of abortion by criminalising it

after the pandemic and lockdowns i guess millions of horney americans must be bonking like crazy

you wont see that in anally retentive uk"
the attorneys general of arkansas is a heartless cretin the reason she cannot imagine the piles of dead women her decision will inevitably create is because abortion has been safe and legal for 50 years with the stroke of her pen blood is on her hands
again i just dont see why supreme court decided this it should be the people no one have the right to take  a life of an unborn life
god bless the scotus  fjb
thoughts and prayers for the pregnant men affected by this decision
horrible country with a horrible political system i will be forever grateful that i dont live there my heart goes out to all the americans suffering in the land of the free
praise be to our lord and saviour 
if aoc should accidentally get pregnant no one in their right mind would want to impregnate her all of the united states should make an exception when it comes to abortion for the sake of our democracy grant her the abortion that she requests with all expenses paid because this republic cannot take the chance that her offspring will be just as mentally challenged as she is
congratulations usa on finally realizing abortion is not a right give a flying fuck to filthy feminazis who are crying
the byproducts of left wing human waste is dead unborn child trans womens breasts and trans male penises they are a strange breed
nice to see another totally misleading headline from the bbc
you are liars your title is a lie abortion was sent back to the states and the the people of each state
just make a law  no one is allowed to have children without a licence   requirements no welfare no bipolar allowed no mental person eather  you must make income and have a job   lets see if these things start chanting to for children now instead or have a blue screen of death
this world stumped at the need for more gun constraints but no issue banning the constitutional right for women to choose to abort their babies  women are upset as they should be but too many of you dont factor in how recklessunprotected sex for some not all results in unwanted pregnancies yes lets fight for our rights but lets also work on being more responsible with our bodies which would decrease the number of babies terminated before birth
this is just beginning the next target will be gay rights and birth control the conservative wing is trying to fall back 50 years and if this absurdity of the supreme court continues soon enough the united states will become once again a white mans nation the democrats must win the senate election and put an end to this 21st century blasphemy
may god protect the fetus of the antichrist what is he waiting for now a soul
this is so sad those poor women that will be forced to have a baby that they dont want then what give the baby up for adoption or struggle to look after them and the child potentially ending up in foster care this is so messed up what a step backwards for america
we remind the chinese government do not to encourage the bombing of ukrainian railways dont encourage russian war otherwise we will no longer guarantee the safety of the the belt and road railway
another reason why the whole world is laughing at the us
imagine being so desperate for sex youll forgo all the many types of contraception and pursue a few moments of pleasure at the expense of someone elses life sad person sad world
abortion is a womans right however if a woman can terminate her pregnancy due to her financial situation etc than a man should have the right to terminate his contract to pay child support if he has poor financial standing rather than taking away rights we should be giving equal rights to both men and women on this issue
this is disgusting
life is life yeswhy do humans think they can control lifeis it because we can terminate lifewho will ever understand what life is
congratulations usa welcome back to the civilized world the united states has made progress in civilizing by changing legislation and now you are one of the people only primitives kill unborn children thank god god is great glory jesus christ
the abortionists seem to have aborted themselves out of existence
stop getting drunk and handing out your pussies be an adult and there is no need for abortion
"everybody wants to save the children but nobody wants to raise them 

if the entire country does a 180 in less than a decade because of this we need to pack the courts you cant changed 100 years of preconceived decisions built ontop of other judgements in less than a decade youre cheating the system at that point youre forcing your perspective on other people and not looking back at past judgements taking in multiple perspectivesjudgements and deciding where to go from there thats how the courts have always worked"
the title is misleading it didnt remove any rights but gave them to the state witch is the proper place not a constitutional right this is a states rights issue
if the law was about men women would just say be more responsible
all proabortion  just go to a doctor and do the things so you cant have kids in first place whats the matter
if  you have no control of your body what is nextchip implants
noooooo the right to chose and the right of abortion is a human right and our right of freedom we need to fight this rulling this decision is not the final word the people will speak up and fight for our freedom
another thing they have blamed trump for why doesnt anyone see that this is all about negative coverage for trump   he was high in the polls as biden is pathetic  all of this is to sabotage the next election
"right to abortion dont make me laugh what you mean is the right to murder an innocent child has been abolished one of the best days in the us keep moving forward to progrssive

there are many ways to prevent accident pregnancy sex isnt a necessity too if you cant control your body and want to have an unsafe sex then you deserve to raise an innocent child youre creating you are a human not an animal murdering an unborn child isnt a solution its a selfish most barbaric sht one can do"
i wish it happens to my country too
this channel is a circus
interesting such governments also should provide all essentials to d children being born unplanned including good education and provide for families sufficient enough to meet all demands besides why is controlling over population not a kpi of controlling climate change this should be not only about a right of a person to decide but also should be understood that controlling reproduction is a overall good thing for d society us is becoming the land of crazy strange and sad
yay yay yay  i love life and i love our constitutional rights such a tear filled happy day
its funny how suddenly the left is talking about women again i thought biological sex had nothing to do with giving birth i thought you were all supposed to say birthing people now what changed
good now they cant kill babys
jesus loves the little childern how weird is that lolol church people are funny
this because communists said enforce covid19 vaccination status for work  travel the court was just doing what was asked invade privacy
this is extremely bad decision from the supreme court what will happen to all the women who cant give birth to a child due to medical conditions and risk to their life what happens to all the women who are raped and cant bear the children due to trauma or just because so is this how the usa does things sad how the humanity and intellect of people just goes backwards and women are still objects perceived by men without any rights and choices sad
the irony in this is they seem to care so much about babys getting killed in abortion and yet they dont give a shit about the children who died in school shootings this is nothing but hypocritical bullshit
abortion is wrong all of you who support it is going to hell
so a stillborn baby is worth saving instead of a women that could actually live its cruel to force a women to care a already dead baby to full term or a child a product of rape or incest i do agree that people need to be more responsible when it comes to having a child but people deserve a choice not all pregnancy is consensual this antiabortion ruling is just gonna lead to an increase in heath problems such as suicide and depression and kids ending up in foster care without a family because there isnt enough children already there already
my body my choice except for vaccines if they are so terrified close your legs and use contraception
thats really disgusting that government did this to women in the usa all the women are sisters and i support girls who protest against this shit abortion is the right of every woman rise up abortion rights love from russia
where does a british anchor of all people get off calling an originalist faithful interpretation of the constitution radical
this will also solidify the fact in peoples minds that religion affects even the nonreligious religion divides and it hurts people faith is a virus
i think if a woman gets rped no abortion but then i think the just the father and the father alone should be legally responsible for the baby as a counter option to life in prison
freaks  on both sides
looking at time index 130 the entire world needs to see exactly what sort of circus freaks have been pushing for the destruction of rights and freedoms in the us of a
i dont understand how arguing that because kids lives in the foster system are difficult that somehow justifies killing them if a child in foster care told you they wanted to commit suicide would you stop them or let the go through with it
"americas corrupt and total evil filth called the evangelicals have metastasized their cancer with their takeover of americas federal and states governments this will not end well i the same week the scotus decided to make it perfectly legal for concealed carry anyone who wants to shoot someone just has to say they felt like their life was threatened  many are going to die for that decision and their samebreath overturning of r v w women will be dying 
this is not about lives  this is about going back to an america that never existed  
people like marjorie taylor greene is perfectly ok with the jan 6th insurrection because it was patriotic americans wanting to get rid of dictatorship    well people  look who the real dictators are"
you should hace shown the stories of those whove chosen to safe the lives of their babies  they are humans too and their lives have meaning

"peopleofcolortriedtotellyou
do not vote for trump he was able to nominate 3 supreme court justices that are going to destroy your lives"
"im pro choice myself i dont think abortion is a good or a bad thing i think its a case by case basis thing

all i can say is i hope any state that makes it illegal is willing to pour ample amounts of money into the foster system to balance this which they wont"
abortion is the process of tearing a fetus crushing it and removing it from the body for disposal is it a womens right
"thats a lie
    the supreme court of the united states of america simply handed this back to the states where it belongs
    youre reporting like sods
                 victory

this is beyond weird and stupid i mean how do these peopleagainst abortion function they fail at being a civilized human at the basic level
women have the option of keeping the child putting the child up for adoption or going to a state where abortion is legal the federal government should never have been involvedjust as the federal government is not involved in the lifedeath decision of captial punishmentwhere each state sets its own law
congratulations to all the unborn babies  and to all the dads who want their kiddos
i dont understand what they fuss about if the government  rule  to no abortion first women or girls keep your legs shut if your not ready to become a mother focus on study  find a decent work instead of dating so young so casually if you dont want to be responsible then stop having casual sex without protection it is your body and thats true but its not the fault of innocent life to be kill because of your irresponsibilities the government should focus more on how to change this young generation to be more cautious solve the drugs issues and homelessness some of this women  use drugs  drink alcohol  and do casual sex  killing is never  right even how much you justify it by saying your young etc

"why the walmart management kicked out the ukrainian immigrants by saying not to com back to walmart  is there a food sale for american peoples only or is a shortages of food and why the americans are telling ukrainians that the ukrainian people are buying all the food and because of the ukrainians the food and gas is so expensive

do somebody care about immigrants or this is a trap  with immigration

who stops comments from getting any more replies the quota is not exhausted there are comments with way more replies than that also im trying to reply to someone who replied not the commenter whoever is doing this needs to butt out
coming from my perspective as a woman who struggles with having children i agree with this law however this was not always my viewpoint since i understand what it is like to be assaulted i was always pro choice that is until i found god and realized that he would want all of his children to be born no matter what i deeply feel for all the victims of assault and i hope these people find god to help them through on the other hand ive known women who just wanted to go out get drunk not use any kind of protection and then wanted an abortion that sickens me i pray to be blessed with a child someday

this is 100 a determining factor that will drive the split of the current us into two coutries  the medieval barbaric racist farright south and the progressive forwardthinking north    the union should have taken the opportunity to cast away the southern states during the us civil war
the us takes a further step towards becoming gilead
"i hear a lot about victims forced to give birth but zero about convenienceinconvenience abortions which are probably 98 of all abortions 
sus"
heres an idea keep your legs closed hoes
all the angry baby killers are upset about not being able to erase babies denying them the chance to live
only people who never were in the situation to decide if they could or couldnt care for a child could make such a horrible decision
it means that babies lives are no longer at the mercy of selfish women
the best decision made by the court
why dont women who want abortions adopt their babies to women who have miscarriages or people who cannot have childreninstead of being the excicutioner of these these poor innocent little souls 
ahhhit feels gud 2b a american right now
but its as you say its down to the individual states so it has not been banned nationwide so why are the democrats trying to incite violence over this it can still happen so threatening to burn down the supreme court is very extreme in my view
is that what america call human right
hell yeah  know you know

"usa spends trillions of dollars 20 years and thousands of their own lives and millions of foreign lives to give equality to women in afghanistan

all womens in life cant do the abortion after the 40 days of pregnancy this was in all holy books before the holy quran  they can remove the baby before the 40 days of pregnancy i swear in the name of great god its the true truth but but if the woman respect it and she doesnt remove it from her body she will not regret at all especially the one who hurt so bad like the ones who get raped from bad sick criminal from any years past or now because she a victim innocent woman and the great god respect them so much and if the woman raised the child she will take a great boons after life  the great god will burn all the criminals in hell of fire after death womens can do the abortion before the 40 days of pregnancy but she must go to a good professional doctor in hospital  but she cant do the forbidden abortion after the 40 days of pregnancy because the great creator he put the soul in body of the child in his mother womb about the bad sinrs womens who do the forbidden adultery she must stop  and if she was pregnant she must raised the baby or she give it to the government they will take care of him  if someone wants something pls text me its my honor to help you yes i forgot something very important if the woman was so ill and she bleeding she must go to hospital to remove the baby if that baby wad so dangerous to her live herself because sometimes womens fall off or she had some accidents any accident in life or someone hurt her she must go to hospital immediately and its not matter if she was pregnant before 40 days or not she must safe herself  poor womens cant imagine how they feel when they be pregnant god bless all womens  if the woman was not clean faithful she can remove the baby before the 40 days of pregnancy but she must stop and ask forgiveness i hope that "
abortion was never protected under the constitution thats why roe v wade was overturned the supreme court did not take a stance on the legality of abortion because there is no such law over which they have jurisdiction rather they reached the only conclusion they could reach which was to affirm what is in the constitution and thats the 10th amendment which makes abortion a state issue which it is given that healthcare is mentioned nowhere in the constitution democrats have had 49 years since roe v wade to pass another amendment to enshrine abortion rights but instead they did nothing and therefore have only themselves to blame but as usual they point the finger at anyone  everything else for allegedly wronging them
all the ones happy is un attractive and ugly
an evil strategy of the wealthy and powerful to force the poor to reproduce enough cheap labours for them to continuously to exploit the quality of their lives the health both mentally and physically are not their concern this is a tragedy not just to under privileged american women but to our entire human race this is a disgrace
a women should not be forcefully burdened with the child this is truly a dark day in american history this is wrong they are treating women like a secondary gender these people of religion are taking lives of women they think they are saving life of an unborn child but the truth is they are pushing both the women and child to hell of a life ahead
i pray samesex marriage gets overturned as well its an oxymoron for one and a total mockery of covenantal love god establishes between a man and a woman rejoice in the lord
abortion is wrong
"fact check propaganda from the bbc 
the power to decide time frames has been given back to individual states nothing has been outright stopped"
someone should tell to thouse pro life idiotsthat abortus and family planning are essential for population and food controland if to much people are bornits gonna be pro life fault for colapse of populationnatureand food industry

whats this  religious people imposing their views on others surely not  first you abandon  the children of afghanistan to the taliban and now this you are no better than those who oppress others in other countries
if you believe in a god then you should automatically lose the right to be a judge you have already proved that you have no critical thinking skills
finally good news
bbc doesnt believe in god but they do support child abuse remember who paid jimmy saville
they hate adult women already how can they love part of them all they want is control crazy religious people
"220 wow you know you can just not have sex outside of marriage and it solves all those problems 

 figures women who seek abortions can just take a flight to canada"
"10s of millions of women wow thats a lot of women who are killing children time to move to a state that allows abortion if youre a woman who sleeps around 

yikes crazy women everywhere"
abortion is murder and the child doesnt have a say in it if people dont want to have a child used contraceptive its as simple as that the bible says that god saw the embryo and all the working parts of david alive and growing
surely a good decision  cos the feautus lives matter  it is very cruel act to take the future innocent babys life
all hues and cries for unborn kids nobody even want to care about the thousands of kids in orphanages and foster cares who grow up without love or affection wow what hypocrisy
what a disaster of country the us is in total decay
abortions will never stopjust safe ones will not be available they should open up public funded travel to help out women wanting an abortion to travel to states where it is still legal
"dr willie doesnt have right to kill children what a bunch of sickos red wave is coming to get rid of perverts
"

the best the best news  america is back it brings tears of happiness
"next is getting rid of perverts

"
"this decision was a no brainer no right to abortion expressed or implied in us constitution never has been no one has a right to kill a child
"
just go watch how a child is aborted 
the handmaids tale
as a male abortion has to be legal idc what ppl say
"it burned my heart to watch videos on social media of women who say that they killed their children they had abortions if the problem is with poverty then this is not a justification for committing such a horrific crime otherwise what are we different from those who bury their daughters for fear of poverty 14 centuries ago
note all laws and regulations allow abortion in cases of rape and danger to the life of the mother what we object to is abortion without a real reason which is most of the cases of abortion"
people are stupid some lady said what about the dads that rape their daughter my answer 2 that is good now there will me evidence of what hes doing instead of us having laws that help these people destroy evidence and lifes
these people are selfish and delusional to think that they have the right to tell a woman what choice she makes about their bodies and their own life  shame on us america usually proud to be an americannot today
the abortion protesters who hassle women outside of clinics can eat shit and die
that arkansas lawyou can shove it up your ass

how d care if its illegal stil de kil unborn childrenworse dan wars
and organised crime thanks the government for a brand new business adventure
"if i were to debate a person on abortion there would be 3 things ill point out 

1 the fetus has value just not as much as a person thatll be important leading to the third point and ill expand on that 

2the fetus is a human being in the sense its a being which comes from someone but it isnt a person its not cognitively changing or reacting to anything that happens to it so from that standpoint it matters less and is complete indifference

3 the reason its good to draw the line at birth third trimester abortions rarely happpen and most of the time they do its for extreme medical reasons is because of physical consequence the woman has something in herself which if held to the contrary of what i believe shed have to deal with the struggle of giving birth as someone who doesnt want to as well as the vast amount of possible health issues that come with giving birth outside of just when the baby is out once a baby is born theres little to no physical consequence because the person can rid themselves of responsibility as they will and its outside themselves the baby also isnt a person but it matters enough to have it live due to what it can accomplish mixed with that it isnt a physical hindering of someone with actual personhood as far as their body"
get your facts straight the federal government turn the matter over to the individual states there are only 5 states where abortion is illegal
so if you got raped and pregnant your gonna take care of the child
there is no federal right to marry anyone people voted to define marriage in the last 15 yrs and the ussc took away their rights by overriding their democracy
trump did that the man gets things done
are all foreign journalists this ignorant there is no constitutional right to an abortion there never has been that was the entire point of the sc ruling even liberal legal scholars concede that roe was founded in bad law the supreme court does not legislate policy its only purpose is to interpret the constitution i was a journalism major before my professor told me that true journalism was dead and the first thing we learned is how to do proper research and fact check please educate yourself
"as an australian you may say i have no right to view my opinions but i say screw that im lucky to live in a country where our government actually gives a sht about us its sad how some of you americans care more about your guns than women 
heres an idea if these menwomen that believe in a magical man in the sky think its okay to tell what women should do with their bodies how about you old fcks get a vasectomy at age 60 and even better men below 18 as well can you american women please bring that up with the supreme court if they think taking away womans rights is okay then theirs should be taken away too fair is fair right bloody pathetic 
i hope these laws change for you beautiful american women xxx"
"this lie that most women are getting abortion from abuse needs to stop 

most women are using abortions like birth control 

i know a woman who had 11 abortions before she had the last 4 children 

this is sexual irresponsibility"
states cant regulate guns but womens rights on abortions with no exception to incest or even rpe  ok america call urself a free country why dont ya
 women fighting for the right to be sexually irresponsible
i dont like christians but in this case theyre right abortion is a murder and women should not be able to kill children and face little consequences
i thought biden can make that decision   poor americans  i rather have that option to choose
so people are upset because they cant end life anymore  what has this world come too
its about the population to sustain status quo black americans are the most valuable economic resource for the white people power structure its about the power of the ink pen to maintain the white people power structure the goal of white supremacists law making courts with weaponized abortion laws is about sustaining a perpetual supply of black bodies for the number one job creator of white people  the civil and criminal codification systems these two systems do not work without people to intrap into 1  if not both  to finance job creation and government fundings  black bodies are the number one resource to sustain both civil and criminal systems for white people employment and power it is also about increasing the white american population to protect the economic power of the white race forever into the future the white american population is shrinking to play the longgame demands forwarded thinking of at least three  generations  100 yrs from this minute but first you gotta be around in a century  meaning descendants  babies to pass power  high income to the white labor force must be replenished as the older white labourers leave the labor market the potential labor output of the unborn white child is extremely valuable to those in longstanding white positions of power and high income the longstanding positions of white power and high income cannot remain in the hands of white power or be conserved and sustained for white people only if the white labor force to retain and conserve the high income is not replenished this is why dixiecrat republicans with high income and positions of power do not care about life after birth because the high quality of life after birth is subjectto birth into an already established white family with benefit and security of longstanding white positions of power and access to white power  privilege is determined by birth andor the output value of mental and physical labor of the white person it is white socialism disguised as capitalism which is based on false scarcity and false fear of black power the official citizenship document or birth certificate issued by all predominate white countries is the proof of collateral for the country of birth and based on the potential output of valuable assets value development and job creation basically the countrys gdp white countries are able to borrow high amounts of money from international resources based on the potential cash flow  collateral produced from the labor of each citizen  especially each white citizen  whom cannot be collateralized if abortion impedes white population or white birth certificates  hence death certificates and the withdrawal from the gold standard of dollar value this is why in 1971 the usa eliminated the dollar gold standard and put the dollar up again the usa full faith and credit of the usas gross domestic product  which should now be the gross labor production instead especially the income and job creation mechanism of the civil and criminal codification systems  the two systems typically allocated the largest percentage of city county state  federal operating budgets  designed to extract income from the powerless and poor nonwhites by way of fines fees judgements and convictions to finance white job creation throughout local state  federal governments by way of the covert marshall law style policing in the low income nonwhite communities for the sole purpose of perpetuating poverty  and thereby gaslighting civil liability and criminal activity  a perpetual supply of civil liability and a pipeline of criminals for sustained white job creation the civil and criminal codification systems are the largest white people job creation mechanism in local state  federal territories  the number one creator of all types of job positions income levels and careers jobs  careers reserved and passed down to white family  friends forever and ever propagated to conserve and retain white power and positions of high income the true power first acquired thru gunpowder and protected today with the largest military and the most nuclear bombs a position black people will be kept away from at all cost  even if the white people were not so afraid of such black position and power they cannot accept black people controlling the most powerful military with the most nuclear bombs  unless its over their dead bodies
i am loving in a giant cult run country fuck
the states will decide if they will allow abortions the people of the state will decide and thats the way it should be
third country
land of the free  banning booksdresscode for children and now this home of the brave   the kidds are more likly to get shoot then of cancer or drivning accident
about time we fight against these narcissists that have no believe in god morality or common sense looks like youre gonna have to be more careful when having sex bohooo gtfo lol
its hard to explain but this means trump has a stronger chance of election
"there will now always be a black market 
abortions will still be done legally or not 
hopefully safely 
but this was a lot of money and time wasted 
abortion will still continue 
a few corporations have already put a change in their health plans stating that they will provide financial help to get their employees to a safe state and care 
and its all good for the higher ups that made this decision
until its their daughter that gets pregnant because the family friend raped them or etc
pfffft dont think they wont secretly find a safe way to treat their family"
congratulation
"im 21 and im terrified  of what   seriously of what  youre not in danger  the only thing you cant do now that you could before is murder a baby  except you still can in half the states  are you terrified that if you get pregnant you might be required to give birth to the child  okay fine  giving birth being pregnant thats all a very big deal so its understandable to not want to go through that  if thats the case try not having sex
theres a lot of talk about rape incest and pregnancy complications  aside from the fact that these cases are a tiny minority of abortions my opinion on those is as follows  
1 rape reallocate resources from abortion clinics to psychological counseling and maternity assistance  strongly encourage the victim to make the best of her situation and help her through it  abortion may be a last resort in extreme cases
2 geneticphysicalmental defects i think that this category is justifiable as potential reason for abortion especially in extreme cases where the childs quality of life would be severely impacted  eg if an incurable disease would mean the child would be born and live a short life of suffering its arguable that it would be more humane to end it as soon as possible
3 incest refer to part 1 and 2  incest may or may not be rape and may or may not cause a deformity or defect
4 pregnancy complications if complications arise and the mothers life is threatened by the pregnancy this is reasonable cause for an abortion procedure

there was also talk of abortion being a human right  its not  it cannot be  human rights are inherent not provided  you have no right to any service or resource whatsoever  you do not have the right to have an abortion to have a lifesaving medicine to have access to the internet or to have water  heres why  if you have the right to say education that means that any government which upholds human rights must guarantee that you have education  that means they must not only build schools but they are responsible for making sure there are teachers  and if hypothetically you lived in a low population area and no teachers were around the government would be required to relocate a teacher to that location so you can have your rightful education  they would need to make it a legally binding statute that someone must educate you and if that someone refuses to provide their service they are in violation of the law  this makes them a slave of the state work or be punished  give water or be punished  educate or be punished  abort this pregnancy or be punished  freedom is a human right because we all have it by default  actual rights are things that you start out with that you have by default  they can only be restricted or infringed they are not cannot be something that someone does for you because that infringes other peoples rights  life is a right  freedom is a right"
congratulation
a return to subjugating women and keeping them in poverty and misery
the woman with the sign in the thumbnail the future is antiabortionwhat a clueless snapper i cant believe there are women who are against abortion and against a womans right to choose seriously what a woman does with her body and her life should be up to her not some republican loser im not american but republicans are totally fd this is just one reason why they are fd but there are soooo many more reasons leave the women alone let them decide for themselves
my god the thought that a baby about to be delivered can no longer be subject to having a pair of forceps thrust into its skull and its brain sucked out is unconscionable  we demand partial abortion
abortion kills innocent human life and should be banned worldwide
imagine being saddened by not being allowed to murder human babies in the  womb
some of yall in the comments raising hell because they said yall cant kill yall babies no morecant be the same people going to church praying to god for moneyi mean seriously
this reporter looks amazing her suit is so neatly fitted on her the woman in the blue
if women can opt out of being a parent then men should have the same right without being financially burdened for the next 20 years men shouldnt be forced to pay for something women ultimately can destroy
"the prolife movement is prodeath and more people need to recognize this important fact

the same justices and politicians who weep crocodile tears for embryos are the ones who sentence thousands of the elderly and children to die  how prolife are they really when they refuse to protect people from covid and guns  the blood of thousands stain their hands disproving their rhetoric about caring for life

we need to vocally label conservatives as the prodeath party and directly call out people like brett kavanaugh and clarence thomas as the heartless treacherous wretches they truly are  dont let these hypocrites claim the higher ground on the cause of saving lives challenge them and ask how many people died from their other actions"
"why not use condom 
what is the need to get pregnant if tou dont want the child dont you know doing sex makes baby"
"pro  life  women should think life is a precious gift 
jesus christ  is boss the world universe has killed millions trillions of unborn children   
women says it is their choice and their bodies  what about the child body  parents supposed to protect their unborn child not get rid of their tiny bodies god help women"
"screaming they have the right to kill babys should strike a notch in every human being alive
it sounds kind of sick doesnt it
if most people had seen what the after shot of an abortion looks like they wouldnt feel that way"
thanks trump for the march for life
wtf is happening im so glad i was not born in this crazy country
"usa constitution do not guarantee the right to abortion lies lies lies
read the constitution"
mr trump  his idiots have nothing better to do than cause trouble over stupid stuff
stop abortion born to live free  wake up american people  god bless our nation god bless america  god bless our president trump wake up america wake up american  freedom is not free 
liberals are crazy you cant tell them nothing they like to kill babies this woman thats screaming should thank her mother for not aborting her hears a good case for abortion
us is messed up
psalm 1391318tlb13 you made all the delicate inner parts of my body and knit them together in my mothers womb 14 thank you for making me so wonderfully complex it is amazing to think about your workmanship is marvelousand how well i know it 15 you were there while i was being formed in utter seclusion 16 you saw me before i was born and scheduled each day of my life before i began to breathe every day was recorded in your book 1718 how precious it is lord to realize that you are thinking about me constantly i cant even count how many times a day your thoughts turn toward me  and when i waken in the morning you are still thinking of me
as a child whose parent considered abortion its not right to force women to have these babies it sucks knowing you were unwanted and that you ruined your parents lives one broken condom and they got me a recalled birth control and they got my sister to this day my parents hate each other because of my moms decision to have us they were happy newlyweds but were definitely not ready for children let alone two sometimes i wish my mom just went through with it i hate that i put this burden on them and its not like i wouldve known and thats what these millions of kids will feel like my mom had an abortion at 15 when she was raped by a mentor she was too young to be a mom she ended up having another one 8 years after i was born another bc mistake but she found out she had cervical cancer around 2 months and had to choose getting chemo and losing the baby or waiting til the baby was born and hoping it didnt spread and we lose her or both of them she chose to stay with her living children i mean we were sad at the loss but we wanted our mom more abortions arent always bad and each one should be treated individually instead of outlawing all of it

good bye usa  did the taliban just take over  disgusting disturbing disbelief  i will never visit this country again
reading the comments below i am reminded of why leftist elites call you brainwashed morons useful idiots the supreme court did not take away your right to kill unborn babies it simply upheld the 10th amendment which makes clear that such decisions are the purview of the individual states not of the federal government some states will outlaw feticide as is their right and others will keep it
reversing roe is a big win for pedophile priests and the religious fascists that worship them
they need to make abortion ilegal death penalty for abortion

men need to shut their mouths an unwanted baby doesnt ruin their livesonly womens lives so now foster care and orphanages will skyrocket in population many more kids will be without parents well have 12 year olds giving birth raped women will be forced to carry poverty for women will increase greatly i think the fathers and fetus should get dna tests and be forced to pay child support upon conceiving not birth also pay half the hospital and doctors bills prison if they dont  they already dont with no consequences so we are putting women right back at that severe disadvantage and womens salaries will decrease and well see fewer in management positions because of sickness delivery and maternity leave of course men want this it gives them the upper hand forcing women to have a baby they dont want will never turn out well imagine the self abortions and desperate measures women will take many will have the procedure in mexico this will traumatize millions i think as long as a fetus cant live on its own outside the womb abortion should be legal government better not touch the plan b pill change birth control no questions asked rule  in fact now we need more of this readily available and free at planned parenthood federal laws like this worry the shte outa me each state should govern itself not nine people  i know my state will ban it but i still believe in state governance we cannot let this seep into other areas where we end up being run federally we arent china russia or north korea i guarantee those six votes were to lord over the states not to care about fetuses they know good and well this will financially cost us dearly it probably also has something to do with an increase in natural born american citizens becoming more and more of the majority taking away womens rights is unjust and discriminatory im so sick of the inequality weve never even had a female president never black lives matter  yes and weve even had a black president a man  i still get teary eyed thinking about at least we have a madam vice president but i want to see a madam president and first gentleman of the white house and all of those people standing out there crying in happinessare they going to adopt thes unwanted babies will they volunteer their time at an orphanage  will they foster ten kids of course not because theyre hypocrites so yeahthere are so many horrible things about this
hm well the same sex marriage is next one thing to say to the judgehow about interatrial marriage judge oh sorry you are married to a white woman hmwell if you open pandoras box you never know the outcome 
its scary to see these women celebrating abortion cant be stoppedwomen will continue to terminate unwanted pregnancies by all means possible and most likely now die doing it
u guys remember the film hot tub time machine specifically the scene of chose it dose it so if the believe the babies should be born they should be handled the rights to rise those kids the mothers dont want to kid this varies all those people who dont want abortion laws should be handed the kids born the kids which the mother does not want for which ever reason we all win
 im ready to get the  out of this  country
americas gone a bit crazy lately hasnt it 
if anything america needs to stop having children the thought prosses here must have been extremely short poverty will rise clearly lower educated familys will grow causing more mental health issues but at least you still have gun laws to support bad mental health in children the movie idiosyncrasy was supposed to be a joke
lol so much not correct with this reporting  there is no legal obligation to ban abortion  nonsense  all the ruling does is follow the constitution and gives states some of their rights back against the federal government  the states will now get to decide for themselves as they always had the right to do so
"who is the government to decide what i do with my body
who are you to decide what happens to the babies body"
trump is a trump indeed
prolife does not end with delivery of the baby
whats next america chastity belts
it should be illegal for women to say no to men saying no is the murdering of a potential baby murder is murder
guy saying abortion is murder on 515 can burn in hell for all i care because its not murder
banning abortion is wrong and its a womans choice some people make excuses saying its murder and should be banned if people dont like it then leave it alone and they need to just stay of it its none of they  business
god is watching over his gift of life taken  for granted by humans  contraceptives are widely available they are not banned for rape and incest cases the individual will have to make a personal decision  some pro abortion activists say it is their body  no one  says it isnt  killing a babyembryo is still murder it should never be used as a substitute for contraceptive there are long term implant contraceptives available and other states still available to perform abortion if someone sees nothing wrong with ending  a human life on an ongoing as needed or regular basis
they should have the right to tell people what to do with their body if theyre using it as a baby killing weapon what if im an expert in karate they shouldnt be telling me that i dont have the right to chop your neck and make you dead right yes they should there are a lot of different ways that the body can be used as a weapon
its interesting to see the clear bias of the reporters
yeah these abortion women have dreams they that they believe were destroyed but destroying the dream of a prospective father who wants children is just as bad i have children and i pray every day that no idiot aborted my child thats sick shit i once married a girl in order to prevent her from getting an abortion
rapist pedophiles toxic families and relatives must be very happy now they can able to control women again congratulations america you are just as bad as other third world countries uneducated narrow minds control freaks nobody has rights to tell what women wants to their body you cannot even help all of the orphans so why putting your nose on womens decision what about mandatory all of the guys to do vasectomy so its fair then we do not need to worry about getting pregnant i would rather not to forgive all the parents who decided to keep the  babies and ended up neglected or killed them where are all  your supports for the parents who need help if you are prolifeif you think women who did abortions are selfish then prolife are selfish too because you judge another human being without thinking about their situations we all not perfect but do not act like you better prolife people america has more problem than this

hey women out their who want to murder babies get some contraception or keep your panties on murder should never have been an option
no matter how you rub your lips with your mouth abortion is wrong period
boycott american conservative owned companies and businesses they supported this
i get tired of doing this but here we go again  there is no constitutional right to abortion nor was there ever  biden and his leftist advisors may say there was but if you go look for yourself you will see they are in serious error and misleading the public  the constitution actually gives the states the right to legalize abortions   it doesnt even give that right to the supreme court  so when scotus decided on roe v wade they were acting as an unelected legislative body and acted in contradiction to the constitution even rbg recognized this and said the decision was on shaky grounds and she was pro abortion   this supreme court now is recognizing this and has handed the states back their rights  look if you want your rights and freedoms that are enshrined in law then you have to follow the law  you cant pick and choose which laws you are going to follow  if you want to change the law then you need to pressure those who can do that  one thing i do know is that whenever the left doesnt get their way they react violently  remember the george floyd riots  how about the threats and plots to kill supreme court justices  i thought only right wing fascists did that sort of thing  guess not  seems the left is much more inclined to violence  ive even watched certain members of congress and the now vicepresident of the united states encouraging and cheering on that violence  think that might be sedition
land of the free
the us is becoming the anus of the world
abortion is not something a mother think lightly of she probably thought it through and pulled herself together to go through the process i feel sorry for every women who arent in a state that will protect our rights and will have to travel to another state for resources and services there are many unwanted children in the system who struggle to find families because families also have their own standards on the childrenren they want to adopt
care about people  care about women  really  what about the care of the unborn babies selling the parts afterwards on the open market  care of the women  really take care of yourself before sex  not afterwards 
the termination or the dismemberingkilling you should say
"we do have constitutional rights and civil rights in our country in our communities our cities our streets 
abortion rights its our bodies 
so is weed and drugs 
its legal isnt it 
we do have our civil rights also against marijuana"
women  take care of yourselves before sex not afterwards  murder is not the answer 
lady abortion is not in the constitution do ur research before you talk 
abortion is irresponsible sex and selfsatisfaction unless you are a victim of a crime

"abortion is banned
eastern europeans our children deserve to live god bless 

westerners anarchy"
oy bruv innitthe extent of words i care to hear from brits
vomiting  this is horrible
bbc fake news it means that people should go to states that agree with their values to kill babies
i mean abortion is a choice and it is upto the women who is carrying the baby what she should or shouldnt do in no way she should be compelled to carry the child if chooses not to very sadge 
those of you who dont live here in the us please take to the streets and protest for us maybe if other countries join us it will help im frieghten for my children and the world over with these extremist changing america in the worst way and having the largest military the furture could be a very frightening place for all of us were being oppressed please help us
abortion is murder  you get an abortion by a doctor  theyre the murderer and the woman is an accessory to murder  if there was no options for women not to get pregnant i could understand  but theres many options to prevent getting pregnant  and as far as wanting to get pregnant getting pregnant but finding out the baby has health issues  be a human being and give that baby a chance at life  and my views arent about religion  its just about being a caring sensitive human being  if a woman gets raped  you can put that baby up for adoption theres so many couples who want babies but cant  couples can give that baby a home with lots of love and care for many years
"wether or not you are for abortion notice the rise of churches in the us
back to the middle ages"
"slippery slope so whats next beyond the current issues should we take away voting rights from women and people of color should only one religion be allowed should all people with diseases and disabilities be removed from existence yes its all the same thing and yes this is normal in some backward countries right now 

democracy is great but not for everything we have seen where democracy does not work for certain issues sometimes you have to scrap democracy and support something because its just what a society of equality and respect is all about 

im glad that companies are getting involved because they have rights too and often power its funny how big progressive companies are the ones with the courage  i would love to see big conservative companies come out supporting prolife but you know they wont because at the end of the day this would still hurt conservative parties a lot more than progressive companies that speaks volumes as to where the general society sits and what brand is more powerful again well see how prochoice companies like netflix disney and amazon will be impacted  i dont think much because most prolifers are hypocrites and will still visit disney subscribe to netflix and buy from amazon lol"
so many children in states who go through foster care child abuse and youth drug abuse now there will be many more due to unwanted child birth i cant believe it doesnt even make exception for rape and abuse victims this is stupid leaving mothers accountable while fathers will fly offtalking about those who abandon women after pregnancy
all the anti abortion chicks are so ugly so it doesnt matter to them no one getting them pregnant
hey everyone divide and rule strikes again their still playing us
you would think the us would of learned from history nationwide prohibition and the drug on war campaign where became illegal and how well that turned out i think the us government is a bipolar rollercoaster
its crazy how people want to have pleasure but do not want the responsibility that comes with it for every action theres a reaction the whole reason humans have sex is to procreate and its engrained in the biology of every living thing do not reply to me about rape and incest which contributes for 15  abortions a majority of women who have abortions are doing it our of their own convenience to shy away from the responsiblity of having a child  or clump of cells which we all are consciousness which in technicality from the viewpoint of prochoicers would mean people in coma or asleep arent human beings since they arent conscious women have the right to choose  which everyone has the right to choose but that does not mean the choice is right and some choices should be prohibited eg just because i have the choice to stab some one doesnt mean i will because as i stated earlier theres consequences for each choice we make whether its immediate or in the future  you have control of your own body  which in this case the body in dispute is not the mothers and the child is the one going to be destroyed so its our duty as prolifers to defend it women may die from pregrancies with our advancement in technology the only 2 our of 100000 women die from pregnacies which is a mortality rate of 00002  and thats for women with complicated health issues the average women wont have any problems our arguments hinges on the comparision between  humans inside and outside of the womb and our contention is theres isnt any difference aside from their physical location so to say that people who are prolife dont care about a childs wellbeing when its outside the womb is bs
whats the lgbt doing about this why are they the most hit and vocal about this isnt girl to girl or male to male cant conceive can someone explain thanks
"it doesnt matter if you know the usconstitution  article 4section 2 states clearly 
  the citizens of each state shall be entitled  to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states
 we have equal rightsstates cant make anything illegal that is legal in  the several states 
  several means 3 or more"
third world countryin certain aspects
shame on all of those involved in making this extremely harmful decision for the so called land of the free this quite frankly a disgrace
shouldnt get pregnant in the first place only reason for abortion is if the woman was rapedor if the baby will be so badly deformed the quality of life is heartbreaking
its a shame to see those women cheering for what why do they care so much what other women and people with uterus do with their body why does it affect them go touch some grass
millions of innocent lives will be saved no one should have the right to murder children 50 years of darkness in the usa have ended
ah yes dont trust women to decide for themselves whether they want to or are ready to undergo the extremely difficult period of pregnancy childbirth and take care of a child treat her like shes not an adult and take the decision off her hands then pretend youre doing gods work but not actually care about the kid once its born
many people are not having children until  late 20s early 30s so i have a conspiracy theory that another small reason is to get more people in the workforce to compete against chinas superior work productivity
finally joseph biden the 8 is taking drastic measures to increase the population as he should time to return to our traditional roots
these protesters believe that the supreme court actually makes the lawwhen in fact its your own state makes the lawnow women you have to take responsibility of your own fk up when out there drinking an fkn one night stand dudes
it was never a constitutional right to abort a baby  what you are saying is not true
in america i dont see any difference between lawful sexy life and rapewhat does abortion mean for such society because who will determine weather the case is related to rape or consent anyway abortion is equal to kill unborn kids intentionally during the intercourse the dependant partners must be reverse a little bit when the agg is broken to avoid abortion
"i hate to break it to all of you who are going on about babies and children but  were not talking about babies
over 90 of abortions take place before consciousness awareness ability to feel or experience anything has developed in the fetus
theyre a collection of developing cells that have the potential to become babies but theyre not babies
i suspect those among you who oppose abortion on religious or what you think of as moral grounds do so because you believe in an immortal soul and therefore they are people from the moment of conception
this is a belief not a fact
its not moral to condemn others to a life of misery and poverty simply to appease your own unsubstantiated beliefs
and incidentally to all those crowing if you dont want a baby dont get pregnantsimple  51 of abortions in the us are or were provided to people who had been using contraception when they became pregnant

you all need to realise how simplistic and illinformed are the opinions by which you deem yourself fit to pass judgement and sentence on others
look at your own bible and judge not that ye be not judged and look for the beam in your own eye  but i guess you only pay heed to the words of your supposed saviour when they fit your own preconceptions and prejudices

youre all quite sickening"
this is fear mongering at its best abortion has not been criminalized by the supreme court the supreme court reversed a wrong decision that was taken 50 years ago which was based on a flawed interpretation of the constitution thereby federalizing abortion what it has now done is to place the decision to legalize or ban abortion where it rightfully belongs  in the hands of each states own legislature and you already see the results of that decision  progressive states will legalize abortion and everything will carry on as if nothing has happened more conservative states will ban abortion but at this stage there is nothing that prohibits a women who seeks an abortion to travel to a neighboring state and have her abortion
in god you trust but your killing your own flesh
march for life dont kill the innocent babies 
maybe its time for eu and uk and others to offer us women the right to seek political asylum in countries with abortion rights at least that would send a message to pence and other fundamentalists
well america youre gonna have to introduce id checks for women crossing state lines
hooray for all the troglodyte incest abomination babies who will now be born into a tortured life there are worse things than not being born who the f would want to come here anyway

good day"
you can fool all of the time some of the time some of the people all of the time but never all of the people all of the time  abraham lincoln please stop worshipping henry kissinger who is hosting the next bilderberg meeting when trickle down failed then we can honestly debate this very divisive issue as adults 
search up cern july5th its not good
pro life idjits fail to see the larger picture where ultimately this will make women 2nd grade citizens who from whatever background now has to think twice about having any sexual autonomy a man during a one night stand would do the deed and go away but the woman will have to spend the night hoping the protection didnt fail so many other ways where the law accommodates the man but never the woman just because women have the ability to birth doesnt mean its a duty its not a miracle process thats how  civilisation evolves from a necessity to eventual enlightenment of choice god made all humans capable of that theres absolutely no logic reason or emotions in this decision its a farce and women have to deal with it
the land of freedom huh
the rest of the world should follow this example
commercial sex zones have developed around us bases worldwide many look much the same filled with liquor stores fastfood outlets tattoo parlors bars and clubs and prostitution in one form or another the evidence is just outside the gates in places such as baumholder and kaiserslautern in germany and kadena and kin town on okinawa even during the us wars in afghanistan and iraq there have been multiple reports of brothels and sex trafficking involving us troops and contractors

"for those who disregard history are doomed to repeat it

the following is a rewording of first they came by pastor martin niemoller

first they came for womens rights
and i did not speak out
because i was not a woman

then they came for same sex marriage and intimacy
and i did not speak out
because i was in a hetrosexual marriage

then they came for interracial marriage 
and i did not speak out
because i was not a person  of colour

then they came for the poor
and i did not speak out
because i was not poor

then they came for me
and there was no one left
to speak out for me

your rights are a temporary set of privileges given to you by the government if they are given then they can be taken away 

what is happening in the usa is a direct attack on everyone 

register to vote and ensure your voice is heard"
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you president trump for appointing justices to the supreme court
tragic history is just happened

for someone to say my body my joice is sick that baby inside you is not your body it didnt ask to be there no matter wut the sircumstanse and it certainly not asking to be flushed down a toilet ive herd pro abortion people talking about pregnant women being hit by drunk drivers and screaming for 2 life sentences the hypocrisy is thick n pro abortion is sickkkkkk
21 and terrified stop screwing aroind
"1 contraception does not give 100 protection from getting pregnant
2 as i see it there will be less sex after such law
3 the numbers of lesbians will grow because it is impossible to get pregnant this way
4 the rates of suicides among young pregnant women will grow specially among teenagers
5 abortions still will be done by those who need it same as when alcohol or smoking is forbidden but it will lead to high maternal mortality and complications because not done in official medical center
6 now read carefully they have banned any abortion even pills in many states already including for the underage victims of rape and incest
7 numbers of babies left in orphanages will grow amount of homelesscriminals too  because if kids were not wanted and parents left them who will educate and give loveattention to 900000 babies per year who will feed them give clothes and teach
8 they say that this decision protects life but they refused to pass the law about free contraception or baby food"
thousands of people want to have a right to kill people since they are not yet born is it
"your headline is incorrect  there was never a constitutional right to an abortion  a quick word search through the us constitution will quickly show this  roe v wade used a rather tenuous interpretation of an imputed right to privacy and even more tenuous interpretation of the right to due process in the original ruling  the only reason that it has stood since 1973 is that there have been no scotus challenges which directly addressed roe v wade  there have been cases which addressed the application of the ruling but none which addressed the validity of the ruling itself

do some research and you will find that even the prochoice side admitted this in 1973  there have been many millions of dollars spent to ensure that nothing with the required wording to challenge the original decision never saw the inside of a us district court much less scotus"
same sex marriage should also be abolished
seriously if women die its their risk that they took why not make it safer by legalizing it wth is wrong with you guys
turn abortion clinics to maternal homes
good america is waking up
close this evil killer clinics down
this victory should not end the fight the evil abortionist will keep on fighting so keep on fighting

just shut up american women if u were aborted u would not have a life to abort someone shut up and give life why take life from someone
if women are so damn mad about my body my choice then why are you not mad when a man transitions to a woman who will never understand what being a woman is never having menstrual cycles never giving birth never growing breasts you will never be a woman if youre born a man you will never be a man if youre born a woman say anything you want lol but youll always be what you were made to be confusing
how tf has it effected your community negatively so youd rather have neglected abused abandoned traumatized and fucked up youth my lawd im someone who sees both sides women have that right to a point i knew a woman who had 8 abortions before she had her children didnt care about birth control or any sort of preventing pregnancy thats wrong period however other circumstances i can totally understand so now well be caring for all these kids or their families will and there will be an even bigger strain on government assistance with unwanted babies are all these pro lifers going to help are they going to fund and raise these children will they help when they need counseling and housing and food hell no they wont were struggling as it is cpa in most areas are a joke they cant deal with the high volume they have now what will the future be like this is supposed to be the land of the free but its the land of the how much money you have will gain you the power and voice insanity solidifies and international move in my mind
abortion is killing and women should do abortion just if they have good reason health issue in case of rape who are we to decide whether someone should live or no the fact that we own our body doesnt give us right to decide about someones life if we are already pregnant then we should take responsibility for our actions
the right to have an abortion has never been guaranteed by the us constitution please read the us supreme court justices decisions abortions have been given back to the voters in each state
abortion is not  in the constitution
i cant wait to hear someone say how this will severely affect transgender women
"no sex with menhusbands boyfriend or that app they say till the recent ruling overturned
women will use it as a weapon against non favorable husbands or boyfriends while going out to have sex with another man they will all relay on the natural calendar
men be on the watch our slits are becoming very tricky
men be on the watch"
you all better cut the christian crap about unborn babies  you cant force anyone into giving birth and carrying an unwanted child end of story my body my choice so you shut up

womens body womens rights but after we have a heartbeat then its murder
what ever happened to good old birth control why are people so freaked out that women have to pay for their abortions now also it is paid if there is danger to the mother why are the news not discussing both sides of this subject matter
abortion is illegal in majority of countries around the world execept where the mothers life is threatened
women stop showing your daughters to be like you acting like a w getting pregnant by everybody and then one in abortions burn your tubes burn your insides so you dont get pregnant show your little girls to burn their insides theyre too so they dont get pregnant that way i dont have to be protesting stop sleeping with everybody inbreds
america is nothing more than one giant used car lot  vet

i cannot believe this the fact that the majority of politicians are backed my religious groups and funded by religious backgrounds for pr is discusting  crazy religious losers
my body my choice that is why no vaccine mandates
"yes  usa is going islamic

this abortion crap has nothing to do with womans right its just again who got the bigger  democrats or republicans
violence of abortion white privilege what about women who are raped what about accidents
wtf has someone elses organs have to do with that lady ridiculous
all im saying is the cost to raise children in 2022 is absurd if developed countries want to ban abortion they should at least make policies to make it easier to raise children for example making a social benefit program where daycare is free so the parents can just work and earn money to support their family
ive seen the devastation abortion has brought on our country  what is she talking about i would like to know what devastation shes seen
hard to tell the difference now between the taliban and america neither believes in womens rights the adoption industry is lacking fresh stock to broker adoption was once a billion dollar industry that plotted to make this comeback day care will be targeted next to ensure american women are forced to stay home to care for children they didnt plan for and cant afford or forced to relinquish their new borns to the adoption brokers
the us supreme court did not strike down abortions it did however give each state the ability to decide by the people who live in those states to vote for whether or not you can have an abortion in that state many companies have said that if a women would like to get an abortion and the state does not allow that they would provide access and pay  to help the women get an abortion your headline sucks  stop it
this is not true false flag
right to kill babies thats you are asking use always condoms plz save the babies simple
capitol punishment is murder yet thats alright what i and i jah admire about the gop and maga is their consistency in heretical blasphemous hypocrisy go trump tucson arizona sonoran desert  jah sisters jah rastafari praises tucson arizona sonoran desert 
god bless the scotus
for the upcoming fourth of july in the  which includes any and all of his states and territories i  any and all detonations of fireworks needs to be postponed
"america the country where guns have officially more rights than women


what a shame"
"thanks god this murdering act is finally ending 
a win for life"
this title from the bbc is nothing more than a deceptive lie you still have the right to murder your child in the us what the judges merely stated is the same thing that ruth b ginsburg stated in her own writings and that was that the federal government has no right to dictate and that each state individually can vote on what is allowed and want isnt allowed read the blasted and complete decision written by the judges bbc is full of crap
once a fetus is formed to terminate it is murder except in immediate health cases if women do not want to be pregnant there are condoms
what there saying is legal abortions are no longer available legally but illegal abortions will be on the rise no doubt this will lead to the death of the children as well as the possible death of the mother is there is no excuse abortion should be legal with in the first 2 12 months right now you have abortion group celebrating yet they do not know the horror of what is to come with old style coat hanger abortions it is sad that a 13yearold girl raped by their father should be forced to carry a child and take away any possibilities of college or any advanced schools i can honestly say that guy we see a rise in unexpected infant deathse because of this
like i said in my video that i uploaded yesterday we need new people in the government that werent born during world war 2 because obviously they still think were in the 60s and 70s 
abortion was form by kkk and to control black population per the liberals standard whoever support abortion are racism
the only choice women should have is if my sandwich they make is on either wheat or rye
women are being treated like zoo animals or cattle it is certain that if this corrupt money making approach to banning abortion will cause the usa to suffer a raise of ramped poor mental health for the women who are forced to bare unwanted children and the children who will suffer the shame of being unwanted and or foster care and what come with it this act on the part of the supreme court needs to be walked backed now before this mess get started america is in shock as it is we dont need another mass issue like roe vs wade being overturned if you look closer nothing really good came out of donald trumps administration andl if anyone is thinking about the irs checks trump allowed i am not for sure but believe the fine print for some if not all stated the money had to be paid back loopholes and fine print read it trust in government is out the door
i predict a fracturing of the united states into two countries 1 will be a neoconservative country and 1 will be a social democracy
there was never a constitutional right to abortion in the us and the scotus decision only returns the question to the states where it should have always resided based on the 10th amendment
"are the prolifers carrying guns religious fundamentalist fanatics are usually armed and willing to kill others
france is in the process of making abortion a right in their constitution 
france is a laic state and refuses the control of religious fundamentalism 
interfering with peoples freedom of choice and human rights"
utter madness such a backwards decision bearing in mind this decision has been made in a country like the us which is meant to be at the forefront of advancement its just scary
we truly are progressing backwards
this entire thing seems surreal i am starting to wonder if states rights went too far compared to having a consistent law of the land  will different illegal abortion states make it a crime for a woman to leave their state and travel to another state to have an abortion if some states can shorten the trimester time for abortion can other states lengthen the trimester time
so the supreme court just announced it should no longer exist since it cant be expected to uphold half a centurys worth of precedent and would like to side with religious fascists
women who want abortions make horrible decisions in their lives because they dont think before they acted 
so  if a woman is raped and pregnant  she has to keep and raise the baby   whoever vote for this is extremely selfish and stupid if you wanna be a mom do it dont force others have to antiabortion fk off
"speaking as a short man i was disappointed by this ruling  i want to make my wife get an abortion if it is a daughter 

i dont want some shallow girl who only dates 6ft tall guys"
so much for land of the free pffft
there is no excuse for abortion  it is women committing socalled legal murder here are some simple solutions to avoid pregnancy 1 keep your legs closed 2 use contraception 3 get married first and do things in the correct order a man needs to be consulted before any abortion as it was his seed used to create the baby it is not a womans right suck it up princesses and get off your feminist high horse
portapotti instagram models will now have to be careful that they dont get pregnant by a 12 year old boy or his 90 year old grandfather in dubai take lots of contraceptives and dont forget to take them ha ha
let me get this right you cant terminate a foetus now but can gun down kids in a school america is fcuked
"god is so happy with this ruling749 
why would u murder that innocent unborn baby"
why dont the bbc show us how the aborted baby looks after the abortion just so people have a good image in their minds of what abortion actually does to the baby
as a non religious person i cannot understand how religious people accept 1000 year old beliefs and have it so engrained in their core
what does the government gain from doing this more kids in foster care satisfaction from a few people
i find ironic what the gop christian conservatives did to undocumented children at the border and yet in the same breath say that the life of an undocumented unborn child is more important than abortion rights of a us citizen truth is this is about religious fascism we the people shouldnt have to be forced to conform to christian idealism
i understand that most prolifers are christian but what i dont understand is how these same christians most likely never even considered fostering childrensomething they will have to answer to god on judgement day the whole reason theyre so adamant about abortion is because it makes them feel godly empowered yall prochoicers have to start guilttripping the christians into opening their homes to foster childrenisnt there a verse that talks about how many will be thrown to hell for not doing things like feeding the homeless taking care of the parentless etc
"its none of my business as a christian what unrighteous persons do
its unchristian to interfere with others"
"i agree with life first but not by religious involvement in politics
all religions involved will be destroyed soon amen you should believe that fact"
"religious interference in politics did this unbiblical action
jesus commanded his true followers to keep without spot from the world not to get involved in it in any way"
amazing how every lefty has some extreme account to give in an effort to show that abortion is good for women if every case was as the lefties say they are then surely the issue you need to address is abuse on women but in your lefty mind the problem is solved by ruthlessly destroying the the one party involved who is the most innocent of all  joe biden judgement day is coming every doctor making a living of this  judgement day is coming  to all you pro abortionists you say you will never stop fighting i want you to know that my brothers and i have the armour of god on and we will never stop fighting evil  the battle belongs to the lord and he said the righteous will inherit the land  come bring your fight god will have the glory and it will be in your faces continuously
any monster that could cruely and violently serial kill their own children has serious and extreme mental issues
hmmmmis it just meor are the anti abortion women a bit uglyand the pro women pretty and i would love to know what the ugly woman meant when she said abortion has been reeking havoc on communities surly its unwanted children that are generally more problematic just my opinion but surly only one person has the right to decidethe woman who is pregnantnot a bunch of protesters who have no idea of each individual circumstance
just wondering isnt there a 3month time period i just generally want to know why would someone not get an abortion before that time if you dont want to have a baby i might be wrong though
americans seem to have some pretty warped ideals on the one hand theyve outlawed abortion in thrall to those self righteous holier than thou types who believe that the moment of conception means life and its sanctity thereof even though its not a sentient being and being no more than a collection of cells would never be capable of existing outside the womb conversely  and some may say perversely  we have the thorny question of gun control it seems the high and mighty can plead the so called barbarity of abortion but bringing in rigid gun controls is apparently impossible and so every few weeks more and more innocent people will be going about their daily routine completely unaware that theyre not going to see another day because some individual found it way too easy to accumulate a raft of guns and ammo and had got a grievance americans really need to reassess their priorities
if these people believe so strongly that they dont want to get pregnant why not get sterilised instead that way they can sleep about as much as they wont and not need to ever have an abortion
"wow the us is going so backwards its becoming 4th world country it already has no decent healthcare or has one that kills its people and now this in 2022
this is literally back to middle ages because the bible said so disgusting
how can someone be so evil to want this much to take away basic choice from another you leave your life the way you want but to watch to take away this medical right from another its plain evil and ignorant backwards primitive i have no words "
those women in the rally wants to kill their own babies
right so lets kill kids since ther lives will b shit christ u talk about a dead end job so many ppl frm around the world risk everythi ng to escape into america u rt out of touch daniel
"i think it is extraordinary that it was legal to kill an innocent baby for the convenience of the mother

the babys body and soul belong to the baby
the rights of the mother do not extend to it

banning abortion is a revolutionary decision
i am very happy to see that no more helpless babies will be deprived of life
i am very pleased
god bless all babies"
society is nutz 2 weeks ago no one knew what defines a woman
theres going to be a lot of feral kids running around the streets in america in the coming years
well abortion is always illegal in my country
"i literally have a video from my local news of the catholic church telling the news in an interview that they have spent a lot of money and time on this and wont stop until they achieve itnot all christian people are bad by no means but this is why at the least in america christianity is becoming more and more hated and why there are less and less christians
our government is supposed to leave religious beliefs out of decisions because we are not just a christian nation we have freedom of religion but yet everyone trying to pass this have been doing so based on their religious beliefs have your christian beliefs by all means but dont force everyone else to live by christian rules regardless of their religion
they will still happen as they did for thousands of years you only cause more problems with this law and the facts these dont account for rapes andor abusive relationships that the other person may not safely have an abortion within that window of time if at all its absolutely absurd i know if i was a woman and i was raped and became pregnant i will find whatever way possible to abort that child till the day of birth imagine having to live and look after a child from someone who did that to you especially with features that person had fuck that that would be hell on earth right there a very miserable time that doesnt go away"
the baby is chopped up like a chicken so happy with this ruling
dear bbc  there never was a constitutional right to abortion in the usa  you can read the us constitution all you want but the word abortion is not there
"doesnt anybody realise that this is not just about abortion 
this is about taking away the privacy of a woman 
it a woman is pregnant or not is nobodys business but the womans herself 
now if a woman wants to travel states in the us she will have to take a pregnancy test first 
this is outright crazy "
i havent seen one good looking anti abortionist so of course they dont care no one would dare to get them pregnant
its not the fact that the justices were prolife its the fact that the justices were upholding our constitution something the other three and liberal activists failed to ever do
first of all abortion is not outlawed it just goes back to the states and there will always be abortion in united states sorry to say your rhetoric is disgusting as our president or should i say our illegitimate president
what it means in practice is that individual states make their own mind up about it and the government lets them dont see a problem with that i do believe there are cases where abortion should be allowed but with strict time restrictions thats my opinion
my body my choice  except for masks  lol
scotus shot down a ruling not a right yesterday returning it to the states where it should have gone in 73 what dems are pissed about is rulings from judges are no longer considered  law pass a law on abortion no one ever voted on roe v wade and abortion is not in the constitution oh no   babies might live
the inmates are truly taking over the asylum
"religion won over rights

fatty girls whom nobody gives a lot are happy"
even catholic ireland is easing up on abortions in certain cases whats wrong with the us they bemoan the likes china but i see no difference
i am so happy it was overturned  every child should have the right to live
i agree with libs on one thing  i believe they should not have kids either 
looks like margaret atwoods gilead is not far away i thought america was a free country
well that is perfect go americans get children nobody wants and then they can buy guns and kill other children and the history showed how great it works when abortions are not allowed so stupid
you people that call evil good and good evil preserving the ultimate innocence which is a pure unborn life should be the number one priority for every living female its an absolute shame and tragedy that it has to be the government that teaches  people a basic instinct such as this
if you believe in god and religion thats your business dont do an abortion but dont force your beliefs on others
people need to understand there is a difference between having an abortion because it is inconvenient and having an abortion because the women will die 
for all those that support abortion  your parents should of had one
you take your seat instructions for joey biden  alleged leader of the free world  lol
50 years of a progressive supreme court has ended i never thought id see this day god bless america
"joe biden is far from the tenet of christianityhe is an antichrist joe biden is a disgrace to christianity and all of you who profess to be christians but support the killing of children because of their size location and dependencegod will judge and condemn you all to hell for these acts of violence against helpless babies 

the blood of these babies will cry after you foreverexcept you repent and get right with god

the psalmist said it was god who joined his bones together in his mothers womb psalms 1391319

psalms 1391319
13for you formed my inward parts you wove me in my mothers womb
14i will give thanks to you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful are your works and my soul knows it very well
15my frame was not hidden from you when i was made in secret and skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth
16your eyes have seen my unformed substance and in your book were all written the days that were ordained for me when as yet there was not one of them
17how precious also are your thoughts to me o god how vast is the sum of them
18if i should count them they would outnumber the sand when i awake i am still with you
19o that you would slay the wicked o god depart from me therefore men of bloodshed

5before i formed you in the womb i knew you and before you were born i consecrated you i have appointed you a prophet to the nations"
theyll just make it illegal without the finantial assistance to the mothers because in reality they dont care about the mothers they just want their world view shoved down our throats
glory to god in the highestthe best news in the media today 
they fully well know having sex unprotected may cause pregnancy need a law now to prosecute fathers who impregnate women and do not support their offsprings
control  power and greed  roe versus wade and its impact upon republicans and democratic  young women  ted cruz  greg abbott  mitch mcconnell  christian evangelicals etc
use condom no need for abortion
the blood of 60 million murdered american babies has been heard by the holy spirit
pro life in the womb but not in a classroom
as an american we no longer cant say anything about human rights since what the supreme court did stripping womens constitutional right  to privacy write to her own body and so on and until we fix that
having an abortion should not be a crime but a right because there can be a lot of variables  leading to it such as rape incest or unwanted pregnancies due to lack of sexual education or it could be a financial burden if you are struggling to survive there is also genetic malformation or in rare cases such as ectopic pregnancies death of the mother will take place if the pregnancy is not terminated i dont believe is a decision that will ever be easy due to moral emotional or religious beliefs but the choice should not be criminalized whether to do it or not should be a personal choice since it is the female individual that will have to carry and deliver the child and later on raise it or decide to have the infant go into an already overwhelmed and broken system
i live in georgia and i was adopted and i wish id never been born my parents were physically and mentally abusive mainly mentally we moved around so much i never got to leave roots anywhere and i am also physically disabled now being forced to live in a disability system that forces disabled people to live in poverty i am the living proof that socalled pro life people are in fact not pro life they are only forced birth because if they were truly prolife they wouldve liked politicians to take things like foster care adoption disability and other social services extremely seriously and would fund them with whatever they needed and with whatever they could instead they routinely elect politicians primarily republicans who routinely try to restrict these programs and rights on a regular basis lindsey graham most recently and famously came out in an interview admitting such at least if someone claims to be pro life and yet is a democrat i can somewhat believe them to disagree with them because at least they actually support all the policies that actually make life worth living for millions of people
when is rishi sunak going to repay that 6 trillion debt is my question 
what a crazy shit show of a country america is becomingit is like a reality series for the world to watch
bruh no one gonna talk about the furry lmao
there is morning after pill  you can take up too 3 or 7 days after not to get pregnant im not happy with abortion after 12 weeks and 18  24 weeks to late its a  baby 
this is so sick i feel so sorry for the people affected
let them protesters rally on these scutos residence daily  disrupt their priveleged status
proof that the us is a country full of whores who cant keep their legs shut
everyone in the comments like its scary we dont get to kill babies anymore
"abortion is never an easy choice but sometimes it can save life brave women stay strong in fighting for your rights 

edit i got a lot of hate from people who say foster care is good answer 
 there are 400 000 children in foster care 26 000 age out each year and are instantly homeless 
 most who age out have disability
 children in foster care sre 4x more likely to get saed 
 more than half of child sex trafficking victims recovered were from foster caregroup homes 
 40 of foster care kids reported abuse or neglect

do you still think foster care is better do you want more babies put in that hell becouse of new system"
the land of the free
not cute for semifascist bbc to give so much preference to pro lifers
"the unborn has righttolife at the pointofconception  said rep kevin mccarthy aspiring speakerofthehouse inwaiting

justice thomas of the supremes wrote the opinion to fulfill that belief by overturning a previous ruling over fortyyears old in an unprecedented legal retrogression
to give statesrights primacy over matters of whether a womans right to selfdetermination regarding her pregnancy is trumped by a zygotes legalright

the ruling is riddled with selfcontradiction  the premise is life begins at the pointofconception

those same ideological corners in states ruled by such sweeping fundamentalism are the same entities which often deny the righttolife  to those already born

this conceptoflife is rudely terminated at birth  

it denies the mother that right even if continued pregnancy carries the risk of harm to her survival or even to the fetus if carried to term while undergoing say chemotherapy  such decisions of life and death are best left to the patient and her medical provider  decisions of health made on evidencebased science  not on extreme ideology

another glaring contradiction is this concept of righttolife is denied at the gatesofthepenitentiary to those on deathrow

it is even denied at the gatesofelementaryschool to little children the alreadyborn barely growing out of the babyfat gained at birth   their righttolife is trumped by the righttobeararms


why stop there  actually we dont  those ideologues are the same ones who think nothing of supporting neoliberal foreignpolicy which insist on bellicose adventures by shipping overseas 50 billiondollars worth of weaponry to fight a proxywarofchoice   weapons some of which 

   end up in the hands of massshooters who had legally purchased such highpowered weaponsofwar to deny the righttolife for littlechildren alreadyborn"
" abortion stats 
from the abort73 and guttmacher institute  websites that are dedicated to womens right to abortions

 ages of women getting abortions
young girls  19  87
2039  87
40  37
 the narrative of young women making mistakes is used to cover up grown women who are using poor  management and getting pregnant

 reasons they got abortions 
sexual assaults and health problems accounted for less than 4
4 interfere with education 
7 not mature to be a parent 
8 dont want to be a single mom
19 done with having kids
23 cant afford a baby 
25 not ready 
6 other
 so the narrative of victimhood and health risks are bs to cover up that grown women have unprotected sex they dont want to be inconvenienced by a child they need american tax dollars to bail them out

 im cool with that if the fathers have the right to financially option out of parenthood women forced fatherhood on millions of men if women can delete a baby then fathers should be able to peacefully walk away that some equality i can vote for"
religion is crippling america
what are your british laws on abortion
"telling it the way it is like it or not i dont care

heres what my position on abortion was i didnt care ive always thought a woman should have the right to have a child or not her body her choice and all that

but then something changed i heard about a case out of mississippi that was trying to put limits on when an abortion could take place not if only when they didnt want to ban abortion in fact at the time federal law wouldnt have allowed them to do that they just wanted to have a say on at what point its a person that needs protections well the abortionists didnt want any restrictions on when an abortion could occur and that is where they fucked up because most americans arent willing to go that far 

in my naive beliefs on abortion i thought it was something that was being done when it was just a blob of cells in a petri dish something that didnt even resemble a human especially not a little human being that could even feel pain a person 

so once i found out that was the case i decided to investigate further and i found out there are people and states that have no problem with aborting all the way up to full term babies and thats a bridge too far in most americans opinions so yes now it will be an each individual state decision most people dont want to live under california or new york laws thats why they dont live there

i predict the next big supreme court fight will be when does that baby have constitutionally protected rights like life liberty and the pursuit of happiness at what point is he or she a human being deserving of mercy and a chance to live their life at what point does the unborn baby become the injured party and not the mother these are all questions that will need to be answered in the highest court in the land this time around they will have a whole lot of science to help figure that question out unlike the 1970s

just sayin"
nowhere in our constitution is the word abortion or any deritive of it mentioned so they did not lose any rights your whole lead in is a lie
joe biden correct in 2006 i do not view abortion as a choice and a right i think its always a tragedy and i think that it should be rare and safe and i think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions and there ought to be able to have a common ground and consensus as to do that
as indian we are deeply concerned about human rights conditions in us
abortions are still going to be performed the states will decide for themselves what they want for me life begins when new dna is formed that is when the sperm fertilizes the egg i am grateful for the outcome and the blessings that will follow this decision
about time 
bunch of idiots
americans are mad how can killing the unborn baby even be something to debate over 
"oppose the us supreme court ruling on abortion rights
the court on june 24 2022 ended the right to abortion in a seismic ruling that shreds half a century of constitutional protection in a significant curtailment of womens rights the us supreme court overturned roe v wade a 1973 landmark decision giving women in america the right to have an abortion before the foetus is viable outside the womb  before the 2428 week mark 

the ruling sent shock waves sparking protests abortion rights  which have been available to women for over two generations  will now be determined by individual states

also overturned on friday was planned parenthood v casey a 1992 case that upheld roe the conservative justices are picks of donald trump who had said he would appoint justices who are pro life opposing abortions

 with sorrow  for this court but more for the many millions of american women who have lost a fundamental constitutional protection  we dissent wrote liberal justices adding that the decision breaches a core ruleoflaw principle designed to promote constancy in the law

in doing all of that it places in jeopardy other rights from contraception to samesex intimacy and marriage and finally it undermines the courts legitimacy liberal justices wrote

we the rights activists are concerned that there could be a domino effect on these other rights

us women have lost the fundamental right to make informed decisions about their own bodies

before roe was made law of the land there was a time when women risked losing their lives getting illegal abortions a time when government denied women control over their reproductive functions forced them to move forward with pregnancies they didnt want and then abandoned them once their babies were born

this horrifying decision will have devastating consequences and it must be a wake up call especially to the young people who will bear its burden

the court has a strong conservative bent which is based on a 63 majority was evident this week fridays decision comes a day after the supreme court rolled back restrictions in new york state on who may carry concealed guns in public

the decision is a tragic error and a sad day for the court and the countrythe court has done what it has never done before expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many americans roe had protected a womans right to choose her right to make intensely personal decisions with her doctor free from the interference of politics said democratic us president joe biden

all are requested to oppose and react peacefully on the rulings on abortion rights and gun culture the right to privacy liberty equality personal freedoms should be protected"
im pro life and against abortion its inhumane and murder the fetus feels pain when the act of abortion is conducted cause nerves are one of the first things our bodies form its a mystery whether the fetus feels pain before or after 13 weeks but its not responsible to take chances based on curiosity

america is breaking apart american have gradually become immoral society with deeply imbibed sexgundrug culture social and even family fabric had broken long ago worst is yet to come and that is civil war based on religous ethnicity
in the uk there are 200000 abortions every year to put that in perspective in the six years of wwii 250000 british and empire troops lost their lives
no doctor your termination of each innocent life is the greatest crime against humanity all these women should receive help and support throughout their pregnancy
its a cycle the gov depends on and the right is being used like puppets to push that agenda the gov depend on uneducated low class humans to fill the prisons and the foster system is the main supplier yay prolife way to take rights away from women why not look into the actual problem males can run around impregnating as many females he can get into so its time to start snipping the problem
american prochoice lawyers gather in groups produce ideas how to cancel or bypass this at any level
the right to privacy in reproductive services is what roe was ultimately decided on  theres nothing in our constitution about women or reproductive rights religious organizations fought roe because for many their annual budget relied on adoption fees  newborns are in the highest demand for centuries churches sought unwed pregnant women to gain access to newborn to sell or adopt for a fee  the only care about children from gestation to delivery thats because they want newborns to fuel their religious organizations
feminist want abortion because she want funny sex
abortion is murder and abortion is illegal
"abortion is womans right okay you have your right 

what about the baby inside your womb did heshe  told you to abort himher baby should have right too right 

you see this abortion thing is easy to be settle it comes with your decision at first why you go and have sex at the first place what is the reason there you have it thats the jackpot and legitimate question why you had sex at the first place for fun for what  

now i know some of these women are a victim of crime such as raped victim or poor living condition that lead to early sex what else brother and sister doing sex do stupid things and so forth i understand about all of this victims situation and for this reason as well i dont encourage them to have an abortion at the first place no absolutely not go to the doctors or report your case to the nearest police station for next action taken 

as for parents they have the responsibility to teach their children from an early age about sex and what is right about it and what is wrong 

the churches and other religious believe need to teach their believers the right and wrong about abortion and having sex 

for the law increase the  punishment for those who raped so that people know that raped is a very serious crime and can lead to heavier punishment by law 

lastly sex is a gift from god and we should use it in the right way the same thing with baby it is the gift from god god is the only one who have the absolute right whether to take life or not 

for female you could learned martial arts too you know to protect yourself you never know what will happened to you when you walk by yourself at night carry weapon too just for protection"
abortion is illegal abortion is only for critical condition

the latin word for  medicine medicina it means the art of healing or means of healing from medicines relating to healing from medeor or medicor to heal or cure all actions of the medical profession belong in the arena of healing and prevention of disease or illness from natural or unnatural causes abortion is not medical treatment to preserve life or to prevent its decline therefor it cannot be place in any category of medical treatment it has nothing to do with a denial of a persons rights no one has the right to demand through law a person to take take an action against them that is causing harm and the killing of living cells and life form within the body of a person harming the women and the women in agreement to harming a living life is the real criminal act here the courts have no right to redefine medical treatment as a right to not save life but to destroy it a women may think and feel anything she wishes but she cannot force others to agree with her and demand them to pay for destructive actions against her and the unborn there is a distinct difference between medicine preserving life and curing people from disease then using the platform of medicine to destroy

"pro lifers can lie all they want they only care about their agendapro birth not pro life being pro life will harm more women who will still seek out abortion regardless

let life occur naturallylife should not be forced and forced life will sow you plenty of bad karma one human absolutely should not have a say how another lives their life"
how about right to life upheld by supreme court bbc
the decision by the supreme court was done to correct the actual original decision done by the court regarding the issue under debate abortion it is the original decision made by the court that was incorrect and unconstitutional  the ruling that has now been corrected has no effect on the issue of abortion itself  the issue could have been about anything not just abortion   the decision has now been corrected and allows for all voices of the people to be heard on the issue under debate abortion  as opposed to only one side which is what happened as a result of the original incorrect decision made by the court
to the american women girls nonbinaries and people with uterus i am extremely sorry to see this become future for you stay strong in these dark times
abortion is not a constitutional issue
maybe now instead of teaching children about gender and pronouns in school they will teach them that life is precious and that there is birth control  so if they can tell young children to take puberty blockers they can get young girls sterilettes or free birth control pills and teach boys about wearing condoms and responsibility towards their partners
its a states rights issue  the great thing about america is that if you dont like how a state is run you can move whereas the british government constantly shits on their citizens rights and doesnt give a fuck because you cant do anything about it
those antiabortionists are basically trying to bring more people into this overpopulated overpolluted and resourcescarce world that was plagued by covid19 and lockdowns war terrorism  and having extremely harsh natural disasters brought on by global warming and climate change its like we dont have enough people to see how ridiculously depressing this world is
i know my comment maybe a bit harsh but this may deter young women of the younger generation to think long and hard about pregnancy and that they cant just throw away an unborn life if they have second thoughts so people need to stop whinging and start thinking thats what the grey matter is the for
the world continues to laugh at us
"how to piss off a lib shyt

"where is america going 
does americans want to show how  conservative they are"
jus mentioning this ruling doesnt make abortiom illegal it just gives the power of this descision back to individual states and legislatures the sc descision just said that abortion isnt a constitutional right now its up to the people in the states to elect those who will pass legislate that they want
that is one of the most brutal decisions to aid abortion and this rubbish country will talk about human rights with there rubbish women
wowits amazing to watch a country experiencing a slow burn demise just another nail in americas coffin antidemocractic minority rule will see america go up in flames 
"the unborn are fully human

the most significant debate is about when life begins is the unborn child fully human or tissue it cannot be both when does human existence begin science says that at nineteen days a heart starts to beat and at forty days the heart output is almost twenty percent of an adult

in gods eyes an unborn child is entirely a human being scripture also contends life begins before birth and refers to the unborn and born interchangeably one is as fully human as the other for example god reassures jeremiah the prophet of his importance by showing him he was known before he was born god knew him as fully human before his birth before i formed you in the womb i knew you before you were born i set you apart i appointed you as a prophet to the nations jeremiah 15

king david wrote about how god knew him fully before he was born for you created my inmost being you knit me together in my mothers womb your eyes saw my unformed body all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be psalm 13913 16

when luke writes about elizabeth and mary greeting each other he speaks of the unborn john the baptist as a baby when elizabeth heard marys greeting the baby leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit luke 141

to end life through abortion divides life into the unborn and born and we learn through scripture this opposes gods view of both being equally human"
"a lot of unwanted children are going to be fucked up good job 

america is such a shitshow

luckily you can just punch a pregnant woman in the stomach and get rid of it that way"
wtf is this abortions nowadays becamr like going to have a tea you need to educate your children this is not a way of protection there are some cases where it is  needed but to have abortion just because you dont care it is stupid
no no right to abortion was struck down the federal government via the court has handed the right to access this medical procedure back to the individual states the federal government can no longer force individual states to perform abortion procedures in any state were abortion is legal  then abortion is still legal only in states that have outlawed abortion as of the time of this ruling is it now illegal the bbc cant even do journalism
the right to an abortion was not struck down its easier to get an abortion in the us than uk
"wonderful day 
god is 
great"
abortion is murder and all of you supporting it are forgetting that thats an innocent child there is no difference between a child in the womb and outside the womb saying that theyre going to have a hard life means you are saying people who are poor and endure adversity have less valuable lives and would be better off not existing if you dont want to have a baby then be more careful or dont have sex if a life gets created its no longer your choice and you dont get to kill a child because its inconvenient to you
"abortion is murder yet a necessary evil
it is primarily liberals who get abortions it goes with the mentality abortion keeps democrats from breeding more democrats and thats a good thing
20 million black babies aborted 
30 million white liberal babies aborted thats 50 million fewer democrat voters praise jesus"
the power of the sc
another proof of usa not being a democracy
ive never felt so fortunate for not being an american seriouslyim so scared for the women who are going through this witnessing their rights being snatched away from them stay strong
stop gbv now
thats cruelty  dont kill what you cant create  its by divinity that a child is formed 
america is now not the land of the free  it has turned into a fascist state for 22 states
nobody has the right to tell another person what to do with their own body when it doesnt affect them personally full stop
arguments for justification give  me the right to take any action
"my mother got pregnant years ago despite her iud it caused a very complicated pregnancy that put her life on jeopardy and she had to have an abortion to save her life 

my childhood friends dad left her mom got interned into a psych ward soon after she worked like a beast to get the best grades and crumbled when she discovered that she got pregnant she could barely afford rent with the help of her boyfriend and had no family to help i cant even fathom what kind of life shed have if she didnt have an abortion  

ive been severely depressed and anxious for as long as i can remember at times i couldnt even function normally without meds i do my best but im still very mentally unstable if i ever got pregnant and was forced to give birth it would be a disaster with the emotional and physical turmoil that comes with pregnancy it would be a miracle if i make it to the delivery without attempting to end my life"
the biden presidency has been a complete and utter abortion
50 years of western moral decay
stop talking about died woman  lets talk how many children had been killed by abortion  billions
demons demonic world orders un wef who govts mainstream media all are built  run by the biggest liars hypocrites fakes evils psychopaths inhumans all have sacrificed their souls for satan and satanism they can do anything against humanity only the most ignorant people believe in such kind of demons
"we now live in a world where 
psychopathic politicians  governments destroy freedom  humanity
psychopathic doctors destroy health
psychopathic lawyers  the judiciary destroy justice
psychopathic education systems  universities destroy knowledge

abortion is not a constitutional right if you think that then you have never read the constitution
i studied the constitutionno right to abortionwomen can still get an abortionits a state thingyou are passing propaganda like you are in chinagood we are smart enough to understand shame on you
rationality prevails
god is in control  of his people no more abortion no more and no more  my ex told me to abort my last boy i refused  my boy now is 6 years old boy going to year 2 school class women sex is not a fun sex is responsibility and sacred and when it come to abortion  it is life destroyer if it come from rape or sickness ask god to give you grace to carry it you will not believe  what child would be and might be a glorious child that give you that joy  you will never expected stay save women
"now you know why every president will stack the scotus with judges of their choice 
hahahahahahahahaha"
"and it has nothing to do with the fact that the majority of the scotus are conservatives 
hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
us gives too much power to those unelected judges "
"us will get dumber even more as more children with 47 chromosomes are born 
more marriages will be wrecked as a result "
the scotus ruling striking down _roe v wade_ simply causes this scenario to revert to what it was prior to january 1973 i remember in those days if a woman lived in a state that didnt allow abortions she simply went to another state where it was legal and had the medical procedure done there again this procedure is not banned in all 50 states as the result of this scotus opinion
why does abortion exist so many reasons to have one but what about thinking about not getting into that situation in the first place why not try to not get pregnant that goes for men and women there is always a medical exception and should be allowed but also i think its time for men to prtest that it is not fair that they have no say  especially if they want to give up their rights and financial obligation when a women decides to not get an abortion when the father wants her to have one he is forced into child support in the times we live in where is the equality
"it doesnt matter just go to california or the blue states for abortion if the red states ban it
and trust me most of us men dont want to be father as we will only get divorce raped by alimony and child support

so in a nutshell all this facade is to just hide the inflation caused by the government"
abstain or wear condoms
this will lead to more suicides more women trapped in violent relationships and more deaths from backyard coathanger abortions
this is why you never let christians into government archaic thinking christians are clueless
we really screwed the pooch on this one dead liberals are good liberals
i care for the unborn baby im a prolife
abortion is outlawed because capitalism needs more future consumers and tax payers
a 63 vote wtf why is it a bunch of saggy white supremacist men that get to decide instead of the public
"arkansas says your dad might be the father of your baby  or billy bob next door raped you  but your having the baby regardless    

wow  dont think thats  gonna work out too well  with women not reporting the rape and hoping the bus to a jurisdiction that allows  the procedure"
youre 21 and terrified abt abortions being illegal but not thinking abt the fact you are anticipating abortions due to your negligence you stupid fk
this is very good news for live
glad to see these child murderers mad and upset lol
watch how abortion is done  killing a baby is not a constitutional right genocides
its their rights to access the abortion
"lets be honest how many little angels are getting killed from abortion or brought to this hell without capable parents 

1 drunk womenmen not thinking consequences

2 idiotic 1725  years old people who dont really care  about anything and just do their
 thing

3 women who may keep the child for  for taking money from their partner

ofc rapes  healthy couples that got an accident etc are excluded

i am not against this new law but i dont support it too"
i must say that any woman who voted for trump had this coming
at one time abortions were also banned in the ussr this only led to an increase in criminal abortions from which womens health suffered
yea these supreme court justices just bite off way more than they can chew you know in 48 hours all 6 had their addressees dox all over the internet everyone hates them  i am just going sit back and watch them learn a hard lesson  what happens when you are dishonest liars you told us roe was decide law in your confirmation hearings you think you can lie to the american people and get away with it  good luck clowns
i hope everyone pro life and fighting the abortion rights plans on adopting as many kids as they can
no where in the us constitution is there a right to an abortion period no where try reading it and maybe youll gain some knowledge
maybe there will be alot of adoptions going forward
everyone hates that law but i think no one should to allowed to kill another human just because theyre uncomfortable with them if that was the case every maths teacher that i ever come across would be dead and my life would be really easy
dont worry lefty females  you will still be able to kill your unborn baby  just wonderingwhen you do thatdo you hold a kill party  do all of your lefty friends come and rejoice with youlike self appointed heros  by the way just wondering againdo you support animal cruelty or are you against it because it so horrible to harm those poor creations of god   please let me know  i would really like to understand what seems to be so very ununderstandable  bet you wont  hope you do
i am one of the millions who are delighted that the supreme court of the united states of america overturned roe v wade  now those lefty women will need to dig into their own wallet to remove a baby from their lefty wombs  when i hear them snivel about itit makes me think about what they are mad aboutand come to the conclusioneven they dont knowor why  thank you president trump for your part in thisnaming three conservatives to the supreme court of the united states of america
they want to protect a fetus from an abortion but wont go as far to protect a child in school from getting gunned down
america is gone
this isnt prolife  this is probirth
republicans will keep pushing toward their version of sharia law  unless they are voted out of office in large numbers good people will vote as often as possible to get these gop handmaid tale masters out of office
ahh yes sexist homophobic racist and most of them having sa allegations should determine the rights of womans body
yay peoples beliefs get to control a major medical procedure for women and young girls hooray giving birth is a major medical procedure and no one can do it for her
republicans liked a handmaids tale so much they are doing their best to make it a reality in america
"i dont have a dog in this fight and therefore no real opinion in either direction

but to me this definitely sounds like a decision that only creates more issues than they think they are solving"
now i like trump and will unfollow the obamas
finally this law thanks god
im 21 andim terrfied dont be instead educate yourself to safe sex
about time  and by the way abortion isnt mentioned in the us constitution  that is why it was overturned
god lbess all pro life warrioirs
now killing babies is called the procedure  i wonder if the nazie called their procedure
abortion is neither a right nor healthcare  its murder  it states clearly the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  no mention of abortion  sorry nice try  and since when is murder considered healthcare  thats right  never  ive pondered many medical journals and laws scrubbed the internet up one side and down the other  no mention of murder being healthcare  what i have in fact found is murder is illegal and healthcare is to preserve life
abortion ban what about the human rights usa is the self appointed contractor of world human rights        doing injustice with their own people regarding the abortion ban  see their hypocrisy
"in 1973 seven white male judges took it upon themselves to force their view of a highly divisive political issue on the entire nation  

today 4 white males a black male and a white women finally overturned the 1973 decision and allowed this contested issue to be legislated democratically and ultimately by the people

no matter what side youre on it is a great day for america for our constitution and for our democratic republic  a great day for women the unborn and human rights"
"for my britisheuropean friends who are being duped into believing that this is a step backwards by the fear pornographers the media all this ruling does is return the issue to the states its what we call federalism abortion is no longer in the federal purview where it didnt belong in the first place

you may be surprised to learn that some states like california or new york  will probably make abortions even easier to get then during roe

this is all the lefts fault btw  as part of their asinine woke revolution they tried to make any abortion for any reason early trimester late term the day before birth legal and they demanded that those abortions be taxpayer funded its all related to their idiotic premise that gender is oppressive and women er excuse me birthing people are being oppressed by this tyrannical fetus that they dont want freeloading inside of them and making them be responsible  oh the humanity

and right on cue enter donald trump"
this is great news for wire coat hanger companies
they do realise theres a thing called birth control yeh
"as trump inadvertently has one by one
taken our freedoms
away

little boys and girls walk to their new day gas chambers called schools
do safety drills that are ineffectivein class rooms which become make shift slaughter houses

we cant abort knowing his mum should have 
next  condoms
then metal coat hangers

no wall needed here
the us is involved in a civil war we the people vs american homegrown terrorists  trump has served his purpose and shown the whole world what greed fear and hate can accomplish

merica at present 
not so free
not so great"
"us one of the country where they have sex the most thats why that matters so much folks just wear condoms duuuh  you need to grow up and take responsibilities be accountable for your stupid decision when copulating 
though cant avoid to say that this has also a huge positive impact to the usa economy in the next decades to come to maintain the country you need youngs paying elders pension importing young people from abroad its not a good deal indeed when applying for a work visa if you see statistics the majority are over 40 with a family theyll work in us and go back to their country work visa only for seniors with lot of experience cos gov dont want to spend money training them so you need young work force that the gov dont want to bring from abroad so you gotta do the work and toss out children 
hope that the law has some kind of twist for women raped 

go usa "
there should be grief counseling for people thinking about killing their child they should also be told what actually happens to the baby and how corporations profit from the little body if women die from abortion then they die are they not committing murder on the innocent our future these pro abortion people should have been aborted
and yet thinking before having sex with everyone is a solution not an abortion
they are angry because pookie got regulated
its the beginning of a wonderful era of finding newborn babies in the dumpsters 
okay i dont care about either of these topics but dang it i will have to voice my opinion if i get asked which i will be judged for it then all the marches and protest will cause problems i mean we already dealing with transgenders in sports causing problems and also this very long gender lgbtq too long to name cant we just stick to one problem then start another on
to be fair there arent many women in these videos with any chance of finding a man that would get them pregnant  abortion isnt a worry they really have
it is a great news god bless america
jesus is the only way into heaven ask him into your life cleanse you from all unrighteousness make him your lord  your savior one day you will enter the kingdom of heaven amen
so this means if a woman gets raped and gets pregnant they have to have the child how the fuck is anyone suppose to cope with that what a stupid system
stop having sex with men  even better no marriage no children no dating  learn from the south korean womens 4b now 6b4t movement  sk decriminalized abortion in 2021 after a nearly 70year ban
thank god 
abortion is the killing of a living human i get tired of white people complaining about stopping abortion so black women seek abortion 5 times that of white women so if you think of that maybe they are racist and upset that now there will be more babies born that arent white
millions of baby killing murders just got pissed off one would expect violence to follow stay safe yall
"this is coming from the same group that refuses paid parental leave universal single payer healthcare living wages affordable childcare universal pre k affordable quality education and higher education affordable secure housing etc

they want a vulnerable and desperate labor force they want more people to work dead end jobs with poverty wages and no benefits because theyre desperate"
take all of that marching and protesting energy to the polls this fall  and vote all of those right wing slugs out of power this is what you get when you vote for those with an r beside their name
the judicial branch within the us should be independent neither republican nor democrat  the laws should not be based upon political agenda  i truly want to see more gun control but its hopeless because the majority of the supreme court judges are republicans
its about time the us makes these like sleezeballs accountable for their responsibilities hopefully theyll abort themselves now
"at least theyre not taking away your guns though right america the land of the free

sure looks that way"
"stay out of sex holes 
these people now know what  women or woman is  nonsense  people  wokeness  wokeness no difference between  a man and woman a man can become a woman a woman can become a man sick lunatics"
bearing arms is a right  killing babies isnt in the constitution
finally these babies have rights thank you jesus  we have to many contaceptions today to accidentally get pregnant  if you are in any situation and their is a chance you can get pregnant you should set up an appointment as soon as possible to get protection they have the 5 years plan these streets have been running over with the blood of the innocence this quick fix have cause more harm then anything  i am pro life and also the same women that get pregnant call it a mistake and keep doing what us women i am talking about real ones need to be more responsible and take precaution this 2022 and we still saying we made a mistake sad
the us is a nation in conflict with itself lacking direction and purpose and most of its decisions are frictional and transactional it cannot control its gun violence womens rights have been setback decades and decades its governments is either in inertia or moving towards the religious right guided by the supreme court that is out of touch in foreign affairs it is either starting wars for the benefit of its economy or failing to stop wars for the benefit of is economy if caligula and the spanish inquisition had a  child it would be the united stated of america as it is to day perverted  gluttonous and sanctimoniously pimping a moral righteous that has nothing to do with and for the good will of its own people
it seems that conservartives think all the children got to live for being shooted in the schools
bbc defestating having mass wants abortion rights  listening from mass usa tyvm 
radical decision whatever get outa here brit cnn msbc is enough 
i read that child protective services has real problems and need to be overhauled and revamped so these poor children can really be cared for and possibly adopted into loving homes im sure there are some good people but there is a lot of corruption at the top that is failing the children and just lining their own pockets
did anyone ask  god if hes   in favour   of mothers having  even  more  of a burden placed  upon them

millions   of  children  born    who  will  care   for   the  children whose  mothers are unable   to care for   them   a lack of  money a lack of maturity    what of the  children born  as a result of rape   r  stupid  stupid  selfish men  no where near  when they have  to pay child support
i have a good idea how about all men especially those who are most opinionated get vasectomies at birth so then when couples are ready for children they get it reversed wouldnt this vastly reduce the need for abortions
"it would be interesting if people even the very poor and destitute make a mass exodus outside of these states if they fear that they may need these services at any moment and that the population demographics shift but i think what will happen instead are that people will just not get as many abortions in those places wont drive out of state and will just carry the pregnancies to term or will find ways to stop the pregnancies which are illegal in those areas i might have preferred that people leave states and no longer pay taxes in states where they feel the government is not representing them properly or otherwise if they wish stay there and wage political campaigns to get those states to make things legal that they want to be legal but the problem is it appears the majority in some places may actually not be like them or on their side so it would be hard to convince a new group of people to be the majority to move in a bunch of people who will become the majority otherwise and it seems much more easy to just leave even if one has to hitchhike out of a place and start a new life elsewhere

i might also not mind if a lot of people decide to leave america altogether maybe not directly regarding this issue but just in general seeing as how unstable it has seemed to become how polarized how crimefilled and dangerous it seems to be it just might not be worth living there anymore except in very out of the way places without much action or social interaction it is extremely difficult for people to leave the country though since other countries dont typically allow such a thing but people should definitely try even if it takes measures such as marrying people in other countries or whatever is necessary even illegally entering those countries potentially if it is a decision between living in poverty in some crime filled place or getting out and being free from america and the scary state it is currently in for the last decade basically and really since bush jr"
so we banning abortion but our way of helping our children is still in the shitter how is banning abortion gonna help at all

these is a really thin line if there is a rape  i think the woman has the right to do what she wants but if that is no de case womans and mans need to be educated if you can afford have a baby please dont dothere is so many ways to prevent get pregnant  dont be irresponsible  my grandma said one time if a woman dont want to get pregnant keep the door closedbut if you open the door is because you know what are you doing people lets be responsable and educated new generations
kangaroo court is a branch of the tableland and needs to be burnt to the ground the country dose not need gun  loving court and hates woman and children and they love guns and kill the separation of church an state minority rule in america they made it great again for the men and the religious cooks fuck them all
i can personally say that im happy that the people who support abortion will rally together to continue to support it i do not support it and i am happy to know that my tax dollars are not going towards the funding of something i personally do not believe in as an american citizen its my right as an american citizen its also the right of the people to rally together to support the causes that speak to them personally the media always makes one side louder than the other i would like to hear from the mothers who have struggled and despite their struggle honored their belief not to abort their children and have still persevered i know them personally they spent countless hours studying for degrees working at strip clubs doing hair etc so they can take care of babies that they did not plan for we never seem to hear from those women im sure single parenthood in general is not easy but we all have our choices to make whether theyre right or wrong its not for anyone to judge but its everyones right to support the causes that they deem worthy
yes yes yes thank god
"ironically the same democrats who pushed mandatory vaccines and decried grievances against the 2020 election as the end of democracy are complaining about a real return to democracy

we thought that was democracy and yet the very people whove been lecturing us for years about democracy  its the end of democracy  are horrified by the return of democracy carlson said theyre telling us the legitimacy of our institutions is at risk and yet they cannot allow voters to have a say in how they live what does that tell you it tells you they care about power not popular support

since the supreme courts ruling over a dozen states have already banned abortion as a result of trigger laws on their books california and new york lawmakers on the other hand have vowed to make their states sanctuaries for abortion access

democracy is already in action


leftists freak that scotus has overturned their ability to kill unborn"
"roe was one of those decisions you never heard anyone defend on its own terms lots of people want legal abortion but no ones ever explained how exactly the constitution guarantees that carlson explained roe was a political document it was not a legal opinion and for that reason its existence degraded and undermined the legitimacy of the supreme court one of our countrys central institutions it was poison

the purpose of the supreme court is simple its to determine whether the laws that politicians pass are consistent with the united states constitution thats it thats all the supreme court does

carlson explained that the issue of abortion is now left up to individual states exactly as democracy and the american political system is supposed to function

what the supreme court does not do what it cannot do and should never do is make laws and it should never do that because a court making laws would be by definition antidemocratic carlson noted none of the nine supreme court justices has been elected by anyone all of them have lifetime appointments if you cared about democracy and wanted democracy to continue you would demand that all laws in the united states be passed by elected legislatures again no matter how you feel about abortion or any other specific issue in a democracy voters have the final word on how they are governed thats what democracy is

which means if some states want abortion their legislatures can vote for it if not they wont the fox news host said

now after nearly half a century voters have had their rights restored on the question of abortion if they like abortion they can vote to legalize abortion if they dont like abortion they can vote to ban abortion thats not shocking that is how our system is supposed to work not being a monarchy and all so whats the argument against this well there isnt one really and we know that for certain from the dissent in todays supreme court ruling"

good decision and if you dont want an abortion then excercise the option of chastity

"the silent scream

 warning this documentary is not recommended for sensitive people

the documentary the silent scream released in 1984 contributed to the abortion debate in the 1980s

dr bernard nathansons classic video shocked the world he explains the procedure of a suction abortion followed by an actual firsttrimester abortion as seen through ultrasound the viewer can see the childs pathetic attempts to escape the suction curette as her heart rate doubles and the fetus girl opened its mouth in what nathanson calls a silent scream as her body is torn apart

the clip begins with an ultrasound of the fetus girl who is about to be aborted the girl is moving in the womb displays a heartbeat of 140 per minute and is at times sucking her thumb as the abortionists suction tip begins to invade the womb the child rears and moves violently in an attempt to avoid the instrument her mouth is visibly open in a silent scream the childs heart rate speeds up dramatically to 200 beats per minute as she senses aggression she moves violently away in a pathetic attempt to escape the instrument the abortionists suction tip begins to rip the babys limbs from its body ultimately leaving only her head in the uterus too large to be pulled from the uterus in one piece the abortionist attempts to crush her head with his forceps allowing it to be removed to dehumanize the procedure the abortionist and anesthesiologist refer to the babys head as number 1 the abortionist crushes number 1 with the forceps and removes it from the uterus

hold up if theyre banning abortions  shouldnt they also ban all medical procedures of any kind to fall in line with their ultimate beliefs bunch of backwards hicks
i realize that youre a british media outlet but it doesnt require an oxford education to do simple research understand that the ruling on abortion here in the us was not overturned but rather relegated to the states  and its not a constitutional right as your sorry education has led you to believe

lets see how shes going to celebrate life when a doctor refuses to remove a dead fetus from inside her or when shes told she has to give birth to her rapists semen
"white people are declining not reproducing and oh the great replacement theory

gov ban abortions 

cant make this stuff up  majority of those people celebrating are young teens who will cry after not having the choice or women who are clearly gay and just dont plan to have kids or adopt or the mom already who has kids tubes tied and wont have to first hand live with the consequences"
this is difficult in america because we have a supreme court judge that doesnt know what a woman is how do we know these are women is this now not transgender are these old transgender or theres no such thing as a woman because we dont know in america or woman is if we dont know what a woman is how do we know that they can have abortions the supreme court judge of the democratic party the president of the united states so this is a pointless demonstration considering everybody there is transgender

your comment are falsethe abortions laws are going to be decided by the state and with time framesyou are not onset lying to the people
another reason to hate each other in usa those poor women my god
the problem is if we believe in god who said you shall not kill
it is totally rationalit should be the state to regulate it depending theirs citizens choice
"so for the 95 of people that are crying about losing the right to abort a baby not because they were raped or there are some extreme health problems but because having a baby is inconvenient for them heres a fun fact if youre worried about getting pregnant dont have sex
problem solved if youre that afraid of having a baby dont risk making one or get your eggs removed or whatever dont blame someone else for your lack of control and if you do have an abortion and it goes wrong because you chose to do it somewhere illegally well thats on you no one forced you to do it you decided on that choice yourself 
imagine me saying my friend died of an od because we got drugs from a dodgy dealer in another country because its illegal in my own country then blaming my government for his death saying they caused it i swear people got some dumb logic when theyre crying over their emotions"
democratslets make a deal please secede and you can have your abortions gun control and all of your other utopian and unconstitutional ideals  we will gladly let you goplease leave
the radical position is being pro life  the irony is beyond reason imagine the supreme court the judiciary one branch of government placing legislative onus on the legislative branch of government per the separation of powers heaven forbid they would display deference to the constititionality of such laws by passing them back to the legislators as they are the representatives voted in by the people name any article or ammendment in the us constitution that directly states abortion as a constitutional right oh it doesnt exist was founded and based on a period of judicial acvtivisim within the courts okay understood court suits you when its full of activists and it doesnt suit when it actually has originalists who dont make up rights where and when they want
i never have and never will support abortion if someone is willing to kill their unborn baby then they are not a human at all
abortion was never in the constitution so how can it be guaranteed by the constitution the only thing the court did was give each state the freedom they once had to make their own laws which is what individual state government was designed to do abortion will only be limited not stopped since trash blue states will continue the pathetic barbaric practice
i am sorry  people are supporting here in comment section the killing of unborn child 
note that the bbc does not use the term prolife but calls them antiabortion activists clear media bias spin

"perhaps these same judges should pass a law which states that all menboys have a vasectomy unless they are legally married you can bet that those same judges would never pass this as a law you can also bet there would be hundreds of thousands of men who would loudly protest the laws should be equal for women  men plus what are these same judges going to ensure that american men take care of the children they have already created how many single women are out there financially taking care of their children but the men of those same children are not forced to actually pay the child
support they are required to pay"
if women are in positions where they want or need an abortion but legally cant and the man who got her pregnant doesnt want to keep it or help raise ithe should automatically be given a vasectomy  it takes two to put an unwanted child in a uterus apparently conservatives are saying that the door is kicked open now for going after same sex marriages and contraception the conservative ball has started rolling and america is soon to be obsolete on the world stage and moving back towards mccarthyismthinking with a heavy dash of fascist rule added to it
ok men get the snip what is that a no then stop forcing women to go ahead with pregnancies that you wouldnt stay around for what about all the unwanted abused kids in state care where is the love there ffs ok then it should be made illegal to get a woman pregnant and fuck off then stupid world

 its something no wants to do but for the world to be better we need this right for women the mothers need to be priority a child can not be supported if the mother is unable to support themselves we need better sex ed so this isnt an issuecontraceptives too the fact that this is illegal means so many people will go to jail over the unborn who have no voice and will not appreciate or disagree with the gesture its depressing that people can be born into this world and wish they had been aborted"

people forget that supreme court didnt ban abortion and make illegal but removed consitutional protection and gave states ability to make it illegal or legal

this is an issue that has been pushed to control people it is a lie it puts the issue back to the states it is not in the constitution 50 million babies have been murdered it is eugenics pushed on our black and poor communities and now bill and melinda gates are building abortion clinics in africa it is the will of the people roe vs wade was a fake it was planned and used to push planned parenthood she never had an abortion her daughter is alive today even though her mother gave her up you are only shown these few instances and not the evil side of abortion these people are pushing abortion at the moment of birth and allowing the mother and doctor to kill the child while it is alive it is a for profit organization that earned 19 billion last year and received 528 in government money they sell the fetuses to labs for experimentation and the clinics and doctors receive money for it what about the dumpsters of aborted babies stop pushing propaganda it is totally out of control my body my right is not true it is not the mothers body it is the childs body the left and our education system has brainwashed all these young people minds for decades it is about money and control not womens health"
its almost like someone wants to keep us fighting with each other
ah yes  religion  keeping humanity from progressing since its inception  or in this case actually regressing humanity by a good fifty years in one fell swoop  idiotic beyond belief
"theyre going to build a better world with more unwanted or under cared for childreni guess this means the states can choose to outlaw abortion even if the mothers at risk i hope most states have the foresight to protect women from potential harm but i dont have much faith in red state legislators they care more about the unborn than they do about those of us who are here right now

trump and the republicans had a chance in 2017 to change our lives for the better when they had full control over congress and the presidency but chose to focus on temporary tax relief for the poor and middle class while giving the wealthiest like trump and his family permanent tax breaks and packing the scotus to overturn the right to an abortion lets not forget about their 2nd amendment right to kill children who are alive and breathing once again showing they dont care about us"
america is a shthole may god have mercy on its citizens
a victory for pregnant men worldwide praise jebus
how about you dont get pregnant in the first place
more jesus better america
"theres no such thing as a right to abortion you dont get to murder defenseless children out of convenience your rights stop where the rights of other begin leftie liberals always say my body my choice but never mention the babys body and the babys choice which is disgusting if you dont want a baby then be a responsible grownass adult and dont have sex or buy a condom theyre super cheap and easily available

ps congratulations from mexico to all american patriots for this beautiful victory this is a glorious and delightful development

i couldnt help but notice that everyone who is for abortion have already been born
president ronald reagan"
perverse behaviour fornication sexual immolarity premarital sex is cause of abortion lets deal with the cause encourage americans to abstain from sex until they are married
why cant women just keep their legs together is it so hardyes thats why they cant
who cares what england thinks they never cared about human rights
i would leave that country asap
the united states will be more divided than it is now many of the states will ask for their independence and probably will have it not only on the abortion issue but also on gun control a civil war is coming
just move to ny or california they will continue to kill babies there thats why their states are so f up
white supremacy 100 years ago a white supremacist woman named sanger started an organisation to control what she considered to be undesirables through eugenics  today that organisation is actively murdering minority children at a rate way faster than the murder of white children the damage doesnt stop there  once a person has destroyed his or her own child heshe has destroyed a piece of hisher own soul the pain leads to drug use alcoholism despondency and destruction ms sangers dream of destroying the minorities in america is being seen everyday in the inner cities everywhere in america and liberal black leaders are cheering her on

so dear brothers and sisters work hard to prove that you really are among those god has called and chosen do these things and you will never fall away 
harvest  fruits must be there we should not be beating around the bushand sufferings are two eyes of a christian life 
an easy way to get sufferings
when will you get sufferings 
you will get  more sufferings if  you have to put on the full armour of god
when you do good works like christ or take the armour of god ephesians 6
12 for our struggle is not against flesh and bloodd but against the rulers against the authoritiese against the powersf of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realmsg 13 therefore put on the full armor of god
1 john 216 tells us not to love lusts eyes lusts of flesh and pride of life  our achievements
because we have to continue to do good works until we die 
good brotheren christians tells this avoid second time  seeing a list 
i couldnt understand that
god even forgives our sins 
he called us when we were dead in our sins and lawlessness
but  christ raised us from spiritual death 
we may have no money 
we may have no own  house
but our aim should not be a house or money 
this world is not ours 
we have no permanent city here 
but we should know that without us the world will be dark and saltless
but when we lose our saltiness 
matthew 513 
you are the salt of the earth but if the salt loses its saltiness how can it be made salty again it is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot
so if are bad christians the world we will be thrown out
sufferings are different but saltiness is different
we will have sufferings
1 peter 4 
being faithful to god
1christ suffered here on earth now you must be ready to suffer as he did because suffering shows that you have stopped sinning 2it means you have turned from your own desires and want to obey god for the rest of your life it means you should take armours of god 
2 peter 110 
new living translation
so dear brothers and sisters work hard to prove that you really are among those god has called and chosen do these things and you will never fall away so we must know in a running race about our speed or we will win the race or we running with real winners or we must closely run with successful evangelists or victorious christians 
philippines 122
but if i live i can do more fruitful work for christ so i really dont know which is better it means when paul was doing ministry he had lot of harvests this is a sign of knowing that god is with us 
when you are doing good works like jesus automatically you will be getting lot of sufferings
it is not that we are inviting troubles or sufferingsbut doing good like jesus did healing the sick and helping people so automatically you will get sufferings or opposition
or a ministry of  god  this you can know gods will in your talents and gifts 
successful christian life is different from ministry of god 
you can know your calling of a ministry only by your fruits or results in ministry 
those sufferings would be helpful to you from sins 
it means not inviting sufferings ourselves but it means doing good works
you should not lose your heat when you see hostility  opposition 
there you should think about jesus  he suffered on earth so comfort yourselves  you are on right directionvery much bigger it is a sign that your works very great but make sure if there is fruits or you should not be beating the bush or punching in the sky high or beating the sky "
how about telling the truth for once you do know this doesnt make abortion illegal right it leaves it up to the states to decide of course you know that but you need ratings
this country would be better if we executed all conservatives
130 personal level obviously the product of a failed abortion too bad their parents failed
lets be explicit the us is not divided on this 75 are prochoice so against this decision
thank you jesus im so tired of seeing women having abortion parties and tired of them getting abortions just for fun tired of see women get abortions just to make their boyfriend mad  my neighbor had 7 abortions i asked her why so many abortions she said she enjoys getting abortions and she do it for fun when she heard the news abortion she stuck a metal clothes hanger up her private part and i called 911 smh
separation of church and state needs to happen right now
"in a democrat state that allows abortion up to 9 months isnt that murder  
if i were to kick a pregnet woman in the stomach and she lost the unborn child i should be charged with assault only because under their logic the unborn child is not a life but in those very same states there are people in prison for murder for killing a unborn child the hypocrisy of what goes on in some liberal states is unbelievable"
what happened to all lives matters
antiabortion is mostly christiancatholic belief however the united states constitution states there should be division between the state and religion even jesus said give to caesar what is due to caesar leave the issue of the state to the state do not meddle you are forcing your belief to atheists buddhists muslims jews hindus of this country because you are forcing them to follow christian beliefs they will go away and think of christians very badly jesus never forced anyone to convert to christianity nor follow the commandments he preached and showed love to anyone who will listen
i love the democracy end the freedom of speech in this soils  am sure back  in my home land africa  if found expressing  ur thoughts in the streets  all these citizens would have been swept to prison cells  safe abortion aright 
murder is not a right but sometimes a tragic necessity
use a condom or drink a pills or abstain from sex but do not go around killing babies
its crazy to see women who are pro life 
yay good news so glad for this children deserve to live
"imagine being one of the idiots in the crowd chanting

this aint a good thing because abortions will still be done just now much more painfully and unsafely"
what if it was your preteen daughter she could die from giving birth yet america gave more rights to guns than women
weird the bbc did a whole show on abortion but wouldnt show the procedure or aftermath i wonder why
why are women making a big deal out of this change women get pregnant somehow right  just have some selfcontrol and everything should be just fine
the constitution dose not give women the right to an abortion  democrats just keep spewing that lie  show me where in the constitution where it says that it does not
if the chick dies thats on her
millions of children in the united states are getting the constitutional right to live after the supreme court overturned its landmark roe v wade ruling of 50 years ago which take the children the right to live
i wonder if those women are going to take care of the abandoned childen or they are just celebrating over nothing
democracy is going to die in america n india all the best future citizens 
this is the most perfect law in us it will save a lot of people lives and will make women take more responsibility of their pregnancy
they are not pro life they are pro breeders
"its hilarious that these people think they had anything to do with this  the supreme court didnt do this because these people  changed their mind they did it because a bunch of conservative cronies with too much bible and not enough brains put in by another cronie with no brains made a very very stupid decision  

pubs are always bitching about paying for people that are in poverty  just wait until they see how many more of them there will be now   a pregnant teenager will now have virtually no chance as a life  and science is not on your side little girl science clearly shows that more population is the last thing this world needs  but soldier on idiots  when other aspects like the environment really start to go south i can tell you who will be bitching most too

all i can say is anyone with three working brain cells to rub together better have a few morning after pills set aside"
no abortion no sex before marriage
"finaly something good happend in america 
satan is very angry and furious it can be seen on the faces of the people who are indifferent to killing children"
oprah is the most hurt by this
what this shows is that the president is not the most powerful man  in the world
i believe this is a subject where men in politics are in no position to have any say
"since the well known potuspuppet in his public statement show immediately connected the sc ruling with existing rapechildren 
i dont dare to imagine what elderly single male  men are heading for now 
 transgender auntie bob seems to be not the only refuge option anymore "
right to kill
"140
this lady said that she saw the devastation that that abortion does on a personal level well has this lady with the red hair and the glasses had a abortion herself if she hasnt that she needs to keep her mouth shut because i personal level means she had an abortion herself and she knows what its like to have an abortion if she knows what its like to have someone rape her but i doubt it that shes ever been raped and i doubted that shes been ever chosen abortion because shes never lived in fear because if she did choose abortion and if she was raped she wouldnt be in that riley saying yeah now those children are going to live in property congratulations miss redhaired i know what its like to have an abortion know you dont"
i dont agree with total prohibition on abortion just as i dont agree with legislating abortion from the bench congress should do their job and pass a common sense abortion law prohibiting all abortions is extreme just as allowing late term and mid term abortions i doubt the average person cares if an abortion is had in the first trimester but i doubt theyre ok with it at 7 8 9 months common sense and compromise must return or we will tear ourselves apart
it is not woman taking womans rights away but seven men  just like they did in the past by our ancestors
this is almost totally driven by religion put america back 100 years what they going to do next start burning witches bunch of god fearing idiots
there will be illegal abortion and this will endanger women morethink about poor women who wont be able to achieve it  think about the women who get raped and get pregnant and dont want the child think about a woman who got pregnant accidentally and who cant afford a living for herself think about the cost of living  the world is changing more recessions poor women will suffer the most
we are in a new age not old custom ages women should be allowed to choose proabortion does not make any women get an abortion only if that women chooses too if they dont want to give women right to choose then lets also go back to the stone age and hit women on the head with a stick pull their hair and use them to mate just because these things were done by cavemen does not mean we still do it give women their respect and allow them to choose
the real solution is flirt with the right person or dont get knocked so easy why is that so hard learn self defense early so you dont get knocked either if we are powerful woman why we get knocked so easy deal with it if you do properly lets all start new do not be weak you dont need this law if you become wise flirt with the right person even if it takes you till you are old clean slate for america besides think where the fetus ends potentially in the mouth of the elite rich for food gross but investigate why feed them more
"she lift a sign my body my choice 
how about the human in your womb 
did you give him his choice to live 
f devils
you think you own his life just because he was in your womb 
ridiculous dheads"
imprenant the pro life ppl with multiple babies then deny them abortion and take there job and beat them and then tell us what you think
and then they vote to allow more guns to kill the children when they are no longer an embryo but real children
zambia appreciates the decision of the us supreme court no abortion we celebrate with you amen zambia
bbc this is disingenuous it isnt radical or of an evil oppressive nature the us supreme court hasnt stopped women having an abortion they have handed that responsibility down to individual states legislature were if your representative doesnt align with your beliefs or moral code pro choice or anti you the electorate can elect them or not cherry picking at its best
its unconstitutional to say you cant get an abortion it goes against you freedom of choice
havent seen the unbiased bbc this upset since the americans elected donaldjtrump
this directly pointed at hoyt plunket this is your religious belief not mine you have no right to tell me what to think
beautiful day in history
"the silent scream

 warning this documentary is not recommended for sensitive people

the documentary the silent scream released in 1984 contributed to the abortion debate in the 1980s

dr bernard nathansons classic video shocked the world he explains the procedure of a suction abortion followed by an actual firsttrimester abortion as seen through ultrasound the viewer can see the childs pathetic attempts to escape the suction curette as her heart rate doubles and the fetus girl opened its mouth in what nathanson calls a silent scream as her body is torn apart

the clip begins with an ultrasound of the fetus girl who is about to be aborted the girl is moving in the womb displays a heartbeat of 140 per minute and is at times sucking her thumb as the abortionists suction tip begins to invade the womb the child rears and moves violently in an attempt to avoid the instrument her mouth is visibly open in a silent scream the childs heart rate speeds up dramatically to 200 beats per minute as she senses aggression she moves violently away in a pathetic attempt to escape the instrument the abortionists suction tip begins to rip the babys limbs from its body ultimately leaving only her head in the uterus too large to be pulled from the uterus in one piece the abortionist attempts to crush her head with his forceps allowing it to be removed to dehumanize the procedure the abortionist and anesthesiologist refer to the babys head as number 1 the abortionist crushes number 1 with the forceps and removes it from the uterus

its a shame how the ushit is going backwards

gas prices  baby formula shortage in america  waste of money in ukraine southern border wide open
next they will bring witch burning back america is a child
so all those people have lost their jobs too
trump has just gone from being by far the worst us president in my lifetime  i was born in november 1963  to by far the best i was dreading his return but now look forward to it
unwanted peasant babies yay id rather be aborted
so men sue planned parenthood for the baby they killed that was half yourswithout your consent
just remember that a unborn baby is still a like if you dont want your baby then adopt it out
banning it isnt gonna make it go away some women may be desperate enough to do it unsafely the system is already flooded with so many kids  very limited resources i cant imagine what its going to look like with this ban everyone should have the right to choose
all those mad libtards burguers are funny 
it means that tens of millions of women across the country no longer have their right to ab abortion guaranteed by the constitution they never did thats the whole point shes talking as if they wiped it out of the constitution freedom of speech freedom of assembly freedom of the press the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed oh there it is the 153rd amendment the right to an abortion gee how did i miss that i guess i skipped it what are they going to strike down next the 10256th amendment right to free ice cream on national ussa day what about free coffee to commemorate us putting down the robot uprising this is a nightmare
yesterday was a victory not only for republicans and conservatives but for all of life when i see children being thrown into garbage cans because of abortion and i see people defending abortion as if it were normal as if one had the right to speak for a life that cannot defend itself and that i realize that the human being has not learned anything that the life of the next is disposable my regrets to all the children who were killed due to abortions and had no one to defend them more yesterday justice was done  congratulations republicans you proved that some people still have a conscience thank you very much
"i mean they are technically living the american dream considering most of them dont seem to even be awake
abortion gets reillegalized if that even is a word free healthcare something that should be a basic human right somehow is being politicised and i bet you 500 theyll try to chip away at the very recent law of legalising gay marriage because when a basic right like abortion is stripped away there is a 5050 chance theyll try to do it with other basic human right laws i mean sarah the reporter literally said that theyre maybe other progressive rights the supreme court could be looking into getting them removed so what are the odds of seeing a slave in virginia being used to produce cotton again"
better late than neverwhat took so long
do not be complecent in europe more and more us influenced evangelicals are active in europe to gain political power
keep there legs closed then there not all rape just lefty feminist evil selfush lives
just print more money us
so sharia law for the us it is or something equally religously antiquated
dem states will still kill kids and republican states will save them they will never win this fight its so time for the left to realize what they are doing not only to america but the world biden will not not save america he will destroy america this is his plan
"they say were letting the states decide were delegating that authority to them
ive got a better idea how about the states delegate that authority to the individuals and let them decide

for the record i loathe the idea of abortion but a im not a woman and b if i was nobody couldve forced me to have an abortion before so this is just basically people wanting their personal views to have the force of law over others as for protecting the rights of unborn children in the inutero stages until there is a clear agreedupon universal consensus on when a fetus is considered a living human then the law has a constitutional interest in erring on the side of individual civil liberty what pregnant women choose to do with that liberty concerning the health and vitality of the fetus and the consequences thereof is and should be their responsibility to bear"
people are becoming more and more retarded by the time
real question is on what basis did the same supreme court upheld abortion for so long god is great
stop just sleeping around with everybody then u wont be able to aborte simple  its maybe that sex is now easy
how many different types of birth control are offered women today
babys lives matter i dont think people realize how many people want children  they are willing to pay thousands for them bear  while i feel rape and health are ok for it but im tired of people playing god  in more than just abortion  we have a democracy so we can choose who better suits that party and their own beliefs  everyone deserves to be married im ok with that why is it the same people wanting to murder babies protest dog shelters from putting down dogs because no one wants them why is it the same people put likes on stories of premature babies that survive the odds and grow up to be beautiful people
justice clearence thomas is a dead man walking he  will mysteriously die
doctor willie parker is a devil for murdering his own people
as fast as i am growing and learning about the world usa is becoming hypocrite for me
its very bad for people to have there way with everything its good that abortion is now illegal  thank god
great news murder should be illegal
"the us isnt a democracy its a constitutional republic

just because the majority of the country believes in murdering children doesnt mean its right"
well thats the only thing ive disagreed with trump on im pro life too the life choice we should have
america just signed a death warrant for all the children being born into poverty and over population
botched abortions it is then well done america for going back in time further and treating women like crap as usual
most of the states that want abortion outlawed are the lowest in the educational system
heres a commonsense solution  use contraceptives two different types concurrently  this isnt the 1800s
finally a supreme court made up of rational intelligent jurists have overturned the prior unconstitutional supreme court decision that enabled the immoral and abhorrent killing of babies in the womb
america sure needs a sweeping changei hope this is going to be the beginning of many more to come
"crazy nazis satan churches pastors is giving the republican party of the supreme court justice and the young republican congress party members and groups are pushing horrors on the usa people
the church pastors are giving instructions of what to do what to say what to think and who to kill especially cops
the young republican congress party is also taking its orders for the usa peopleit comes from the crazy nazis satan church and its pastors
the bible doesnt talk about abortionno where in it god has nothing to do with what happened on 6242022 the nazis republican party"
what a misleading title abortion was never a right outlined in the constitution to begin with the supreme court simply ruled that the power be returned to the people within the individual states where it belongs many americans are too stupid and lack the wherewithal to understand how their representative republic was designed to operate not realizing that states rights won this victory which is a beautiful thing removing power from a centralized federal entity and placing that power back into the citizens hands is what seperates america as a free republic from countries elsewhere in the world where citizens are actually subjects under centralized authority as an american myself im thoroughly embarrassed with most of my countrymen who do not even understand that they live in a republic crying for government tyranny just so they can feel as though they are safe under a nanny states control mechanismsso pathetic
isnt it just up to the states now you can go to another stateits not like they made it nationally illegaljust no longer a federal issue
the problem with america is too much extreme freedom
bbcs sex education should not go to waste
people wants to so much rights to escape accountability and responsibility prior to 1973 the abortion was illegal unless the mothers life was in danger make sense to me you cant just take unborn life when you want
america is not the land of the free anymore

america and human rights are two opposite things america didnt think for afganistan people before now their own women citizens are in troubleshameful
psm 127v 3 children are gifts from god how do you view this most precious gift  are you thankful do you appreciate this gift from almighty god
have responsible sex the choice was made once you spread your legs give more awareness to sex safety and pregnancy prevention not termination once its allready too late
no this shouldnt be celebrated  if shes raped she has to go through 9 months of an unwanted baby give birth and have the memories have the baby she didnt want in her body because she was raped and she mustve not fought back this is disgusting
america eating itself
good to hear the us is going onestep to the right the federal government has no business forcing everyone to fund killing babies for the convenience of women let the states decide what they want
if you people would turn to the god that gave life to youuuuuuuthen you would happily give up your job of death
all the ruling states is that individual states decide its not illegal just not a constitutional right we are so far off with compassion politics that we forget how simple the law is
land of the free
maybe people should care about the kids that are alive breathing and thinking and are actually right now in many orphanages instead of thinking over a meat apple of an underdeveloped fetus that likely is going to end up in one without a parent or worse be born and die while feeling pain early in life if people care about life so much they sure didnt show it that way towards the ones that are currently alive and walking the homeless the ill the kids without parents or kids with mental disabilities this is just hypocritical
women are losing their rights every day this country was supposed to be free but as always it is just for the straight white christiancatholic male this is religious coercion what happened to the separation of church and state
great day in america the states get to chose their path based on what their residents want the people supporting are evil look at what they are wearing losers
i love this so much god bless the supreme court
wait did they remove abortion now if yeh then good because i think its bad to take away an innocent babys life away and its not right but i understand that people are not okay with it
gas is 5 a gallon and you have to drive out of state to get rid of the bump in your belly lol   you voted for it
do they really think banning abortion will end it people will do abortion illegally which increase the risk
another nail in the coffin of liberty in the self proclaimed land of the free at this rate the usa is going to end up about as free as iran it will become that which it purports to oppose a despotism under the rule of mob violence and the tyranny of fanatical religious nutjobs the same lawmakers who applaud this decision are the very same who viewed the massacre at uvalde with cynical indifference presumably they dont think there are enough children to provide target practice in american schools
look at the bright side more children around  i dont hate  children   now who here hates children  i have nephews  and nieces
thank you trump unlike other politicians you delivered
these days being a progressive involves murdering your unborn baby chopping your genitals off and taking children to story time read by a pervert in a dress
dependes  on situation im for abortion  yes u have  rape baby or a fun bed baby as t early age mom  dad no job gandperants stuck with baby or system places baby who knows to who  baby gets abuse i can go on and on yes must to abortion save the baby from evil worldthose are my feelings i belive at times do what u have to do let creator juge me
"its a great day

millions of fewer innocent babies will be murdered"
520 lol the irony
youre not pro choice youre pro death to the most innocent among  us
people should look up who started planned parenthood and after you read the story of the woman that started planned parenthood and her reasons for starting planned parenthood i think a lot of people are going to change their mind about planned parenthood not only that people will be shocked
well you better have great social services because orphanage will sure have alot of customers to serve soon
"right to abortion struck down by us supreme court  false
us supreme court supreme court decision reversed federal law and turn abortion back over to the states thats it thats all this does the headline is propaganda  abortion is still legal in 35 states with some states have some restrictions 3 more states and dems can pass a amendment to the constitution guaranteeing it as a constitutional right but democrats want a wedge issue to win elections 
roe vs wade was court decision made into law circumvented the democratic process   roe vs wade was illegal  courts in the us dont make laws congress does the courts making law  is antidemocracy  
so regardless if youre for or against abortion the federal mandate was unconstitutional
if dems dont get off their bums conservatives will use the law to go after gay marriage in the same way gay marriage was made into law by executive order not by congress"
abortion is crime   after enjoyng from the bed  u will killed  so stupid  pro life  pro god 
forced motherhood  nobody is forcing motherhood just practice sex safety abortion is just baby killing pure and simple
her boyfriend hits her every day but she sleeps with him
finally a light in the dark the business with the babies is finished lord give wisdom to these women so that they take better care of themselves
amen no abortion
"this comment section is so scary i cant believe we still have to claim that womens rights are human rights ffs 
greetings from germany where on the same day as the us supreme court overturned roe v wade our highest court overturned a law prohibiting doctors to openly discuss their abortion practices all us women are in my thoughts and will be in my actions"
 life has one this day
all theyve done is ban safe abortions and put millions of girls and women at risk
one more thing to overcome same sex marriage
i am so glad i am not from america guns no abortion no simple human rights like control of your own body its crazy
if you dont want kids keep your lages closed  abortion is only a choice for those who dont want to take responsibility for their action 
wait a min was that cat ears
look at how many children in foster carelook how many children are in the system already no one wantslook how many children parents killing all due the parents didnt wantwhy dont these people adopt these kids give them family and a homedo they really think by overturning this will stop abortion no it will nottheirs going to still be a lot of abortionsjust not done in a medical officebut it will still happenwho are them to tell women what they can and cant do to their bodysour bodys should not be in their handswhite house votemy choice my body i choose
wonderful news   give the unborn a voice  do these people really believe that god will say the killing of an unborn child is ok
"its crazy how people struggle in usa to kill babies i mean at their point things are fair cuz most of the ppl in their society are lack of self morale and discipline 
finally the kids are the ones who gonna suffer for a lifetime"
finally justices reading the constitution as it is written not pulling rights like rabbits magically out of their black hats abortionists boohoo we cannot murder innocent infants anymore so upsetting
prolife
why supreme court  so desperately want to bring a babies into the world when their parents are not ready for it who is gonna take care of those kids i think this is all done to please the votebank of orthodox christian community welcome to stoneage america
women will continue to try to have abortions  as they did since of the begining of times  but now they will put their lives at risk  trying to do it themselves or  going to places that will do  it with metal hangers and die from infections 
stupid young girls being happy about it   women will continue to try to have abortions  as they did since of the begining of times  but now they will put their lives at risk  trying to do it themselves or  going to places that will do  it with metal hangers and die from infections 
no it wasnt  it was put in the hands of each state to decide
life has indeed won praise god
just because someone decided to abort there pregnancy doesnt mean its easy its one of the hardest things to decide for yourself it can be mentally draining but if they feel like its still the right thing to do then they should have the right  to decide if they want to do it people who think its just killing a life arent thinking of everything else
all life should be protected
american women should start going out more with colored men watch how quickly they will overturn the ban  besides colored men have bigger dingdongs
so america is going to listen to a bunch of religious extremists sentencing countless women to death and trauma blood on scotus hands
thank fuck sanity prevails
"as usual the bbc has got their facts and their opinions all twisted 
1  the scotus did not simply out law abortions across the country  what they did is leave the decision to do abortions up to the individual states 

2 there is no provision in the us constitution guaranteeing the right to have an abortion  

what has happened to the bbc  did you get bought out by cnn
get your facts straight report only the facts and stop trying to stir up fear and anger with your wild unfounded opinions"
now there will be millions of homeless  hungry babies
great day for all those unborn children god bless the surpreme court
recently the ccp began to use its diplomatic power to explain its own faults to the world and then demanded sympathy from all countries and once again lured and bribed dignitaries from various countries dont you know the essence of the ccp  when he retreats it is in exchange for time and space for the next attack as long as he is softhearted towards him he will have to move forward have you ever seen the gangster society  as for trump if he takes office he will bring the united states with him    to hell because he is a selfish person he does not understand liberalism he does not understand the spirit of the founding of the united states the founding of the united states and the establishment of the constitution and can only say that he is a businessman  and pompeo is the future president who will truly lead the united states to the right path for us foreigners he will be a good president he can maintain peace in the entire world because he has a righteous heart  today chinas banks and real estate are bound to each other they have a set of funds which they transfer around and support each other as long as the people withdraw and run on the money there will be a series of thunderstorms because the ccp has no money and all bad debts  its all fake cover up
stop freaking out  its up to the states not completely abolished bbc stop saying the right to abort is struck down
"god bless u all  keep growing  
unite eachother 
help each other"
maybe if the democrats didnt want to use abortion as political football they would have codified this during the clinton administration or the obama administration ive heard political operatives say they would never pass it because its too useful a weapon to use against the right
reminder that this wont drop abortion rates it will just mean more women die from unsafe abortions and thats exactly what republicans want having this type of power over people makes these justices feel important
im not about abortion being used like candy but at least have exceptions like r word insests if having baby can kill the mom like health situations im sure women are would be more inclined to go for that this is all population control  control that men are trying to get back cant believe being a woman is so hard today this was a great way to move backwards 
red pill fact if some women were more responsible with their bodies had some selfrespect and respect for the unborn abortion minus rapeincest would never exist mic drop
oh my god thank god im not living in the states i feel sorry for women who are now going to be forced by law to raise a child for all we know could be the end result of a rapist having his way with some poor girl imagine that looking at a child and seeing your attackers face completely moronic country and the people celebrating that verdict only highlight that stupidity they have no idea what theyve done idiots
antiabortion is better than destroying the future generations of humanity  maybe our country will finally grown stronger again instead of weaker
those antireproduction rights gender traitors will be haunted by the deaths of women and children that this will cause
us is the most advanced country in the world compared to the europe because it does not cater to feminists hoes
good job women with bad morals are protesting
oh shut trump up  hes only campaigning for votes
i support the baby killers
i want to hear how they are going to help the unwanted children shelter food medical education let alone family love to grow up unwanted b possible abuse
so now im the criminal what you going to do charge me you going to charge me are you going to charge me for trying to push your asses to do the right thing make me a criminal at least i became a criminal for the right reason
bruh at least report correctly on the issue abortion is not federal banned it is now up to the states to regulate the issue
why is this headline news here in the uk who cares what the usa does dont see much coverage by the bbc of those that support the removal of the laws in question just another biased bbc low quality piece of journailsm
the ruling simply puts the law to local  state lawmakers    what  most news is not saying is the democrats  control all 3 houses to make law  but instead blame the justices who read the law  why are they not doing what they preach 
we are acting like these beings are an item u can cancel on amazon what determines your death no pulse then what should it determine at the beginning a pulse heartbeat its not a baby out the womb its been a baby since the heart beat  these crazy people makes me 
first step to a responsible society  
too bad the title of the video is entirely misleading they are not banning abortions they are leaving it up the to the state to decide which is fair because some places believe that killing babies is ok and same dont california wackos want abortions up to 9 months dont know if anybodys seen a woman 9months but shes about to pop at the that point and you can kill it then when are women gonna take the responsibility of  either wearing protection or dont sleep with everyone no common sense with these people u can be poor and take care of children just fine i have several kids dont make a lot and they are all happy and fine just gotta sacrifice people that are for abortion up to 9 months is sickening do yalls homework and grow a heart
we thank god
hmm american
this is all because of the f ing  bible bashers
and thank you guzman family mexicans latin americans minorities majorities and everyone else for making this a priority when those administrative level offices didnt
"im so mad at this and i dont even live in america
i wanna choke every single one of those people who are defending this decision"
decision as big as this decided by 9 people why do we have voting and elections seriously
"tens of millions of women in america do not understand where babies come from
contraception is cheap and available everywhere
im sorry but abortion is not a form of health care nor contraception and those are still available to women"
final justice for the  millions of unborn babies sacrificed to the devil
finally killings babies are over
"this is like the beginning of the handmaids tale 

looks like were on a one way trip back to the dark ages"
"paying to travel to a state where abortion is legal is still an option and much cheaper than 18 years of raising a kid so if you want an abortion remember the pregnancy was your mistake accept the responsibility fork up the money and stop bitching by the way i support government provided contraception 
to all no government funds for abortion"
but at least i became a criminal for the right reasons
and my kid nobody wants to bring her to me nobody wants to give it to me and nobody wants to tell me whatever this i dont know what this stupid s is here i dont know how you guys shit works and since nobody will help me walk her to me something tell me whats going on i will become a criminal
president trump knew what he was doing biden is trying to cause conflicts with those countries no lets make sure that we unite those countries lets make sure that we unites everything that they wanted to cover up instead of making conflict with those countries lets all get in it together were all the minor minority
"dont like it then dont get pregnant 
abortion is murder 
not birth control for the irresponsible"
133 what an absolute karen
thank u for allowing comments
not to mention the fact that you got shell corps baby turtles arent they illegal to sell
"the hell with scotus we will defy itmaxine waters d caa sitting member of congress said that
i wonder if she remembers  some other words she saidsuch as preserve protect and defend imho spitting on your oath of office is a high crimes and misdemeanorsthese elected criminals  which are of this opinion  need to simply resign  or be impeachedor simply  voted out"
this f administration they are covering up war crime sex trafficking they are covering up an international sex trafficking ring that is being fueled and funded by government agencies and offices
you kept my kid away from me for three years because you wouldnt give me my kid cuz you wanted a political insurance hits a surety bond 13 companies miller real estate five star because you wanted to cover up your corruption but most of all you want to cover up covidian
"soooamerica makes abortion illegal because they argue they want to save the lives of future children but yet america doesnt care enough about those children to change gun laws so they dont keep getting shot in schools 
got it"
nary a word by mainstreams dems about the childrens life in the womb
i have an email where i believe was five to seven million dollars at states for a hit on me because it would appease many people in offices but they went to a bike to do it they just didnt know the minority is the majority you kidnapped my kid my kid you used because you were too worried about your corruption and your baby sex trafficking well dont worry you got the right one four and a half years didnt you lock me up send me to prison throw me the mental institution have the police beat me up because you wouldnt give me my kid
and i thought church and state was supposed to be seperate in the us 
republic of gilead here we comeunder his eye
dont i have that email
the fact that religious views of some has had a lot of influence on this massive decision is regrettable
biden you should have did something about this board and you shouldnt have tried to hit me didnt you use a bike didnt your offices administrative level pay five to six thousand million dollars within your administrative level to put a hit on me to shut me up
this is the ugliest thing ive ever seen and ive never seen a goddamn administrative level office cover up something what i witness every f day my f kid has been kidnapped for 4 and 12 years because they wanted some goddamn money they wanted a political insurance hits
about time one step foward for conservatives
do you know how many men are involved in this sex trafficking ring at the highest levels do you know that the southern district mayor of new york authorized for these people and these offices these congressional offices to sleep with these women that were an institutions and then raped their children and this is all in a book and it is said that if it ever was to get out it would be politically controversial
the negation of abortion rights makes me feel as if were moving backwards rather than forward
happy day  what a happy day  there is absolutely nothing in the actual us constitution that expressly states a person can wholesaley murder a child
my kids are important and all these kids have been extorted sex trafficking thousands thousands of kids that have been killed at the hands of the administration at our borders that they have failed to do anything about it
"yeah she hates black people  and she knows blacks make up over half of all abortions 
since 1973 over 19000000 black babies were aborted  if those 19 million blacks were allowed to love then reproduce just imagine how many million more blacks would be in the usa probably enough to make half the population of america black by now but deep down these politicians and crazy chalky ladies dont want more blacks alive"
family planning resources should prevail
these women mad they cant kill babies  just strap up or keep your legs closed  stop being a hoe
close your legs and you wont need to murder your own baby
the people have won 
abortion is murder
you crying because you cant kill babies anymore f nuts
baby killers mad and seething
"those pathetic woke liberals have caused this with their gender fluid nonsense meaning that they can no longer define what a woman is  feel the power of a conservative backlash you whining snowflakes 
"
what president
im happy with the majority of americans who are making this happen
keep your legs closed there wont be a problem
in america considering the 63 millions of babies that have been killed by early termination something had to be done obviously killing babies is not good and sorry but it appears women dont seem to have the education to protect themselves and killing the babies has become the easy solution i cant believe an american president can speech that killing babies is a right whatever belief you are i wish you well and all life on this beautiful planet
back to illegal abortion at least now there is a chance the aborting woman dies in the process2 flys in 1haha
im a woman and am so pissed that these people say abortion is about womens rightno it is not women  are naturally nurturers care giversprotectors of life not killers
welcome to gilead
"i dont understand todays generation people have normalised sex and it has become a way of enjoyment people nowadays take sex so lightly that it means nothing at all if we consider sex as a holy gift of god to be enjoyed by married couple then there wont be any issue at all
abortion is mostly done by people who goes around having sex for enjoyment in some cases its done by rape victims but mostly by people who take sex as a means of enjoyment if you are doing for enjoyment use protection a condom wont cost you much but for me having sex with multiple partner is not necessary at all and sex dont prove your love for your partner so say no to sex before marriage
i am a christian and i truly believe that sex is holy

and the protesters here are not victims of rape or medically unfit to have babies they are protesting because they want to have sex with multiple partner and in case of pregnancy they want to go for abortion"
why should a rape victim go through months and months of dealing with a pregnancy that she didnt even want women who wants kids talk about the struggle of pregnancy but theyre happy because they actually want the child so its a little easier to deal with everything that come with it a child is a beautiful thing dont get me wrong but for a rape victim theyre not gonna be thinking i have a miracle baby no woman should ever have to conceive a baby that way all theyre gonna think about whether they give up the baby or not is the fact that its a rape baby and then what if its their very first child idk bout you but i wouldnt want my first child conceived by being a rape victim and forced to take care of it or give it upthats traumatizingjust saying
thanks for love of life americans 
good job us youre turning theocratic with every passing day
there was never a constitutional right to abortion you biased disgusting so called new organisation
"from what i can see the point that is completely lost in this whole issue is personal responsibility
if you check the numbers one percent of abortions are a result of rape and half that for incest next is medical reasons that leaves irresponsibility for the rest 
so instead of threatening violence for the right to kill an unwanted baby that you created how about being responsible with your body and your choices and dont get pregnant  not getting pregnant is very easy"
how dare these people in position of power think they have any right to tell a woman what to do with they own bodies  dont force religious beliefs on individuals wars have been caused by foolish people who claim they do things in gods name if abortion is now illegal will every man going to be out in prison for masturbation cuz shit thats killing thousands of kids every time we orgasm pro life people are blind to the truth they constantly contradict themselves and in outlawing abortion they themselves raised the suicide rate pro life equals pro death smfh
and just like that the democrats know what a woman is
abortion mean killing murder and who support that it is satanic generation
if you dont want to have babies dont have sex sex was designed primarily for procreation not for fun
still waiting for américa to go full nazi and invade europe
"bbc is another liberal media which is known for distortion of the truth first and foremost abortion is not enshrined in the american constitution secondly the judgement insist that abortion matters are solely states not a federal issue thirdly the judgement never banned abortion rather is specified a time frame in which abortions are permitted
why is bbc changing the narrative"
life won today indeed 
it was never a constitutional issue idiot it was a state issue like it is now i was 15 now im 65 and lost my nephew   when i got out of the marine corps cuz my sister in law got one
everytime the left opens its mouth they vindicate the right position  it is about human rights  all humans
thank your parents for not believing in abortions
satan must be rejoicing right now hes managed to capture the souls of all of gods little lambs to the so called christians just know that youve been suckered by the devil these are the same people that would crucify jesus were he to make an appearance today pathetic
i am a chinese and i am sad to say that in china we still dont have such law that can prevent us from stopping abortion i am very happy to see that america walks in the right way and i hope one day in my country abortion can be illegal
women not allowed a choice blacks  africans that turn their back on their own culture and worship a white mans god pro lifers that want to keep the right to shoot people trans men allowed in womens sport
crazy people upset because they cant kill babies anymore
land of the free
this is one of the stupidest decision america has made this year this is a personal issue why is it politicized
so many unreasonable adults out thereinstead of wearing a condom  or getting on the pill or getting a vasectomy  you would rather have an abortion
snowflakes meltdown make america great again from serbia
use a condom or birth control  stop being no class sluts
i thought they were supposed to be the land for the free  dont seem to free to me 129 i am very curious to know what devastation that person is talking about
from what i can concern these horrible women can die doing illegal abortionsthatll rid us of horrid minds
we in india has low rate of abortion
well now that abortion is going away maybe we can start focusing on banning religion next  
i welcome
will stop illegal sex
biden is a sad days for america
biden is a sad days for america
let me get this str8its ok for parents to kill their children and its ok for fathers to murder their children as well because they came from our ball sacks
what the fuk have humans become abortion is murder no person has a right to end life no matter what your fukin selfish excuses are
the news anchor is wrong nowhere in the constitution does it mention abortion read the constitution and the amendment
liberals always look mentally ill 
enjoy going backwards several 100 years moronsenjoy the civil war that becomes a result of this  what the hell were you thinking religious freaks  you dont think it prudent to ban guns youre all just plain old stupid
abortion is murder unless there is a threat to the mothers life or the child was conceived through incest or rape
i wonder how many of trumps girlfriend or flings he has given money to to have an abortion  for shame to all of you that think he is a god fearing man
land of the free 
"taliban country 
next step  girls arent allowed to go to school god bless the usa "
women do have a right to birth control married or not to kill an innocent baby just because momma failed to use contraception is not the babies fault abortion is legalize murder and should be treated as so 
"the biggest killer of women around the periparturient period is suicide sadly this i think will increase 

cant help but feel if this affected mens bodies the result would be different im glad biden had common sense"
first why dont they fix the loose gun laws  usa
and they call themselves champion of humans rights  usa
excellent news for the humanity not to the abortion not to the killing of innocent people now usa win a moral standard something that lost 50 years ago about the right to life the politicians supporting the abortion will see the will of the people
what are you talking about these kids are human beings they are alive
why do the right tolifers want to protect the unborn they are not protecting or giving a better right to life to those born and struggling right now the conservatives have stuck their middle finger up the hornets nest one time too many
reality will dictate whether this judicial ruling will be progress or regress im just here watching the future
a poor law has been dismembered just like the clinics that only exist to chemically poison or dismember unwanted pre born babies
this decision was made by the federalist society that nominates all republican appointed judges
womens bodyso let her decide plzzif a child is born without her wishthe baby will go through hardships what ever is happening in us is regressivein the name of baby murder you are actually snatching away the rights from the parentsplz put a ban on sex too
they will not fully celebrate until women are not allowed to wear pants biblical theolgy ia taught in schools and being gay is made a crime in all 50 states these people are insane
"america has once again proven itself to be the most backward thinking country of the civilised world land of the free i think notland of the enslaved and brainwashed more like oh watch out for the invisible man in the sky
the let morons buy military grade firearms to kill little children in school but dont let a woman make decisions about her own health and wellbeing i weep for the women who have lost their freedoms today"
what kind of country sets as its high mark those human rights practised in 1778
praise the lord  evil people are losing ground
next they make it legal to marry your dog

now we need to repeal the 19th
what a day now americans got true freedom
did the speaker of the house change the bathrooms in the white house so the pride man can walk in on her and ask for a kotex or a tampon just another opinion
i wonder how many of those pro lifers have adopted millions of kids no one wants but well just not mention that
usa has very quickly turned into a shithole children routinely murdered in schools by crazy people with assault rifles black people being assassinated in the streets by police officers and women being treated like second class citizens if men had to gestate abortions would be free and available on every street corner country is a complete joke
if you dont support abortion then you support illegal abortion  that is what will happen you may not like it but the facts  evidence of history prove it
this shows how backwards the usa is the right wing there is so hypocritical
so much seething in the comments section  sorry ladies no more killing your children at your convenience
it self rightious to pride yourself on the dictatorship of other peoples lives
the right to murder isnt something toshow off
every one of the self righteous birth slavers should be forced to adopt a number of rape babies and children in the system and pay reparations to the other children and families of women who died in childbirth or committed suicide after rape
"day after day it is proven that democracy and exces freedom fails creat and magnify people differences to a point where we are at now in the us 
exces freedom brings a miss by destroying all good and moral values 
a society with out these moral values and red lines is a random society that suffer deeply  its nothing but a broken everything"
hmi dont care one way or the other really but dropping roe doesnt seem like such a huge deal to me  if you have so little personal responsibility that you cant keep from getting accidentally pregnant just move to a state where the revolving door at the local abortion clinic is still openeasy fix
"i noticed generally that no one is discussing the actual case which i find a bit odd  the draft opinion says regarding roe

it relied on an erroneous historical narrative it devoted great attention to and presumably relied on matters that have no bearing on the meaning of the constitution it disregarded the fundamental difference between the precedents on which it relied and the question before the court it concocted an elaborate set of rules with different restrictions for each trimester of pregnancy but it did not explain how this veritable code could be teased out of anything in the constitution the his tory of abortion laws prior precedent or any other cited source and its most important rule that states cannot pro tect fetal life prior to viability was never raised by any party and has never been plausibly explained

roe and casey represent an error that cannot be allowed to stand

no ones discussing the actual decision  there is no right to abortion in the constitution  its not a constitutional right  the decision is logical  it makes sense  we cant just project laws onto legal documents that arent there"
im confused usa sent amry to war to protect dictatorships to protect women  yet youve just done what islamic state is you pro life but yet your law also states you can legally make a women be sterilized its a total disgrace
look forward to a decadent american society no irony intended
make the hills have eyes abhorrent again
"taliban  we are sht 
american supreme court hold my beer"
glory to god 
"women who are pro abortion saying its my body and i have the right to do what ever i want with it  i say like it or not humans were created or found or made  males and females females carry babies that is a given fact  you need to make peace with it and stop being angry about it  i agree its your body so please take responsibility of it  and do not get pregnant to start with if you are not ready for it  i beleive this is a reasonable request and with little caution it can be achieved
thanks"
prochoice people can protest the us supreme courts decision on banning abortion all they want  until theyre blue in the face but the highest law makers in land made their decision its final and its now carved in a granite stone slab and no one could change it so its best for everyone to accept  honor it it instead of fighting it
this happened in ethiopia
its easy dont shag or use prophylactics
looney left media does not report all the facts  abortion laws will be left up to individual states  california and new york it will be abortion as usual nothing will change  read the united states constitution before you report no amendment on abortion right shall not be infringed upon
there are other ways to deal with unwanted pregnancy than to kill a baby killing is not the answer killing is not the answer
glory be to god the victory is the lords any female who wants to get a botched abortion deserves to die as they try to kill a defenseless baby hoping they get caught and all who partake in it go to prison you evil murderers just remember god always wins and you will reap what you sow
you are the one who is removed mr president your words mean nothing to us
ok the brits can now sanction the usa for its human rights abuse
bruh people say save life but when these children grow up they dont grow up with the love they should have most just get negativity and suffering
years from now people will be denying they ever supported mass abortion deaths and stealing credit of its defeat from christian movements just like with abolition and alcohol regulations
the only reason a woman would be against abortion is because she was brainwashed by religion i just cannot see how that makes any sense whatsoever
sarah smith says the courts decision which she has obviously never read is radical  if anything roe was the radical decision  it propagated baldfaced lies about what is in the constitution because seven male justices wanted to pass their policy off as part of our basic law  the dobbs decision is a simple retreat from that fraud  during its five decades roe was never accepted by a unanimous supreme court it was partly overturned in 1992 and the only thing shocking now is that three justices still claim it is partly sound
use condoms and birth control your liberals idiots
what god do you serve god is against abortion
pro lifers want you to have the kid at any cost but you better not ask for social support services after the kid comes
maybe a pro abortion woman should be called a mummy
what the hell you protesting and crying about you flipping delinquents you want to be adults and kill un born babys but you dont wanna be an adult when having sex its called use a condom or birth control  dont see how having abortion is easier then just to use a condom or birth control young lady you not 21 you are 12 lol look at the people who want abortion bunch of clowns 
"it amazing that humans who are alive can support abortion as if they fell from the sky
imagine if those who support abortion were aborted"
i dont know much about us culture but if abortion is legalised for medical reason if mothers life is in danger and not for women who cant keep their legs together and act responsibly then it should not be a problem
right to abortion struck down thats one way of putting it but how about right to life for babies upheld  
as a society interest its better not doing abortion but as individual its high cost  unless we start to be more care for our actions and the government will help us  and close the gap
are those women crying because they cant murder babies anymoredisgusting human beings
teach young women to protect themselves if they dont want killing babies is not a choice is murdered
"this is a great news
acknowledging the sanctity of life"
government are all for abortion so they will overturn this give it a few months its just gonna have womens feel more accepting of it when they bring it back leading to more abortions than ever before shocking political tactic going on dumb shit
many ways to avoid children get your tubes tide or use a condom killing a human is not a choice is murdered
no abortions i agree 1million percent and i hope it happens all across americatoo all the fools protesting here you are marching the streets because you were not aborted even if life growing up was tough still here you are alive and well enough to march for killing an innocent childif you women marching dont want children then remove your wombs and become a condomno abortions is correct and jail time to the people causing these crimes
abortion is bad protect your sex if you do not want kids
abortion being banned in half the states the same states who wont pass better gun control laws so theyre for life unless its taken by a gun 
abortion shouldnt be illegal
its hilarious to watch all these baby murder  getting upset and also dont forget to do your peaceful protest
clear to see whos side the bbc is on
we are devo
forcing a woman to have a child is wrong but i dont agree to kill innocent babies
all these signs were made over night 
the least safe place in the us is in a mothers womb 15 billion unborn children have been  aborted in the whole world
21 and scared of what
haha fuck that country
family is blessing
"abortion is crime 
god bless all americans"
and you guys wonder why the rest of the world think your systems are retarded
horrible i feel sorry for womens who are raped and forced to give birth those who have a fetus with handicap  etc i am so stunned that womens are pro with this crap mind blowing those saint mary look alike  religious fanatics womens will regret it one day
these idiot women  will never  win the law have thec duty to  protect  the  baby  if you were not  rape
maybe contraception would be a better option than a vile abortion my body my choice no that s gone ever since the vaccine green pass when their was no choice for those who wanted a choice 
implement consequences for people who are making these unwanted children over and over and maybe theyll respect sex more i fostered a little girl who was her mothers 7th unwanted baby i believe she needs a forced hysterectomy
good why should judges make laws in a democracy the people elected by the voters should make laws but the truth is that our elites dont want that they consider the general population to be too stupid to make these decisions
prochoice should have a option of getting cab just like animals so they wont reproduce thats the biggest worry
"hey joe biden  how about fixing real problems using this as a shadow to cover up the real issues impacting us citizens today
biden says you us citizens feel better today  how about the main voting population retired  how do you feel now that you have lost 50 of your value  retirement funds gas cost over double food double housing cost and interest rates out the roof crime  all better right
inflation  all time high in us history
fuel diesel that moves america  highest in us history  double  remember biden said he was going to shut down fossil fuels work it out  all biden needs to do is open up usa energy 100  keystone pipeline finish it message it reduce taxes on oil and gas reduce limitations and regulations promote and build infrastructure new pipelines refineries get going on this and message it it will drive down futures cost of oil per barrel  cost per gallon  no need for tax holiday or gas card  do your job
transporation  production  farming cost up 100 due to fuel cost diesel  this is just passed onto goods cost which you us citizen pay
supply chain issues  never in the past have we had such issues with supplies store shelves are empty  critical items gone or in very short supply  and with fuel cost so high truckers truck companies are parking their trucks that will only add to the supply issues  and joe  dont blame shipping increase cost 1000  that is what it takes to fill up the tank with diesel and that cost is passed onto goods that consumers purchase  called economics something you and obama failed in
taxes  joe looking to raise corporate taxes where do you think corporations get money to pay their taxes the sale of goods so if taxes go up the cost of your end goods goes up inflation  biden does not understand economics

simple things to deal with let every state to decide if it is ok  this kind of thing can never be an issue in china and cannot image why it is so tricky in usa
"shame on the supreme court
a panel of 7 men should have never had the right to vote
not youre body not your choice
ladies if you need an abortion i hear canada welcomes you to visit
they believe in womens rights"
im sorry but what bloody right does a bunch of men and old at that have to tell women what they can and cant do with their bodies communism here we come how blind can people be
"this is what religion brings to your doorstep  war destruction segregation authoritarian rule dogma just evil overall 
note that this entire thing was brought on  not by muslims or hindus or atheists it was the christians  
christians did this welcome to christianity"
"what a misleading title it does not strike down abortion rights it simply says that it is not constitutional and gives it back to the democratic legislature

its a true pro democratic decision"
america what a shit hole
kinda sad when religion basically rules your country like in countries such as afghanistan or back in the medieval ages
misleading title they actually kicked the abortion decision back to the states
"the headline should read right to murder struck down by us supreme court
this isa a very welcome and humane decision  the mass slaughter of babies must stop
roe v wade was an evil antihuman pronazi proinfantacide progenocide and satanic decision
to see feminnazis crying in our streets because  the courts have restricted their right to murder  is a sickening sight  their mendacity  is incredible"
really this is a slap on the face of women all over the world
to bad for the baby killers
if youre like me youre scrolling the comments for the words  spock ears
"if women stop having sex will that put their lives in danger nope  plus they wont kill a new life 
there you go
sex is for married male husband and his female wife anyway  mark 1069"
right to abortion is like the right to murder
its all about there life all about them self and useing the word of its my body guess what britches god is fighting back for the rights of babyscos they are people too only little ones
the republicans are such hypocrites its sickening this decision ironically has nothing to do with life these people voted for trump which clearly says they are not playing with a full deck of cards this decision has set america backand more is to come these republicans may not be that bright but the combination of power and ignorance left in their hands is entirely dangerous for this country
amazing   this is going to save millions of babies
its still legalstop freaking out
jeez i seriously hope god doesnt condone this stuff 
killing babies is not a right ladies   what woman  has a right to murder babies 
"i dont really understand why most ppl seem to be against it even though theres still 15 weeks for ppl to decide whether they want the baby or not 
its not 15 days its 15 weeks almost 4 month the baby would grow up to human shape and be able to move inside the uterus how could anyone even consider doing such horrible thing if you really have difficulties raising childrenuse protection if its an accident hey you still have like 3 months to decide starting from tje late period
if anyone consider himselfherself    a human being start to act like one instead of shouting for the freedom that you wasnt supposed to have as a human being"
pretty obvious that brits do not understand our constitution since abortion is not mentioned in the constitution it is not one of the enumerated powers granted to the federal government therefore under the 10th amendment abortion falls to the states or to the people this ruling is actually more democratic that the arbitrary dictate imposed by roe vs wade
"they could at least have made exceptions for victims of sexual abuse incest and when doctors know there is like 90 chance of downs syndrome

 but honestly i am not so sure normal healthy pregnant women should have a right to free surgery for a self inflicted condition that poses no health risks how can killing a healthy fetus be part of the hippocratic oath of treating the ill and doing no harm if a woman have a right to an abortion a doctor should also have the right to say no id rather spend my precious time treating cancer and bullet wounds than perform unnecessary surgery on the healthy"
thank god  thank you for delivering little babys from the hands of monsters
human rights should include all humans and for those who would dehumanize the unbornyoure one step closer to being dehumanized by others who think you have no value
i dont see them adopting any new borns they just want live babys so they can have dead aoilders
does bbc and its audience understand that the united states is a federation of states and what that means in light of the 9th and 10th amendments to its constitution
once i was pro choice  as i become older however i became aware how precious the  life is i saw the people dying in combat i saw the people dying in this pandemic covid19 especially youngone that they can not help themselves i realized that life is precious and is given only once and need live it to the fullest in that regard  i rethought of  the value of life that everyone even unborn human being called fetus has right to live and giving a choice to them to choose to live or die that is the true pro choice i am now pro life i have message for pro choice women and  if one is against unwanted pregnancy first and foremost use caution in mating and if that did not work or was in  a situation it cant be exercised  consider adoption rather than killing a baby unborn child yes we need change the law but not the legalizing a murder  in that regard we need  make it easier for mothers with unwanted child and up to child under 5   to put up for an adoption and make it more easier in general adoption that is responsibility of law makers up until now law makers they choose easy way out by legalizing murder now they need gather and go to work
anyone else noticed that the two women at the beginning are ones that no man would ever be physical with
so glad trump decided to elect those three judges lifewins adoptionsaveslives babylivesmatter oh and by the way with great pleasure comes great responsibility
i m from brazil where abortion is prohibited since always  thousands of women do illegal abortions without safety or healthy carethousads are arrested more than 50 thousand a year brazilian press never talk about this subject  something like dont  ask dont tell the problem is not going to disappear women will keep seeking abortion too much hipocrisy and religious bullshitthats a men world we know since early childhoodfree women around the world
this is a strike against women period its about power and control solely the right to freedom of choice for anything for women  lets be honest is devastated by this ruling ugly gillead in on our doorstep
what we will never hear is biden say that something has gone his way
what i dont understand is why are they over turning this how bad was it that they need to overturn it was this really a problem now days
why does the law in the usa consider the murder of a pregnant woman a double homicide if an unborn  baby is not yet a life
how many of these woman protesting against abortion will or have adopt a child from an orphanage reality is if woman who cannot or mentally refuse to take care of a child now that they cant make an abortion theyll just leave the kid and unfortunately staticaly not a lot of children get adopted and the ones who dont are kicked out of orphanage at the age of 18 unfortunately statistics for these young people is not good so yes sure protest for life but this decision will lead to a lot of young people having not so good of a life
"everyone has the right to move to another stateif abortion is important for you there a a dozens of states that are better suited for you 
please respect the courts ruling it was a democratic decision by a bipartisan elected court"
"oh god more fact lite partisan bullshit from the bbc color me surprised  
reality check  mostly false the scotus has ruled that the federal government has no right to impose this poorly written unconstitutional law its up to individual states to decide in california new york oregon alaska you can abort your baby right up to the point of birth as its head emerges you can cut it off bc its still not human most us states had laws permitting abortion up to 30 weeks now they are free from federal control allowed to set the limit themselves people can actually vote locally to change those limits its called democracy"
"i can not understand the government

in germany it is so that one may carry out an abortion only then
if since conception fertilization no more than twelve weeks have passed 
this corresponds to the 14th week of pregnancy
the meaning behind it is that namely after expiration of this period the protection of the unborn child takes effect and must be ensured according to the federal constitutional court

now the discussion about the deletion of paragraph 219a of the penal code stgb which then allows doctors on their website to advertise for abortion to be allowed to perform and accordingly

with the new government since 122021 in the office is and not from conservative members consists i am sure the paragraph 219a is abolished

it belongs as i mean to a liberal society that one may feel freely about it
but it is also due to the principle of protection of the unborn child as soon as the 14th week of pregnancy passes 
this should not be changed

i am happy that we have here as one of the few countries in the world a federal constitutional court which alone has the right to decide on such morally difficult questions
also private persons can sue for their right
as the highest court that stands above all courts its judgment is unchallengeable
one talks in germany also of residencecity of the right or there i go up to karlsruhe in order to assert its right karlsuhe  name of the city where the court is
"
poor people and mentally deranged should not have babies periodi know this firsthandhowever the const really does not say anything about abortion so the roe law had no basiswhich is why they reversed it and now each state will enact their own laws which is how it should beif u dont want kids2 optionsclose your legs or drive over state line like ca and they will do it for free i imagine so they can take the fetus and do stem cell research on it for their miracle drugs
killing black peoples is murder  thats why i dont listen to yp  they say abortion is murder but killing black people isnt
"the manosphere and their pickmes must be jumping for joy at this ruling gone will be those 5 unholy decades when desirable fertile women with better jobs better education and more fulfilling and diverse sex lives would run around free in both choice and options and unburdened with both childcare and deadbeat husbands because misery sure loves company especially with the chance to pull our said attractive heroines down a peg or two off their pretty perches

seriously its the jealousy and resentment from the unfulfilled and unhappy people in society who would want to put women back to biblical times  sheesh"
were taking this country back from you limp wristed leftists no more baby killing no more gay marriage no more male transvestites using the restrooms with our daughters no more gun control were arming everyone with a concealed firearm and eliminating criminals if you dont like living under our new rules nothing is stopping you from moving to another country

i wanna put my hands on them so bad
i find it funny how even after banning abortions conservatives never had a plan to prevent possible situations where abortions are needed from happening like free contraceptives more and better sex ed in schools funding families and mothers who didnt want a child and cant afford one improving the foster care and adoption system and making penalties for rape more severe especially if the rape results in an unwanted child
protect the right of life liberty  pursuit of happiness for the unborn  ride the red wave and vote the baby killing demonic democrats out of office
free cheeseburger day at the court house
a theocracy just like iran
praise the lord no more murder
"the number one cause of death worldwide 
is killing unborn babies 
that did not have a choice"
this is the  greatest verdict ever given by the supreme court in the states abortion is deplorable because it means killing to those who endorse abortion i would say that you have no right to kill somebody for your own pleasure that said the victims of rape and those who have to undergo an abortion on medical ground have to be exempted from this law
so much for the land of the free more bs 
hahaha you making me laugh stop westing people time to cover body parts stealing crime
"if you do not want a baby do not make one 
if a baby is conceived by violence give the baby up for adoption 
a rapest does not get the death penalty"
12weeks is a good determination point on deciding whether or not to continue the pregnancy that is the point where the fetus thereafter gains consciousness and the point where a woman is able to assess elements like drug addiction health social climate or whether her child should be forced to live in dirt poor poverty and lowlife quality etc now that roe is struck population will explode in ranks of those already poor who are already struggling andor unable to have basic human needs and facing homelessness at it is now let alone there being any hope of their kid going to college and prospects for anything other than existence and being dirt poor and on welfare from birth to death once upon a time centuries ago it was ok to flood the earth with population unchecked and now this population has wiped out the rain forests and i predict the strain on water will be the next as human population increased to todays level god gave abortion to man to remedy  control his numbers   take a look at the situation with lake mead for instants then go ahead and crank out another several million babies beyond the capacity of our planet
republicans love fetuses not children they vote against everything that helps poor children they call it socialism
the states will decide which is a right thing
the constitution makes no mention of abortions mam 
me and my dad had a long conversation about this last night he even mentioned it was a very emotional day at work because of this setback he was at work when this happened it is very saddening to think that they also might even take away lgbtq rights
its not your land it belongs to the native people
no one has the right to tell a women what to do with their body  get rid of everything in washington the are not for the people  dont you get it this hes way beyond abortion rights they are causing chaos so they can get total control
the solution is easy stop voting for the american taliban republicans
having a child born or not is the right belongs to the woman because it only affects her health and her life why do they have to waste time considering that law when there are many other things that need their attention things that affect life of many people like guns or petrol
how about telling all the women and girls to stop opening their hairy legs and having sex without protection there are consequences of your actions
responsible sexual contacts  in case of crime related cases womans life is medically in peril from pregnancy then abortion maybe justified  a offspring has right to life too
"what it means to follow christ in iran
the iranian government is among the most oppressive regimes in the world it is illegal to leave islam and christians face the constant threat of imprisonment and being falsely charged with acting against national security for owning bibles or even talking about christ christians are routinely fired from their jobs and it is difficult for a known believer to find a job or rent a home many christians gather in secret fellowships and receive teaching through christian media smuggled into the country and through broadcast media several christians are currently imprisoned and many others are under house arrest awaiting sentencing

access to bibles
it is illegal to own print import or distribute bibles since they are so difficult to obtain bibles are treasured by iranian believers few have their own copy of gods word give bibles"
only 25 of the american population believe that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances if any gop member tries to do that they will fail miserably
"the country is riddled with problems like homelessness drug addiction and poverty and these sanctimonious judges have no idea how the overturning of roe vs wade will impact on the lives of millions of women theyre a bunch of dinosaurs idiots  who turn a blind eye to an obviously corrupt ex president and his cronies and claim to have god on their side in making this decision 
they are bible thumping  heartless and privileged they didnt need to do this they did it because they wanted to and because they could
  only a woman forced to make a choice when confronted with an unwanted pregnancy can understand the consequences of and bear responsibility for an abortion it is a personal matter 

government should not intervene but give every assistance possible to help women who find themselves in the position of  having to make that choice come to the right decision do what is best for them
is it harder for a woman to give a baby up for adoption than have an abortion perhaps

many wealthy  couples in america who have fertility issues will be clapping their hands because there will be more babies available for adoption for sure there will be a market for discarded offspring whose interests are being served here"
"i do not agree with an abortion ban nor do i side with feminists who honour an abortion i am against a blanket ban or a complete authorisation for abortion

aborting a children at the first trimester should be legal after that should be banned most of the abortion happens before the 12th week anyways

at the time the child is not really a child yet and it gives the women the rights to choose

the left and rights both have their agenda which i loath but this overturning should be expected because it has no legal ground of that the state shouldve made legislations in the past"
i feel sorry for the rape victims and those at medical risk but the fact that you can just get pregnant and then kill a life that depends on you for survival is wrong
usa going backwards
"the problem no problem
 far too many people
 with far too little to do
 with far too little education andor critical analysis skill
 with far too many glib opinions and untested assumptions
 being governed by people with the same credentials"
gosh so much foreign news on johnsons bbc

"losing the right to abortion    how about they might actually consider the idea of avoiding pregnancy in the first place   why is noone addressing this question   or is that too difficult for their tiny minds to comprehend   these selfish ignorant women dont seem to think it incumbent upon them actually to prevent unwanted pregnancy   

few pregnancies are the result of rape which is a different question"
whats next make it illegal to have sex before marriage
this shows how many people were getting abortions because they had to be turned away
all these morons are angry because they cant go around and have unprotected  sex anymore 
when these children are starving when these children of suffering from life without parents  when they suffer at the hands of parents who were forced to provide them with life and are nowhere close to ready to have kids when they are abused by the profiteers of the defenseless human traffickers  you best believe i will be there to remind you of your abject failure i will make sure you know that simply living is not life  not for a human being not for someone who has the conscience understanding of the hell in which they live there will now be millions that suffer not just the woman that is raped and you believe that to be by divine province you sick twisted rats  the people who will suffer are those who will be abandoned not only by their mothers but by the society that forced them to live and then blamed them for not being good enough
actually makes me sick and im not even american its just so wrong
i think this a sad backward move for women every woman should have the right to her decision regarding her own body
aight im moving to britain
"abortion is killing

1973 was the year i was paralyzed in an accident and abortion was legalized by the supreme court 2022 the supreme court reversed that decision and i am happy i wish the supreme court would reverse my paralysis im getting tired of hurting everyday
be aware the lude media is a traitor of america
glory to god 
this is simple its about the court saying the abortion issue is up to the states each state shall determine how they want to manage the issue of abortion if a state wants to limit abortion to medical emergencies then they have the legal right to do that if congress wants to pass a law concerning abortion then they will need the necessary votes in the house and senate

i think that numbers of lesbians will grow much  same goes for the toys in sex shops
for a country that constantly barks to the world about its freedoms and rights the usa does not have 1 a constitutional right to housing  2 a constitutional right to abortion instead they prioritise their right to own an ar15 above such rights even after the massacre of children in schools what a backward uncivilised shit hole
you should get your facts right abortion has not been deniedit never was in our constitution it simply says that the states should decide by the people of that state check your facts

life wins life has the final word abortion kills innocent lives it s not about womens bodies it s about the body of innocent little fetal infants  those who are chanting my body my choice on abortion are the very same who refused to chant  my body my choice on masks and vaccine if only logic was what they were after abortion is murder stop it
the only right that will remain is the right to shoot 8yearolds crazy country
are democrats now usingbunborn children to get the power to outlaw courts and emotional manipulate to vote   for them in the midterms  anyway timing is perfect just before midterms
but you can kill kids in school with guns in the us and nobody really cares idiots still have guns

if thats to control the raising amount of early teen pregnancy then its good
very sad people cant take care of themselves they want to kill the unborn abstain if you cant take care
as clarence thomas already stated in his opinion im afraid this is probably only the first of many serious blows this court will hand out against civil liberties in the us everything is at stake gay rights contraception meaning every single form you could think of even voting rights as a whole and civil rights of minorities and the gloating demeanor of republicans about this rule leaves little doubt that this is about anything else than domination and throwing the other side into unconditional submission they will evidently stop at nothing to achieve this and they literally got away unpunished after attempting a coup
"its not totally reversed bbc it means the individual states now have the power to ban or keep  abortions

abortion is not a constitutional right  it is upto personal interpretation gun right is 2nd amendment
death is not the worst of all evils
these days american exceptionalism means moving away from what the civilized world considers progress
america is a hell of a scary place i will never visit such a pro gun and anti women country yall are backwards
if safe sex was practiced there would be little need for so many abortions ironic how freedom means freedom to have casual sex and also freedom to abort babies weve lost all sense of self control
so this is how liberty dies  pademe star wars
all the pro abortion are storming the bastille now attacking government buildings in arizona and other states 
only woman has full right over her sexual organ and consequence of its usage
if you can afford to pay for an abortion as often as it seems most of you have abortions you can definitely afford to drive to another state if your state has restrictions if you dont drive buy a bus ticket its a small percentage of the cost of an abortion
america a country of dangerous religious nut jobs if only they had oil so we could all invade and liberate them
fuck me just pure delusion glad im from the uk where if an innocent girl is raped she doesnt have to keep her abusers baby
well the title is so misleading the right to abortion is not struck down by this ruling what this ruling means is that the decision whether to ban or limit the term of abortion to a certain number of weeks during pregnancy is up to the states legislature to decide
stem cell research had come along way from abortion
america fuckedthey must have the dumbest populace on earth
doesnt the us have more pressing issues than abortion
america a truly backwards country one day it shall fall
the trivialization of what must remain for exceptional cases is never a good thing  for all those who truly believe in god the respect of the sacredness of life must always prevail and must be always be preserved from the nefarious desacralization of life  amen 
pro life  yet they are not protesting to have gun laws changed the things that are taking lives in schools
wow wow wow wow wow this is the decision from the lord against the innocent blood that is being shared
 how usa will now lecture the on human rights and freedom
americas version of christianty is closer to extremist islamcathlotisism than any semblence of humanity
your country does care about you morons it just isnt letting people with multi coloured hair tell them what to do
they loves unborn babies as long as theyre not mexican
pregnancy is extremely dangerous for humans compared to other mammals the reason so many women die from child birth is not the abortion it is because it is quite dangerous for a woman to give birth and alot of women do die in child birth even when the child survives
"if youre pro life you should also be a vegan to make sure youre not contributing to the suffering and murder of innocent animals who are considered life and have nerves like people so they can feel pain you should also be living off grid in a self sustainable commune so as to make sure you dont contribute to an economy that relies heavily on the destruction of eco systems not to mention our planet

but no its nothing to do with protecting life its about being a religious nutcase"
the bbc should be pro or against abortion but the bbc is clearly pro abortion and that is not news its pure and simple activism
what the hack is going 
trumps strategic planning is on some next level
there trying to take our freedom rights and whats next we already keep track of us but yet millions of people are homeless children being abused left behind in currupted foster care and people keep buying guns and killing taking peoples lifes you tell me whats wrong in this picture
the reality is that this decision is from the supreme court  they are the final arbiter for the entire country  this cannot simply be repleaded like a bill in a special session of congress or a revoked with a executive order  it can only be reversed with another abortion case from the ground up in a local court  in other words it will take years for this to actually change
fu sake why are these people trying to kill young babies
the left and democrats dont like it when it doesnt go there way and they cry  about it
america needs to start tackling real problems like affordable housing of which there is none for minimum wage single men women only have to have kids and they are set up until the new born is 18 yrs old sort out free hospitals like the rest of the civilized world and make social housing a real thing that is accessable to the homeless the mentally ill poor and the poorly educated become homeless it is not only predictable and a should be a human right to a place to sleep and dont get me started on guns holy shit
enshrined  clearly not 
the problem with america is its full of americans
quite likely something to do with the rights of the child bbc you need to report news without bias
america is a broken country
why do they always focus on the absolute minority ie incest rape etc the overwhelming majority of women getting abortions are sleeping wrecklessly with men they should stop being a slut and get their priorities straight
all women in the usa should stop having sex until this law is changed
this is a womans problem and should be left up to the woman and man should ask them selfs  if there wife was giving birth and they where ask it is the wife or the babys life which one would they save 
sorry but your country is going backwards when mostly men and some of them are that old they wouldnt have a clue what sex was about decide that its illegal to have abortions then there is something sadly wrong what a disgrace
so they cry and cry when it  doesnt go  there way but you told if you dont have the vaccine youre killing everyone
choose two methods of contraception choose to not sleep with anything and everything choose life lots of choice still out there where does it say in the constitution that women have the right to murder their unborn
republicans desperately hoping stripping peoples freedoms away will give them some whataboutism ammunition whenever jan 6 is mentioned the simple fact they dont care about living people proves the concern about the unborn is a lie
based decision
conservatives have blood on there hands
they pretend to save unborn lives while risking those of the living mothers and once those children are born all those politicians applauding the most now could not care less about the poverty and violence many of these kids will grow up in  until they get shot at school
there is finally a glimmer of hope in americamurder of innocent babies can never be right
a small group of old white christian men dictating to all jewish women muslim women buddhist women oh america  what have you done

"this is just going to promote more death and hurt for babies abortions are painless safe procedures that guess what kills nothing 

but now women the victim of rape or incest will be made to carry their child and those women might even just murder the baby from the postpartum depression i mean they would have gotten prosecuted if they got it as an abortion anyway 

women whos babies are severely disabled in the womb and wouldnt live more than a few hours are going to have to spend months carrying a child only to hold them in her arms while they feel the pain of failing organs and death when they could have been given that mercy without the traumatic experience of birth 

many women will die from dangerous pregnancies that they could have survived from by just getting an abortion and living to have another child

this isnt a win for life this is a win for the continuous suffering of women and children these people are disgusting"
abortion is not now nor was it ever in the constitution stop reporting falsehoods bbc nonsense stick to your own countryyou got plenty of issues to deal with to keep your ratings up thank god for this decision states now as they should have control and power back to the people
this will not end well
shut up women and do as men say 
jus imagine countries in asia allow abortionusau have lost it
where is potato head in all of this
you created a child its not like adopting a puppy and giving it back
perhaps this will force people from using abortion as a form of contraceptive this ruling of course does not erode the various exemptions for abortion neccesitated by rape incest and medical emergencies stop reporting this news as though this decision automatically bans all abortions
for the land of the not free and the home of the insane 
amazing news for good people everywhere abortion brings too much darkness
what is wrong with america
allowing abortion is controlling poor masses who lack sexual responsibility blacks and latinos i mean democrats will now have large unplanned families which can be exploited by the labour sector by rich white supremacists and also they will provide armies for advancing external aggression because of unemployment
time zones are crazy in australia its 9am in in rome its 1am and in america its 1942
the most dangerous place for a child in the us is the womb all this ridiculous fighting its a womans right
right to life won right to kill innocents
ive seen left wing activists protesting in manchester england to protect womens rights to kill a baby  theyre so concerned about it they even protest for women in another country to kill a baby  yet at the same time they cant or wont tell you what a woman is  
history repeats itself as someone whom studied history we are a powder keg once there is a spark itll get ugly
i hope the religious freaks who forced this are prepared to raise those children i wonder if america has gone down the shithole so much it will present each newborn with a gun
production for adrenochrome and demand for fetal material will be in a crisis  this is more than a womens right this is a challenge to  big business  i guess when they start to abort a fully formed child at term even god himself had to step in
theyre alive so they arent in position of talk about abortion let the aborted babies tell about it
prolife i hope theyre willing to look after unwanted children and not just take joy in seeing people suffer for their mistakes
america is actually fucked
the left just can not catch a break   lol 
since abortion was legalised the family unit has been decimated i hope abortion becomes illegal in my home country the uk
land of the not so free
vile backwards selfentitled country devoid of values and a scar upon history yet with the pomposity to think theyve a right or a moral position from which to judge the rest of the world and lecture it on human rights and democracy your country employ torture you consider other peoples bodies your right and there are more of you incarcerated than any other population on earth you experiment on your own people mk ultra treat black people minorities and immigrants like dirt you make health unattainable for many of your people and you probably have the most crooked profiteering health systems in at least the developed world many of you still fly a flag of slavery the kkk have been allowed to persist the majority wont even consider the slightest of gun law changes and if i wanted to get shot id think first warzone then america and you have caused nothing but misery woe and destruction around the world you also elected an illiterate narcissistic ableist racist who incited an act of terror but of course we wont call it that because hes white and claims to be christian which by the way you force down everyones throat and use to signal virtue even though most pretend commandments 2 3 4 and 10 dont exist that is who you are america so stop strutting around pretending to have a morsel of moral integrity or authority it is baseless
killing innocent children saved your life evil people imagine your mother took your life will you be alive now thank god its overturned
"the devestation and violence of abortion ahahaha what are they talking about what was happening at the arbortion clinic perhaps they should increase security at the clinic give every doctor a gun to solve the issue make sure theres only one door they could have translated their logic from gun laws kewk   

clowns"
"i will be exposing my case of child trafficking whereby i was trafficked to tom cruise after writing to jimmy saville asking to meet tom cruise  thereafter my aunt my main guardian was misdiagnosed and murdered by the nhs i k by monarchy due to the fact she exposed depopulating and debilitating tactics used by the uk monarchy upon children whereby they distributed milk cartons which contained poisonous ingredients  to babies in nurseries and those who lived on council estates which led to infant death and deformities 

after my aunts death i was trafficked to france frontignan 1995 to tom cruise assaulted hosed down with a firehose and molested whereby he exposed his small genitals  ghislaine maxwell was in the resort as was nicole kidman 

thereafter upon returning to the uk i was systematically assaulted terrorised and raped by various freemasonic individuals who were involved in paedophile networks and sex rings led and protected by the uk monarchy 

i had 3 children from 2 of the men involved in this criminal network all 3 have been trafficked to paedophiles  my elder son lushaan aged 12 has been trafficked to a male who is not related to him and has been tortured and terrorised by both the criminal paedophile working for the uk monarchy and the authorities my younger son aged 6 mohammed ahsan being abused by his grandfather who is a known paedophile this family were known to the authorities and working for them my daughter yasmeenah has also been subjected to severe abuse which includes food deprivation and a humiliating torture she has been unlawfully adopted and i have not seen her or my younger son since 2019


this email will be circulated to every country to spread the truth and spread awareness of what the uk monarchy are engaged in daily the fact they have always adopted nazi regimes which oppress the most vulnerable in society and systematically abuse the weakest of all the children the uk monarchy harbour paedophiles and agree with child rape  torture and child trafficking for profit


all my childrens human rights have been disregarded by this scum uk monarchy and their vile lowlife spineless cowardly nazi cronies"
lets see how many women die needlessly because of this law my thoughts go out to those women who have lost another right 
this is not about abortion it is about the full term abortion that has become common place in the us where the body parts of these innocent children are recovered for profit and for stem cell research made legal under bush and as yet has not cured any paralyzed person as promised by george
imagine crying for losing your right of killing a newborn
the british state media frothing at the mouth that murders are restricted the babylon broadcasting corporation hates life particularly innocent life
yessssgood news
the wokeistsfascists are determined to abolish free speech they are starting with removing the right of choice for women
who has a right to tell a woman what to do with her own body especially men
good win for god and humanity
"theyre not pro life theyre pro birth they couldnt care less what happens after 
what a truly backward country"
"ones body is ones property and so is whats inside ones property 
so who is the man or woman that believes ones property belongs to them  "
"jesus loves the little children as the clueless are singing here except those that were apparently saved from abortion now having to grow up with easily preventable trauma loves the little children except those who had to deal with being raped and now forced to birth a child that will only cause them more trauma to themselves and that childs baby will also have to deal with trauma growing up

and no adoption is not an option that should be a default every child in the adoption system deals with trauma regardless of the age they were put into it yes including if they were a newborn it is not an option to easily default to"
its not a constitutional right its nowhere in the constitution
i dont care if youre christian your book will never dictate what should i do in my life let alone affect my humanity
its a good thing   glory be to god
just wrong 
i understand extreme cases for abortion and agree with them but what about the hundreds of thousands of women globally that basically use abortion as another form of contraception no thought or responsibility for your actions  this is what we really need to be speaking about in society as for biden and the dems this was the guy and party that was supposed to unify the usa hows that working out joe  your political and ideological rhetoric has over half of your population convinced some form of civil war is coming cessation of states from the union is definitely on the horizon the show trial that is jan 6th the dems using the dojfbi  to persecute your political adversaries an in doing so demonise about a third of your population hitler did this during the 1930s and we all know how that turned out
"im a christian woman who is 21 weeks pregnant and just because i have moral biblical beliefs that doesnt mean my beliefs need to be forced upon others the us is not a christian country built upon tyranny that has been completely forgotten 
the best part about the us iswas religious freedom for all well not anymore we are literally in babylon now

jesus is  about freewill choice love forgiveness of sins mercy and treating others how youd want to be treated god never ever forces others to obey his commandments he always gives people the choice to choose it is satan himself that forces people to bow to him and to conform to his twisted will"
"women will die from botched abortion is like saying people can get arrested if they commit murder
actions have consequences"
then increase rape sentences and respect womens rights
you republicans do u realise  what u have actually gone and done to your womenin your own home  think  goddammit  your jesus christ is not gonna come down and help you 
to all of you promoting abortion who by the way have been born defending someone to born is at least selfish really who you are to take someone life are you supporting industry of abortus as someone god given right to decide who is going to live and who is going to die
217 incredible hulk copped a feel
america is so backwards such a laughing stock

and that was it for the last democracy on earth welcome to the dark age 20
lets force males to breed oh thats right america is a sexist country run  by misogynist males
the religious right are as bad as the taliban
the death of any innocent human being is always wrong and murder if you dont want children dont have sex the totally depraved of the human heart is seen in the murder of babys and casual sex what rights are taking away from unborn babys before they are murdered
take precautions against getting pregnant if you dont want kids dont create life then destroy it you have to be pure thick to not understand that you dont have that right to kill human life
america is an interesting country u protecting fetuses but not kids who are already born with mad parents transitioning them at young as 2 years old these are the kids that need the most protection
"why are women fighting so hard to kill babies

babies have the right to live 

its not your choice to commit murder on babies

disgusted by all these women

learn to use a condom or keep your legs closed"
youd think they enjoy killing babies with the way theyre going on about it
i guess this sort of thing can only happen in america
now woman will die from botched abortions kids will overrun the adoption centres and kids will continue to grow up with poor moralseducationgood experiences due to living with parents who dont want themare not prepared for them what a way to continue to screw up the country looks like america is heading towards districts hmu in 2050 yo
i expected more people to protest but nope
this isnt removing the right to abortion its just now down to individual states
good welldone america its not a right at all
"634 million babies murdered since roe vs wade 1973

"that is only half my mind on that 
im so glad i married a real woman
my wife has had 6 embryos that are still alive and expressing life 
every embryo 
even one cell of living human should be able to choose their way of life as god intended no one should judge condemning to death those who are unable to defend themselves 
the end result of every non molested embryo has been a living soul"
do you have contraception in the usa
"women of america come to england where men are real men and wont try to enslave you 
or in those states refuse to have sex anymore"
whys everyone anti abortion butt ass ugly and never going to have a waine
"land of free  biggest joke ever
usa is a christian country  religion should not part of the decisions a country makes usa has relegated 200 years in the past today"
theres no excuses for getting pregnant by accident these days women have so many options to stop that happening i hope they bring this law into the uk
america has literally gone to shit
nothing has been banned
usa has no right to exist existence of usa is a error which must be corrected
these stupid gullible women that think god is real and voting to ban abortions are they trying to say if they were raped by some disgusting evil ugly man that they would willingly have that baby and love it and they would not look at that child and be reminded of what happened every minute of the day for the rest of their lives bullshit and the leaders of these groups deserve it happening to them then see them run to the nearest abortion clinic as nobody wants anything to do with them after being raped pregnant and happy about it this is a sick law and anyone agreeing with it is a mindless sick individual
"taking away rights from people that have had those rights for more then 50 years will not go well  then threatening to take away more rights will absolutely guarantee that you wont live in a happy country no matter which side youre on   taking away rights against the wishes of a large majority and doing it in the name of god by a financial right wing of catholic judges will only turn millions more against the church  that will get even worse and unrepairable when women start dying  
add this to their ruling that anyone can carry a concealed hand gun in new york city and congress still allowing 18 year olds to buy assault rifles and its the beginning of a dying country"
if woman have the right to abortion man should  have the right to deny alimony
"they seem to think a woman is simply nothing but a carrier for the next human life that is to appear upon the face of this earth therefore a female who is raped or has been incested her feelings is not consider

the people making these laws against abortion rights are no different from those in other places  giving orders for  the clitoris of women and girls to be cut out"
i am prolife it is good news yes abortion is a murder
if you want an abortion go to a state its legal they wont be checking your abortion papers like they do with the covid papers bafoooooons
608  why did her boyfriend beating her  raping her everyday as you say  shouldnt that had been address with a call to the police or the girl calling her parents before becoming an unwanted pregnancy  now that some how justifies another really bad decision in taking a babies life  there are 3 times more abortions then rapes every year and we also know that only a small percentage of those get pregnant  which means majority of the women are using killing a baby as birth control  oopsy cmon people
i hope they stop unwanted pregnancies with easier access to contraception if they dont want to stop unwanted pregnancies then stopping abortion is an unbearable or even fatal decision towards the mother and could be torture to the baby who was conceived through incest
"all thats happened is they have given the right back to the people instead of the government

if its illegal in your state vote in pro abortion leaders simple no one has lost anything the blue states can still do what they want the red states will do what they want"
america is suc
well we clearly know on which side bbc is
its always the ugly ones
the dems havent been this mad since they had their slaves taken away from them
millions of women in the us losing their rightto kill their baby or we could saymillions of babies are gaining their right to live life

and the unborn child is called a fruit for a reason it is very clear in the bible that abortion is not murder"
why get pregnant in the first place
celebratelord himself walks with you pro life
good decision by usa  court
it looks like america has lost it in more ways than one with this court ruling i am afraid over population has consequences just be ware
mothers who murder their children how about the childrens rights because they cant speak then they have no right

burn the bbc to the grow
9 unelected people thinking they have the right to radically regress a country land of the free
people should be more careful and use condoms
women have the right over their own bodies and when onemale takes advantage of that the woman has to carry and so this is emotionally and mentally and physically demanding to a woman and so they make the decision for their health to have the bubble break and be removed woman did not consent to having their bodies invaded men do not understand the depth of making this decision and if male had made this decision over woman then stand fast ladies and fight a global fight woman understand women so dont allow them to tell you what to do the organisations and courts are private corporations and so you as living women do not consent and you do not have to accept any ruling which is just an act to overturn it by private corporations federal and state are private corporations
abortion is ungodlylife matters
"this judgement suggest results of political bias for appointment in judiciary

i salute the supreme court this the happiest day 
i predict this will result in a brain drain women who can will flee while others will suffer an increase in crime rates and maternal mortality increase in violence against women the problem with absolute ideals is that tend to be bloody
"a dark day for humanity no one has the right too tell women what to do with their bodies 
this is disgusting 
the far right christians who endorse this are the scourge  of humanity you have no right 
your god is a sick narcissist my god is caring and compassionate 
the christian movement are no different to a cartel
your religion is a tool of control not compassion"
"ive noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born

ronald reagan"
roasties furious that they have to take responsibility for their degenerate behaviour
adultery and formication should also have punishable results to limit women getting pregnant in the first placeits not rocket science
"ok to all you pro lifers let me give you a little analogy i am a woman of which has an abusive and violent husband one night my husband comes into the bedroom yelling and screaming at me because i forgot to do something he then proceeds to rape and violate my privacy a few weeks pass by and something doesent feel right and i discover im pregnant with my violent and abusive husbands child now lets say that this ban has been put into place i should be forced to endure a 9 month nightmare carrying the child of someone i am begging to get away from and throughout the pregnancy he still continues to be violent and invasive one night i go into labour and i am rushed to the hospital and things arent looking good my blood pressure is through the roof im passing out every few minuets and waking up screaming in pain i come close to death itself i then have to raise that child whilst their father continues to abuse me and possibly my child which can cause trauma in that childs life or teach the child that its ok to hurt people they then grow up to be a violent person and cause more crime in america

should i still have to have that baby 

let me add that even when this ban comes into place people are still going to have an abortion they are gonna resort to the illegal unsafe and possibly deadly forms of abortion because to bring that child into the world will bring them an unholy amount of trauma so whats the point let me give you another example of why this ban is pointless murder is what you call abortion well murder is illegal everywhere its banned but people still do it your arguments are unbelievably invalid

you argue that a clump of cells is life and its wrong to do so well everything is a clump of cells and youve probably stepped on an ant or some form of insect you destroyed that life why limit it for humans"
report the truth i know its hard for you lot at the bbc
and retardation in the west just grows and grows as time goes by
yes this is good news for us now all the countries of the world should do the same  abortion is murder and thoses that are fighting for abortions are also murderers
bbc is fake news
great news for the rights of those have been murderedbabiesbecause of the careless actionswomen and menin getting pregnant outside of marriage leading to conceiving and termination of a innocent child to be

"as the one lady said you cant disinvent something all it means is that women will have to travel or alternatively seek a back street quack

i hope global warming brings an unprecedented catastrophes to destroy this planet along with human civilisation and its unfair economic system"
"its amazing that joe biden nancy pelosi and their ilk now all of a sudden know what a woman is    amazing  

abortion shouldnt be used as contraception   thats what the issue is from what i can see   abortion isnt banned  women they do exist  and im no biologist can still go to states who will allow it from what joe biden has said  so not banned at all  more bs from msm and the screaming loons in fear for their lives "
my body my choice except when youre forced to take an injection against your will
mad how some americans seem to be so deluded taking away the choices of women because pro life but when theres mass shootings every other day does nothing about gun legislation
the us is becoming more like afghanistan every day
shes 21 and terrified  then keep your panties on and imagine the terror of being murdered
anybody can have it  but not everybody should pay for it  abortion is immoral
lets abort the baby killers jihad against child killers
lets make this a bit more transparent  the supreme court in the usa deals with the constitution they are custodians and there to uphold it  they have deemed after retrospectively looking into roe v wade which was a controversial decision at the time is in fact not a constutional right  nowhere in the constitution does it state or be interpretated that a women has a constituional right to abortion  this will mean that indiviudual states will have the right to make their own laws around abortion  some may ban it outright while others will allow abortions up to 40 weeks  as governors are elected they are directly accountable to the people  more conservative states will probably have stricter laws whilst liberal states will not  but would probably be inline with the will of the people of said state
"there is no constitutional riggt to abortion as abirtion was not even mentioned in the constitution
the decision simply means that each state has the right to democratically decide whether or not to allow abortion on demand
as for joe biden he professes to be a catholic  by supporting the killing of babies in the womb he has shown he is not"
"absolutely disgusting 
thank you conservative and religious christian foundamentalist 
telling women what they are allowed to do with their bodies and lifes  absolutely disgusting"
well loads of people are out of a job now
yo supreme court  ban guns that kills both adults and kids
america is the most backwards first world country in the world
"i think now only 2 things that supreme court must make it ilegal 
1 guns
2 same sex marrige"
great day for states rights
liberal melt down loving it defundthebbc
i actually agree with the decision life over death
this is like trumps booby trap he left after leaving office what a sad legacy from a selfish man
usa is going backwards this is so disappointing
knuckle heads seems there are no freedoms any more but there are plenty of countries outside of the usa that one could easily travel to these days
the last time pelosi had a period it was in the triassic
the legal murderers need to find a new job vile criminals
wtf this 2022 anything could happen pandemic ban on abortion alien and world war
if a country mandates vaccinations then making abortions illegal isnt a surprise because both are done in the belief of doing the right thing even though everyone may not agree
victory for the innocent unborn children  if you dont want to have children keep your legs closed
"republicans when they get majority they get things done look at roe vs wade now 
when the democrat get majority they just talk talk look at gun ban 
"
the bbc opens with lies it only means very late abortive crimes
criminalizing pain relief is what it is ridiculous
haha all the baby killers lost today
the words right and abortion should not be used in the same sentence with a straight face
i wonder if all the women celebrating anti abortion would feel the same if they got raped on their way home and fell pregnant
"this is horrendous news im so sorry my lovelys

come to australia youll have more rights better healthcare and best of all no guns "
hehe do you notice most antiabortion activities are fat and urgly
"do these people realize the children abandoned because their parents literally couldnt afford to feed them have to go somewhere
death is the greatest gift a man can achieve and not being born in the first place is even more of a blessing"
the uk monarchy encourages abortion through the vile nhs they and my non muslim mother who ironically works for the nhs forced myself  when i was most vulnerable before i reverted to islam witches
america please bring back all of gods laws
typical disingenuous bbc i see
well its far from perfect here but compared to the usa its paradise here
40 of uk abortions are to someone who has already had one thats quite careless to have been rape or incest impregnated at least twice
im hoping to see riots
its ok calm down everybody the evil democrats will have baby kill centres in all the states that ignore this ruling
cant we humans strike a balance when it should be done and when not if it is life threatening for mother then existing life should get preference over life yet not born other extreme is girls take relationships so casual that every second month there is a bf dumped and a baby that is bad and must be stopped laws must distinguish between extremes better is to apply and get permission from court before abortion however no one can stop emergency abortions it will continue as per existing situations pragnent woman meeting accident may need immediate abortion even before her other surgery is performed what about rape victims i dont know how people on such big position try to apply a broad brush
usa mass shootings at schools solution is to ban women who get sexually assaulted from getting rid of an unwanted pregnancy gotta fill the schools up for the next shooter
time to disband the usa
abortion is murder if you dont want the baby give it up for adoption
the protester said this will lead to botched abortions and many women will diewell if she is willing to kill her babythen what is the problem could it be a life for a life at all
the first city to be distroyed is new york cityrussia
wow the us is so backwards
america really is a massive cesspit
so victory is taking away a womans rights over her own body thats not victory thats overbearing control when that child grows up and kills somebody whines up in prison or wind up on disability runs our country girl broke then tell me
"legalised murder by the state hasnt been banned it has been put back for the people to decide in individual states which is where this decision should be  with the people 
this perfectly highlights the left to a t when they cant get enough people to vote for something they turn to the politicised courts to get their demands met by either banning it or allowing it 
when president trump told people they should peacefully protest at the white house they demanded he was charged with trying to foment insurrection yet listen to the open and clear threats of violence to come from the left and the sitting president and you get silence"
i just dont understand why women want to kill their babies can someone explain
glory
"i would just stop having sex all together let the blue balled men overthrow those out of touch geezers

"he will rot in hell
"
its crazy to me that united states doesnt have free healthcare free education free child care or free birth control and yet they want to ban abortion
a backwardarsed country in so many respects but this and their inablility to act on guns just ices that cake
devastation that abortion brought on us if you want to save the children you should stop guns this is ridiculous youre making it more dangerous for all the women that will go through abortion in some illegal clinic america is not being progressive example to the world anymore more like back tracking into dark days the best is that men are voting what will happen to a womans body im sorry for the women sad times 
well done america taking a life as a method of contraception in order to live a hedonistic lifestyle is never acceptable
god bless america and to the unborn 
i find it atrocious i really do
i wouldnt actually mind people revisiting the idea of gay marriage  people tend to forget that developed nations were doing pretty well without it  in fact its in diametric opposition to another protected characteristic that of faith
when you law and country is built on the bible dont expect it to just stop these people are bat shit crazy this is why china is taking over from the usa
"they have struck down the right to kill another human being 
praise be the lord"
when the beeb and the rest of their pals want you looking at this  just know something else is being done far worse to the people without them knowing it yet
what a rag tag mob  not a normal person to be seen  lezers fat ugly enforced celibates women without wombs and men without winkles day release mentalists vegans with secret sausage fetish and finally the lush pelosi and her alcoholic husband
protesting because you want the right to murder i give up
"the ruling on abortion was given back to the states to decide for their own
thats it no one banned a thing the right to abortion lies with each individual american state
jesus christ how dumb are you lot these comments are embarrassing go read the ruling for yourself you cant trust these liars they just whip your emotions by not telling you the truth
right to abortion struck downwow more like right to abortion decentralised from man in government back to states back to local opinion"
an innocent child doesnt deserve to die because of the actions of the abusive father who would beat the mother lets help the women in these situations find safety treat them with love and compassion killing her child is another violent act towards her lets work towards a nation that serves women and children and families in need there is a lot of work to be done lets fix the foster care system and the adoption system lets fix our family leave so woman can have up to a year or two with their newborns so much needs to be done this is the beginning
the result of dts nominating of supreme court members
whats the differences urhcraine killings or abortions
"people need to go home and get on with their lives all this judgement of vulnerable people by people with nothing better to do is ridiculous
rape and incest arent a problem but abortion is apparently "
youre lying the overturn simply means that it is up to individual states to decide what their stance is and not the federal government
the world is fucked
a lot of babies conceived by rape and incest will be born from yoke to prison and warped lives only religion can take a womans right over their own bodies
"now every other country needs to tell america where to go when they  come all holy telling others how to run their country and talking about democracy they are in no position to speak about human rights violation when they are eroding every trace of human rights in their messed up country
people needs to be very careful who they vote into position of power bcoz it has longterm consequences  trumpism and evil satanic ppl strikes again
the leaders of the dysfunctional states of madmerica seem to want to control peoples lives telling them when to eat and when to sleep
these ppl are barberic and evil throughout history and unfortunately time doesnt change people who were taught to be evil to the core from a tender age"
i find it funny how none of the comments on here mention the rights of the baby
about time america had some good news its been incessant evil for a long time
"imagine thinking you could keep pushing for later and later abortions even some saying after birth termination should be the mothers choice wanting all that power over another life without responsibility changing the terms from rare cases like aborting the product of rapeincest to an ondemand and at any time service and not expect there to be pushback 

the prolife movement is majority women by the way so abortionists can keep trying to blame men it wont stick especially when an ondemand abortion culture benefits men"
baby killers unite  the most dangerous place for a black man is in the womb source unknown
the news is a big part of causing violence supreme court did not strike down any right to abortion they gave it back to the states
good decision beforeamerican blood goes extinct
another proof of the states being a third world country
and return to back street abortion well done america 
great day for america
land of the free 
these protesters should practice and preach contraception instead of murder for a better world god gave women the responsibility of the continuation of the human race do not abuse that sacred right life is a precious gift preach to your sons and men the against sexual exploitation and trafficking of humans preach to them against greed of money and power being the root of all evil preach about egalitarianism for a better work
why does this remind me of breeding grouse for those with guns to shoot them
"the right to abortion was given to the people of the states to decide
why lie"
i despise these religious morons who oppose there bs on to everyone else america is the land of the free please
its devastating abortion wont stop only safe one will people who think this will save more lives are complete idiots
"ive noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born
president ronald reagan"
theres so much emotion in the rally that it will rip any man masculinity
i wonder if sunday church will soon become mandated shortly after working for your lord every saturday
a country steadily heading into the dark agesyet more laws that cause harm to people pandering to relgious fantasists and extremists
i wouldnt want to carry  nor raise a braindamaged child thats too much to ask of most women the righteous always think emotionally and religiously instead of reality
just what the world needseven more americans
"the insane christian taliban wont stop until they turn america into a theocratic dictatorship and they force us all to live as they think their imaginary sky daddy wants

we must fight back peacefully and legally or they will thrust us back into the dark ages"
keep your legs closed no problems and ask your self what if my mother aborted me
so women will end up having back street abortions and unwanted kids will be neglected and abused this is so backwards 
time to riot burn loot kill injury and destroy peoples properties businesses and cars  well  thats if your a unhinged left wing marxist commie that is 
this woke snow flake world is absolutely fucked its like living in the twilight zone
just keep your legs shut  abstinence is the best form of contraception
bullshit the house needs only a simple majority to impeach a supreme court justice or any federal judge to convict and then remove the justice or judge the senate requires a twothirds majority
it is victory to godly people and a death blow to satanists the abortionists
i do not know why they are celebrating the choice to abort or not it still belong to the woman if they choose to have an abortion they will do it wether is legal or not and that probably sometimes will cost two lifes
pro life deluded morons the land of the free not very free is it
finally the tide of moral decline is turning praise god
its still legal in most progressive states though
praise be to god i am grateful and thankful we still have righteous politicians
from conception to the time they turn gay
btw im not sure why some guys are boasting about this do you understand you get almost zero access now its still their body their choice so this doesnt stop access to anything it just makes it unsafer now and makes it harder for you to get laid calm down 
im grateful im neither female nor american this is disgusting
right im unsure what this means can they have abortions upto so many weeks pregnant or certain circumstances or is it just a no straight from the start
it is horrifying that this is happening in 21st century america several states will not even have exceptions in cases of rape and incest its evil shame on all of them who voted for this
"the republicans will turn america into afghanistan if they are not stopped womens rights mean nothing to them
i wonder how many of trumps girlfriends had abortions in the past"
"this is not a federal ban on abortion it simply returns the decision to the states
the court is meant to decide the constitutionality of laws not make them"
why are these antiabortion people all so fat
a woman has the right of ownership over her own body
most people dont understand what happened in us they want the court whose only job is to uphold the law as it is written and understood to make laws that is for law makers so if you want any rights laws then choose representatives who will give you what you want meanwhile use a condiment 
such decisions which effect huge sections of ppl should be done through referendum
yeah these are the ones who have sex and get pregnant and get abortion to lose those innocent tiny babies what a shame
"so its ok for babies to die but not women 
what about girl babies is it ok to murder them"
when they are permitted up to 9 months and including birth what do they expect it was never safe legal and rare both men and women need to start taking responsibility for their actions
"more baby girls are aborted this saves femicide

just behave responsibly do not go for 500 partners simple and do not jump in the bed of every imbecile that calls you now you will have to behave not be reckless and irresponsible 

the world is going to suffer from population collapse in 2100 according to a bbc report"
what the af is happening to america 
the dawn of the fall of usa 
from the reaction of these fascist women in the footage it looks like all women in usa were obliged to abort for 50 years in that case i would understand these sort of reaction but nobody want them to abort it is more that them as fanatic believers want to impose their credo on other people and off course the shadow of the scum of trump is still there poor usa poor america continue voting the republican good luck
no woman may be allowed to kill exceptions are obviously acceptable  in case of rapes or serious health problems nevertheless every human being must be respected while on the other hand pussies may never be faced as a green card to murder innocent human beings because responsibility inheres to womens liberty
a lot of unwanted children will be trafficked thats what theyre really celebrating so sad 
america the newest third world country
well there goes womans rights ya bunch of psychos
why is this a big deal  it seems its only the hill billy states doing this sorry for my ignorance im not from there but i dont see the big ones doing it it seems its those religious hill billy states
no one has the right to kill an innocent foetusi support the supreme court
fuuuuuuck  im genuinely in awe of this the utter ridiculousness that america what is considered to be one of the most leading nations in the world would do something like this
i cant believe this happened in the usa
that country is headed for a civil war its actually terrifying how divided the us is on so many important issues take care my american friends 
its right  abortion is murder and also if you dont want kids strap up
shame on you america you have put the rights of unborn babies before the rights of living women take away their reproductive rights but put assault rifles in the hands of mentally ill 18 year olds shame on you you are taking your country backwards into the dark past shame on you
great biased reporting once again bbc you never fail keep it up
"why do the nationscnn msnbc etc conspire and the peoples plot in vain
the kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the lord and against his anointed saying let us break their chains and throw off their shackles 
the one enthroned in heaven laughs  the lord scoffs at them he rebukes them in his anger
and terrifies them in his wrath saying  i have installed my king in the supreme court"
stupid backward congress this ruling has set back america 50 years
its about time people took responsibility for their actions  when a woman says my body my choice  that isnt exactly true is it  if youre pregnant then youve got another body in there one without a voice  the only exception i would allow is when there is a medical risk to said woman if the pregnancy would proceed or if she was raped   being drunk or promiscuous is not an excuse to murder an unborn child
great step moving away from the devil that covered peoples eyes by the name of right it is weird that people march in support of killing a human being   banning abortion and improving workable protection system for women and girls must be among the priority agendas
america is such a fucked up country how a western democratic superpower like this would have such little rights for their people and control peoples bodies in this way while having no safety nets for people no healthcare no protection they are in no way the leaders of the free world they are a tyranny against their own people
sluts are worried now 
in todays world only two countries issue new laws against freedom and liberty afghan taliban and america
it was never a constitutional right as it is not in the constitution  why are the bbc reporting fake in accurate  news
such a ridiculous ban their bodies their choices
the fat creature saying i won today has she got something wrong with her 
murica where life is precious until the second your born then your on your own with no universal healthcare workers rights and you can get shot at school i hope those policy makers enjoy living in the republic of gilead
people should just deal with their consequences instead of killing their fetus and living their life with complete ignorance of what they have done
well the us government has made a backyard butchers job legal now congrats idiots
if the bbc arent bias then why are they reporting this like its terrible news
they dont get so hysterical when the west genocides the third world spoilt selfcentred women who cannot face up to the fact that the biological female can get pregnant when she has sex
"the media so biased there is obviously an agenda being displayed here 

respect the decision as we would have had to if it was the other way around and shut the fk up"
congrats give people with mental health guns and now take away a womans rights to a choice
thank god no more killings of innocent babies  it is murdermillions of babies have been killed get contraceptive then
defund the bbc
imagine being forced to carry your rapist child
merica is a mess
its simple they just want their name written in history even if its on the wrong side
thanks to trumps appointments
that guy with the colourful umbrella yea he aint got no kids and he wants kids but nobody wanna have kids with him so if abortions get cancelled he can definitely have a kid when he hurts another women  w t heck bro
the christian nationalist judiciary will change the law to suit their vision of a society ruled by a reactionary elite a society with a preferred religion and a prescribed code of sexual behavior all backed by the coercive power of the state
this is excellent news it will stop the murder of thousands
do you mean they stop killing baby
is the catholic church running the usa  women now will have to have the rapist baby and what next no contraception no sex before marriage good grief i feel for the unborn but really there are over 7 billion of us in this small world nations are starving wars are raging the planet is over heating i feel for the unborn but they could be the lucky ones now before saving the unborn get of your lazy backsides and make a world worth living in
keep the ten commandments and we would not have problems with this
the bbc so unbiased
america is in shambles
abortion is murder we stand for life
shocking and biden just sits back and stumbles a few words out make america pathetic again another choice lost
how can one nation be so detrimental to its own wellbeing aborting a child is wrong but allowing them to grow and be shot up in a school is just part of life if the preservation of life is the most important thing then the death penalty should be struck down
yes its about time we protected the unborn now the unborn have the right not to be murdered unborn have souls too
they look and sound like men this evil anti abortions
simple ladiestake responsibility in not getting pregnant use contraception and dont let him go ughhhh in you
well done american women crazy
christian fundamentalism governing politics similar to the taliban
sick divided society governed by greedy uneducated psychopats
it seems to me that you guys should have a refferemdom and not let a few people who think they know better than the rest of your population
if i were a foetus id rather be dead than born disabled with defects to people who dont want me
united states my ass at this point its just the states
life in the united hates of america
best news ever god wins
"there is a brexit parallel here control of abortion has been returned from washington brussels to the individual states uk

democracy at the state level will show us what the will of the people really is"
excellent news if people followed the word of god we wouldnt have these things happen if your that bothered about being selfish for your own pleasure be prepared for what comes after that man and woman should not sleep around before marriage it should be in love and true harmony
man theres going to be a lot of back alley abortions and deaths
all glory to god
its murderyour taking a life for gods sake 
im just worried that these prolifers are going to take this thing to its logical conclusion and call for an outright ban on masturbation
bbc is the new cnn all fake news all the time this is not at all what you falsely report there is no ban on abortion it moves the decisions to the individual states  abortion is not birth control as it is being used bbc sucks
how embarrassing
i swear the us is gonna have another civil war soon
i saw some ridiculous girl on the news singing jesus loves the little children oh sure he does and now the little sweeties can go home to parents who didnt want them to begin with out of mind of the authorities who consider theyve done their jobs by jesus and wait to be neglected starved and abused to death  sometimes i think the americans as a race are about as intelligent as mouthy school kids
i am pro life we need more kids so that we can send them out to warto die pro lifepro war makes sense
if u dont want a baby close them legs
one aspect of the us constitution i did envy was the separation of religion from politics the establishment clause prohibits all levels of government from advancing or prohibiting religion  what happened
"question if a woman was forcefully raped by a psychotic serial killer she would still have to keep the child but that man would by us law be put to dead is that what is happening 
so a woman that is forced to do something against her will should be once again forced to do something against her will one person that forced is sentenced to death and the other paid a salary 
is that not insanity"
im so glad i live in a country where people can destroy unborn babies without any consequences 
about time this accepted genocide has been going on too long mass denial of this because you want to spread your legs
the number of these idiots who needed to be aborted themselves is staggering
the number of these idiots who needed to be aborted themselves is staggering
"what kind of reporting is this leslie rutledge saying the doctor doesnt have any facts and no push back despite decades of facts just air it as an opinion
also most people in america support womens rights to have an abortion nowhere is that said in this report also nowhere is it said that this is an infringement of human rights 
is the bbc just an opinions show now"
many who are outraged at this supreme courts decision little realize how blessed they are in america for none of them would want to live in a society where human and divine law is no longer respected that experiment was already tried in ancient france and horrific were the results thus those who are outraged are exhibiting that they whether they realize it or not have accepted the lie the god of this world continually propagates of do what thou wilt yet those consumed with impulsive anger over this decision are acting thus because they whether ignorantly or willfully have abandoned the creator gods plan for marriage and sex and that is complete abstinence until wedded in holy matrimony
fuck pro life i hope your daughters get raped with no possibility to abortion
and this is the country shaming the taliban for making their women to wear a burqa 
try taking responsibility for yourself     then you dont need to get upset or happy about this
"welcome to america 2022 where you can walk down to your local walmart and buy a highpowered assault rifle to help protect your family someone could use that rifle to go on a rampage killing innocent people nothing is done because of the 2nd amendment and the powerful nra

yet a woman who has become pregnant through either rape abuse incest or even is not mentally capable of supporting a child can no longer have the right to an abortion it is a crazy situation to be in in some states women even risk being tried for murder

all this has done is open up backstreet abortion clinics and there is a high risk that a lot of women could die as a result of this 

america is turning into gilead more and more each day"
lets just faces it the us cannot be considered a free country anymore
the us leading the way for babiess rights
fifty three years ago neil armstrong stepped on the moon and made the famous quote one small step for man one giant leap for mankind now the american supreme court has just turned that quote on its head this is a second giant leap only this time its backwards how in the world can the us of a the socalled land of the free be trusted to oppose dictatorships like russia when theyre intent on cracking down on liberties like this we in britain should have been reducing ties to america instead of europe at the rate things are going
very good decision 
"if only these women had access to condoms contraceptive pill contraceptive patch or contraceptive coil

 oh wait "
people are upset that they are reducing killing of life  i think its great as women use abortion  as contraception these days hopefully it will make ppl more sexually reserved and wise
"now americans would laugh and look down upon on those countries which allow abortion legally 
american syndrome 
laughs over ever thing which is different from their country "
lies tens of millions do not have a right to abortion it is state by state they are free to travel to get an abortion leftist propaganda all of this
i think they should consider regulation of guns first rather than mobilizing crowds to act more violent 
"same old lying bbc its nit been struck down banned or anything like that tyw supreme court has just given the decision to the states
youre as bad as chabnel 4
may as well cone oyt of the closet and just admit youre a left wing propaganda machine"
america willingly marching itself back into the dark ages what a silly childish move
there is irony in the fact that nineteen children were shot to death in their classrooms and the same people who claim to ban abortion to protect unborn children refuse to ban the militarytype weapons that kill real children
its time for us men to do our part and stop treating sex as a recreational activity and letting our hormones get the best of us sex is for mature men in committed relationships and thinking otherwise already debases women into sexual objects and unequal human value i know because i have been there but we can learn from our mistakes and do better lets treat women with the respect they deserve
these people are crazy just sickening i feel for the woman of this country i hope they find access else where
"no prob 
they could canada for it"
when u get too much freedom that u even wont realise whats basic rights are and when were they taken away 
so they make abortion illegal but make it legal to carry a gun that can take more lifes so when they commit suicide as cannot get abortion i hope these people realise they have killed 2 people
i dont understand why cant they just go on the pill or use condoms
if there so pro life why is it so hard to to get stricter gun laws passed children being shot in class rooms it just doesnt make sense
usa   gods  home
if there going to make abortion illegal they should make all you religious nuts support the children your so concerned about
go on puny humans go do the bidding of the elite and divide yourselves with anger take to the streets in time of coming war and fight each other because you cant have sex without consequence will of the people what good is the will of the people if theyre programmed by tik tok  china
"all life matters a dogs life matters the heartbeat in that 10 week old matters 
before i formed you in the womb i knew you"
not a land of dreams anymore
its time to abide by the right of a person even unborn to life as enshrined in the us constitution
it is not  the right to abortion  that has been struck down  typical miss reporting by the bbc all that has happened is that each state now has the power to make its own laws concerning abortion
"and with an outpouring of misinformation the bbc yet again demonstrate to the world why they should be shutdown completely

judges dont get to make up new rights and grant them to the citizens in any democracy because that makes it not a democracy
if amerircans want the right to abortion theyre gonna have to get it via democratic representation not via misuse of law to have an unelected appointed branch of government create and grant it like a taliban council"
"because its was found that roe vs wade was based on ironically a woman telling lies due to that law is clear the case must be overturned 

so now if they want to murder their babies in utero then they have to go state level 
still cant avoid baby helping to kill mother may still have a chance for rape babies but either way today is a good day because all the women who are protesting want is the right to both screw and cheat without consequences dont want kids 2 things you can do 
abstain or use birth control  great day"
oh yea ws in the chat
the us is slowly destroying itself from the inside out the republican influence is two hundred years behind the times and is dragging the country into serious division and conflict
"wow life and death serious consequences of death for an unborn human 
abortion clinic works mcdonalds is hiring its better to feed people burgers and chicken then to kill what god has created 
yeah give life fill stomachs with life not your pockets with death profiteering dont keep the horrors of fetal murder going 
what person has the right privilege in free america to just dictate what life is or isnt 
50 years ago a bunch of old over the hill already had families morally deviant power brokers made it ok to murder unborn human offspring an entirety new money market of desperate emotional people manipulated into hating their own baby 
a book said that a day would come when a woman would take their baby off their breast and throw  them in the fire to eat
taking a lifethat is know as life from the beginning by all people world over 
life is life 
the byproduct of two humans a male and female is male or female of combined  hunan genetic tissue 
we call them new borns babys inf"
american women will have to choose another contraception method
abortion still exists in the usa the us federal government will return each individual state the right to decide their own abortion laws for themselves
dumbest country on earth right now america woman are becoming a object over there now and those knobhead men going on about it they shouldnt even have a say over what woman can n cant do with her body all them crap wack states more like a clut overran by religious crap wont belong before they have the woman on collars and leashes
plonkers i rest my case a planetary disgrace
take down that stupid article on your website about billie eilish and sack mark savage for poor journalism abortion was never a constitutional right complete lies by the bbc lies and poor journalism no wonder people dont believe anything you write anymore
"so you are telling me people cant just go around and have sex and get pregnant and then murder an unwanted child 

what a decision  great ruling "
is abstaining from sex murder after all its preventing life from coming into being and must surely therefore be a sin
vagina people now will think twice before looking for adventures   or just move to the blue states
life is the most precious thing and although i understand the desires of females to kill the fetus life is the most important thing the unimaginably precious baby is the most important thing and although the desires of women to want to have wonton sex and not have to be a mother and be obligated to the baby is understandable the right to life of the baby supersedes all other human desires or wants
pfff prolife woman said we build a better world  really did you pass the law about free contraception or free baby formula or anything to actually help those unwanted kids  vomiting
pro life message you csn not have an abortion but you can buy a semi autonmatic weapon once you are born you are on your own
the bbc is giving too much time to the forcedbirthers why is their picture on the thumbnail
another country were everything is policed except crime
pro abortionists only have to attend one abortion to turn totally against it imagine pulling a baby to pieces with forceps and putting the body parts on a tray so they could be counted that is what abortion is nothing but murder i totally support freedom of choice if you made the decision to have sex live with the consequences noone has the right to terminate anothers life
well for those who voted for it i hope you dont get raped then up the duff every human being is unique in their body and it should always be the womans individual choice this is just christians rich powerful home wreckers forcing their opinions on people left wing cts
that anyone ever thought they had a right over someone elses life is obscure that the bbc would defend a right to kill is atrocious
as a prochoice attorney the court made the correct decision abortion was never a constitutional right abortion is a political issue better left for each state and their voters to decide the decision does not preclude a womans right to travel to a state that allows abortion
and they say america is freedom
biden needs to arrest the pedophiles and rapist and stop protecting them
i get it abortion after a certain length of pregnancy is wrong but what about if the mothers life is at risk what about ectopic pregnancy a septic uterus or a miscarriage that your body wont release is abortion this why i love islam because its a religion full of wisdom in islam you can have a abortion if the mothers life is at risk
"they will brake laws now trying to play   god or shall we say kill babies 
the baby is innocent 
so are th victims the only one who should get a life of pain in jail are the rapists"
hmm wasnt the us built on separation of church and state theyve done it again embarrassed themselves in front of the world
america is the devil
disgusting i thought america was a farce already but this is just ridiculous
this is not about prolife its about antiwoman
and you call it civilized countries
ye coz not like were in a climate and food and population crisis what we need is a huge rise in kids people cant afford to feed or ouse
why is the bbc promoting this 
jesus loves the little children disgusting who do these people think they are to force their religion on others
backward country
why do i only see older white women supporting the courts ruling
make no mistake for the republican leaders behind this it was never about the rights or wrongs of abortion  it was always about control  they dont give a damn about unborn babies and never did  they want to control every minute aspect of your lives and the gullible naïve prolifers are handing them that control on a plate
open padma bridge  bangladesh world record 
leftists do a good job showing why they should never make any decisions
"for abortions to be legal both the man and woman should agree to the abortion the choice was made to conceive when you were ragged all over for 15mins if you were raped you should also be allowed an abortion 

you do not have a right to an abortion because as soon as you use advanced medical knowledge to induce abortion it is no longer a right 

you have a right to water it does not have to be clean"
the yanks need more budding shooters pew pew pew
not abortions
next thing the american law makers will do is probably make their females wear a burka
very good decision
they should have banned jesus instead
"thats right us just let more woman have children so they can go to school and get murdered by some nutter with a gun 

great how about overturn the gun laws before being prolife"
good common sense prevails seems like the supreme court is our last line defence against and at the minute its holding up next phizer no wait we won that too  stop wef
whoop whoop great stuff thank you jesus  
"i am probecky who found out at her 20 week anatomy scan  that the infant she was so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organs
i am prosusan who was sexually assaulted on her way home from work only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later
i am protheresa who hemorrhaged due to a placental abruption causing her parents spouse and children to make the impossible decision whether to save her or her unborn child
i am prolittle cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should of been able to trust and her 11 year old body isnt mature enough to bear the consequences of that betrayal

womens lives
you dont get to pick and choose which scenarios should be accepted womens rights are meant to protect all women regardless of their situation"
i present to you america the land of the freeso long as its not personal freedoms you seek
make america great britain again
america are the richest 3rd world country in the world from the gun laws to health care to now this so happy i dont live in such a fucked up country with braindead people
different countries different rules who are we in the uk to dictate our views on others
there never was a right to an abortion its not in the bill of rights nor is it in the constitution the supreme court misinterpreted back in the early 70s the 14th amendment of the  constitution which as of yesterday was rectified abortion was not eliminated but thrown back to the individual states to make their own minds up if they want legalized murder in their state so please dont read into this that which is not there
very happy news killing is not a right
i wonder if jesus will feed them as he loves them so much this makes me so mad is it not better to terminate a pregnancy when the parents cant look after it i really dont understand this decision and it has definitely made america seem more backward in the eyes of the rest of the world
pro life believers and protestors must start by abolishing war first to prove that they are all genuine
america is going backwards instead of progressing sad day religion in favour of science by a bunch of fundamentalists
if your terrified girl use a rubber
as a lot of people have said im sure women dont have an abortion lightly will all those protesting about abortion now devote their lives to looking after the children that will now be born and not even if a woman has been raped or through incest insanity
do we like the win or dislike the hysterical news reporting choices choices
the us is coming back to moral standards yes there is hope
land of the free
no one would screw either of those women unless they needed a green card or food stampsreality 101
love the bbc but first time giving thumbs up for this story r vs w struck down
women and girls who have been raped will be forced to have that baby the foster care system and orphanages are already overwhelmed and underfunded pro lifers dont care about these babies after they are born
"people are upset because they can no longer kill their own baby in the womb president ronald regan famously said  ive noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born over 60 million defenceless babies overwhelmingly murdered in the womb for convenience in the usa alone and from people who were given the chance to be born
when a woman has an abortion shes not killing her own body shes killing someone elses body"
again bbc fake news not all us states will ban abortion this is a victory of good over evil so naturally the bbc is pissed off
anyone else sit on the fence on this could argue both ways
how sad while others cant bare children
the abortion industry trading in the body parts of babies is disgusting
"america  ban abortion  abortionists are murderers
same america protect our rights to easily own guns"
very good decision by the supreme court of america god bless america moral and etical values must be preserved for the betterment of humanity
ive seen the devastation that abortion has brought on our country what jesus christ some people are retarded
this is the world just going backwards in the first instanceit will just send women back underground to get abortions are we not ment to be progressive society not a backward one the person that started the campaign probably has stepped back from the issue i pray that all the people against it never have something happen to them that could result in the ever needing one if they look to most religions does it not show that god gives people the right to choose which path they take this is so ignorant and stupid that this has happened i can see a big reset happeninghave we not learned anything
"its a good thing that they did this it gives an opportunity to the whole world to observewhat happensin next few years its better to learn from others mistakes then your
own"
abortion was not struck down each state just gets to independently decide if it will be legal in their state now this is how democracy works the more liberal states will allow abortions but now more prolife states get the choice to ban it legally if they wish this is a big win for democracy and freedom the media makes it sound so bad but it is quite the opposite yet again
the usa is a backwards theocracy who knew
amen stop  killing young children 
yes no more death to babies
what overturning same sex marriage
america is a third world country
mentally ill people
this is absolutely terrifying i feel fortunate to not have been born is us
excellent news no more killing babies
stupidity has frontiers mexico and canada
wow congratulations
look at those activists
the anti abortionists should have been aborted
oh brilliant  child services cant keep kids safe now how will they cope with thousands more babies born to mothers who dont want them  i hope the government up funding for the repercussions to come
funny all those girls happily crying against abortion look like the girls that will never get pregnant of have a boyfriend
its amazing to know that less and less babies of colour will be aborted now 3
you can not blame the child for your actions its real simple
no greater evil than abortion
come to your senses women will still continue to get rid of unwanted pregnancies but those who need it  will have to do it illegaly while facing a real life treatening danger because not done in proper medical facilities and health consequences better choice is to provide free contraception orand baby food but no you wont do it
if a women is raped the child is innocent  34 years mandatory minimum sentence for rape the women gets pregnant 10  15 years  punish the men who do this  dont murder children 
bunch of fat ugly woman who will never get pregnant unless they pay on the pro life team 
wow i wish people would understand before commenting maybe if the bbc didnt falsely headline they might abortion has not been made illegal the law has simply been pushed back to the individual states to decide whether it can be done in that particular state yes some states will make it illegal but others wont
who else wonders how americans do barely anything to stop the 45000 people who die of gunrelated deaths every year but are happy to take away the rights of women to stop a few abortions
"why is the world going against the logic  its taken us thousands of years to reach  

everyone is a hero campaigner 

get over yourselfs not your body"
they always isolate these victims overall abortion rights helps destroy the family model and endorses unethical relationships
america has a good heart at its core after all and ive seriously never felt appreciative of trump
look at all those transphobes claiming that abortion is a womans issue bunch of terfs
genuine questionhow many of the supreme court are men
so if a woman gets pregnant from rape she has to have the baby and raise it will she also be forced to allow the dad  rapist rights to see the baby good job america
"did that jennifer thomson just say its heart breaking that she has to turn these irresponsible women away and then says im sorry if your boy friend beats you up every day and rapes you you will have to find another way no if your dumb enough to stay with a man that beats you and rapes you everyday or every other day then you cant complain another girl said im 21 and scared well act and make responsible decisions then 
those two women said we thought this country cared about people and women not at anytime did she mention about the little human inside the womb  and that is the reason why the right has been taken away someone has to think about the little person"
abortion has never been in the american constitution this is pure misinformation nothing more
"america do not care about life the governmentcorporations must need  more bodies in prison  children in care to keep their profits upthis is wrong women should have access to safe abortion care

the interesting thing is america do not give free contraception and the very people protesting against abortion are the ones who are against welfare and free medical care to force someone to keep a child they do not want is a recipe for disaster this is a crime against the poor"
this is gonna ruin the porn industry 
thats the end for the wicked evil planned parenthood organisation
those who support and carry out abortion for reasons other than medical are murderers shame to you woe to them
timess up for the hateful ideology called feminism
i agree with this abortion unless it is for medical reasons is murder  take responsibility for your sexual behaviour men and women  we as a race take sex far too casually
what a load of crap anyone wanting to kill babies can still go to another state and get it done majority of states still allow it but the way some of these people talk its like they want to use it as a contraceptive and some want it all the way up to birth sick
"the god of creation said 
                       be fruitful and multiply
read holy biblegenesis 128"
interesting how americans are antiabortion because it murders unborn foetuses but are proguns despite having school shootings every other week double standards much they sure like to control other people but dont want the same treatment themselves
about time itll be either russia or trumps fault no doubt
"a sad day for women and their right to choose i see too many women pregnant from abuse rape and violence what choice have these women got now to be reminded on a daily basis of what has and will continue to happen
ok america tighten up your laws if you need to  big mistake making it illegal  you have set womens  freedom of choice back 50 years put us back to being second class citizens what next removing womans right to vote 
shame on you"
and its getting to big to ignore why so many at the bbc are allowed to still use blackface when presenting these things
if women were not given the choose or dont have the money to take care of kid what are they meant to do now not right
this is horrible coming back to a stone age where women had no right to open a bank account or get an education
this is good
what an inflammatory headline
"
i am not religious just consider thinking something 

if you come across a child with terminal illness consider asking her whether she would have liked to die before she was born i think you know her answer shed be glad to being able to see the world albeit in pain

when a life is conceived without forceful intent say rape you no longer own that life just like a humananimal has every right to live an unborn baby who has no capacity to take the decision on their part should not be killed unless she is killed by natural reasons or is a risk to her mothers life 


please have common sense before starting to exercise your all entitling attitude"
i get this but also dont people getting knocked up left and right dont deserve abortions but if its life threatening for the woman then i feel it should be legal this is a horrible decision they shouldve made laws to abortion like it its life threatening let them get it but if the child is healthy and the woman wont suffer from said birth i feel they shouldnt have an abortion i also feel if they get raped they should have the option
such a messed up country all of these rape and incest babies will have the right to bear arms in less than 20 years you can almost guarantee more school shootings
america is truly backwards one day its ok to have guns and kill children in schools the next a woman cant  make a choice over her own body dont you ever criticize other countries the world is laughing at you
this is the beginning good bye gay marriage
biden could extent the board of judges that my change the majorityin at the surprimecourthe would have the 51 in the senate
god wins the satanic left goes under now the paid anti fa clowns are coming back to the streets trump forever
im 21 and terrified 
the supreme court said this was going to happen even before they had a chance to hear the case  let the church pay taxes to support all the children that this will produce they have had a free ride for to long
now rapists can do their thing without the threat of having their sperm wasted praise jesus

this judgement is not just about the right to abortion it is the removal of the right to destroy a child right up to the moment of a full term natural birth an abortion as we know it in the uk is the termination of a pregnancy where the foetus does not have a heartbeat and is incapable of independent movement overturning roe v wade was removing the right to murder viable children also the rights to abortion enshrined in roe v wade were in the process of being expanded to ban police from investigating and prosecuting infant mortality of children under the age of 28 days after birth abortion law was never in the purview of federal government the us constitution demands that anything not specifically covered in the bill of rights should be adjudicated at the state level where the time limits will be set by elected representatives and local electors can influence the decisions the bbc know this presenting the decision of the scotus as an infringement of the human rights of women is a deliberate act of deception it is nothing of the sort it is about preventing the willful murder of children
god this is scary  its like going backwards 
good job supreme court abortion mustnt be considered as a right as killings are in many ways anti abortion measure restricts one of those ways
not too sure why people are getting bent out of shape over this ruling lets be honest 99 of women in the us wont even think about having an abortion the undesirable 1 who blame everyone else for their demise will suffer only if youve been raped thats a whole different issue where it should be allowed
i am prolife but also prousing the term birthing people
"extreme radical this is all we hear from the left

finally weve criminalised murder is all we hear from the right

this isnt about whether abortion is right or wrong its about whether the people should decide this this is the way the usa was supposed to be before they started federalising everything"
who cares its gumpland  nobody cares
jesus loves the little children yeah thats why he allowed so many of them to be killed in uvalde right right
god has opened the ear of american leader abortion is a murder and murder is a biggest sin
"and the catholic supreme court has done it again another great morally correct action under 
the eyes of the morally right conservative republicans
no to abortion no killing of fetusesonly grown ups  that explains why the same supreme court 
will let  everybody in ny to get a gun now lets go  
i wonder if god would be a fair guy and let these justices  have their daughters and wives raped and 
forced to carry the criminals baby in their womb for 9 monthsand then give birth raise and 
support that child for the rest of their lives 
i would like to see that 
america great country for some"
silent killer finally come to an end
abortion is sometimes an unavoidable choice but not a right dont be arrogant no one has the right to kill a person for example is the choice to stop a ventilator in a person with brain death a right it is sometimes an unavoidable choice not a right dont be arrogant

not a word here about the damage abortion causes to women of which the the prochoice movement has precious little it seems to say
we have a fool for a president
im curious what ireland thinks about this since theyre the most traditionally antiabortion nation
my first reaction  hallelujah  at last the tide is turning in favour of the unborn child  there may well be a return to backstreet abortions and women may travel to other states who defy this strike down but what doesnt seem to be mentioned here are the millions of lives lost since roe v wade was introduced millions of lives whose taxes could have funded even obamacare the workforce who could have kept the us going and not a word about women who have had terminations and lived to regret their choice
americas clapped anyways
it means that millions of unborn babies will have a chance at life

50 years of murdering babies

no abortion allowed good then gentlemen please sterilize after you have a satisfactory number of children
imagine a women whom got rape and is deny abortion
right to kill children in the womb struck down by us supreme court
so if a woman was rped then she has to deal with 38 weeks of the baby growing whoa
another ludicrous piece of legislation by the us  what a bunch of emotive fatbangers
"but what if a woman is raped just imagine the awful experience of having to look after that child or having to sadly give the child away also imagine the awful increase of population

its better to remove it when its inside the woman then to kill it when its and fully grown and released to think so many mothers will now end the babys life as its released into the world as they are now unable to abort it

to think these children will now grow up much worse and in much more awful experience as foster homes increase and of course violence will arrive"
these are sex mad they will kill for it
trump wins even when not in office
theres no constitutional right to abortion once again the bbc lying and twisting the truth the bbc side with baby killers
care  killing children according to this report
the problem here is that woman cant make decisions on whether they want to have a kid or not any more for someone who doesnt want kids why force them to have one yes sure dont get pregant dump that guy blah blah  but things happen yet we dont get to decide what we can do any more for women who are living on the street or drug addicts when they have babies the babies will be drug babies they will have behavioral problems due to drug abuse from the mothersif a drug addict doesnt want to keep the baby she should have her own right to do abortion safely i dont see anythign wrong with it its cruel to force someone to have a child when they dont want some hypocrites just simiply thinking killing a fetus is wrong but forcing someone to have babies is wrong too not mention there are other reasonsits never black and white regardless taking away this option  is not right
how can they chat and cheer for life when their gun reform laws are a total joke the right to kill if you think person was worthy of dying so corrupt absolute stupid logic this its all about pissing the demos off and vis versa all about funding their individual states raging at this absolutely raging
thank god their right to murder has been withdrawn
its hard to defend abortion and also hard to be anti abortion one side it could kill the mother and on the other your killing a helpless baby so fucked all around really
"disgusting that state court does not fulfill the will of the majority 

this is only the will of the few  career polititions and overpowered judges

"
all the antiabortionists deserve to be raped and impregnated by paedophiles
well since life begins at conception how can a person scientifically and scriptural deny that it is not an embryo you see dead things do not grow it is that simple when jehovah god was speaking with the prophet jeremiah he told the young prophet in jeremiah 15 that when he was forming jeremiah in the belly of his mother that i knew you jehovah could read the spirit in the bones in the belly of her who is pregnant ecclesiastes 115 in the book of romans 91113  jehovah read the spirit in the bones if you will of both jacob and esau in psalms 1391316 king david wrote about jehovah saw even king davids embryo life starts at conception cause dead things dont grow if two men got into a fight and in the process of fighting they caused a pregnant woman to have a miscarriage and the fetus died one or both of them had to forfeit their lives exodus 21 2223 all these scriptures show how the creator jehovah god views the growing embryo in the belly of her that is pregnant he views them as a living human human life human child killing the child inside the belly of her that is pregnant is from the creators standpoint murder to see what the bible says on the topic of abortion and so much more simply go to the totally free most translated website on the internet no sign in or out no registration no information gathered on you all browsing and downloads are free private please go to jworg
finally the mass killing of unborn babies is stopped  the us is  now a better country today
use contraception its not that hard
in reality women really want abortions as a safety measure for the bad decisions they take
"just think about how many kids there are in foster care or who are not wanted and are living a shitty life the mothers dont abort the child because they find pleasure in killing children what if the mom seriously cant provide a healthy life for the kid there are already enough kids in foster care abortion is not murder

edit plus why the hell are people worrying about other people buisness and abortions anyways it aint your child or buisness so stay the heck out of it"
"close to million babies are murdered by abortion every year in the usa 
that is horrific theres no reasonable argument that can defend this casual destruction of human life"
they always try to use black people abortion is not a black issue its a white woman issuec
psalms chp1273 children are a gift from the lord the fruit of the womb a reward
this will end up in south park
yes it is very extreme to rule that murder is not a right it is extremely good and virtuous
democrats are going to lose a lot more if they dont start paying attention to black peoples needs
it seems your right to life ends when you leave the womb enter the schoolrooms and get a bullet in your head from a far right extremist that likely preached at one of these rallies against abortion
turkey do hair transplants dentist work and now abortions the care system is about to be overwhelmed by kids being dumped on them and expect the suicide rate to increase  the fact someone could be raped  then forced to carry a child is going to have serious implications america is about to fall
weird how the people that scream about saving the planet say that the future generations to come dont deserve the right to life
us always was lying cretin and agressive country punishment is coming for mlns killed people in the world
just phrase by the news lady guaranteed right to abortion killing a young child is a constitutional right i get there could be exceptions like when it saves the life of a mother but to phrase it as a right is no bueno 
abortion is not healthcare its murder
this is why i have never wanted to move to the us the evangelicals which trump has piled into the courts will destroy that country
"trumptards dont restrict my rights to guns
also trumptards but do restrict womens rights to their own bodies"
"this is a great victory for men  for our female warriors  who want to be men too  for they have struck a great blow towards the destruction of democracy  the ability to choose for ones self  hurrah   for men rule women that bit more now
if i could become the elected leader of thinking women  who want to stay women  i would recommend they no longer have sex with men until the movie suffragette 2  is released    where the plot has been changed to remove womens ability to vote  dun dunn duuunn 

there will be no limits to the amount of absurdity i could unleash on the general population
1  i would create laws to force men to pay child support for children they didnt want  couldnt afford
2  i would create childrens homes to look after all the unwanted children that even the  antiabortionists wouldnt look after this in turn would financially cripple the cities  where america would eventually fk themselves into financial ruin
3  arrest you for being a murderer when you leave my state for another to have an abortion there   dont come back if you leave

everyone knows theres nothing more democratic than voting to have your medical options taken away from you
i would feel the need to sit back and watch the movie that hollywood makes out of it all  starring the old cast from the original  look whos talking  movie

i will order my popcorn now and prepare for the new era which will come to be known as the great times of mazturbaishin"
banningoutlawing activities or goods doesnt make them disappear it merely makes them go underground and it greatly increases the costrisk its not a question of letting abortions happen vs not happen because they will happen regardless the question is should they be safe legal abortion or should they be dangerous illegal abortion think of drugs even alcohol and the toll society has paid when substances were rendered illegal it boggles the mind that the us at least a part of it is still living in the distant past compared to the rest of the modern world
dont like the verdict keep your legs closed unborn lives matter
it is a great dayat last the unborn defenseless babies have protection from being murdered
98 of all women aborting got pregnant as a result of sex before mirrige aka adultery
everyone has the right to live especially innocent life
abortion was never a right its not in the constitution anywhere
a good time to watch junior with arnold schwarzenegger is this weekend
"for normal  women and girls who consider having an abortion its  very traumatic to have an abortion i cant imagine anyone is having an abortion lightly but in some situation like pregnancy through rape poverty illness etc it should be there as a last resort and as early as possible making that decision for others is unfair are the people making that judgement also happy to foster adopt support poor mothers
plus the system as it is is atrocious getting worse for most americans especially children crap education housing or even homelessness crime violence rising living cost lack of employment abandonment abuse by their carers failing social child protection services and there seemed to be far too many children abused even killed"
before it gets out of hand realse the federal right was struck down so its like england wales scotland and n ireland get to decide individually on abortion thats it
right to kill i mean us has abortion mills and that is the nation that want to tell muslims how to behave
"how about encouraging abstinence  responsible relationship choices and marginalising the  casualisation  of sex 
they will reduce cases"
it must be awful waking up each morning and realising that you are an american
it must be awful waking up each morning and realising that you are an american
abortion is a crime
the religious republicans in the us are no better than the taliban  complete nutters obsessed by what they think god thinks is right
abortion is the ultimate expression of hypergamy gynocentrism isnt just a western thing it is global and women worldwide will fight tooth and nail for the right to be absolved of bad reproductive decisions
got to save them in the womb so they can die in the classroom
its ironic that all those pro abortion were never aborted themselves
the usa land of the backwards
america leaves afghanistan now half of it is run by the taliban ironic
you can feel sorry for them all you like but the left wanted full term abortion yes thats killing a fully formed baby that just hasnt been born yet some leftist states had even aborted babies after they had just been born thats murder no matter how you dress it up no one has a right to do that
there will be anarchy in the streets
world is getting fked up everyday
"american has too many right and it better to cut some off to set boundaries  use protection if you desire to have sex and if you are rape the innocent child isnt the victim here  people should wake up 
what about the women that dies everyday from abortion  to that need to be discussed right
god bless america "
and there is biden reading from an autocue again man cant speak a sentence on his own
im in the usa when trump won in 2016 it became a very scary nasty place today reminds us of his fascist regime
lets be honest the woman shown here dont even have kids
"great massive inflation so they brought abortion rights to the front of news
smoke curtain to draw attention from what is going on"
the ironic thing is this will lead to leftist rioting looting and burning in leftist states where in those states abortion is still legal they are going to literally burn their own stuff down
usa just a third world country wearing a gucci belt
they are evolving just backward 
bbc fake news abortion is not in the constitution and the supreme court has only relegated the abortion decision to state levels this is a great win for donald trump    in trump we trust
"wrong

rights only exist when given by government

there are no natural rights

scotus did not ban abortion

it gave that decisionpower to the states

factually incorrect and biased"
you mean i cant sleep around and just abort the consequences die conservatives
thats a lie they have not been totally reversed
 karma too many opinions on other women from other parts of the world
well they have to keep those classrooms full for the shooting sprees
get ready for a summer of leftist see fascist idiots in their monkeypox masks easier to hide from the cctv protesting see rioting in various cities across the us obviously this wont occur in their own back yard as their leftist cities will still allow abortions regardless of the ruling as they are state controlled expect death threats violence damage to government buildings and local businesses oh and of course lets not forget the killing of babies too tolerance at its finest
there seems to be  a lot of supreme court  justices when asked about the roe v wade question simply lied
june 24 the day that the unborn got their civil rights and protection from being unjustly murdered by sexually irresponsible degenerates who refuse to take responsibility for their actions
it will still be in the hands of the people when half are for it and half are against it it is best for the states to decide
abortion groups must mind that they would be disappeared if their mom own it
go to hell this women
this is ever the most bloody violation to womans right in 21st century your americans had better shut up by mentioning any human rights from now on so hypocrite and dishonest what a joke
abortion rights for trans women 
"217 i am 21 and i am terrified 
hmmmyou are not terrified killing a baby but you are terrified cuz your right to kill the babies is taken away oh mywhat on earth is going on"
now women learn word  responsibility
"americano abortions
school shootingsthoughts and prayers 

its a joke they value life until it comes into the world"
"the supreme court did not make abortion illegal the ruling was to say the supreme court did not have the right in the first place to make this law they were correcting what was in effect and illegal law at the time in 1973

the supreme court are basically saying you in the congress must pass the abortion law it was not the responsibility or the legal right of the supreme court to create a law that permitted abortion in 1973

joe biden of course is squirming away from his responsibility as the president as are the democratic party they are blaming the court when they as the elected party can immediately table their bill to legalise abortion across all states

its the classic cowardly politician a bit like what happens here in britain where they want to point the finger somewhere else when in fact it lies with the elected government

the principal would be as if our own supreme court in the united kingdom wrote a law and implemented it without parliament having agreed to the writing of the law and without the supreme court having the power to implement the law

once again we see poor journalism from the bbc who do not represent the truthful facts of how this issue has come about but simply advocate for abortion it doesnt even get into the deep moral issues around the rights of a child remembering that in some states the abortion law allows the killing of a child right up to the point it leaves the womb where effectively the child would otherwise be viable outside of the womb had it been born naturally

we should also remember that there are a wide range of contraception which should prevent pregnancy in the first place if a woman wants to manage her risks in a more effective way i recognise that in america there may be challenges around that given that healthcare is not free at the point of provision

we should also recognise that we are actively killing a human being the deep challenge of course is when does that collection of cells moving towards fetal development become a human being

the ethical problem is that we are saying womens rights are greater than those of a dependent child when women do actually have the alternative contraception options to prevent the pregnancy in the first place of course there should be exceptions such as rape or criminal abuses towards women where abortion should be in place along with all of those issues of clinical risk 
the rights of the person who is not yet born versus the rights of the woman who has power over the unborn person is the stress test of society it feels to me that abortion has become more like another contraception option where a woman has failed to make proper contraception plans to prevent pregnancy in the first place

and yes god forbid i am saying that women do have responsibility to manage contraception responsibility in todays world seems to be something that belongs to someone else"
so what about a woman who has been raped should they be forced to keep the child yes it is not the childs fault but it is not the womans fault neither  she did not ask to be raped so therefore she should have the right to an abortion
quick one as im the other side of the world if you can travel state lines for an abortion legally if its illegal in your state does that mean they can now cross state lines to buy cannabis for the same reasons
remember when alcohol was banned in the early 20th century it didnt stop people drinking alcohol people illegally made and sold booze all over the place same things happening here banning abortions will not stop them it will only make them more dangerous by being preformed by people who arent trained doctors
"1 prove its not a baby and just a cluster of cells and i would agree with abortion 

2 if it has a heart a brain and can feel pain after 89 weeks there is no logical reason why anyone should be allowed to kill a baby particularly when 99 of abortions are preventable and 100 are preventable after 8 weeks when a baby can feel pain by doing just 1 pregnancy test a month 6 max when sexually active

3 if you are having protected sex and do 1 pregnancy test a month 6 when you are sexually active no baby will need to feel pain for your sexual pleasure how could anyone not do that 

4 at least before 8 weeks you wont be putting a baby through pain 24 weeks in the uk or later in special circumstances is ridiculous you can have a baby at 23 weeks and it has about a 50 chance of survival obviously killing a new born 23 week baby would be the worst crime imaginable but if the baby is in the exact same state and just hasnt been delivered yet its seen as a great thing vital for womans rights

5 if you are prepared to have sex be prepared to have a baby no one should suffer for your sexual pleasure 

i should also say that before i looked into it i was pro abortion but i think more people should be concerned about putting babys or foetuses through pain when this is preventable we are living in a society of 0 accountability"
"these prochoice devils are the same animals who go round telling people that eating meat is murder yet they have no problem killing children 

also the prochoice devils who are complaining that they have lost their right to chooseits very easy saying that because their already born"
us  is taking in thousands of migrants every year why dont this women who want to abort luk after the children
"another step towards fascism in america 
after all they based overturning this on right to privacy not being explicit 
everything else also tied to right to privacy in now under threat"
ironic that this court case came from mississippi a backwards state with high child poverty rates  congrats mississippi you now are getting more kids to abuse and neglect
"good abortion isnt your plan a

in a perfect world people could have abortions out of necessity  but over 200k abortions a year is a complete joke accidental pregnancies with condoms and the pill are individually 15100 and 1100 respectively  combined that number should be very low but 200k accidental pregnancies a year people are looking at abortion as if it was a right instead of a privlidge and a lot of inhuman animals abused the system by killing babies

good riddance now you dogs will have to actually practice safe sex the horror right"
just take necessary precautions to not get pregnant all acting like its inevitable that youre going to get pregnant about time woman took responsibility for once
we are not a representative democracy we are an oligarchy we are becoming a theocracy and this will flame our divisions
satanists are crying no more unborn babies to eat
abortion is sick if your big enough to create a life you should be big enough to provide for a life  i love my kids and never once have i or would i ever amagine my life without them
this isnt the end we continue to fight for our rights because this is about controlling people and taking our rights away 80 of americans want reproductive rights to be the land of the law
time to rip out my uterus too much of a liability in this country
there are ways to prevent pregnancy for those who dont want not taking precautions when possible is not wise enough  ending a pregnancy should not be taken lightly but should be considered carefully according to ones situation
simple solution dont get pregnant and you wont need to kill the baby really simple s i dont drink and drive and i wont get a dui 
cant wait for all the peaceful protests from the gentler tolerant side of politics that are about to commence

i am only alive because my mothers back street abortion was unsuccessful in 1945 she hadnt been raped or beaten when she got pregnant  to her her pregnancy was simply a mere inconvenience  yet in spite of the efforts to dismember me and kill me i survived just i died at the eventual birth but was resuscitated  even then she didnt want me  i am so grateful to be here 76 years later with four children and ten beautiful grandchildren who would never have existed if my death had been successful  the unborn cannot speak or plead for their lives its not just about my body my rights that pregnant mothers body has another bodyperson inside her and that little one has no say now thankfully someone has spoken up for them to protect these little ones  its murder to kill another human being whether that child is in the womb or out
about time 
"unfortunately since the demacrats fear losing powerthey are spearheading a movement to overthrow the supreme court
you can tell it by there words they have loved the supreme court for the last fifty years even said it was not political but every honest american knows it is and always has beenlol"
prolife believers want to save the fetus but once the child is born literally the child is f
"right to abortion  right to kill a person who cant speak for himself
unless its for medical compulsion of life threatening for respective mother"
what surprise and terrifies me is that many ppl who are supporting banning abortion are women themselves so pathetic
maybe these dumbasses will stop shagging for 2 seconds and realise what a shithole the 1st world countries have become  but then again we expect much from stupid people
what part of the us constitution guarantees abortion or the right to access medical care
she just lied about the gay thingthey didnt say anything about the gaysugh
as a pregnant man i find this attack on mens rights very distressful
"how embarrassing the passage of this law is part of the war of religions against each other they pass a law to protect the fetus women are seen as a bag in which future soldiers should grow but in the case of the hundreds of thousands of children who fall victim to violence and war every year children who go to war by force children who work on the streets children who are trafficked for sexual purposes and organs and dozens another catastrophe
the legislators and men of god are dumb and blind sorry i forgot children victims of sexual harassment in the church more than 300000 victims a year in france alone church leaders may need more children to meet their sexual needs maybe handmades tale has already started"
wow the right to murder babies in the womb has been denied all those would be murderers will have to stop having gratuitous sex or use contraceptives instead smh
omg so funny to watch 
end baby butchery ban abortion mills
617 the rape baby argument we are using the 1 of cases to justify the other 99 healthy ones 
if you dont wanna have a child use protection but if it does happen that you get pregnant see it as a gift of god and love that child no matter who the father is how stressed your life is that child cant do anything about who the father is but will love whoever gives himher love back like every mother and father should do
the us is socially evolving backwards 
fantastic news
the separation of church and state is over the usa is fucked
yeah murica the freedom land 
no the rights to abortion lies in the state that votes to have the rights of abortion  thats why local elections are important  if you want to murder your child then vote for it if you dont want to murder your child then vote against it its that simple
good stop murdering babies its disgusting the fact people actually advocate to end babies lives is disgusting to me the future generations will see this abortion culture one of the worst atrocities in human history
i hope u can understand the elites want your kids as slaves to theirs they do not have your best interests at heart every three days the wipe their behinds with the constitution being constipated from the diet of kings
"taliban rules based on religion same in us
human rights are missing
sad"
these men better use protection
this is a great day in the history of the usa  the killing  of babies has come to an end  i know women in my community that have had abortions  6 to 8 times because they keep sleeping around with crappy junkies  useless men if you believe that killing babies because of your hoe attitude is right you are a terrible human being
how long will it take planned parenthood to send for planes to states like texas to pick up girls during school hours without parental consent and wisk them off to the nearest slaughtering state but with the full cooperation of the schools
the american people are becoming rich and they are forgetting the rules of religion prohibiting abortion seems to suffocate american citizens but the american government has done well
its yea the video game industry is in control of everything so they are doing this and should be because abortion is torture
"227 will of the people im with you sweet heart now the majority of americans want the right to bear arms 

so hands off the guns respect the will of the people right"
blacklist blocked putin do what we can do
thats human against selfish monsters
lies lies lies  dont worry democrats you can still kill your children in all 50 states its just up to the states on what restriction will be instituted some states like california illinois new york say you can murder your children up to 9 months in the birth canal others say no  up to 5 months to kill your kids  i hope this clarifies things
its not everyday you witness a country regressing just wtf is going on usa
its simply pathetic nothing but just pathetic
"mothers will die as a result of this decision guaranteed
teen pregnancy will increase 
child marriage will increase
poverty will increase
there will be more malicious prosecutions
republican states will have greater costs
young people that can afford to leave blue states will leave those that cant afford to will have babies they dont want if they live"
there is no such thing as abortion rights abortion is the killing of babies is bbc a baby killer  
perfect the  rate of ungerage people in conflict with the law will surely boost the in the next 18 years
were overpopulated humans are a virus  many of the people that would want abortions wouldnt make the best parents  so regardless of when a soul enters a body we may as well allow abortion  who wants more commies in the world anyway
so thats what a women is i thought there were no sexes anymore
maybe im wrong butban abortion  more soldiers not worrying at all in todays climate
its nowhere in the constitution
when all of the churches in the us have closed down and do not reopen then we shall have democracy and freedom again
revival is coming to america
just look at trans rights
abortion was never a constitutional right and actually violates the 4th amendment it was an illegal act by the scotus in 1973 by making it a federal law set right today and set the abortion issue back to the state legislatures where it can be voted on for each state  scotus in 1973 only was to interpret the law not make law and thats exactly what they did and it was a violation of the purpose of scotus women have a choice with their bodies not to have sex since abortion is not birth control here in america we are giving the lord all the glory for this victory
biden trying to be different 
itll bankrupt republican red states with unwanted babies someone has to bathe them feed them and send them to school before they give them guns and not any of them are going to vote republican 
i am waiting for burning buildings and rioting in this peaceful protest
cassava leaves are very good for abortion

the science labs dont need aborted feotuss anymore they need to be responsible and not get pregnant in first place
usa the nation where its not ok to kill a human pretadpole but its perfectly fine to shoot human adultsvoted by the same crowd 
6 of the 9 judges followed the constitution it had nothing to do with their personal beliefsthey are supreme court judges there to interpret the constitution
its the dark ages
the president cant even bring down the price of gas
life won today then they turn around and call for the death penalty ahhahaha oh the irony
no where in the us constitution does it grant you the right to an abortion
"from the us  we are not polarized the majority of americans want abortion to be legal we are literally under minority extremist rule  6 religious extremists decided today that they dont like abortion so they overturned 50 years of legal precedent to make it so

edit they are going after gay rights next and the right to contraception and god knows what after that this is what fascism looks like"
why do many americans fight so hard to stop a womens tragically hard choice on there body for whatever reason  they feel its  there only option is too end their pregnancy  but nobody riots or protest and courts dont even attempt   to try and overturn any of your assault weapons laws  im not trying too be rude or disrespectful as im not american so im just simply trying to understand the logic of some mom out there homeless or drug deepened raped abused many reasons besides a lazy birth control method where a women keeps getting pregnant and just keeps getting rid of baby that way is disgusting and should have tubes tied but as i was saying why is there so much passion in your country on the life of a mom its consider evil for her to end the fetus from growing but it almost seems less important to stop a person from killing classrooms of children why dont those moms who wanted their babies and just sent them too school not have the support of so many including courts too i change that law on assault weapons 
is it that hard not to get pregnate
watch this mad nation bring back segregation and prohibition within the next decade
why dont women just goto another country for the procedure
im american and abortion was never a constitutional right60 million babies dismembered and slaughtered at the alter of convenience since 73 by immoral people that need to learn what morals and contraceptives arethankgod in heaven it was struck down
"putting a mans tenth child into mandatory servitude to the early 
catholic church is the root of their views on mandatory procreation"
i pity the brits law not based on facts more tea anyone
can shoot full grown kids but lord forbid you kill a fetus
how awful that country is going backwardswasnt it called once the land of the free what a joke
thats good because all those innocent lives will be saved and theyll have the opportunity to experience the world before they would have been killed millions of future lives have been saved thats wonderful
so  us in god we trust uk god save the queen who is god of biden  johnson blame or praise
fifty years backward on abortion rights and 150 years behind on gun control way to go usa donald trump making america great again in the 19th century
im one happy yank and god is whom i thank next overturn of jubilee same sex marriage no more
i take it the us supreme court is full of old people shame on them
"i am prochoice but if the abortion will be used for medical emergencies for rpe victims or for molsted victims that is fine but to continuously use it as birth control is abuse and wrong 

the states has complete access to contraceptives why not be responsible and use the provided contraceptives its your choice to give into your lust and allow yourself to be impregnated or to impregnate women"
the only person in this video with a reasonable bmi is the bbc presenter
this is a great day in america praise our god

it was never a womans right its the life of the baby
freedom of choice but the government dictatedecide and controlling whats right you have to do and dont to your own bodyamazing democracy 
nice one lets celebrate this day
unfortunately this heralds the time for the big migration of the american people progressives will have their states and conservatives the other states this way elections will become significantly more predictable as we all will know to distinguish the progressive from the conservative states thank you very much and good night 
okay rape i get it but u women opening your legs without even thinking yall are dumb
"im not american  thank god also zero political knowledge  but  i get the impression  that  judges are driven by their own personal feelings opinions and  which party they belong to 
best interest of the ordinary people of the country takes the back seat"
it was never a right it was a medical care extended affirmed in roe vs wade which was later abused to kill children
hahaha snowflakes becoming responsible
i surely hope the government will be funding orphanages women are going to be going through unsafe abortions teen marriages and teen pregnancies are going to sky rocket soon therell probably be a plan b and birth control shortage this is just disheartening for everyone
where is the anti surrogacy law if you are so pro life bear the 9 months pregnancy dont pay another person to do it for you 
get rid of all the progressive trash that has been put in to law get rid of them all and crush the leftists that have almost destroyed the west
"nowhere in the us constitution does it say women have the legal right to murder their unborn child
absolute joke of a news station lol"
lets hope all the antiabortion protestors dont get raped by the family members or  a stranger
this isnt banning abortion in my state you can have an abortion until its born quit acting like women will be dying from dirty knitting needles just innocent little babies
"its not right to abortion knuckleheads why not

1 this ruling does not outlaw abortions it merely sends it back to state legislatures
2 there is no right to abortion in the constitution the word isnt even mentioned hence this is a states rights issue by default"
thre us fought the taliban just to replace them with their own christian taliban
imagine a guy cutting holes in a condom just to trap a woman
121 its unfair shes pretty safe from abortion
well played get ready for more religious laws passed all the way to sunday law its  happening
abortion imo will always be the most political issue while humans walk the earth
common sense there is not much to admire america for lately but credits given where credit is due hopefully more countries will follow
cry leftists cry you dont like it then do something about it 1000 years of serfdom has turned europe in to a prison where people have little to no rights
by the power of yehoshua back off evil doers dont come to americans or anywhere in the world saying its my body  then turn back after unprotected affairs for paid abortions or if you cant afford kids get a vasectomy or condoms we are not here for food stamps welfare gov assistance section 8 free housing free funds for a child that you can not afford so its not your body its the childs life and our packet is not paying because you decided to date and screw the rest get a grip 
"its very upsetting to see this happening im pro choice and i believe that women should have the option to have an abortion but on that same note if women have the right to say my body my choice i do believe that there must be discussion on what a prospective father has the right to say as well ie my wallet my choice with abortion being legal as i said i believe it should be women can choose to abort a child even if the father doesnt want them to and assuming the woman wants to keep the child but the father doesnt the woman can still have it and get money from the man so obviously the discussion of abortion is a topic concerning women but it also concerns men as well 
i agree with this outrage but i just wish there was more outrage like this when fathers cant even see their children who are already walking talking and conscious and where there is no debate as to whether they are alive at conception or a clump of cells with no consciousness yet due to spiteful spouses and court systems that treat men terribly all im asking for is a little consistency because lets be real as a whole womens issues get spoken about significantly more than the challenges that men face and there are plenty whether it be in mainstream media or just in our social lives women and men both have issues and just because i ask for attention to also be directed at the other side does not mean im saying take away attention from the other but i shouldnt hold my breath i doubt anything will change my mini rant is over lol also i assume most people wont read through this unfortunately"
"gop to announce their next political goals
remove womens right to vote and property rights
bring back slavery"
nobody had a legal right to an abortion in the first place but nothing is being taken away from anyone or being banned all theyre doing is letting states decide for themselves if and when an abortion would be performed letting elected officials decide for their constituents in some states for example abortions will be allowed up until 24 weeks and in others they wont be allowed at all but theyre not making it illegal to travel to another state its incredibly simple to not get accidentally pregnant though if youre in such a terrible situation that you cant afford to raise a child perhaps this will encourage people to be more responsible instead of treating getting an abortion like picking up a prescription
why are pro abortionists so transphobic dont they know men can get pregnant too
home of the free
its called recovering moral sanity
its the womans choice not the state 
just have contraceptives mansuch a cheap and simple practice

ya we want to kill our kids  practice abstinence 
the prochoice protesters are so uneducated the school system and tik tok has failed them the ruling is the state you live in makes the decision most of them im sure live in a democrat state so there going to be able to have as many abortions their cold heart can handle the american liberals are so anger and lost
america slips back into the 19th century by removing every womans right to selfdetermination the socalled prolifers arent nearly so bothered about kids getting shot to pieces enmasse in schools on a weekly basis as if we needed confirmation that 50 of americans are stupid
i think abortion is murder and the unborn baby did nothing wrong unless the unborn baby endangers its mother life
still driving around with a huge placard with your name on it sarah
forget about all the other issues common americans face but oh no you just had to stick your nose in peoples personal lives  lets see if pro life people will be there for you when youre with a child that you cannot care for
naturally nothing will be done despite justices committing purgury in front of the nation which then turn around and steal rights from our population
haahaafuckbunniesits over
and this shit country has the audacity to preach others  about human rights when they have the largest incarcerated population astronomical health costs for majority of the peoplea failing education system children gunned downed at school and people so paranoid to carry guns everywhere now this well done muarica
im encouraged to see young women that are fighting for the right to life abortion is murder look at a newborn baby and see if you are ok with anybody ripping it apart or stabbing it in the neck and murdering the baby
be good if republicans cared as much about human life after birth as before it what a different country the us would be
i hope we dont follow this
sex 
california allows abortion
why is all of this blown out of proportion  if you feel you want to kill your unborn baby just drive over to the closet state where it is legal and get it done and live a happy life  i think the overturning it is a good decision overall and every state should be able decide what they think is right in the matter of abortion
they didnt take away a right the right to abortion was never constitutional they gave the right to decide to individual states as it should be this is not the job of the federal government its federal overreach take responsibility for your own decisions the decision to have unprotected sex when there are numerous methods of protection
i hate it here
divided states of ameristan this is all fluff people will just go to democratic states to get one with a whole movement to help themanita thomas must be celebrating tonight its farcical
the right to abortion was not struck downthere was never a right to abortionthe court just said that judges cant make this decision and that it has to be decided by each states individual elected legislatures
the world is tumbling upside down into a terrible abyss there must be something wrong with society is it culture wars poor poor america
move to state that lets you murder your baby 
theyre gonna keep fighting for what gun legislation to protect the lives of kids in schools healthcare for all people the many deaths and complications from back alley abortions or how about proper care for the many many children in vulnerable situations that they have no control over i doubt theyll give a shit about anything else now well maybe taking away other rights that have been fought for over the years what was is heard there is talk about taking back the right to same sex marriage
what most people dont know is that babies of 9 months were being aborted and used for nefarious purposes  when you look into the details its horrific
"dear women dear feminists men have always been in danger to be made a father against their will in those cases there is hardly any personal autonomy left if you have to care about a child although you did not want to women benefited from the privilege to be able to undo their bad choicesmistakes after the fact men always have only had the option of contraception

the perfect example to show that women are extremely privileged regarding the societal empathy they receive where were all the protesters fighting for mens rights of family planninglife planningpersonal autonomy have you heard my dear feminists"
well now safe abortions will only be available to americas wealthy as god willed it i guess 
q is back  
plus im pretty sure all of them babys would still love to have a life without instead of been born
"abortion has never been guaranteed by the constitution
   about  the only right guaranteed would probably be the right to refuse to abort 

should abortion be considered as a legal option sure
   but in 95 of cases where abortion happens in america theres no medical or rape issue 
   there may be considerations for supporting the child after birth or concerns about the hospital costs of giving birth 
but thats unlikely to be the case for more than 1015 of cases at best and adoption or pregnancy centers are a thing 

and realistically speaking the supreme court would have probably considered the outcome of some woman taping some guy
_and then insisting on aborting said baby_ against her victims wishes 

abortion on demand is wrong abortion on having a need thats something worth discussing 
   i would point out that if only 0001 of all abortions resulted directly in death for the mother that  would be around 800 deaths annually  and we know from antecedents of situations where the mother to be dies but it is not attributed to her abortion even if investigations by family reveal probable links 

california for instance doesnt even report what information on abortion they do collect let alone try to track the so called back alley abortions that happen in their state

simply put if people want universal abortion access they need better  more reliably researched arguments for it than emotional arguments based upon the mothers 9 month inconveniencing _especially when so called abusive boyfriends are just as likely to coerce their girlfriend into getting an abortion if not more so_ _i know from stories former planned parenthood workers tell that this happens_ _frankly  speaking it seems more likely _

it doesnt really help the pro abortion argument that prior to this overturning
north korea  china were amongst the few countries that could match americas abortion access standards 
   most of the 200 countries worldwide restrict abortion access in some fashion to a greater or lesser degree"
usa population about to hit big 
free contraceptive  free health care  then
jesus loves the little children
she said i am sorry i can not kill your baby
you sick basrds lost
they picked one woman with glitter glued to her face to argue for abortion 130 and one woman with glitter glued to her face to argue against abortion 223
if only pro life people put this much effort in the banning of guns across america i guess theyd rather take people rights than guns
the usa takes another step backwards into the 18th century demonstrating even further what a retarded country it is
i too wish that they were aborted
why do one gets pregnant in the first place if you have to go for abortion
abortion is illegal and guns are a constitutional right in afghanistan as well america is great
its a pity an unborn child cannot stand up for their right 
they all better be donating to orphanages all of those nut bags
"i truly wish prolife idiots would understand the implications of what they believe in 
abortions will always happen
roe vs wade made abortions safe and calculated now america is returning to the old days where coat hooks and two day trips to canada and mexico are common"
yes way to go
what about the rights of unborn child what fault is theirs
pregnancy is profit for america thats all that matters nothing else
god bless  im so glad now it could be more babys  born and earth population and united states population can expand 
women who want abortion will find a way i expect to see the rise of people who are not medically trained now offering abortion babies that are not wanted will be abandoned social services are not funded to provide a safety net for this
we dont want church in the schools and businesses but you want to take away my right
abortion is killing by hit and run
the law never changedthou shall not kill
im 21 and im terrified why  because you cant get an abortion
banning the procedure after a certain amount of time has passed in the pregnancy  a logical decision and a win for sanity
absolutely love this  ben a while since ive ben proud about my country
you have the right to wear a condom
"if you support banning a womans access to safe legal abortion  you are flatout antiamerican the vast majority of americans want abortion to be legal with obvious exceptions based upon term limits 
you are not an american if you are happy with what happened today that is the ultimate truth
we have a lot of people in this country masquerading as americans when they disagree with everything america is supposed to stand for they hate freedom they hate democracy they hate anyone who is not exactly like them and most of them live in the traitorous south who cost our nation millions of lives when they rebelled in the 19th century nowadays they like to claim they are more american than everyone else even though we all know differently you are not americans you are scum"
"dear police covering riotsprotests
give the babykil lers a taste of their own beliefsshoot them
at least they can run and try to protect themselves "
simple dont want to get pregnant dont have sex
absolutely disgusting
they can do something impeach thomas barrett kavanagh and gorsiche thomas has ties with right wing extremists and is unfit to serve the other 3 lied under oath to congress regarding their views on precedent alito can stay but those 4 gotta go
land of the free if only they gave a shit about the little children after they are born
what if the baby was going to have no quality of life what if the mothers life was at risk if the pregnancy continued and she already had a child whom she didnt want to leave with no mom 
democrats you welcomed to moved back to ny and ca
im incredibly happy that people care and are fighting to get this human decency back abortion should not be seen as murder i see murder as if something has already been born not something that cant even breathe and is leaching off its mothers well being
"a great day for america 
a great day for the unborn children 
time to go the same way in uk and europe"
as an american my country never ceases to embarrass the hell out of me  shameful
the title reveals the bias of this reporting  that is not what the ruling was
i wonder how many of these happy young women celebrating here will die because of their pro choice decision
bear in mind that the democrats are in favour of abortions up to and including the point after a child has actually been born   it doesnt take much to translate this into selective infanticide 
planned parenthood is a branch of white nationalism and supremacy such as the kkk disown and destroy margaret sangers statues
great news amen jesus loves all the precious babies
as canadian i feel sorry for all the women rights come to canada 
biden is always on the stupid  side
this can be fixed by your vote
rather than banning guns they are taking away a v important constitutional right from the women what a shame
the christian racist taliban is takin
america is a complete joke to western society its like their evolving backwards thank god i live in england 
women being made accountable for their bad behaviors  omg
"this is being overplayed divisively
this was a correction of a bad law 
all that has happened is that individual states will be responsible for their abortion laws via their elected representatives and so democracy has been improved
nothing stops women from crossing state borders to get an abortion
the decision was not caused by trump judges at all it was a decision based on correct legal interpretation of the constitution by 6 to 3  in favour
the bbc is showing bias in its presentation and people are overreacting emotionally many subtle adjustments will balance out inherent difficulties that are being screamed about and are well known to need addressing such as cases of rape and poverty etc
49 years ago the supreme court invented law in contravention of its jurisdiction and that has now been corrected the democrats are pushing reaction to get votes 
joe biden president_ and nancy pelosi speaker of the house both back abortion very strongly and yet also claim to be catholics it is completely against the catholic faith to endorse abortion  so they are both clearly liars whichever way you look at their stances"
america is the most backwards country on the planet
"no one has lost the right to abortion  it may become inconvenient jurisdiction was simply remanded from federal to individual state control
jaybee installed elliptical office occupant is most certainly not a devout catholic"
the constitution never gave them a right to an abortion thats false and anybody saying that is either a liar or ignorant of  the facts roe vs wade is not a law it was a judicial decision thats all its supporters say its legal precedence that enshrines it under that logic jim crow laws would still be in affect its left to the states in otherwards the voters of those states that determines it legality where it belonged all along
so all the left has is groomers  baby killers  free loaders  and rioters and looters on thier side    and they wonder why the left is getting so much push back now days   hmmhmhmhmh
lol the baby killers are so mad  and thats a good thing
roe has delighted sane people and enraged fanaticsxian sharia law is celebrating their hollow victory o telling others how to live  and it will not stop there  goddamn i thought this was america
410 if he really cared about it being up to the people he would be for legalizing it but hes not so he uses buzzwords and catchphrases instead
"i am not a us citizen and dont know the politics either but i personally think they should have never banned abortion they need to ban guns totally instead
raise your hands if you agree with me "
shame these pro lifers dont give as big of shit for the children murdered in school shootings we need our guns
abortion was never a right granted by the constitution more far left propaganda
best news ever  thank god dont sleep around and have unprotected sex and you should be ok
guns n bibles what a country
someone in sri lanka is committing many unscrupulous evils and murders from within the physical reality of many countrymen in defiance of god investigate and take action sri lanka is a bad poison
more are enraged than delighted this happened because currently the us has a minority rule 30 of the country has more influence over the direction of the country that the other 70 that not democracy whatever way to cut the cheese
"as a child did you imagine this alot

yeah as a 6 year old girl i can imagine she was so excited and passionate about murdering an unborn fetus in a strangers stomach who she didnt even know anything about and who had nothing to do with her let alone the story behind the pregnancy or the reasons for the feeling of needing to get rid

im sorry but what a strange group of people americans are lol"
it was never a constitutional right any rights that are not specifically written into the bill of rights are left to the states to decide ie cannabis
why do women protest to kill their children great decision from the supreme court
yall will see what hell is like
american women sleep around too much what willl happen if women do not have any lasting relationships and keep aborting babies that are from casual affairs dont they know that many societies look down on them being a superpower is not enough have family values and take care of your babies
funny how abortion seems to be an issue and children getting shot and killed every month is not make this country safe for children to live in first
thats whats wrong with this country stupid asses like them dumb asses
people are saying use protection until a woman gets raped multiple times by multiple people until certain details  about the pregnancy lead to the death of the child and the mother until they start finding children dead due to the irresponsibility of an unfit motherfather   until they see hundreds of underage sexual abuse victims die during birth because theyre bodies cant take it not everyone deserves to be parents not everyone planned to even have sex what is wrong with this country
this crazy where the world is heading all thanks to fasist mentality people
i wonder how these animal women who are cheering like idiots wpuld feel if god forbid any of them individually was red by an awful man and now was unable to abort that baby and have to live with that reminder and pain forever i wonder if they would still be cheering like animals then they would deserve a massive crowd of people screaming in joy as that individual is left broken and terrified yet unable to get help for whats happened
europe might need to liberate the usa from fascist rule somehow please i am not trying to overthrow the government  just shame the hell out of republican tourists and ask them why they are so racist and stupid  every time you see an american on the streets ask them if they are  republicans  and if they are ask them why  and ask them if they are fascist and or racist and then tell them to fck off and you dont need their money and go home 
something people are ignoring or intentionally missing out is the fact that roe v wade was based upon testimony of a woman being raped which was later admitted to have been perjury so its based on lies and as such has no reasonable way of being upheld in court stop treating this like an attack its not its how the law works
praise god jesus is the righteous judge and he is coming back repent while you have a chance you wicked people fighting against god only foolish will fight against god
thanks be to god now charge all those doctors with murder throw them all in jail
the shitty judges in the supreme court deserve to be jailed
"pi off with your lives matter honestly its not selfish or disgusting of parents to end up getting an abortion what is selfish of a human is having a baby knowing fully well that you cannot support or raise that child to the best of their abilities and potential knowing that food is short housing is a struggle or knowing that you couldnt afford school fees or clothing 

all these aholes fighting this nonsense remember you live with mommy and daddy they pay everything for you and the only reason you have anything on your back or in your hand so get out of mommies basement and go get a real job"
it is disgusting see a nurse crying because at her place of work she can no longer murder babies it grosses me out
women will use herbs and governments will try to punish them for it  herbs is how women took care of themselves and were burned at the steak as witches  this is the same thing in modern times 
pro life pro responsible parenting
they have no idea what theyre doing at this point
men have been treated like secondhand citizens when it comes to their children for years men have had no rights whatsoever when it come to their children if they wanted the mother to keep it or not yet they have to pay child support any custody cases men have been treated like dirt now women are going to have to learn something about personal responsibility
good we dont need abortion in america and around the world how can one person murder      unborn child  in the name of abaution
this is the best decision in our history finally murder is elegal
sleepy joe  how far we are removed you cant even go a bicycle lol x
god isnt real its made up all of it
these right wing christian white nationalists dont care one bit about refugee babies 
"certainly jesus son of mary the servant and messenger of allah  peace be upon both of them will descend in syria  almanara on two angel wings wearing two dresses of cotton his face dripping with water as if he was coming out of a shower his breath reaching the tip of his fingers at the length of his arm killing everyone who entered his breath except  muslims he breaks the cross kills the pig and accepts only the religion of islam he prays with the muslims in the alaqsa mosque then he will kills the antichrist then he and those with him hide on mount altur for fear of gog and magog  gog and magog 

a people who have been imprisoned by dhulqarnayn under the ground and he said that they will come out when allah wills

they will kill everyone on the earth except jesus and his companions and they will eat the green dry and inanimate opjects then jesus prays to allah to kill them so they all die because of a flying worm that enters  in their noses then he would rule the earth for 40 years in which love justice and much prosperity would prevail even children play with snaks and wolves guard the cattle  then he would die and be buried in muslim cemeteries

4171
o people of the scripture do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning allah save the truth the messiah jesus son of mary was only a messenger of allah and his word which he conveyed unto mary and a spirit from him so believe in allah and his messengers and say not three  cease it is better for you  allah is only one god far is it removed from his transcendent majesty that he should have a son his is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth and allah is sufficient as defender

4172
the messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto allah nor will the favoured angels whoso scorneth his service and is proud all such will he assemble unto him

4173
then as for those who believed and did good works unto them will he pay their wages in full adding unto them of his bounty and as for those who were scornful and proud them will he punish with a painful doom and they will not find for them against allah any protecting friend or helper

4174
o mankind now hath a proof from your lord come unto you and we have sent down unto you a clear light

4175
as for those who believe in allah and hold fast unto him them he will cause to enter into his mercy and grace and will guide them unto him by a straight road
1981
and they have chosen other gods beside allah that they may be a power for them

1982
nay but they will deny their worship of them and become opponents unto them

1983
seest thou not that we have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound them with confusion 

1984
so make no haste against them o muhammad we do but number unto them a sum of days

1985
on the day when we shall gather the righteous unto the beneficent a goodly company

1986
and drive the guilty unto hell a weary herd

1987
they will have no power of intercession save him who hath made a covenant with his lord

1988
and they say the beneficent hath taken unto himself a son

1989
assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing

1990
whereby almost the heavens are torn and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall in ruins

1991
that ye ascribe unto the beneficent a son

1992
when it is not meet for the majesty of the beneficent that he should choose a son

1993
there is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the beneficent as a slave

1994
verily he knoweth them and numbereth them with right numbering

1995
and each one of them will come unto him on the day of resurrection alone

1996
lo those who believe and do good works the beneficent will appoint for them love

1997
and we make this scripture easy in thy tongue o muhammad only that thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off evil and warn therewith the froward folk

1998
and how many a generation before them have we destroyed canst thou muhammad see a single man of them or hear from them the slightest sound 

394
if allah had willed to choose a son he could have chosen what he would of that which he hath created be he glorified he is allah the one the absolute

395
he hath created the heavens and the earth with truth he maketh night to succeed day and he maketh day to succeed night and he constraineth the sun and the moon to give service each running on for an appointed term is not he the mighty the forgiver 

396
he created you from one being then from that being he made its mate and he hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds he created you in the wombs of your mothers creation after creation in a threefold gloom such is allah your lord his is the sovereignty there is no god save him how then are ye turned away 

397
if ye are thankless yet allah is independent of you though he is not pleased with thanklessness for his bondmen and if ye are thankful he is pleased therewith for you no laden soul will bear anothers load then unto your lord is your return and he will tell you what ye used to do lo he knoweth what is in the breasts of men 
how many children would you like to have personally i would love to have 10 children
boys and girls but i only have 5

im 21 and im terrified  that if i continue sleeping around i may have to pay for it lol x
america wtf is wrong with you
"bbcwalking a tightrope off political fire i can tell you its getting crispy 
mewell done you managed too stay neutral"
religious bigots have overturned democracy im amazed usa isnt on fire fascists have taken control
original case was based on a lying women who said she has been raped good decision
the supreme court was once the last recourse  to excesses of the government  but now it enforces the excesses of governments
i understand how people feel but im not fully agreeing with this decision but abortion is like taking someones life and thats a sin also if they do this the country is gonna end up overpopulatedand also poverty is gonna be high
i dont understand how people can be anti abortion when theres multiple situations this could happen in for example a woman who was raped and became pregnant the woman shouldnt have to carry the trauma through the rapists child also accidents with pregnancy can happen even with contraception america is taking away one of the most important human rights choice the us has gone backwards and people need to wake up that this is unacceptable
keep turning the clock going backward in time  well done usa land of the free where laws are backward looking when will we withdraw the right to votes for the minorities women and other progressive laws 
this all happened because of mitch mcconnells scheming and denying a sitting president obama his right to appt judges yet mcconnell rammed through date rapist and the latest a fake christian against abortion yet pro arms oil as code prosecute mcconnells and prosecute the thomass as well as the trump kuschners 
ballots dont matter when the gop are stealing our rights to vote and blatantly stealing elections and promoting and funding  armed treasonous home grown terrorism
repubicans want open carry and push sales and drugs push terrorism allow our kids to be blown away in public places churches schools temples and at work but they care about a fetus 
time to stir the pot election coming up
god bless president donald trump i love this man and i pray that he comes back to the white house we need this man in power very badly use birth control before having sex and getting pregnant you dont kill a child for the sake of saving the life of a mother who was careless and didnt take any precautions
young ladies if you spread your legs to have someone cum in then you better be willing to spread your legs for someone to come out 
yeah more tax paying slaves for america
all the people of america need to vote for trump and we   need trump to go back to his office in 2024
thank god  it is about time
as a classy woman whos been lucky enough to have 6 abortions from potentially six different fathers this is a setback for humanity as a single mother on social assistance after my exs money ran out im not sure how im going to explain this to my transgender children this world is so disappointing
the baby killers are a salt mine tonight lol lol lol
first off you at the bbc better get it right women can still get abortions in this country it hasnt been made illegal so the misinformation youre putting out and the lies stop doing it
"potato joe biden youre not sure what youre saying time for your warm milk and your sleepytime
youre a corruption baby killers"
some people are crying because they cannot murder babies any more the white man has been methodically wiping himself out in abortion clinics causing a demographic crisis
time to grow up stop doing drugs use actual protection im grateful to be adopted and alive
the motions of a soon to be police state absolutely shocking 
bbc is no longer a real news network abortion was not struck down by the supreme court the decision regarding abortion has been shifted from the centre to the states thats all the ruling has done
i guess its alright that abortions are banned now we can have a backup surplus of kids to stabilize the population when another shooting happens 
dont worry hedge fund ceo mistresses wives and girlfriends will still be safe
thank god the blood of these babies have been crying out for 50 yearswhat a glorious day for the sanctity of life
ohhh btw what do you brits have any business in our politics fuckoff limeys
"the left is so accustomed to killing the unborn that its normal to them  murder is still murder  god bless the supreme court and donald trump  god will deal with them  the trigger laws were in place to take effect as soon as roe was overturned  abortionists dont realize what theyve done because of their selfishness  the right to abortion is not in the constitution  it was a big mistake to legalize abortion federally  ruth bader ginsburg herself said the decision was ill advised upon reviewing it  norma mccorvey the real name of roe
regretted heavily her involvement in the process and spent the remainder of her life trying to make up for it"
christofascists now own america
what
unborn baby s sayingthank youi hope nobody gets hurts
america is awful an fd up they have literally taken away womens right and gone backwards like does america not understand that some women dont have enough resources to care for children and some are even teenagers who maybe not even be ready for raising a child like this is literally just disgraceful like bruh
god cant stand americans why is nobody fighting for middle of the road european policy on abortion consciousness begins at 24 weeks and thats when abortion should be allowed to after that its no longer just your body but another lives
your body your choice well take responsibility ladies because you cant be having unprotected sex with random guys then complain when you get pregnant when you should know your own biology
the devil is going to be very rabid these days
it is not the right to abortion it is the right to have a law to kill a baby in the mothers womb
based scotus
we cant kill babies that sucks
"its so great
finally  a win for the beautiful unborn child thankyou lord "
americans are so weird
bbc should stay out of american politics and comment on their own government for gods sake
aye agree with abortion if raped but its when women just get rid of the baby for no reason other than they dont want it its still a living human being
222  im 21 and im terrified  well what are you terrified about your assignment results dumbo 
im 14 and i know a lot about life and abotion is wrong babys dont need to die smh 
the decision is correct  the constitution does not guarantee a right to kill the unborn   it is up to the legislature to create such a law to provide such a right
the bbc will probably delete this but the fact is the bbc havent done their research and are lying again the supreme court did not strike down the right to abortion it simple restored the constitution which clearly states in the 10th amendment that any power not mentioned in the constitution is reserved to the states or the people in other words states make local laws
women have been finding ways to abort fetuses for thousands of years  by the amount of children that are sold into the sex trade  and murdered and tortured by their parents it seems that abortion is the least cruel of them all  there are millions of people who do not want to be and should not be parents  there is no birth control that is 100 effective and abstinence is very rare
god is coming back to the heart of america reap it
fake news media abortion has simply been relegated to a state level it has not been abolished in the us
i truly hope they pass the law to ban gay marriage and stop this pride nonsense
doctors need to stop saying no to sterilization if you want abortions to stop then allow women to be sterilized the first time they ask
do they really think that killing is healthcare unbelievable
"tragic i hope this can be reversed as soon as posible 

although our society is not perfect and we have so much to rectify it is ironic that we mexicans had gained more rights and liberties as time goes by compared to our northern neighbours"
how can americans care so much about unborn children yet not bother at all about killing their children with guns
why the hell people dont wear condomsright to abortion is same like giving a right to kill a human beingjust because you enjoyed sex and in your emotions you were not able to controlyou shouldnt have a right to kill someonefreedom to kill is not a democratic right
behold the banality of dichotomy
yes take that all you leftists genocidals finally justice has been served suck it nancy pelosi and all the left
"what a glorious day to be an american
ive never been prouder of my adopted country
first bruen now dobbs
god bless this supreme court
born british proud texan by choice"
6 judges decide what american woman can do with there bodies is just wrong  its a personal choice for woman not a government choice  it is a sad day for america
give free birth control
there is more important things that need to go or be added but this is a tragic thing to hear another right been removed from the books for women 
look at the woman protesting at 130 no man would make her pregnant  she just looking for a cause
if this is freedom then i dont want to be free seems pretty apt
its like we dont want a civil war but sometimes you wonder if reform and a cleanse of all these old men and the blind women that follow them  would help america be ameroca
why are all these prolife female activists obese lol
this wont affect trans women as they cant get pregnant can they its just play time
absolutely disgusting disgraceful and vile decision making the judges should be executed
this is unthinkable in the 21 century every women should have the right to her decision and not force things in the name of religion
before you could say the sanctity of life we were knee deep in dog muck thieving kids and crusty jugglers
america finally got a w
the us has now returned to the dark ages what was once a nation of liberty and freedom has now become a dictatorship of evil cruelty
"canada gonna get a lot more visits what the boarder guards gonna do stop pregnant women leaving the country 
probably makes me a racist but i treasure all
life and its breaks my heart that abortion is needed but it is needed for what ever reasons
are american birthday rates so low they decided this "
may i suggest the pill if you dont practice safe sex if you dont want a baby take birth control
im just glad it pisses off the weird liberals
"oh fuck so with the combination of the gun law and now this abortion court cases it seems the courts arent only bias it seems that the government an systems of the us will collapse seriously if the us does not do anything soon to try to fix its fuck ups both on national and local it seems that the once great nation will now cease to exist 

now the chance of states leaving the union is at its highest in years if this keeps up not only will the anarchy from blm come back it might get worse"
abortions are not illegal in all us statesit takes away government power and restores it back to the states
in the us a nation where more women die from complications of pregnacy and childbirth than in any developed country where hundreds of thousands have died in a pandemic from lack of healthcare or poverty and where historically females were bought and sold as breeders to enrich slave owners forced labor is an established national tradition and reproductive rights are another example of human rights that were never guaranteed for the poor
"discarding thinking about genuine failures of contraception this should lessen the instances of random sex in america as all women are noe responsible
im going to enjoy watching the youtube videos of american guys saying  but my girlfriend wouldnt let me"
"again more misinformation by the bbc there was no right under the constitution that allowed for abortion that is a law by state and no judiciary in the uk or the us can make laws that is by legislators all that was done was overturn and set right the constitution the decision was that roe v wade was flawed as it meant creating a new right under the consitution and that can not be done by any judiciary or legislator laws and rights are very different judges do not make laws both in the uk or the us it is still law that states can decide what is allowed when it is allowed for abortion 

the decision does not mean abortions can not be done abortion is not a right under the constitution the fact is ending a life is murder and people can try and twist it all they like it is infanticide and even goes back to sacrificing children to mollock personally abortions should be outlawed arguments for it are flawed by nature biology and even science itself that being said the states in the us can still make their own laws as it was for a long time roe v wade is not constitutional and that is all the decision was it changes nothing on abortion laws and those laws have always been state level 
 
quote the constitution where it says abortions are a right you will not find it
 
abortions are alloowed and state legtislator are responsible for making those laws ion those states i am an englishman who knows this so americans who do not you should be ashamed

the decision does not mean an end to abortions no matter which side you stand on

the beeb needs to stop misinforming people

so yeah abortions have not come to an end in the us beeb are lying yet again propagandists get your facts right beeb the right in the constitution has never existed and roe v wade could never be right that was a state level decision and scotus should have thrown it out then and told the state to make their decision there has never been that right in the constitution if the state law exists then they can have one so what is the issue stop gaslighting people

rights and laws are not the same thing"
great job us 
thank god sacred heart 
american democracy is fraud where holding guns is fundamental right and control over your body is not fundamental right how can these mentally ill american govt advise developing nations to about democracy whereas developing nations improving a lot in comparison to themselves but usa is going backwards
this is a tragic moment for america
"you as a woman can have the right to abort a baby as long as the man can have the right to not financially support the baby if he request you have an abortion and you decide you want to keep it
as dave chappelle said if you can kill it i can decide not to pay for it"
ive never seen a country go backwards so quickly without suffering some kind of coup first
i have never seen so many uneducated women praise their own loss of personal choice in one video
pregnancy should be illegal because the child hasnt consented to being born
bbc isnt getting this  the court has merely said its not a right in the federal constitution which means the question goes to the states  for some people they will need to go to another state and get a motel in order to get an abortion  once in a lifetime twice i cant really imagine getting too upset about that
killing  babies is not carrying  women
goodbye gay marriage please respect the church
i am happy to see this  god bless america
congrats prolifers now you cheer be prepared to adopt unwanted babies that is what you get when you make others uteruses your own business
women dont have indiscriminate sex with men you dont want children with  sorted
jeez the amount of children i would have in england if this was a thing
looks like us needs to build many new foster homes from now on
lets overthrow the government
not going to mention that the roe v wade law was based on a lie
420 i became a satanist today because of those fascists yeah jesus loves those children who are born blind deaf etc
" june 24 eu foreign policy chief joseph borrell is heading to tehran to request the islamic regime of iran the master of terrorists to agree with a fake nuclear agreement then the eu  us  lift all the sanctions and also give them  billions of dollars they could  keep all the rockets and they still can supporting all their terrorists groups in middle east and north of africa
  this is happening after the visit of the russian foreign minister to iran
  mike pence on june 23 now biden and his government are threatening to undo all the progress we have made in marginalizing the repressive regime in tehran we call on the biden government to withdraw immediately from all nuclear talks with tehran"
"all fuel for our coming 2nd civil war
britians be grateful you do not live in a crazy violent country with more guns than people"
i get it youre killing someone before they are born thats bad sure  but what about accidental pregnancies  even worse what about women who are raped and just want rid of the kid so they dont have to have that memory every day that they were forced against their will to have a kid  i am a man myself so please forgive me if my views are unjust  but i do believe theres a few cases where you should have the right  obviously people will disagree with this view and thats fine we all have the right to free speech well within reason of course
the unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for they never make demands of you they are morally uncomplicated unlike orphans they dont need money education or childcare they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships and when they are born you can forget about them because they cease to be unborn its almost as if by being born they have died to you you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth power or privilege without reimagining social structures apologizing or making reparations to anyone they are in short the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe
coat hanger sales will go through the roof
great news
"these people act as if these never happened before roe v wade or as if theyll stop after it theyve been happening since the beginning of time and will continue long after today they have stopped nothing the only thing theyre doing is making it much more dangerous and increasing losses of womens lives but then thats what they want the prolife piles of fetid feces thump their bibles and screech that if you are trying to do this then you deserve to not survive the procedure  prolife 

hardly surprising that most of these people are religious zealots using their dusty old pile of paper to justify doing whatever harmful evil they want by pretending its gods word  but its not just religious zealots either some of them are also conspiracy theorists who think that by forcing people to have babies theyll stop the great replacement which is absurd since the ban affects the immigrants too and who do you think are knocking boots more duh "
how much more sane the prolifers seem

now you know this isnt correct dont you
i knew the bbc was bad but this is misleading even coming from the bbc"
life wins 
darkness has left its cleaning time now buckle up
this really isnt that big of a deal go to another state or mexico etc thats all this does im a right leaning guy who doesnt have much of an opinion on abortion really only that banning it doesnt stop it it just makes the woman get it in unsafe means like traveling abroad etc but all these people protesting why not a big deal so you need a road trip to get it done very tiny inconvenience
having illegal abortions hmmm okay go to prison lol  its actually classed as murder go to prison 
yehp and meanwhile the entire world is being culled for the wef   new world order agenda culling great reset all of this is distraction from the facts these same wef 300 united nation evil puppets are purposely starving and destroying your countries to thin the population so that they can keep control wake up people you are the frogs in the pot
please wear a mask nope constitutional rights please get vaccinated nope constitutional rights lets ban untrained 17 year old minors from carrying semi automatic weapons in public nope constitutional rights  lets make this 15 year old rape victim give birth to her rapists baby because of my religious beliefs  sure screw the 1st amendment  lets let the border patrol assault citizens in their own yard  ok the 4 amendment isnt important  so while we point to a constitution written by slave owners for a country built on land stolen from the natives they slaughtered  lets consider renaming this country for what it is  the oligarchy of hypocrisy
i live in a big city and to find an active pro life group no where around there bribed by the opisition to shut up that is exactly what they do
texas here god bless the supreme court texas secession 2023
"the constitution doesnt mention abortion the courts have restored democracy in america with this ruling 

now states can vote for those that share their beliefs on abortion and the majority will prevail 

thats how its meant to be"
9000 iq move give anyone providing or getting a abortion that was legal yesterday a presidential pardon is this technically illegal yes is it for a good reason yes
this is fantastic hahaha now all of them women who make bad choices and cant control their mating skills will have to work hard at doing exactly that hahaha hopefully this begins to put the accountablity bad on women to make better choices i really wish this would happen in the uk the single mum problem is actually an epidemic the same in the usa and thats why this is so important thank god something has finally been done 
"killing anyone including a foetus in the womb should not be part of any constitutional right 
the screams of the women in the streets who somehow believe that ending life is empowering for them just shows whats wrong with society these women literally are opposed to what femininity is ultimately about 
abortion should never be a right human rights which i support is about something very different and again  in horrible bias of the media shows its ugly face right away these commentators and journalists arent even trying to stay impartial but must berate us with their personal political views i for one who has 
passively experienced the horror and aftermath of an abortion am glad that the termination of life in the womb of a woman can no longer be celebrated or downplayed with euphemisms like abortion"
the incestuous abortions that were missed 60 years ago are now making decisions for others what a freak show 
i always hear my body my choice but what about the unborns body and their choice oh i forgot the left hates life
"from this video what i am seeing is all abortions are illegal in america if that is so then the country has some serious problems if not then there should be cases in which abortions are allowed such as serious mental illness rape victims if the child in the womb is deformed or stillborn if the mother continues it will lead to death of both or either the childparent and any other serious issues 

if a female doesnt want to have a child while having unprotected sex then plan b works fine abortions should be the last measure a female has to take to abort an embryo imo i think she has almost till 4 months to know if she wants the child or not the partner of the woman should also be conscious and aware what kind of responsibility he is handing his partner with having unprotected sex he should learn to either use a condom pull out or finish with oral or external way 

with all the technologies available to prevent pregnancies why would people be happy with a last resort abortions i do know some people dont notice their pregnancies until birth but those are rare"
today i have never been more ashamed to be called an american 2 3rds of our country considers themselves democrat or liberal leaning our supreme court is wrong today the louder conservative minority won we cannot allow our nation to be controlled by screaming rageing bigots who think they speak for all americans
at what point is it okay to take a humans life abortion is murder
hope theres life on mars to much death here
i can bet a lot of those pro life girls and women will want to have an abortion when they gonna have a baby for one reasons or another not all but still plenty and if somebody would like to ask me  well how can you know that look around for stories about pro life people getting abortion it happened many times in the past and will happen again and again in the future
looks like life in america is becoming worse and the country is getting in a downward spiral biden is to be blamed
"usa is pathetic they ban abortions but wont ban automatic military weapons that kill innocent ppl every few seconds in usa  shame on usa shame shame shame usa is a horrid country
men should have reverse vasectomies so then abortions dont need to happen  use your brains jfc forced vasectomies on all men pass that in your usa government 
usa s u x"
just a note the vast majority like 80 support first trimester abortions and the vast majority 6570 support some second trimester abortions this is not the will of america
why should mothers have the legal right to have others expertly kill their unwanted children
whatever happened to condoms birth control or chastity until marriage there are other options besides genocide of the unborn the left is obsessed with sex murder and revolution us christians are winning and will  continue to fight until this is a christian nation again praise our lord jesus christ
abortions are not banned in the us the court ruling simply hands decision back down to the individual states some states are not affected like ca ny va etc the states that have banned abortions have exceptions like rape medical issues etc 
love does not delight in evil good over evil repent god almight gives life more life good sense prevail
if women die of botched abortions that is their choice
they bask in the false glory but the will of the people will be heard and we shall overcome by enshrining abortion rights and reproductive rights for that is human rights
great news for the unborn for those that cant defend themselves and for those who love life to the rest of murders f yourself
why did you have to post two videos on this irrelevant issue  the next law they need to pass is castration and maybe a forced sex change plus throwing them into mens prison for life or outright death penalty for rapists
america really is a shthole isnt it
glad that the murder of babies in some states will not be allowed
"no sex  no pregnancy
the antiabortion rules really make pathways to the rise of lgbtq in america 

you will not get pregnant if you are becoming lesbians"
this just allows each state to set its own abortion laws abortion isnt banned some of you people need to calm down if you want unrestricted abortion including post birth abortions then move to a deep blue state like california or new york if you dont want abortion used as birth control then move to a red state like idaho the dakotas etc
honestly if there is ever a time to storm a government building it wasnt jan 6th its now and the supreme court
omg where will big pharma get its immunoglobulin now
love does not delight in evil good over evil repent god almight gives life more life good sense prevail repent
they are forcing rape victims and victims of incest to have their abusers babies or go to prison in oklahoma this shit is wrong on so many levels

human rights violator
disgusting theres no way you can call the us a first world country some of the most stringent abortion laws in the world and no change to gun laws its exactly like george carlin said they care so much about the unborn but once youre born youre on your own
waitaminnit howhow are the infant sacrifices to the androgynous god moloch going to continue how are these marxists in dc going to get their adrenochrome
1 out of every 6 american women have been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime lots of women are raped in the us and now they are forced to have their rapists children these vile disgusting men should keep there laws of womens bodys
hats off to those people and the supreme court who decided to stop the abortions loved it
claims to be a pro life country but endorses gun laws which culminates in having the highest gun death rate in the world  what a backwards country
sweeping and long overdue change
"there are of course very sad situations that pregnancies come about and for those my heart goes out to
however its about time that people took responsibility for the decisions they makeif you dont want to get pregnant dont have unprotected sex its that simple"
good it isnt in their constitution so its a state matter if you dont like your state then change it via voting or leave end of
grossly misleading
what the fuck
well american is going to become the next china with way to much people that youll probably have to put a law to make sure everyone only has one or two kids
radical christians
if you dont like this country then gtfo bye felicia
yeah all the women wanting to keep abortion legal are the hos that dont want the consequences for their actions just my opinion but that is what it looks like i agree if a crime was involved options should be allowed but if you opened your legs you have to accept what comes out of it i totally agree with that life should always be protected
its so funny the fantasy of one right has been destroyed by a belief far more powerful one one that the left have no control over
up next liberals pause january 6th hearings to call for insurrection
there is no right to abortion guaranteed by the constitution the founding fathers would have considered it an abomination
i am not even in us but i feel so terrified
please tell me if a woman dies from not being able to do abortion whos fault is it
what about post roe v wade are there any plans to help women who may have sought a medical abortion what will happen now if women will have to birth unwantedunplanned babies will prolifers stepup to provide loving nurturing supportive homes and care for the babies born from the abolition of abortion who will help women and babies from this reversal
do what you want girls its your body your baby i cant tell someone not to do something or do something because i would be called a nosey dictator 
catholic church is a mafia like organization  be informed that extreme do destroy everything 
the us government finally degraded under biden in their own country they cannot deal with social and economic problems but at the same time they climb into ukraine they transfer tons of weapons and billions of dollars for the corrupt ukrainian regime there are so many hungry poor and suffering countries in the world but no one is helping africa or south america but there were 40 billion dollars for the war with russia
abortion is murder plain and simple  a beating human heart has rights
dont be surprised when the racists white supremacist and the conservatives who believe authoritarian ideology now work to continue their efforts to overturn the 14th ammendment and all civil rights gains for blacks with an aim of making racial segreagation the law of the land again
upside down world where people cheering for the lives of humans are vilified  and those chanting for their right to murder are praised
"the court simply returned power back to the states it stole almost 50 yrs ago

the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs concern the lives liberties and properties of the people and the internal order improvement and prosperity of the state  federalist 45"
did america start is walk back to the stoneage
some are old enough to recall times before the pill unwanted pregnancies desperation mutilation backstreet abortions dirty table and knitting needlesĺ and death loss two friends in high school this way tragedies
"testimony of jeremy thomas robbins
when i was a young man i enjoyed what most young party going men liked such as girls beer and drugs i would have sex with any girl any time and anywhere for so long i am not sure how many i have been with at this point i had little to no morals nor cares about anything really the only thing i held onto was my word as i was taught when i was a child that a man is measured by his word and to keep your promises so if i said i was going to do something i did it no matter the cost that being said one night i awoke from my sleep sat up in my bed and vocally promised myself i was going to read the bible not sure why to this day i still have no understanding as to why i made this my word but i did so i read and read and read more turns out the bible is a rather large book and it was taking me some time to do it but i gave my word and i kept on reading it and as i read it the words where convicting my soul i could feel something in my heart start to turn and became uneasy then one night when i was asleep i awoke to a presence in the hall at the end of my bed i could see something was there but i was not able to see what it was then i heard a disgusting noise coming from it and i told it 
youre disgusting

then out of the silence out of the darkness i heard

you	are	       to

and it grabbed me

then i awoke not knowing i was in a dream as the entire dream was where i was and how i was never had a dream like this before and never had another like it again 
the crazy part i still felt right where it grabbed me as if the tightness of its grip was still on me
to say the least i have seen something that is not normal nor good there are evil things in this world we can not explain nor understand but i know as true as the air in my lungs spirits are real and so is god
this is my testimony"
americans live in 1952  abortion is a mere right
"416 
jesus loves our little children 
he made one to make many more 
and it grew up and raped 
many women from state to state 
and they cannot be aborted anymore

america is one crazy place "
100 the right decision to ban abortionwell done america
watch the massive crime spike in 15 to 20 years time
abortions are not in the constitution neither is cheese where is the ruling on that oh wait its america land of the fee and home of the slave
its obvious weirdos are the ones upset i love babies who dont well ya some weirdos
in washington state and i fear a civil war the country has turned so hateful we are so weak and truly just asking for an invasion or a civil war
"china knows how the female mind works

tell american women they cant have an abortion and suddenly every american woman wants to abort their american baby"
"shame on maxine for encouraging violence
"
somebody tell me what state has completely banned abortion as the journalist said she never mentioned any state that completely close the doors a planned parenthood when did murdering the child in the mothers womb become healthcare woe to those who say right is wrong and wrong is right another question and you fill in the blank its okay to murder your child when
god is prolife
the gop has replaced safe abortion with unsafe abortion well done just like how the gop replaced the taliban with the taliban 
when libs cry i am happy
welcome canada people will go across the boarder
i incite everyone and especially every woman to take arms up and fight
america is ful l with bs hon clerance thomas you are still considered 35 of a human being according the constitution you hypocrites
im surprised they left the comments on being such a divisive issue i suspect its because the media are not happy about it whereas they stood for no criticism on issues they supported over the past couple of years
these morans who are screaming victory are too dumb to understand real implications of thisthey need to work on making life of kids 8n this country better but who cares about those
latin america slowly legalizing abortions over the last few years and the us now banning it after having had that right for 50 years how demoralizing this setback is makes me sad as an argentian after seeing how hard this battle was in my country to know how hard it will also be for american women now
yes save the kids
her body someone elses right the land of the free
"now how  can you sleep for one night with this womens
while you know they will kill your child or you

killers i hate this womens 
not all of them most of them"
abortion is not a right in the constitution lol   it now means individual states can set their own laws for abortion like texas has a heart beat law  maybe more women will be actually thinking about thier repoduction and contraception more diligently abortion is not a form of contraception its the murder of a child
why was that one girl dressed up like a cat
"people will get angry enough at not having abortions

but when they hear their country is being purposely destroyed as a means of a great reset to make us all own nothing then its sounds wonderful to them"
one question for everyone else equal parts of americaif you observed one man eating human being  do you want to be eatingif you want to be eating you have a great mental health problem because  woman genitals are no conch meat what are you eating baby myself asked the man conch meatdo you want some myself go to bathroom to vomiting okay woman who want to be conch meatin god name amen
it high time the president increase the number of judges on the supreme court  its the only way to combat the moscow mitchs who is nearly single handed destroying our country
abortion is still a sick term but it lessens the horrific reality of the situation murdering babies
so the bbc get told about their bias and all i just heard were people crying about their rights not one mention of the fact of the rights of the life inside the womb
this is so backwards 
time for me to leave this country it doesnt stand for much anymore hypocritical at best downright dangerous at its core
so america is closing down its killing fields finally freedom to kill innocent babies seems to be one of the reasons that triggered selfdestruct america we see today see how it leads to a country without boundary and the freedom to destroy public property and the woke culture
it was never a right to kill a baby
im so happy for that and proud of us supreme court  if you dont want to have babies just be responsible with your body
scotus has established one religion which our constitution is supposed to prevent alito wrote that abortion was not tradition  but her has zero proof so we need to bring back traditional slavery 
hopefully farleftists dont cause billions in damages like in 2020 burn loot murder riots
"due to some family history im not proabortion not because of religion i dont have one not because i wish to control women itd be a long explaination but basically i am a liberal leftie who has different views on this one issue

but i recognise that this doesnt outlaw abortion it outlaws safe abortion women are going to get desperate and take unregulated medication and even go to back street abortionists who may butcher them

i fear that the us has just traded one lot of issues and problems for another lot if there is a god then may god help any woman caught up in this political battle"
"did trump really say that
we know how to create life so only a idiot would think god plays a part 
religion is to blame here 
there are to many extremists in the us"
well if the prolife women get sexually assaulted or red if you really must then say they dont want to keep the kid then laugh at them tell them of their decision in this case and laugh in their faces before walking away
damn but i dont really care
finally all this evil nasty women need to be  lock up
"many women will die 
thanks to the trump administration and these fcked up scotuss"
abortions are evil how you can pull your baby apart in the womb is disgusting you wouldnt do it to a dog
unbelievable  america is being held hostage by the christian right  abortion wont go away  it will go underground and in the process become more dangerous  the fact that they bristle about any attempt to introduce sensible gun control regulations but are perfectly willing to restrict a womens reproductive rights tells you just how prolife they arent
i used to look at bbc as more objective than other media until it stated right to abortion
im shocked and honestly devastated for american women this is going to pain women all over the us
why are we going backwards why
it wasnt a right and it wasnt struck down they simply moved the decision of legality to the states where it should have been in the first place
the ultimate freedom is the freedom to kill your unborn baby
just a reminder to all you biden voters this decision came under his term in office
so condom sales should go up right
"literally going backwards 
build a better world how does she think thats possible when the biggest problem we face is the exploding population theres already to many people on this planet"
the supreme court merely ruled that nowhere in the constitution is the right to destroy human life im not sure what grounds there are to disagree with that
the opposite of pro life is pro death
every country should allow one mistake the 2nd should then become a crime
the american dream is only a dream  its not real
children born of unwanted pregnancy must be state responsibility
this ruling still allows the 8 states who choose to terminate pregnancy up to 1 minute before birth the right to do so yet you do not mention this fact 
no wonder the population growth in europe is lowestyet their stupidity grows in bounds and leaps leave usa alone think about your own countries and how to fix your own problemsidiots
well done america  a step on the right path
this is one of the idiosyncracies that make us politics lesser than under developed or developing countries there are actual problems world is facing and us is still cant decide on right to abortion right to bare arms  etc
and sad it is they all will end up in foster care but yet no one wants to adopt themeven those yelling that its not a good choice
life is worthless rats and roaches can make lives but making choices having a life plan respects make us be human being
yes right now but please dont people understand the situationthe cannibalism is over americans because the trade humane for goldthe gold digger trillonaries using the same thing since we have knowledge of the rapist make womans pregnant to give meat to the canibals trillonariesget to the bottom ofthe dream is only a dream woman have plastic bags in the chest and never can feed the baby because nothing is natural anything else is yes a dream wake up dreaming people amen
"no one actually understands what this decision is it is an excellent legal decision

the whole point is that the scotus is not a political institution roe v wade gave people a right that was not legislated if you want a law such as legalized abortion then the proper path is to ask you law maker to pass a law that involves due process

roe v wade had no due process and yet it performed the function of law making

the decision simply deemed it improper and ask that if the public wants that right go and ask your law maker to do it because the function of scotus is to interpret the law and not making them

and here are people throwing a big tantrum simply because they heard some people saying they overturned the abortion right when it is nowhere near that case

if you want abortion vote for it dont ask judges to do a politicians work"
time to head to america  and rap_ me some women
biden is a moran save the babies we can not have a society that uses violence  its barbaric
abortion leads to female led eugenics its 2055 artificial intelligence analyzing the babys dnabrrrbrrrranalyzing probability of the baby being over 6 feet tall looking like johnny depp and not being bald nor overweight as an adultbrrrprobability 23 woman damn well i guess ill abort this one maybe ill have better luck with the next guythere must be responsibility otherwise we will be heading towards a society we wouldnt want to live in
monsters they deserve to be after birth aborted
why are people so braindead in america
sad yo back to coat hangers i guess 
too many people are claiming the right to abortion is not included in the us constitution although its true that the actual word is not used it is included in the right to privacy body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy in fact which is protected by the constitutionas decided in griswold v connecticut 1965 mcfall v shimp 1978 and of course roe v wade 1973
"heres how to avoid the need for an abortion stop having casual sex
if you must have casual sex use contraception
if you still manage to get pregnant contraception fails rape etc you still have a wide selection of postcoital  contraception options mostall are free in western nations
 morningafter pill
  iud 999 effective at stopping pregnancy if used up to 5 days after sex
 etc"
no the right to murder innocent speechless babies has been struck down since when is murder of the innocent okay for any reason ever
theres a lot of inexpensive birth control out there why isnt that talked about
"the unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for they never make demands of you they are morally uncomplicated unlike the incarcerated addicted or the chronically poor they dont resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct unlike widows they dont ask you to question patriarchy unlike orphans they dont need money education or childcare unlike aliens they dont bring all that racial cultural and religious baggage that you dislike they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships and when they are born you can forget about them because they cease to be unborn you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth power or privilege without reimagining social structures apologizing or making reparations to anyone they are in short the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe prisoners immigrants the sick the poor widows orphans all the groups that are specifically mentioned in the bible they all get thrown under the bus for the unborn

methodist pastor david barnhart"
should be changed to home of the brave but still quite a few cowards
put it this way if you think they truly care about the unborn charlie kirk a prominent prolifer said if he knew a women who had an abortion he would feel sorry for he if he truly believed it was murder on what planet would he feel sorry for a murderer
of course they call them trigger laws because thats what they want the whole right side to have your finger on
do they realize its no gonna stop anyone from having onejust because  its ileagal doesnt mean its gonna stopdont like abortions dont have one
the supreme court just went full order 66 on the libs
when roe vs wade was passed the morning after pill wasnt available
choose life your mom did
there should be better options  people should not be using abortion as birthday
the real dark day in america was when roe v wade was passed
biden is powerless period
unwanted pregnancies cause tax payers a lot of money
my state is new york and any woman who is being forced to go thru with anything they dont want to is welcome here hateful comments will not be responded to
expect bloodied coat hangers to be found in ally ways in states who got rid of abortion thats all i have to say
every child is a precious and sacred gift from god president trumpive noticed that everyone who is for abortion have already been born president reaganincomprehensible that since 1973 61 million abortions done in the us
there are very few sane people on either side of the issue  just look at those women  fyi this case was about a mississippi law that banned abortions after 15 weeks  women in mississippi can still get abortions up until 15 weeks  the medias characterization of this is misleading
still the state decides  so the people of the states decide which is still balance and good
bless the yanks the majority of antiabortionists in america using the argument of murdering babies are the same people who will bite your head off for trying introduce stricter gun laws to reduce the amount of murdered babies
good maybe now the std rates will go down
there is no baby for these people to save the life isnt made yet
i guess in the case of a medical emergency you can claim the that rape has lead to mental illness opening a case to perform an abortion thats just me looking at a loop hole instead of mass riots as this decision went through all the legal paths
only slts and manhes be disappointed 
"its not as if it means abortion wont happen anymore either itll still happen but it will be a lot less safe and bad people now have an opportunity to make money from it 
and not the first time a us law has had these effects might i just add"
there are enough types of birth control and the morning after pill maybe young women might be more careful with their bodies abortion is not birth control american women uoto now could abort a baby right up til the week before it was due that shouldnt be allowed in any civilized society
this is a great day no more abortions thank god god bless america
 dramatic for who for innocent ones por for killers
this is a decision to let states legalize abortion what is the big deal
"the nonaborted humans in the future thank the supreme court abortion should only take place when the mothers life will be in danger if she gives birth 

terminating a fetus because it will inconvenience your lifestyle is immoral and demonic"
very good were going back to our roots in america a proper conservative country
great news for usa from these low life creatures  enemy from within worst than isis  the demon rats
the ignorance of the protesters amazes me do they not realize the only thing this overturn does is to put the abortion rights back into the states they can still get their abortion that hasnt changed it is still legal in the majority of states especially in cases of rape and incest
never go to america
the sport of killing humans a law is needed for the woman
let the accountability start 
this subject shouldnt even be up for discussion i had a friend who got raped when she was 15 her parents were idiots like these people and forced her too keep it and carry it for 9 months when they could have allowed her to abort it since it wasnt even alive yet she dropped out of school in order to take care of her baby when she turned 18 her lovely parents kicked her out of their house my mom let her live with us and took care of the child for her since it was painful for my friend to even look at the child since they so closely resembled the father my friend died in her sleep 2 years ago she was only 19 her whole life was ruined she felt sad and tired all the time and was left with a lot of inguries after giving birth since her body couldnt take it she was such a sweet beautiful girl i truly dispise all the men and women who are pro life what life are you talking about it is a fetas it has yet to develop unless the lady is already 5 months pregnant where the child can feel then its none of your concern if the she chooses to abort or not the only life is the womans who is going to be ruined a child should be a blessing and a choice not a consequence these people scream privileged and uneducated and i wish the pro abortion people would actually bring up scientific facts and peoples stories instead of stupidly shouting my body my choice that aint doing shit to help anyone
women says it will lessen the violence in her country but the guns are fine
what will be next  same sex marriage mix race marriage what the f next  having cops in your f  bedroom you can only slow down the change but you cant stop it
so now what prohibiting guns then blaming on unaccessible abortions
"abortion should also be banned in the uk
it goes against the core principles of christianity and judaism and islam but more so  humanity"
amazingly balanced reporting  it is sad that balance in news reporting seen as remarkable
as a citizen of the us from birth i an deeply ashamed of this country it is on a collision course to either another civil war or conservative dystopia all in all there may very well be bloodshed before the end
i see potentially high risk of gunless females
great news 
the us politics is so bizarre normal things in other countries are polarized and politicized in the us
"this is not about abortion
the ja6 will be forced"
the dishonesty of reporting is scandalous scotus simply corrected a wrong roe was unconstitutional
that has to b a complete violation of womens rights got to be
526 you thought this country would still allow you and subsidise your child termination got it
i hope all the s lags and s luts arent too upset
"glad i was able to help my 15 years old friend when she wanted a termination
i was her only friend and brother figure and she needed an adult

only thing we had to do was travel to manchester because someone could have recognized us in newcastle"
this is not really about abortion everyone is missing the point  its about judges that are biased i dont know what people expect you know the judges are biased and you expect them to make a fair unbiased ruling 
when someone gets raped and forced to give birth abd they dont want to have it all i can say is wow  good luck
i wonder if the bbc is the most hated corporation to ever exist certainly is mt top choice
no they lost the supposed right to make me pay for it
as a hispanic immigrant that came to the united stated im very happy for this decision if people want to have abortions let each state decide if they want to be participant of murderer
no its not its now up to individual states to rule on the subject
this country is dying 
its not a constitutional rightyour getting mixed up with the carrying a gun lawswhich is an actualconstitutional right
0008  abortion was a right    wrong   the only rights that americans have are those enumerated in the us constitution and its amendments  americans have no other rights but they do occasionally get favors from their masters the social security system being a prime example
thou shall not kill  its a commandment that has been overlooked for a long time the unborn finally got their day in court  justice prevailed
this is some taliban 3rd world shit
america is the most divided place in the worldin my opinion
do america know how much of a meme they have always been to the world what a backward place
i wonder if theres a statistic that shows how many prolifers in usa are also nra members oh well look on the bright side more kids means more targets
now us supreme court forces americans to stand with taliban together us supreme court is trying to prove the power of a religion over laws just like taliban this is unbelievable this is making us a barbarian land so shameful it is not other countries beat us down it is us itself drag itself behind the world
are they going to have insurrection are these people going to have an insurrection against the government because abortion rights was shot down wow you better watch it people the fbis going to throw you in jail like you and throw away the key if youre going to try to over the government what you did try on the supreme court there before it was passed you better watch out cuz youre going to get locked up if you happy insurrection against the government because of abortion right was passed by the supreme court
wow what an impartial report lmaothe people are awake nowwe see through the propaganda
these comments are disgusting my sister would be dead if she didnt have an abortion you animals
get your molotovs ready my boys its time to burn some judges mansions
strange that country which is so hyped up on freedom allows unelected officials to make decisions that impacts millions of people
the report was bias  noone was shown celebrating their choice to keep  no mention some people abuse roe v wade to use abortion as a last ditch contraception due to unprotected sex  i dont trust nonofficial statistics on how many us women choose to abort during their lifetime but a safe bet will be 10  i would believe among those maybe 10 were due to rape medical or other trauma  lets say 9 overall used it because of unprotected sex  this is acceptable to keep it legal to me  however no mention that some people believe much more abused it  i found stats claiming it is as high as 30 instead  i know prochoice and prolife issue is so loud mainly for ideologically political and religious reasons not on moral ones  actual arguments for and against on moral grounds matter less and used as tools instead  the fact this is kicked back to the states where abortion can be legalized one day isnt as emphasized relative to how bad that it was overturned  mind you the scotus issue is not abortion legal or illegal but who should handle this if the abortion is a constitutional right or not not weather it is criminal  this report was bias prochoice  no judgment maybe for them it was impossible to represent both sides equally  i am protesting unfair representation not the ruling  dont know there my flavor for today prochoice constitutional but i am not against letting it swing if it was legally done  being fair to some in their perspective in this case will be unfair to others in theirs
221 im 21 and im terrified use condoms or other form or contraception if you must that should do it 
good its changed lot more men an women now will practice safer sex no brainier makes me happy this news 
so misleading and one sided its unreal if you know the facts how about its un done many years of  a unconstitutional overhaul of the legislative process in the states now the power for people to make choices is back with the people to decide when life begins is a decision for the people  trying to claim abortion is a god given right is ridiculous if california wants to keep theirs laws so be it now red states if they choose can change their laws not so much for freedoms of choice when its other peoples choices
"i bet the communist bbc is sick as about this i personally dont really carebut the more lefties and commies and bbc staff hate the newsthe more i love it

im literally amazed the bbc dare keep comments openhow do you keep up the pretence you are impartial when all your commenters hate you and everything you stand for

imagine being part of the bbcthe most pea doh file supporting organisation to have ever existedwhos the statue of outside the bbc

scum bags

and you all dont realise how hated you all are"
the united states of america or as we soon have to call it thecountrythatmustnotgetlaid thank your grandpas in the supreme court dudes they just drafted you all into the permanent friend zone 
british media reporting on us news like we are a us state please stop its just embarrassing they follow the americans like a lost dog
the democrats have deployed national guards unlike on jan 6th when although trumppence had made 20000 national guards ready the democrats wouldnt deploy them because they wanted a riot
who wakes up thinking about other ppl pregnancies and abortions
this is the greatest news the usa has had in decades finally the 55 of americans who oppose abortion will be able to decide their own states laws on the subject history will remember this the way it remembers the ending of slavery and all of its lessthanhuman arguments
keeping legs closed is usually a good thing to do or take the pill
abortion is wrong
hahahaha  hahahahahah i e never seen some many lunatics in my life  women still have the right to choose to choose to keep their legs shut
and im an englishman no way this should have happened women should have every right to choose period 
i thought america was a free country  clearly its not as good as they say im moving to japan
all the antiabortion activists in the video are fat and ugly women i wonder why
how about birth control pills day after pill and condoms   rape is practically the only time the female has not all these aids to keep from conceiving  if a woman does not want to conceive i sure as hell don t want to be born to her  even when they think they want a kid they usually f up  and that is when they are not sadists pedophiles etc
thank you my dear  heavenly father
country who wanted to change the status of womens rights in afghanistan lol
there will be violence
congrats americans
im living in massachusetts and this ruling doesnt apply to my state we will still having abortion conservatives can go f themselves
right to abortion is like a right to cut your finger off if your finger gets broken abortion is wrong
keeping legging closing  saves lives because while you take up a hospital bed getting rid of a life that might want to be here  the bed you take also deprives a sick person that wants to be here    just a thought 
"if the two sides could just respect each other i think that would do a lot
its not murder  its not just a parf   of a womans body
spare  14 day embryos in ivf clinics receive no sacraments
ani implantation contraceptives morning after pill are available over the counter  in some states

it is obviously the womans choice  as it is her risk

a brit"
love our supreme court  this will teach people to be more responsible
i invented gilead the supreme court is making it real margaret atwood
trumps still at work a win for life today  
the bbc shouldnt be aloud to t port on their its like this as they dont report the truth and just feed us democrat bullshit no one should be aour to about a baby when its almost due to be born
now they can adopt all of the kids that will be born into poverty
go back to california also give california back to mexico
a disgusting country
so is this good or bad
this sucks
"perhaps they dont want to cancel abortion only fix that old ruling that served as a platform for wider rights of woman  hope im not mistaken but now they can start a completely different procedure giving back abortion rights to woman based on plain scientific facts that couldnt ever be overruled because science doesnt change with time 
but first science must make it very clear there are no other people living inside a woman body"
so do i still need to pay child support 
its a sad day that the unborn child cant be slaughtered  joe biden 
they care about babies lives and at the same time not do anything about kids being killed in schools makes sense
we need to support the right to choose abortion for women if parents cannot support their babies then who supports i do not want to see child neglect its a fact right
america further becomes a sick joke
while the supreme court decided abortion rights our planet secretly wished for an extinction event
lol what a great country hahaha mad days ahead
so now you will force american women to have babies after they have been rapedgangbangedabusedincest babies that are born deformed from mixing family genetics from abuse will be forced to be born are you crazy america have you judges gone simply wackohave you opposition not got any screws in your brains whatsoeverwhat about women that are raped by serial rapersserial killer babies that could grow to be serial killers and rapers themseleves because of passing over hereditary geneticsomg what a bad decision you guys made today 
the bbc is creepy
finally the libs rant its my body my rights but what about the rights of the baby its hisher body hisher rights hisher life abortion is murder of a baby a human child
im obviously prolife but this is bullshit people are being stripped of their own rights what if a women was raped oh you have to keep that baby and communicate with the father rapist
can you stop obsessively reporting on the us its not the uk
it just went back to the states you dumb ninny
excellent news
"so  a  bunch of old men just decided american women have no right to their own bodies any more 
sorry usa dude you cant hang with us first world countries any more forcing chicks to have kids is not cool and soooo third world country respect your women as fellow human beings brah"
these people pick and choose their religious sins what is tolerated and what is not look in the mirror before telling a person what to do with themselves
in china  an unborn placenta is not yet identified as life  its just mothers property and the mother has the right to give up the property which is her freedomif abortion would endanger the mothers life then no hospital would perform the procedure because the right of life  is first
women that travel from one state to another to have an abortion is nothing short of premeditated murder
the prolife crowd are the same people who would deny asylum to desperate people fleeing warzones and abject poverty theyre also the same people who want to allow unstable teenagers access to assault rifles and theyre the same people who support trumps immigration policy tearing families apart and caging them they must think were stupid if they think theyre fooling anyone into believing they care about strangers unborn children to them this is simply about attacking feminism upholding christian values and winning one over on the libs thats how petty and backwards these people are
so if a woman gets raped and gets pregnant from that she will have no choice but to keep it even if she does not want it so much for a free country
its hilarious these prolife also promote pro death by expanding gun right and minimize restrictions expect a 60 increase in orphanages  abandoned newborns too
everyone must vote for representatives that support womens rights since they threw this issue to the states it is up to us the voters
based fuck leftists and fuck childkillers
this comment wont go down well every day in america more more extremely young children are treated like trash  abused  murdered by their own parents so thats where quite a number of these unwanted children will end up im sure the rest after yesterdays ruling on the second amendment upholding americans rights to keep feeling  thinking they look macho due to the fact that they carry a concealed ego in their holster which means they are in control those children will probably get wiped out in the waves of mass shooting that is inevitable bunch of hypocrites
repent and believe in the lord jesus christ for the salvation of your souls
the fucktalibans of occidental countries this is not the end  respect to all american women who gonna start a hard resistance against this oppression of their fundamental rights
abortion is not a human right its murder period
i love children and all people i am so grateful for the results determined by the supreme court i believe in human rights this protects the human rights of the unborn child
1 in 4 pregnancies self abort for these religious extremists does that mean their god is an abortionist
for such a new country not 250 yrs old to actually force someone elses recent religious ideals onto non religious ppl is no democracy recent coz didnt the nuns used to abort teen pregnancies for all we know they probably still perform these on convent girls now holier than thou
100 years behind civilised society including gun laws
it looks like the bbc doesnt understand how the us constitution works  the supreme court cant and didnt make abortion illegal  it simply said the constitution doesnt protect it as a right  that means that each state can put it to a vote  this is called democracy  rights are not put to a vote and nowhere in our constitution is there a right to an abortion  if a subject is not stated as a right than according to the 9th amendment of our constitution it is a matter for the states to decide by voting  this is why the us is a constitutional republic using democracy to settle matters the constitution does not address   read the us constitution  it is a very short document and no where is there a right to abortion  the word does not even appear in it  this is where democracy plays a role in our constitutional republic   in california theyll be killing their kids right up until the age of 18  in texas killing your kid will be illegal  that is how a republic works
hallelujah for the unborn babies
typical bbc so biased and one sided it is heartwarming however to see so many prolife comments on here 
sluts got to stop slutting i guess 
whats next reversing womens rights america is so tapped and backwards 
same people that  whine about too much  government  they  have taken control over  female  health the  power of a few over the many  everyday  our  freedom is  fading in amercia
bbc bulshit again all 50 states will still have abortion but will have a time limit states can vote who are in charge out so democracy rules you can go to a different state to have an abortion these people want late abortion up to time of birth 
notice all the people a gainst abortion you would not fuck any way  just have the baby and drop them off at the prolife hq
lol what a looney bin
what a sad day in america all because a group of men
usa is a theocracy  so much for freedom of religion
"to the woman who said shes terrified

do you feel helpless do you feel victimised do you feel like your rights have been taken away and your voice silenced by a higher authority well youre in good company because i know thousands of unborn babies who know exactly what thats like if you dont want a baby dont have sex

to the woman who said were gonna keep having botched abortions and die as a result

your basically saying we are gonna keep illegaly murdering people until one day our victim kills us

i would really struggle to feel sorry for you in that instance"
you may not like what they take away from you next 
"it will come down to each individual state having its own sets of values america 
was started as a republic not a democracy food for thought "
this is messed up
roe v wade also made legal contraceptives and contraceptive education these can both be banned buy any states now companies who market these product and health care facilities that provide advice or there products are now criminals in america
isnt it funny how the left all of a sudden knows what a woman is after this ruling
it simply means the states control abortion
good if you dont want children put a johnny on it
canadians will help american women we already said  you can come here and get a abortion anytime  you will have to pay but at least you can get one here dont worry
sorry you cant kill babies some men cant even have any
the supreme court didnt ban abortion bbc doesnt understand how the us system works
now we need to fight to ban same sex marriages
a victory for humans
they kept their gun laws yet they lose a right to abortion crazy usa
it is a shame to see such a modern country act so pathetically with regard to human rights they base their constitution on their being oppressed but do no more than oppress their own people  so you cannot abort a  child even from rape but we are fine with a teenager owning handguns  and driving cars but they cannot drink until 21 they allow tv evangelists whonprey on the weak and poor and are ok better than thieves themselves and then without checking anyone can own an assault rifle what a ridiculous society
they had to cheat the system lie and become hypocrites to get it done
handmaidens tale in the usa
america is dusted
arbotion clinic im sorry maam we are not going to be able to murder your unborn baby today we are sorry for any inconvenience caused
america  land of the free unless youre poor female nonwhite antigun or atheist
people you better pay close attention the prison camp walls are being built getting aid from the supreme court they just made a moral decision not a legal decision thats not their job this needs to be looked into this is a warning shot first in many in plan to rewrite other laws to their benefit  all in moving america backwards no regard for the majority wanting this law to stand  whats brazen is they knew what the majority wanted  carried this out anyway little side not for you guys out there your fucked now do an oops and your life as well as the girl is really fucked advise for your sake get a vasectomy you could get stuck with a woman like whos interviewed here god the mental immoral minority are yelling through a megaphone
great news
praise god  how awful that they want the right to kill their own children  
the mostly peaceful riots will start soon
i thank god for this awesome victory today god is good
more life more money more wife
women applauding a return to a bygone age of oppression and no rights for women now they have no control over there own bodies only in america whats next  cover your faces walk 6 feet behind your man never say no to rape its coming because its america the land of the free but only if your male heterosexual and of course white and wealthy sick country
the best news in 2022 god bless united states of america abortion is murder
"sections of the us of americans love to kill by hook or by crook
by all types of guns murdering the young uns
if not before birth then before they see earth
women supported by the men causing impregnation
to have pleasure and without any procreation
better as justice to the unborn give the couple sterilisation"
well this means they can change the gun rights right 
american politics needs an overhaul the system is broken first you have the trump fiasco and now this maybe they need to adopt the westminster system hard to call what they have now a democracy for the people come on guys sort it out
master tip i now understand why my childhood friends said women that believe in abortion are unfit for marriage and should be for recreational use only if a woman is so heartless as to murder her own children think of what she will do to you when you no longer serve a desired purpose its simply a good vs evil and light vs darkness spiritual battle how can any moral person justify demanding the right to murder someone with impunity what a shame
yes this horrible these babies will now be birthed and immediately start carrying guns provided by the scotus ruling theses babies will  be wanting payback because the birthing  persons wanted to abort them but scotus has put a worldwide ban on abortions gangs of newborn babies will be roaming the streets of america armed with with ak47s and ar15s looking for the new chest feeders that reluctantly brought them in to this lawless world
the majority of woman who get abortions do so because they got pregnant by not using protection or just not having sex at all i understand why woman who have been raped are upset those have my sympathy but most of you need to learn responsibility
the problem that arises from more millions of americans as refugees from the failed gop states  like for california that handed joe biden 5million of the popular vote that he did not need to win california  is that it entrenches the disruptive power of a deathgrip on the country that the republicans hold by way of the electoral college system the majority of americans as appealed to by joe biden must give the democrats the commanding majority in both congress and senate with which  set things right if they refuse to do that this 2022 and 2024 the us is on a daytonafasttrack track to becoming the former democracy of america fdoa under trump or similar like the former democracy of afghanistan fdoa  that trump handed over to the taliban
almost 50 years passed before the supreme court of america can see beyond the clouds now you get it change has come to america
for the united states this over turning of roe v wade continues the rocket sled ride back into the times of ignorance and cruelty i see this dilemma as a womens issue its best left to them to make a decision that primarily effects them no exception for pregnancy resulting from rape or incest flies against the tenons of a descent and supportive society drawing on religion and the words written by ignorant ie primitive middle eastern desert dwellers in a world we think of as being enlightened yet has no humanity for others americans pray a lot cast judgement on other people yet whose military is responsible for wickedness so egregious so vile that even god will deny you all  entry to the heavenly kingdom where most of you are certain exists what a dreadful country only jungle slum dwellers seek mass entry into satins anteroom on earth yall deserve what you receive and this isnt looking very good for yall right now
stupid rule women should be able to make decisions on what happens to there own body americans are mental 
america  land of the free unless youre a poor female nonwhite antigun or atheist
was this not prompted by states like commiefornia  legislating for termination 24 days after delivery  tell me if i am wrong
"every idiot out there for those of you who abuse people with conditions when much applies to you you will not be helped for you bash people with conditions then get one yourself

this has nothing to do with the american dream to that of life is uncivil or perverse and for the government to be involved to force prolife people and blame republicans is unacceptable when they took up the case to choose to that of they had the house through a corrupt means 

if it were up to the president though he argues in the case of women it would be used as a ploy to score political earning points for democrats that turned the nation upside down or divided it even more the fault is the democratic took it up and yet the high justices made their decision with clarity and hopefully not politically motivated tough confused some people by their decisions

why are people so committed to murder outside the womb and by that i mean women  aside from the fact they did not want the child they should think about that before they think about sex is what others would have thought to that of the vital heartbeat bill is important to determine if the baby is functioning or alive if so it gives people the right to choose rather than to sacrifice for intentional murder then so life is justified or somewhat satisfied though i mean there should be a limit of time to get that procedure done anyway  they forget to include that rape and incest is a matter of abortion rights as well and it does not explain this validity of rights or wrongs in the constitution but amended 

to it has to be the morales of humanity is screwed up before the face on both sides 

one to argue for life and the other for murder in this case 
i would claim give the baby to the caring mother and not that of the one willing to have life and kill it  an ancient example that time forgot

though i have to admit this is actually good to teach people a lesson about the abandonment  by that i mean people who continue to give birth and persecute on a purposeful means what the democratic of idiots in the government to the president do not understand to a point is that it should have been chosen by the states to begin with to that of the lady should also have a right to choose based on casebycase scenario in defense of whose body it is  referring to the ladys wants so technically poloski in one case is right and wrong this is actually a step forward for what is right for the lives of others to that of also a blow against those of antilife

it should not be up to the states to pay for illegal abortions or intentional murder it does not advocate for murder but to justify for life so i am unsure if this statement applies knowing i do not know the case too well"
overturning roe v wade simply moves the issue from a federal level to a state level the amount of hysteria in these comments goes to show that many people dont do any research when giving their opinions
lets wait for all these peaceful protests
realistically
this title lets me know bbc is mega left and heavily uninformed abortion now isnt banned its just controlled by the state nevertheless killing babies for selfish reasons is morally wrong and a sin
lets be honest the majority of people who want abortion is not because of the welfare of the baby even though thats what they are preaching its because so they can have sex without the worry of giving birth its about them not the babyit comes down to desires and their lust i would say perhaps 5 of them and im being generous here would probably do the abortion for the welfare of the baby
whats the point us having a presidentleader again doesnt fing work does it he cant do jack shit by all accounts unless you mean endanger human life in afghanistan then he is your man of course he didnt make that decision either
please dont come to california jesus freaks
arkansas law protects the life of the mother wtf she should be forced to carry even if she dies  why is her life more sacred if the law was fair it would let her die put her on life support and the baby delivered when viable  all men who rape should get the same sentence as the mother who cant choose abortion  life imprisonment  fathers who abandon their children should get the same sentence as the mother forced to birth and raise the child  life
it is understood better from a female put in that position
this will teach irresponsible females to be wiser with their bodies dont have unprotected sex
based
it should never of been in the constitution you idiots  ps its now in the public legislators hand where it should be abortion is not ileagle the people of each state can now decide
those women who are against abortion have probably never heard a story of a rape victim   thats just one example
whats the difference between an infant and human adult size development dependency and mobility whats the difference between the fetus and an infant size development dependency and mobility hmmmmmmm scientifically when does a human beings life come into existence when the sperm meets the egg forming a zygote and a complete unique set of dna down to each individual cell that will stay that way for that human beings entire existence what is the definition of murder the intentional killing of an innocent human being abortion the intentional killing of an innocent human being god bless america god is smiling upon us today and i am proud to say i am american
yes yes yes  this was nonses from a woman
these awful pepole need to learn from mother theresa 
life won long live guns
"the 9th amendment states 

the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people

this means that are human rights that are acknowledged but not stated in the bill of rights and that the constitution cannot be used to infringes upon the rights of the individual just because its not explicated stated in the constitution 

the banning of abortion at any level of the government is a clear violation of ones 9th amendment and 14th amendment right that promises equal protection under the law"
sad day for women people should probably care more about the actual kids being murdered in schools and stuff but sure change this law instead
"lol president biden thinks that letting the elected officials of the people decide their own rules and regulations is extreme
yet forcing all states to allow the mutilation dismemberment and discarding of helpless human beings is totally not extreme guys



"
abortion should be legal the unborn baby is not a citizen of any country after all and it should be accessible to all women
i can understand the religious stand point these people have and i can respect them for having that opinion but from a sociatle standpoint is awful and disgusting as well as ruining lives but also halting scientific research simply vile
correction oversight allowing infanticide an egregious crime thats suddenly become trendy to be legal patched by us supreme court only good thing its done so far everything else has been garbage
before i formed you in the womb i knew you before you were born i sanctified you i ordained you a prophet to the nations jeremiah 15
very sensitive subjects to me if someone cant or dont want to have a baby let them make that decisions what good for the baby come out and got throw away got mistreated or got killed best advice i have is if you really want to have abortion then go to other countries
praise the lord
imagine if these people actually cared about children how much better my life would have been instead religious nuts just told me to pray as i suffered as an unwanted child in care
why are they focusing on the rights of the woman and not on the rights of the baby its not about women its about the babies
girl at 220  im 21 and im terrified that i cant have sex with random dudes without any consequences now
if they could do it in 1973 well be fine in 2022 cant wait to see their faces when its federal again hold onto hope
christ came for the sinners not the righteous for the righteous find your own way
im not an american but im glad innocent unborn american babies will get their fair chance at life
so from now on people are forced too be accountable
the us is just a messed up country its a fact and to think theyve been trying to feed us for decades the non truth fact that they are the beacon of democracy and freedom of the world ha
imagine in the uk if the county council decided you suddenly couldnt have an abortion federalism is nuts
abortions should be nobodies damn business except for the woman and her healthcare provider everyone else needs to stay the fuck out and mind their own damn business stop shoving your beliefs onto others abortions were banned before assault weapons usa is on a downfall thanks to republicans who voted for conservative leaders who then voted conservative justices onto the supreme court this is beyond disgusting and a clear violation of womens rights
and just like that magically left wing extremists liberals suddenly know what a woman is you can only stay that crazy in the head for so long
next impeach biden
on the nyse coat hanger manufacturer stocks are going through the roof
excuse me young women use a condom or abstain murdering babies in not a right
i think its only fair to give the decision over to the states the federal government has too much power
im just watching the same  rightwing extremism that tried to steal an election flood the streets with guns ruin the environment and now theyre forcing women to have children they cant raise
nothing has been taken away from any us citizen that is not what this decision is saying at all it is simply stating it is not for the federal government to decide on the matter
as a woman i can confidently say that there is no such thing as a right to kill your children
democrats shriek my body my choice but not when it comes to the vaccine
just move to a state that thinks the way you do problem solved 
theres so many ways women can stop getting pregnant these days the coil the pill and condoms and not having sex unless you want a child because that is the purpose of sex why after all of these choices a femalewomenxx can still kill a human is sick take responsibility for your actions not lives
"and if we can accept that a mother can kill her own child how can we tell other people not to kill one another
mother teresa"
get the factsthey just turned it back over to the states to make abortion laws
trumps justices finally did something useful
i wonder if the usa  supreme court will overturn american womens right to be a person
there will be an epidemic in dumpster babies
the constitution does not say abortion is a womens right
lmao the libs are melting
"you keep thinking that america cannot become a worse theocratic cesspool then it manages to sink lower biden needs to grow a pair appoint 50 new scotuses by presidential order get this immediately overturned then impose term limits on scotus and impeach every scotus who lied during their selection and while hes at it can he please lock his treasononous predecessor and his partners in crime up along with every person currently working to subvert democracy then remove the ridiculos presidential pardon power in perpetuity especially the means to give proactive pardons
but we all know he wont because hes both spineless and part of the same rancid corrupt system and he wants to protect his own pitiful interests"
absolutely horrible  the government has no right to control our bodies
disgusting bbc reporting abortion is not a procedure it is murder of innocent unborn babies ave maria  protect the innocent from evil
it took me a few hours to digest this decision because i had not really thought about it because i dont really care   but now i feel relieved that the abortion issue can be decided state by state  because when it was a supreme court ruling that was like tyranny  said every state had to let women have abortions that was too bossy  now each state can vote and each person can live in a state they chose  i think this is great and women should stop whining
this is the most important day in history that protects the unborn and their rights to life god is more powerful than satan and today is gods victory over satan has finally come to fruition  this slaughterhouse nation  backed by planned parenthood  has murdered 60 million babies for 50 years  people who could have been our leaders scientists teachers doctors and contributors to society  with todays victorious ruling we finally bring everyone back to their senses and fight for the freedom to live not die by a planned parenthood butcher     the slaughter of our nation has gone on too long and all the feminazis have drunk satans jim jones koolaid convincing them abortion is health care which is a lie  abortionmurder is good which is a lie  the aztec and myan civilizations use to throw their babies into boiling oil to sacrifice them to satan  abortion is the same ritual to honor satan and now it has come to an end praise god
isnt this all over the vast majority of the world changing how they view terminating a life and when
more womens need to move to north korea maybe they have better rights over there
"its great news to hear  that roe v wade is being over turned
its about time you stop the killing  of the innocent 
i here a lot of women and girls say its my body my choice yes that sounds just about right from a sinner who doesnt know the real truth about what they are doing 
it was the almighty god that gave you the opportunity to be born and to inter his world  but you cant see beyond your selfcentered wicked heart   to show mercy to the unborned
woman has always wanted to choose what is not right for the family  it started in the garden of eden the great rebellion yes i know you dont believe it but it is true even if you die not believing any of itit still will go on with are with out you 

there are many women and girls who have chosen to do the right thing and show mercy to unbornbut there are still many spiritual blinded daughters of the almighty god who have chosen rebellion your rewards will come faster than the wind and in that day you will call for mercy  but because you have not chosen wisely there will not be any for you in your time of troubles
roe v wade is a tool used by the devil to kill as many unborn as possible to stop the plans of the almighty god but it have never worked 
he the devil tried to stop the almighty god in the days of old egypt   when the  pharaohs of egypt was killing the first born of the children of israel to stop the almighty gods plans but it did not work 
so if you are one of those who wants  abortion youre working for the devileven if you do not believe  this devil exist he the devil is working in you every time you decide to kill the unborned childyour murderer by the almighty god standards"
the way prolifers were speaking they sounded frustrated with the state of the country and are channeling their frustrations to abortion some people were saying that banning abortion would bring the usa back to its former glory and to being a great country again
that means millions of women will have to think before they have sexwomen need to wake up
it should be up to the woman if she wants or needs to an abortion not congress  if they are so worried about life why was the aids and corona virus released on purpose and do not forget the twin towers   world population control  more of our rights gone  it is getting like old germany no rights for the people wth
the democrats have held commanding majorities in both the congress and the senate and could have legislated this problem out of the way but it was politically  safer to kick that can of a thirdrail hotbutton issue into the long grass of the scotus  will the real republicans of maga suffer any consequences this november 2022 and for 2024   will the democrat judges walk out and leave the scotus inoperable 
how about you stop having sex with anyone you see have some respect for yourselves
right to life protected by supreme court
"the overturn of roe just means the decision goes back to each state so if you live in a leftist state like commiefornia ny etc this wont effect you  you can still kill your babies calm down
research the details ignore ignorant headlines and celebrities screeching on twitter"
we exist in time to understand ourselves means to reflect on time to understand time we need to reflect on ourselves the book your brain is a time machine by dean buonomano he states that your brain reacts with the passage of time and establishes bridges between the past present and future if someone throws us something to catch we move our hand to where the item will be in the future we plant seeds to grow crops in the future we invest in scientific research so that in the future it will result in knowledge and technology this being between past and future events is central to our mental structure from the book the order of time by carlo rovelli what i get from this is that the evolution of the brain from before the cambrian times to the present around six hundred million years this is how the brain functions what is happening today in america is that the majority of american homo sapiens are not connecting the past with the future they just want to live in the status quo of the past becoming stagnant never creating knowledge or learning their past is a white supremacy state with racial divide and a fascist state in which some dictator tells them what to think and what to do as they sit on their couches eating barbecue watching sports and reality tv shows the only future they are interested in is the next sport event reality tv show time and reporting for work to them its a crime to have education critically think for yourself and question authority proust in his novel remembrance of things past states that reality is formed by memory which is so perfect in american society today false memories constantly given to the people by propaganda channels like fox news oan epoch times breitbart and other radical right wing fascist channels are creating this nightmare of a reality we face now this stagnation is the death of american democracy and america other nations will advance in science medicine education and the arts while america degrades into warring villages and states hint study the islamic empire from 1000 to 1400 should open anyones eyes the insurrection and reversing roe vs wade are just the beginning  ends 
i think it should be legal for this doctor to kill the babies  but we live in a democracy and now each state can vote on how they want their state to handle abortion  and if one does not like it they can leave to a state they like
so much drama and emotion how exhausting
abortion is crime
bbc  british brainwashing channel
you dont need to screw america america fucks it self
its not about a womans right to abortion its about a childs right to not be killed this should encourage more people to take precautions and unless their life is at risk then they have no right to kill
see the next time some american tells us they are the land of the freeram that right up your arse free if your male and thats about it
i feel so sorry for women in the usa  next theyll have to cover their hair
i wonder if abortion should be authorised by the given circumstances and not to gender ie with mens rights
"separation of church and state is paraphrased from thomas jefferson and used by others in expressing an understanding of the intent and function of the establishment clause and free exercise clause of the first amendment to the united states constitution which reads congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

lets ban religion too"
wow the democrats havent been this angry since we freed their slaves its gonna get crazy this weekend
just put contraceptives in all tap water women who want a baby can drink bottled spring water problem solved 
todays decision of overturning roe vs wade is a nowin situation for everyone because everyone loses its a things of yet to come that is not in a good way
the fing media strikes again it was never a constitutional right and there was no amendments adding abortion to the constitution abortion isnt illegal in america its now up to individual states to decide which is how their constitutional republic system works weed is illegal at the federal level in america but individual states have made it legal same shit different days
this is amazing
maybe not the best country in the world but the most crazy for sure
can we ban religion please
"it is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live as you wish
mother teresa"
and this is why the rest of the world watches the us with popcorn in hand wondering which aspect of human rights they will play the uno reverse card with this law is forcing women to do athome abortions leading to unnecessary deaths this was proflific in europe for years and changed like what 50 years ago
its not making it ilegal at all its up to the states to make it legal or not theres are states that allow abortion up to 8 months of pregnancy thats scary
the true is govermemt knows that without baby  there will not be a america in the future  just like japan and china now  all the govermemt around the world is doing whatever they can to make as much baby as they could for their country  without baby  in 50 years  you left with 2 options  your country either going to be run by immigrants or everyone thats over 80 years old
"three principles of successful genocide
1 dehumanize the target population
2 elevate the killing by looking at a higher good
3 hide the evidence"
lol it got the bbc into a panic
america the land of gun care  health control
feminists can rant and rave all they like
"the world now
wtf"
about time
"yay  congrats america your rights have been shut down land of the free and and all that that now means fuck all  

your free to be told how women are denied the right over their own bodies well done very progressive 

to the women affected by this i am deeply sorryand i say this as a man"
this is truly awesome
"this means more single mums
more children to adopt and orphanages
more underage mothers"
the reason why these people exist is because they were not aborted
perhaps a greater use of contraceptives 
woman should have the right to there own anatomy my body my choice im antinatalist against bringing kids in to exsitence having kids is worse than murder
the bottom line is that restricting abortions will lead to more single mothers who are not financially supported by the state sufficiently greater birth rate of children with disabilities  also consider women who were alcoholic or drug addicted prior to getting pregnant that could have been previously tested for and aborted more young women unable to go on to college and be independent miserable upbringing of unwanted children especially those with disabilities from parents who take out their frustrations on the child as they see it as ruining their youth or independence financially its really difficult to end it when there are definitely good reasons for it i am sure even a pro lifer wouldnt want to have the child of a man who raped her this should be a personal choice between a woman and her doctor but set within a definitive time line and women who abuse abortion having had multiple ones 3 should be sterilised
just like in all other areas of life our rights are being removed one at a time
protest dont work now its time that we start spilling blood
"women have the right to do what they want with their body 
wrong   
when a life is conceived inside the womb then its not only that mothers property but its babys property as well as  its dads sperms donner  property 
its like an embassy which is located in host country but ownership and responsibilities are shared "
never met one person in my life in my country the netherlands who was against abortion
america is looking like a third world nation
america kill your kids and let in more illegals you know the people who might vote for democrats might
did nobody read freakonomics
im literallyshakingrightnow
just to clarify things as the bbc are liars 1 there is no constitutional amendment that says abortion is a right 2 this doesnt make abortion illegal it just makes it a matter for individual states im actually personally in favour of abortion being legal but with a limit of around 18 to 20 weeks
if you dont want a baby stop having sex it is simple god be praise
i truly believe that until a fetus has been grown for 24 weeks and can survive outside its mothers body it is not a completely separate life it is a human soul tethered to its mothers body and she has the right to choose how she proceeds with this part of her life and her body whether you like it or not their rights do not outweigh the health and sanity of their mothers late term abortions post 24 weeks should only ever performed for serious medical reasons women who are having late term abortions are only doing so if their baby will not have any quality of life outside the womb it is unfathomable for me how any politician let a bunch of narrow minded ideological driven so call justices of law can believe that they understand more about a womans health and survival than the doctor caring for her
didnt mind when they were telling people they had to have the jab fuck off bbc how about telling the real truth about the grooming gangs lying by omission is still lying
only goes to show  your rights depend on the whims of some old decriped lawyers one days it legal next day its notfollowing day its legal again  that is not a system that is anarchy  not based on safety or sciencebut simply that is what they want now  no nation can endure being run at the whims of people
its okay to shoot kids but not remove a bunch of cells

human rights womens rights what about the babies rights
a civilization that literally begs for and celebrates the killing of its future generations is a major sign of a dying civilization
over half the population supported the bill and yet it was abolished yay democracy
kevin mccarthy is a pig his district is full of homeless people pro life till they are born then thoughts and prayers  right
no they dont have the constitutional right its controlled at state level
its a big victory
how can killing babies be okay  we killed millions of babies since 1973 how can we say that other countries like saudi or china have the worst human rights when us has killed millions of babies  what a hypocrisy
i cannot believe those nurses were crying they cant murder babies anymore 
people should stop minding other peoples business and mind their own individuals have individual needs health and safety should be our first priorities
"so its down to each state now

traveling to other states is legal  if they have the funds to do so "
if i killed a pregnant woman  i will  double homicide but a woman killing a child they call it an abortion people are crazy af
usa is fallingglad i dont live there
it was never a right guaranteed by the constitution forefathers of american never gave women the right to kill there babies democrats never tried to make it a law
if you want just any guys baby then adoption should work just fine
"so who decided this in the supreme court a bunch of men or just cranky american women or both

what the hell is happening to america its full of psychos"
up to 9 months it was legal how can you say thats not taking a human life 
im not sure america is a real place 
"the majority of the world is shocked by the rank hypocrisy of the land of the free where youre not even free to control your own body as a woman where theyre prolife but couldnt give a shit about the mother or the child once theyre born  where only 11 of children in the care system get adopted
where they wont even control guns to stop children from getting slaughtered but dont forget these people are prolife

youre an outlier as a developed nation without universal healthcare  where severe illness or injury can bankrupt you
you have comparatively minimal workers rights  now the religious extremists are removing freedoms from others they have zero intention of helping in any way shape or form its disgusting

id recommend all the women  men who stand against this see the state of what their country is  is becoming  leave
id like to see the state of their economy  country when all the educated  nonreligious extremists have left  benefit other countries"
this is what democracy looks like we vote in preisdents who place judges on the supreme court who reflects his voters views abortion shod have never been a right its a privilege and now that it is defederalized each state will now vote on keepin it legal or not so states wont be forced to offer abortions in which goes agasint there values and other states can still offer it if they wish this is what democracy looks like america has always been pro life this clip doesnt say that the us was one of only 7 countries in the world which includes china and north korea to offer abortion after 20weeks and even 1min after birth this is not american values
more church bs trying to control people choices
the usa is so religiously retarded it was always going this way religious fruitcakes win the day god bless america
now they will be more careful
you cannot stop abortion you can only stop safe abortion
"are expected to do so
i see riots civil war or a coup happening"
"ahhhh the usa where someones right to own a gun is seen as far more important than a students right to not be shot by one and the religious nutjob far right pride themselves on removing the rights of anyone they dont agree with

as far as the land of the free delusion jim jeffries said it best in holland you can smoke weed in front of a cop while hiring a hooker and you have the nerve to think you are the land of the free"
we want all kinds of abortion to be banned everywhere in the us those who wants more abortion can leave next is lgbtq marriage we are going to ban it all america is gods country we wont let this idiots destroy it with woke agenda
550  do your job we dont need your opinions
making it illegal will not stop people doing it it will force them to do it under unsafe conditions and will cost many young womans lives it is hard to believe that this is really happening

when religion is in charge of your vagina and other reproductive organs
the british need to follow the americans lead and try to get abortion rights revoked every human life is precious and has value born or unborn
the supreme court needs to be killed all of them evil horrible monsters
its a shame social media  mainstream medias behaviour are driving the us backwards lately i am confident it wont last you should probably comment on fox news feed if though if wanna reach out youtubes algorithms have a lot to answer for
wtf these religious people are so delusional and have no semblance of empathy for other humans
if u dont want kids why have them
listening to leftwing feminist has been a total disaster for western civilization
right to abortion  there is no right to an abortion under the american constitution  get some education
239 dont  you mean  birthing  people  
fuck them they better adopt some of those poor kids in the system if they really pro life and take care of all of them and not complain about it but what do they do nothing about those kids in the system just care about those unborn babies shut up and take care of the poor kids there are right now
if  woman who are sexual assaulted and cannot have an abortion then the person who also created that child should pay for the child it is unfair for woman to go through that alone
those same morons will be banning contraception next
women still have four options  abstinencecontraceptionmotherhoodadoption thats plenty
"make the world a better place what a joke
they just want the women to go to private clinics for abortions so
they get more money"
about time the evil of random abortion was challenged god only knows how many souls never made it
bro that lady with the face paint has an iq beginning with a 
if we really cared about children in our nation we would have banned assault weapons but no people want their god damn ak47 instead of protecting kids
pact up and move to a democrat state point blank and periodor go see your doctor and get on some good birth control that is before you lay down with the scum
"life won today what about the womans right to her life pro life usually ends when the baby is born and the mother gets no help i wonder how these
young women will feel when birth control is banished the taliban is here in the usa disguised by judicial robes"
i dont kniw what us wrong with them i was part of the now thus makes me angery and a lot if women are going to suffer and die because of this my body my right so am suck and tired or other people telling me what i can and cannot do as a women
great victory for the constitution and basic decency
so women can go get pretty much free abortions but for those women who have trouble getting pregnant and want a child it cost outrageous amounts of money ya in certain cases like rape or incest the women should have a right to an abortion but for those who just go out having sex and have had multiple abortions well better strap up now
as a capitalist country it only makes sense they would do this they need more people who are going to be put into horrible situations that will work the jobs no one else will at close to nothing in terms of pay
the funny thing about conservatives praising this is that the majority of these babies will grow up to vote liberal its like turkeys voting for christmas we wont see the real effects for 20 years or so but it will happen
great
and most states in the united states theyve got six weeks to get an abortion i dont understand why they dont think that that isnt enough time to go and murder a little baby when in new york they allow even post birth
"spa  when i was a mere child although supremely wise there were only 4 things that i could not overstand  here r 2  abortion   homosexuality but now than i am gifted with supreme enlightenment i have come 2 overstanding the reasons  the whys the creator gave it living creations the magiccreation wants of vagina and penis  so the question becomes  if the creator gave i life and the abilitiesmagic to give or take life then tell i who or what religion government has the right to trump the  giftabilitiesmagic given to i by i creator to chose or not to chose that which i do onto i own self even taking my own life 
personally for she who has aborted could never bear suns or moons for i not because of a wrong or right  simply because i know the chieffects associate with said action but at no time should i or any human being be so stupidly demoniclly audacious to think that their idea of how i as an adult human being should trump my god given right to chose that which affects my body of mentally or physically in any way whether wrong or right

women with men should replicate black lives matter with a more power and effect women lives matter  its a great time and season for this act of true american ideology  spadotcomscom"
i bet everyone of those who have been fighting to take others rights away have never known a hardship
i wonder if all the people crying out to stop people having a choice are helping all the homeless and foster kids in the country as well

"your headline is a lie abortion is not a constitutional right you got to watch the bbc you can see a little socialist contamination
journalism has went downhill in the last 5 years"
you can kill an intruder in your livingroom but you cant choose to have an abortion
so let me get this straight from the uk the us do not allow women to have a right to choose whether they can abort or not but gun rights are for everybody to choose just trying to keep up
this is some 3rd world stuff going on it reminds me of how women are treated in the middle east
people choose to have a unprotected sex end of discussion
right to murder babies struck down by us supreme court    actually it now goes to the states
its just gross  and so are the people who say this is a good thing and the scotus should keep going  let us be a reminder to the world  this is what happens in even a socalled first world nation when the religious zealots get control of the political and legal system  move over taliban  theres a new caliphate on the block
"all the court did was recognize it was always a states rights issue 
democrats can still kill black babies but only in democrat run states"
"what should happen now is that woman that can not keep their babies for whatever reason they think they cant keep them should be left at a church and they have to pay for their education safety and make sure that heshe is successful and loved since they fought so much on jesus name that should be a law actually abortion will not stop these woman will be butchered
and they call themselves the greater country in the world do something about your politicians us people or they will deep fry you and eat you"
this is good news day for babies if you disagree with that statement then youve got to justify to yourself why the right to life does not extend to all human beings
for those of you celebrating in the usa the american taliban is coming for you next
disgusting  that country is going backwards
that woman being interviewed at the start  on a personal level   how is it personal if youre not the one getting the abortion how does it affect you if someone decides to get one thats what i ask
these feminist cant rely on planned parenthood anymore 
this decision is up there with dred scott v sandford as one of the worst decisions ever made by our illustrious scotus  not to mention their recent gun rights blunder  what a bunch of educated ignoramuses
"us women now have the comfort of knowing that they can be forced by their government to act as a living life support machine even for their rapists child 
if you think thats moral you have something deeply wrong with you"
the people who scream pro life are probably the same people who believe they have the right to shoot someone in self defence and the ones shouting my body my choice when they were asked to get vaccinated i feel to sorry for the people in america
i have no idea wtf is going on anymore as a white man just leave me alone and we will be fine
1 good thing in the past few decades that is coming from usa
i know what happens next scotus will ban men from masturbating technically sperm is life too they shouldnt drain and kill them they have rights and freedom too lol
its funny how hard women will fight to have no accountability for their actionsnow maybe theyll start actually taking that one pill a day to assist in not getting pregnant during a tinder hookup
i agree with ruling  abortion is actually murder  you might say its only an embreo and its not human yet i think they are completly wrong  if it is not aborted it would have grown to become a person and a human is a human from the moment of his conception till the day he die this  is my personal opinion and since we live in a free world we can all say our opinions
the world is over populated already and the worlds resources are running out so basically fuck the planet with no abortions we all die sooner as a whole
surely whichever side of this you fall on this isnt good its the same issue that the us had in the 1930s with prohibition and the ongoing debate about legalising drugs the cat is out of the bag and you cant get it back in if women really want abortions they will get them legal or not seems to me all this will do is lead to a sharp rise in dangerous backroom abortions
awesome thank you jesus christ
didnt this ruling come in a week ago geez bbc report in a timely manner eh
"there was never a legally enshrined right there ever was a right to an abortion guaranteed under the constitution
it was never in the constitution or the bill of rights
the original argument to abortion was a privacy right which made no sense at the time and continued to make no sense
a better argument would be bodily autonomy under property law but even then its not only your body the decision effects"
people really want to be able to kill babies if youre pregnant then its no longer just your body isnt it
new york is keeping the right to abortion its believed that many women will go there at least some women will be saved from the back street abortionist of the last century
thank you lord for the supreme court    god is the one who has last word  amen
celebrate good times 
quantity over quality america just want more of everything
this is a womens decision not the governments
imagine wanting to control someone elses body 
i thought first world contraception is available why wait to be pregnant
if i were a woman i would probably start useing condems and date men based on how hard a worker they are  and i would start useing sexual discipline 80 percent of men get rejected  and go into their 30s virgins  if men can go with out sex so can wemon
609 yeah stop bullshitting the majority of the time its women just being irresponsible
welp i dont live in the us but i think they shouldnt have been bowed down to they think theyre right but this is wrong
go trump he was really thinking when he made sure those three judges were anti abortion
the pro abortion group is all for bringing children into this world to stand back and watch him starve to death they call that christianity sounds like pure evilness these women who are prolife they have been beaten down to where they dont think they are human any longer so they are against all other women who has rights that they have allowed their preacher or their men to take away from them by putting them down and brain worsham to believe that prolife is the way when it only really allows children to go hungry in the united states because they dont care about them once they are here on earth if thats what they call christian i wouldnt want no part of it sounds like pure evil they claimed their christians but they violate their own beliefs their beliefs are only for others they want to have control over
"keep your legs closed and it wont be an issue 

problem solved"
"god help us the most disgusting thing to happen in a civilised nation in a while 
every person deserves the right to choose why ban abortion it is choice you dont have to abort you choose to
anyone who says that abortion needs to be banned is a disgusting low  life and has no idea what this means on a larger scale 
choice is important you made yours and i hope it is your last"
all prolifers have now one reason to shut up  live in a state that doesnt allow it if you dont like it and vice versa  simple
"its good  people are realising slowly that there is never an ideal time to face the responsibility of parenting 
and its just part of the journey of maturing and growing
and for men to discover both how to lead and how to respect and follow in turn
leading to order and civil society
the reason why immigrants are succeeding and taking over in many cases in the uk and europe and usa is simply they have family values and still follow traditions that westerners have been loosing
and good for them they deserve that success for following a natural superior way of life
ultimately people are going to have to make more sensible choices
i just see lots of spoiled children in every shade of the rainbow  whining about how they want to have their cake  puke it back up and not get fat 
if you get my drift
this is very good news for black america
 the democrats will very gradually loose their grip on the vote  of welfare dependant blocks of african american communitys as by default they face up to parenthood and create more family units 
the ultimate opposite of what blm wants"
anyone who is pro abortion has no right to criticize the nazis
i am more curious why is the bbc not covering the money that these abortion clinics make for profit from killing these babies  because easily over 90 of abortions are not medical emergencies period
whats next legalise slavery usa is now a third world country
cope and seethe baby killers cope and seethe
what a stupid country their power is going here comes china 
what a shame that women cant kill their kids any more such a shame for world peace and love 
"how can we talk about the rights of a fertilized egg when we dont care enough to see that every child is born into a stable safe and nurturing environment

slaughter the ignorant parents not the baby that did nothing wrong
dont they know there is such a thing bith control roe v wade was based on a lie from the fbi the aborted baby industry is a very lucrative biusness a lot of the so called elites are going to be losing a lot of money 
why is the uk getting this rubbish this is a yankee issue
didnt go far enough you want a baby and government hand outs you have to give a full clean std screening from both the mother and father mind you all these pro abortion people wouldnt even try to get pregnant if this was a law
not that i have a dog in the fight but if you accepted a forced vax the argument of my body my decision  is gone you cant have it both ways
there may be hope for us yet maybe we will miss the wrath of god coming
usa showing its true colors no freedom no choice a prison  i am glad now everyone worldwide knows  usa is not a free land  gay rights next
women should have the right to choose wtf as for the religion comments dont get me started religon is the root of all evil and if god actually excisted he wouldnt be killing people all the time so dont even bring god and religion to the comments
the only thing you can do is avoid moving to red states or leave your red state sad day for liberals
a great day for humanity  a bad day for irresponsible women baby organ sellers and adrenechrome consumers oh and the lefty libtards too
emancipated us women u should be grateful to your dearly beloved mr donald  trump
this is so wonderful no more killing of innocent babies how evil has our society become to think its acceptable or moral to kill a baby no an unborn baby is not a fetus its a human life thank god this evil law has been overturned
this is so multifaceted people can use methods to not have unplanned pregnancies because abortion is immoral  but in instances of rape or when pregnancy threatens the life of a mother she should be able to choose
im sorry but all those tho wanted abortion to be illegal your all fucked in the head what if some poor girl gets raped and gets pregnant because of that she now can not get rid of a child that she never wanted and was forced to have
this is for the children of the world  the lives of those children who have died are what we are honoring   just think of all those souls who have a future now
really good to hear
"states rights 
fk the fed"
"according to the bible righteousness raises up a nation a great tribute to the supreme court of the usa

by the way lets do a little analysis together there are about 354 million people in the united states lets say there are 150 million women who are able to procreate lets say about 30 have an abortion every year so you could say that us infanticide kills about 45 million children every year"
great news
as usual the bbc misreports the facts  this reversal does not make abortion illegal but mearly puts the onus back onto the individual states where it belongs  yes there will be a few states that may outlaw abortion and even a few of those will have exceptions to their particular ruling  most states will have laws allowing abortion and if the state you live in doesnt allow the type of abortion you want you can drive to another state to get one  the proabortion crowd destroyed themselves when they started pushing for abortions that would allow babies to be killed after the babies were born  sounds crazy but the discussion was out there
"conservatives  desperately protect the laws that have made shooting school age children a national pastime in the name of freedom  
also conservatives  cheering that they just lost the freedom to control their own bodies"
"according to the bible righteousness raises up a nation a great tribute to the supreme court of the usa

so in the matter of a few days that extremist kangaroo court has made it even easier for americans to keep killing each other and now theyre insisting on women birthing children whether they want to can do or not i have us citizenship but will never ever move back because its become a sham democracy with politicians picking their voters an elected unaccountable king they call a president its violent the likes of which would be unthinkable in any other developed country and its a dystopian society with all the worst parts of capitalism leading to such incredible wealth for a few and such poverty for millions without even basic healthcare it is a shame the most powerful country has become an example of how not to run a country but for the rest of us in the west we can separate ourselves from being too closely linked so their twisted vision of religious supernatural nonsense and bigotry do not infest our societies children  the elderly should be able to ride public transport without fear and go to school without passing through metal detectors women have a right to decide if they are ready to have a child humans born gay are still people people with a different skin colour are all the same under the skin and everyone has a right to believe in whatever gods they want to or not without having it thrown down their throats by the state these are basic things any developed civilized country should be able to guarantee without question sad day especially for americans but also for the west in general because our most prominent member disgraced itself so spectacularly
this thumbnail is very misleading to people who dont live in the us as an american who was born in 1993 i can assure youthat the future is not antiabortion in the us  the majority of young people are outraged by this
the chinese government likes information control delete user delete comment now lets learn from the chinese government delete putin related information throughout the network just like the chinese government did to me putin wants the rights to speak but we will not give him delete putins content in the same way
in many states it is still legal
well done iam moving to us
abortion should be legal to anyone who wants it but to ban abortion completely even in instances of rape is barbaric wait until you see instances of rape will increase but reports will decrease anyone who gets pregnant through rape will be reluctant to report it as that will mean theyll be known to be pregnant and therefore cant get an abortion these laws are not prolife they are prorapist pro forced birth pro maternal death pro lifers do nothing to help with the very gun laws that kill the babies they are forcing afabs to have or the formula shortage
"its nothing about pro life because if it was they would be taking care of the ones that are already here on earth that are breathing air but instead they pretend like they are prolife just to watch the children be born into property and no rights as a human being in united states of america this people who say they are a christians but allow children to be abused sexually and be starved to death if they are so prolife then why have they took care of the people who live on the streets that are homeless and hungry because it is not about their caring heart its about churchs controlling the people of the united states churches need to be made to pay taxes because they have violated the agreement that they would not get involved in politics which has been nothing but a lie to the people of the united states churches have continued to shave their false belief down everyones throat the bible was wrote over 100 years after jesus christ was sacrificed and the ones who wrote the bible were nothing but men who wanted control of others they have took jesus words and twisted them for them to be able to have control
if there was a election today between trump and god guess who they would vote for trump because religious christianities believe that trump is their god they are led by a false prophet they say they go by the bible but if that is so then why are they worshiping trump as their god when that is clearly printed in the bible but that is considered as a false prophet"
america is becoming the new north korea the uk is not far behind we the people need to rise up and stop this take over of our basic human rights the bubble is about to burst or maybe putin can just start firing nukes at us end the misery of the west
good news now its time to ban guns to under 21 year olds implement universal healthcare free college education greater taxes on the rich 1 and no more foreign invasions
there are already many children in foster care who get treated so poorly why would you want hundreds to thousands more to be treated like that even after being adopted and being of legal age to be out on your own so many teens get kicked out and left on the street at 1417 many of them end up doing drugs or getting pregnant on the street or even raped by their foster parentshell even death are you going to adopt and feed the hundreds of babies that wouldve gotten murdered to give them the crappy life thats already set out for them this just screams the unsafe ways women will try and get an abortion even if their life is at stake prolifers make me sick id rather die than bear a child i did not want to have
this was easy to foresee the trump court will rule like this for at least a generation but for the 8 million lazy smug democrats who stayed home because they knew hillary would win
america is already populated not even more people  smh
men may start buying more condoms now hope it scares then now as much as women
whats so bad about a baby
"what a stupid decision  

clearly there is more money to be made in raising a neglected child then there is to save a life that likely wont get the necessary love support and upbringing to raise a level headed human being 

women should majority of the decision to birth a child or to end it it is their womb at the end of the day that creates life"
its a pity they overturned it  but its not guaranteed by the constitution this is a common misconception and the flimsy construct put together by justice blackmun back in 1973 is the reason and the tool for todays scotus decision
it was never a constitutional right in the true sense 50 year old mistake
what ever happened to separation of church and state
finally some good news from us
surely a simple gestation period threshold of legality is all that is required as a compromise
for this decision to affect womens rights you first need to be able to define what a woman is
sickening decision and just as sickening to see criminal conspiracists like kevin mccarthy gloating about it
this is absolutely devastating for american women a setback on epic proportions im so sorry that the system has let you all down
this is scary
yet they still think they live in a democracy the country where you cant say what you want and cant do what you want with your own body 
murder is wrong controversial i know
very good to hear a step in the right direction
the scotus gave women the right to choose to live outside of states with state sponsored child murder dont worry lefties youll still be able to murder unborn children in half the states of the us
just look at this proabortion crowd what are they woried about the only way that these hags will get pregnant is by artificial insemination
people who are close minded or extreme will never be right whether they are pro or anti abortion  in this day and age its hard to understand how there can be unplanned pregnancies in the first place  there may be good reasons for some abortion but we shouldnt be backing abortions for convenience  people need to be responsible for their actions and make better decisions
dr willie is a clown who got embarassed like a schoolgirl on jesse lee petersons talkshow nothing but liberal sob stories in what was a great victory for the united states
great no more slaughtering of babies from slut mothers who dont know how to use protection
republicans dont care about life else they would support universal healthcare all they care about is controlling and cutting rights from women
girls get your wedding dresses ready cause if you cant be free to choose neither should he if he get you pregnant he your husband how many women would have kept their child if the man married her  you cant have one without the other 
"in the end this issue will be decided by young women 

remember the us has much higher labour mobility than we see in the uk with people far more prepared to move across the country in search of a better life if access to abortion is as important as people seem to say then young women and especially the more talented ones who have more options will choose to locate in states with more liberal abortion laws talented young men will follow it wont be long before some corporations start to leave states who restrict abortion because its easier to recruit and retain talent in states with a more liberal attitude 

alternatively maybe young women will prefer to live in places with restrictive abortion laws because this will engender a culture with less pressure for them to have sex before they really want to 

but whichever way it goes in the end it will be young women that decide"
exactly the right thing to do also if you are with a partner husbandit should be a joint decisionin other countries   woman that take drugs whilst pregnant should be charged the baby should not have to be born a crack cocaine or heroin addict then they should be sterilised
men would rather play video games than have sex and deal with feminist so whats the big deal
america wont have many more chances to turn back to god women should think about the consequences before laying down and conceiving these little innocent babies and this so called ten months abortion outside of the womb is murder plain and simple
the header should read right to abortion passed back to the state legislators as opposed to right to abortion struck down it was not struck down
what else are they going to take away this is just the beginning this is not about saving life this is about exercising power over people and tell them what they can and cannot do god gave us the right to choose good and evil are we becoming a little china were the government tells us what to do as far as reproduction are they prepared for all the adoptions that are going to happen as far as free will and freedom of choice im disappointed in america but like the bible says they will start acting like a beast exercising powers over people
anything that allows abortion with bidens offspring is a good decision
this artice aims to enforce peoples lack of knowledge of the law and our rights be careful and know your rights wherever you are
sure wish everyone would hurry up and die already the human race is just pure shlt anymore
americas a strange place
everybody forgot god performs tens of millions of spontaneous abortions a year
lessen the violence of abortion but increase the violence of guns profile before youre alive antilife once you are they want to ensure that you are born and then dont mind handing someone a gun to shoot you dead once you are
oh boo hoo  sick that these women cry when they cant kill babies
"the left  banning legal abortions will only result in illegal abortions

also the left  banning guns for the law abiding shall stop criminals using guns illegally"
this issue and the other decision made by our supreme court related to guns make me ashamed of my country of origin this is a sad day in the us sadder for our daughters
too bad none of these protesters could trouble themselves to vote in midterm elections  their indifference is the reason this has happened
maybe the states should make the penalty for rape a cutting  off the offending parts too would be helpful
and insulin is still high and la is still in a crimewave
233  the radiant face of the woke harpy horde  someone meme this
i guess abortion industry will be booming in mexico
ah yes freedom
insest still ok in royal  elite circles
roe v wade  is not a constitutional  rightit was never intended to be used as birth control if law enforcement  rules that if a drunk driver accidently kills a pregnant woman and fetus its a double homicidebut if a pregnant woman intentionally  kills her unborn baby its her right to chooseyou cant  have it both ways there is nowhere in scripture where god gives permission  for women to murder their unborn childin facthe gave a commandment  that  thou shalt not kill  it did not say only if its an adult
supreme justice  clarence thomas is a racist             he will not kill unborn black babies                   peace
for everyone thats ever had an abortion remember this you went against your biological programming to protect your kid and then you killed it you murdered your child nothing can change the fact that you went to a doctor and you paid them to rip your child apart while it was still inside you
this is the future of something isnt done  the courts cant just decide things like this
never met anyone on the prodeath brigade condemn their parents for not extinguishing their life in the womb
they wont change gun laws which will save lives but will revoke abortion rights that will ruin lives
21 and terrified lol  not terrified enough of the irresistible trouser snake evidently
america the most backward 1st world country
where is peoples right to overturning the supreme court
pretty sure even 3rd world countries are able to offer this minimal human right what has america become now a 4th world nation
bruh how
they will force you to carry a pregnancy to term but dont give a crap if that same child is shot to death at school think about that
would genuinely hate to live in america for so many reasons
this proves that america is not a free country banning abortion is removing freedom of choice from women
"85 of americans support abortions being legal in most cases

welcome to the death throws of modern conservatism the last dire swings before the next generation snuffs them out with pure disgust at their oppressive nature

dont like abortion dont get one land of the free my ass"
now states can ban it scotus dont want gun regulations but want to regulate women
victory for the babies and jesus thank you jesus for this victory
there is no right to abortion in the usa   i thought this was the bbc
"looks like the fall of civilization
so now well begin to see the rise in back street abortionist parlours meat shops run by the unskilled
and the unhygienic
or worst still a rise in the birthrate of the unloved and hated given a living nightmare that would have 
otherwise been called a childhood
well done america"
based baby killers seething
how stupid are you to think america care about anyone but the rich
this is sad yet again another man making decisions for a womans body abortion is illegal while guns are not 
this is awesomeits about timeno more babykilling
all it did was return the issue to the states   people can vote for state legislature that lines up with their beliefs and the clinic that you featured has had women die  i know this to be true because i work in the emergency room at the local hospital
religion dragging the world back
the white evangelical conservative right ruling the republican party and courts will not stop at abortion next up gay marriage with some wanting to even ban contraception and sex education in schools
"im 21 and im terrified

well if you keep your legs closed  you wont have nothing to worry about will you sweetheart"
i guess the  media  doesnt  understand all the supreme court  did was give the power  back to the individual  states the federal government  should  have never had this power  under the constitution  now if you feel like it empowers  you to murder innocence  babies  so you want be inconveniencethat is on you a baby if a gift from god
america is mental now back alley clinics will be all over well done
why didnt someone ask these prolife women how many homeless children have they adopted  how many young mothers in need and without jobs have they helped
"this is a minority imposing their personal and religious beliefs on everyone this is wrong and it is clear that the supreme court is no longer a neutral body but yet another political tool to be wielded by whomever can stuff their side into the most seats

i honestly blame harry reid he was the one that went nuclear and dropped the 60 vote threshold for court picks"
easy or even subsidized access to the morningafter pill may constitute a compromise solution agreeable to both sides as it prevents procreation
abortion is murder a baby from the moment its conceived to birth is a human being even if you still say that abortion isnt what it clearly iskilling of unborn children and the extermination of human lifewhich by definition is murder is a denial of the basic facts my body my choice isnt even valid because youre not making the desicion for your body but for the inoccent unborn baby in inside the womanthe baby is a whole different entity to the mother just the same as you are an indivisual human being you and everyone else that advocates for this foolishness are degrading children from human beings to objects or inconvenices that can be disposed of  if you say its just a clump of cells thats not even evidence because you are a clump of cells and every living being is a clump of cells you would know that if you payed attention in 8th grade biology that baby will grow up to be a human being just like you and me what if youre mom was to abort you i bet then that you wouldnt be advocating for the murder of unborn children unless you see yourself as worthless if you state that you can kill an unborn child then its the same as saying that you can kill anyone or that i can kill you and by all means is a violation of human rights and basic moral princibles it doesnt matter about what stage the child is in or what other factors lead to the impregnation you still do not have the right to kill a human being if you cant take care of the child then give it up for adoption instead of outright killing the child murder the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another by definition abortion  murder and saying that you could kill a child after it was born is even more trifling the child at that point is a living and breathing human being even in the womb its a living and breathing human being in conclusion abortion is murder and there is no evidence that you can give that can prove me wrong not only because it is facts but there are no valid point that can debunk the proven biological fact that a human fetus is a human being genocide the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group the group in question being children 6289k children are abortedmurdered every year which is by definition called genocide abortion is not only murder but genocide case and point
"america has become a nation dominated by bigots and fascists
how embarrassing that they speak english over there"
empathetic prolife supporters versus pro abortion psychopaths
the us supreme court has just signed the death warrant for 100s of american women every year all thanks to trump man that guy was in power for just 4 years and he still torments us
my country doesnt even take care of the children once they are born all because a few religeous freaks want to have more babies to adopt
"can we please put in a law to stop certain people coming to or visiting the uk
it would be those coming from the usa that are pro life and still think its a right to not only carry a hand gun but also a given right to let 18years old have an automatic weapon  that kill multiple people in one go including children we have enough or our own idiots without allowing any more coming in"
100 millions of babies later after 50 years on concentrating clinics in african american communities controlling the population  blm justice will come
damn its like no ones ever heard of birth control
"the supreme court with a majority of right wing dedided to overturn roe v wade mainly impacting all women in the usa now all women in the usa have less privacy and abortion is harder to get

this again was decided by the all the conservatives which are the majority in the supreme court

biden needs to add 3 liberals to the supreme court now to have balance and real debate about issues like roe v wade instead of letting the majority rule just because they want"
i have not been enthusiastic with the abortion on demand concept the right for many years since its inception as birth control methods multiplied abortions did not decrease abortion was merely the birth control of ultimate last resort i think the right to safe abortion was misused but now society faces the magnified problem of defective andor unwanted births i am absolutely certain that conservative christian men and women are not going to step up to take in this population of outcasts nurture them and see to it that they are provided for nor will they require of their political representatives that there be incentives for society to the job it is fanciful and delusional of me to think that females will take the responsible step to protect themselves and prevent a disembodied soul from emerging as a being who is unwanted
woman will die millions of children will be unwanted because their mothers were raped late abortion is not right but if a woman is raped she has every right to abort
the worlds gone mad
if u can abort i as a man want not pay child support
usa once again proves itself to be a nation of fools
the best thing that happened in america after a very long time
how many of the antiabortionists women mothers and their teenagers daughters  have had abortions already
this is absolutely wonderful news  i hope the cult of death weirdos who think only of themselves cry themselves to sleep tonight
people who want to impose their views in such a controversial subject are intolerant and non democratic people and not other way around there will be a space for every way of thinking and living in usa as always but it is important to fight this narrative
they just took away my daughters right to choose and thomas said he is coming after birthcontrol i am ashamed to be an american love and light world
once again showing theyre a completely uncivilised place they will force a potentially unwanted and unloved child into the world but wont protect them from being killed in a school shooting the us is the cesspit of the entire planet
the whole system is divided the supreme court the congress the senate and the church maybe its time to change the name of america from united states to divided states lol 
a society that devalues human life is a society that demeans itselfdemocrats are simply evil
no such thing as the right to kill a child neither outside the womb nor within
never mind at least you can all carry guns eh
a reckless court abandoning of past supreme court justice ruling is the downfall of the united states of america courts
"if you dont want to get pregnant dont have sex
if you have sex and get pregnant be an adult and take care of your responsibilities
seems some women want a free pass on taking responsibility for their actions
you can spot them a mile away they act like children and are abhorrent peoplewoke feminazis and such"
western women and men are too promiscuous thats the problem abstain from sex before marriage or use a condom or morning after pill
nobody speaks about the fathers right in that holocaust of babies
what is going on in america pakistan and iran will have more liberal abortion laws than large parts of that giant lunatic asylum across the atlantic trumps appointment of three crackpot religious fundamentalist justices has caused the court to go off the rails the decision doesnt even guarantee abortion rights for womenunderage girls who are victims of rape or incest individual states will be able to force them to give birth to a rapists baby against their will its barbaric and isnt the end they will push on for the same thing in relation to access to contraception and gay marriage its as if the puritans had just landed
if the unborn child could speak my body my choice
im delighted the bbc is hopping mad
from the comments ive read they are missing the mark massively the real point is as a woman you no longer have rights o we your own body america has taken several steps back into the dark past im ashamed and embarrassed for the us its now a backwards 21st century country well done you republican clowns
god is smiling today congratulations if we do not protect life nothing else matter stop slaughter babies for gods shake 
to be honest this decision is just making land of the free false women should be able to have an abortion if they feel its necessary
abortion is murder
"theres hope for america yet
all life matters"
"all this anger there is a thing called abstinence
birth control
condoms
just lazy ya lets get pregnant and kill the baby
there will still be states that allow abortion they act like they cant still kill a baby use birth control get ur tubes tied there are many alternatives its all about r i o t ing anger n un needed violence un real"
we dont have any of the facts that the doctor based that statement off of god they dont even hear themselves anymore they cant hear how ignorant and wrong they are
it is about moneyfolks and greed planned parenthood is major money maker and they dont want to lose their livelyhood they dont care about the womenand they certainly dont care about the babies

abortion is murder
not even incest or rape will allow you to have an abortion thats disgusting i pray for america
abortion in the case of rape n incest is ok but abortion shouldnt be like a piece of cake its not healthy for the mothers
it will still be legal and safe for the woman now its up to the states to decide when to limit it for the childs sake ny says up to and even shortly after birth tx et al says at heartbeat
how about british is it legal for woman do abortion there
every baby should have the right to have a life
victory to humanity
good news for the mexican tourism industry 
such a retarded country 2022 or 1900s get a grip america i wonder how these activists who were against abortion would feel if they had been raped and got pregnant or carrying on with a pregnancy that would have massive health implications bet they would feel different then sometimes its necessary
"aleluya
let the wicked die "
there are other methods of contraception
i knew the taliban whooped usas asses in afghanistan but i never realised they gained control of american courts as well
thank you for giving babies  their life back glory to god
freedom to conform to others concept of freedom so not freedom then
38 million terminated so farglad to see it overturned
did u just here the nurse say women abort just to spite
"its absurd in this day and age where men can control a womans body now even rape victims and children from the numerous incest homes in the states will have to go through their pregnancies
 but fine go and get a  ak15 rifle to carry around"
you are not a developed country because you make abortion a norm its called moving backwards how can people call themselves civilized people but find normal to kill babies i have never heard a pregnant woman referring to their unborn child as  a thingso why do stupid creatures think abortion is a human right  and they are able to utter their nonsensical opinions only because no one chose to abort them foolishness how i wish all the proabortion creatures were aborted
a dark day for women 
well if theyve overturned this constitutional right they can overturn the right to bare arms as well
jesus christ is lord  amen
one side of america is happy that babies will live the other side is sad that babies will live
absolutely shameful the world is going backwards i cant believe a president cannot overturn this what is the point of him if he cant over rule such laws
get raped and have rapist kids cost of a abortion vs have rapist kids and live off government tax dollars for life logically abortion saves more tax money long term who wants to keep rapist gentic line going anyways
there has to be a balance in human rights about is murder but self defense causing murder is legal
damn the women who are happy about this look just about exactly like i imagined they would
minor win for humanity but pfizer depends on these babies so they will find other means

 how many dumb people in the comments that think the us has outright banned abortions its mostly the idiots who are upset by this leftists
land of the free
"states already made their own decisions regardless of what these judges say arkansas i know because i live here has allowed abortions until 6 months ago then asa hutchison changed it to emergency only so see how these people lie because apparently abortions where still being preformed in the us
now there showing arkansas like there proudly doing away with abortions as if they hadnt already said they done so lying to their citizens

i dont approve of abortions but who remembers babies tied in garbage bags in garbage cans
or backyard doctors doing abortions where women paid thousands then died because they bled to death
i dont know what the answer is 
i believe we all must answer to a higher calling somebody regardless if you believe theres a god 
there still is a creator of all things regardless what you call this creator
so should we not all be responsible for our own decisions 
im not for abortions but i remember the 70s there where so many babies found dead in garbage bags so many young women found dead next to coat hangers 
is this the world the us wants
i know i dont i think its a personal choice the us got it wrong today

something too i think these judges was part of a bigger agenda here to help provoke chaos rioting possibly shootings in the us its what joe and his nazi regime wants
what good is being a president if you dont have the final say
something is fishy here it really is
the majority of people support abortions in this country
these judges arent supposed to bring their personal beliefs into the mix so what prompted the change
i think it was democrats wanting a uprising in the us is who"
statistically a poor decision
absolutely wonderful
thank you yankcels china and russia when
wtf its healthcare
seems like an unnecessary feud to say the least i wonder how many antiabortionists care about climate change or the damage big pharma big tech and the military industrial complex is doing or poverty or racism etcetc not many im guessing
my goodness the hand maids tale may be on the way for you americans
lets go brandon cant wait for november
this is not about prolife its about antiwoman
"i think there should be more programs of safe sex and stricter sexual crimes laws as it solves the problem of abortion so i am happy for usa with this decision congratulations

if someone really needs abort sure they will find it 

its right that is not default as there should be no situation where family would even need to think about it if there is the root of the problem must to be found and solved not this genocidical way unborn kid is not the root of the problem"
nah banning abortion is crazy ass hell
stop opening your legs  pretty simple
"hallelujah what a reason to rejoice that people will no longer be allowed to disembowel dismember decapitate suffocate and chemically burn helpless babies

god have mercy on us for allowing this modern day child sacrifice"
"what a mess of a country

what a disgusting country"
gop voters relatives and friends do not get pregnant this is a democratic thing  says the basket of deplorables aka gop voters
murdering babies for money but painting it as a womans right the left truly are evil people
banning abortion is awful and a disgusting thing to do but the possibility of banning same sex marriage is simply a red line if these bunch of stuck in the past bigoted groups of extremists honestly think they can turn the clock back to 1950 without consequences then they are truly and unequivocally insane when america turns into a second rate power let there be no doubt that it was the extreme far right gop that caused it to fall
liberals suddenly know what a woman is
america is officially a christofascist shthole
"as a woman  who is mother i would not have the corauge to have an abortion and the issues that it implicate but as a mother of another woman i have no wright to rule about her ideas and believesi not own her and her body is her choice i can only love her no matter what or wathever
face a world with options for all 
respect"
"abortion in ireland is regulated by the health regulation of termination of pregnancy act 2018 abortion is permitted in ireland during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy and later in cases where the pregnant womans life or health is at risk or in the cases of a fatal foetal abnormality abortion services commenced on 1 january 2019 following its legalisation by the aforementioned act which became law on 20 december 2018 previously the 8th constitutional amendment had given the life of the unborn foetus the same value as that of its mother but the 36th constitutional amendment approved by referendum in may 2018 replaced this with a clause permitting the oireachtas parliament to legislate for the termination of pregnancies

abortion had been prohibited in ireland by the uk offences against the person act 1861 the eighth amendment was added to the constitution by referendum in 1983 after concerns that laws prohibiting abortion could be found to be unconstitutional based on a right to privacy in 1992 the supreme court held in the x case that a thirteenyearold girl who had become pregnant as a result of rape could be permitted to obtain an abortion in the state because there was a risk to her life from suicide there were unsuccessful constitutional referendums in 1992 and 2002 that aimed to preclude such grounds for abortion in future cases between 1 january 2014 and 31 december 2018 abortion in ireland was regulated by the protection of life during pregnancy act 2013 under which abortion was illegal unless it occurred as the result of a medical intervention performed to save the life of the woman

in 2012 irish abortion law received worldwide attention on the death of savita halappanavar who had been denied an abortion while suffering a septic miscarriage this increased calls to repeal the eighth amendment the constitutional and legislative provisions were discussed at a citizens assembly in 201617 and at an oireachtas committee in 2017 both of which recommended substantial reform and framed the debate of the referendum in may 2018"
regardless of conception once pregnant it is no longer only about you thus i support this
now theyll overturn brown v board of education
about timewhat a medical abomination
017 in case you didnt know it was never  guaranteed  under the constitution in the first place in fact the constitution doesnt speak for or against so it is disingenuous and a misnomer for legacy media to characterize it so plus for the neutrals perhaps it would be fair to put this in context think about this number 630000000 yes you read that right over 63m abortions from 19732017 before now only the women got to decide who lives and who doesnt but now except in the case of extenuating circumstances like sexual violatin this ruling to return jurisdiction back to the states might perhaps even the playing field and foster accountability
well america has to do something to keep its schools topped up with victims
abortion is disgusting and never should have been legal
so if abortions are banned can we have the right to assisted suicide for the ones who didnt want to be born
the republican taliban has more to say on womens rights birth control is the next one
the us should sort its education system out before doing this
good ruling by the supreme court
guess its back to medieval days theyll be burning rape victims at the stake next and watch out for a new green light on lynchings land of the free piss off the world shakes it head in disbelief at what the us has become since 2016
abortion is not a constitutional right abortion was never and it will never be law such liars lol
daniel dont hold your breath the gop has never funded programs that help children they are prolife up until the moment of birth after birth they dont give a damn the single mothers  their children are on their own
61 of americans are pro choice 70 of americans support gun laws its minority rule in murica
bbc did not read the decision it seems
"theres no right for abortion they were considered as legally killers to humanity life that has godallah given to everyone on earth
these shouldnt be allowing at all life to be borne safely n abortion to be allowed on health status only
killers babies should be punished seriously n there will be no such law to be considered as legally abortion by anyone
may allah blessing guiding protecting all of us to live as humanity justice harmonious etc in life  always "
the bbc should realize abortions are not guaranteed in the bill of rights abortions are not healthcare its mass murder no female has died for the right to have abortions
the baby holocaust has ended
im guessing no ones actually read the abortion bill
good why should a woman decide if my child lives and dies
"this is crazy because two thirds of americans support legal abortion 
the majority need to organize and stop being pushed around by a religious extremist minority"
thank god some good news for once and spare a thought for all the children murdered under this evil law and let it never be considered acceptable again
good now babies have a fighting chance to be born
good decision for the future generations i know some people arent happy but its what humans need exception circumstances only should allow abortion
doctor death is outraged that his blood money stream is coming to an end
there is no right to abortion
abortion is a violent act against your body your soul your mind and your unborn child
women will die because of  this if abortion is murder  then miscarriages will be manslaughter  this is beyond dangerous  more rights will fall after this this decision already paves the way to overturn marriage equality  contraception today they strip me  my daughter of our rights tomorrow they will come for yours
the main question is that abortion is not a right guaranteed by the us constitution so it should be left for states to deal with this and other matters
no abortions mean bigger classroom sizes which in turn means more targets for the bi monthly school shooting
yeah soooooooo whos taking care of all those unloved kids that wont get adopted like we couldve gotten to the point were abortion wasnt needed but thats a far future
what a blow for human rights i am truly shocked her body her choice
a fertilised egg is not a chicken life does not begin at conception
dont fuck random people simple
why is everyone obese
how can they murder shouldnt be illegal we should be able to kill babies all we want obviously
america america what have you become
the decision was to allow states to come to their own decision by the people voting in each state this is the most democratic way to do it rather it being left to a handful of judges    typical bbc   misleading biased reporting  there will be plenty of states still doing abortions and plenty of people and groups ready to pay your expenses to go to these states to have an abortion
us business not ours
one step forward two steps backward
america has failed and it isnt funny anymore
shithole country
the ruthless people who support abortion is because they are already born only followers of the devil favour abortion
wire coat hanger sales are gonna be through the roof
make abortion great again
i only agree with the procedure if a womans life is in danger or was raped the only time doctors should be handling a situation kindly is when a woman miscarries suddenly cause these women never asked to have a miscarriage
lets go thank god this happened
begun the clone wars have
what is wrong with family planning clinics  think about it
the decision just means states can decide if they want it to be legal or not and this is essentially better it lets a gay get married in california and a polygamous life their live in their own terms in utha a group of people imposing their ideas to oder it is good only if you think like them abortion is going to continue in many of the 50 estates of the united states if no central authority can control our lives everybody can live their lives in their own terms we are loosing the essential values of democracy and freedom
this comment section has made me loose my faith in humanity when people say you should be held accountable for what you say on the internet we all start pulling up 1984 but when this happens you all forget about the handmaids tail
wait till the dead bodies start piling up a 20 rise is predicted lets hope the sharp increase in needed welfare will bankrupt these states hopefully this will stem the fascist red wave in november
babies everywhere are happy
for the first time in the long time i have faith in america   someone needed to stop these lunatics no one is stopping people from using birth control
no problem  mass shootings will regulate population growth
itll be griswold v connecticut and lawrence v texas next  this is a horrific slippery slope on the way to a theocracy
abortion is murder always has been always will be
this is awful land of freedom i dont see that any where america has let so many people down i hope you know what you did
then maybe those women need to keep clothes on and their legs closed   
"its sad but true abortions will continue regardless many will be unsafe many women and children will suffer because of this women dying from poorly done backroom abortions women inflicting self harm onto themselves trying to get rid of the child domestic violence from partners who dont want the child more abusedabandoned children from parents who dont want them etc

both outcomes suck however legal abortion was the necessary evil to prevent suffering in many circumstances"
this is great news
"people nowadays are so irresponsible its your body you know you get pregnant from sex its your choice to have sex or not 

stupid morons dumb irresponsible worthless people"
congratulations to the american supreme court for another f the poor decision back to the stone age full steam ahead it seems
this is soo insane that us is even thinking about banning abortionsits just sooo horrible woman should be able to choose over her own body especially if she has been rapedi would never give birth to my rapits child i would be soo disgusted  thank god i live in europe where my rights as a woman arent in danger
our country will implode due to all the insane depravity of our people
women will just have to keep their legs shut
government by flaccid old men and religious nuts enacted by justices appointed by presidents that didnt win the popular vote
to god go the glory from massachusetts yay
absolutely correct no more killing of babies by ruthless mothers
1 friendly advice for all american woman prepare your luggage for jail befor illegal abortion or suicide

bee bee sea chair man rich hard sharp approves
"shut up women we will tell u when u can speak pimp hand to u  

or go vote vote while u can"
biden has no clue what the majority of this country means he dealt with dead people for a rigged election he can sit on my middle finger
god gives life we do not have the right to choose who lives and who dies i pray we can all repent of any sin in our lives and put our faith in jesus christ our lord and saviour god bless
pimps no longer have abortion on demand for victims of human trafficking
disgusting that womens rights are being taken away absolute travesty the is a huge regression and step backward in human rights people cannot stand for this the us is going backwards
thanks god for this decision  
abortion isnt a form of contraception
no to vaccine passports mandates or lockdowns
i feel sorry for all those babies who will land in the bin because the mother didnt have access to arbotion
"now america is now down the right wing conservative tory hole

i hope those that are on the centre or left in the usa go to canada which will look after them pretty much especially because they have the ndp to vote for "
ladies of the usa  just put a ban on sex unless the guy is snipped  watch the outrage then
746 why is the gay man with the rainbow  umbrella celebrating a ban on abortion 
"i dont even have a strong opinion on this really

still unsure on what i think yet it still makes my breath and hr increase weird"
typical american crappy laws after all  they are happy for everyone to have access to guns that kill thousands of innocent young people and kids in their classrooms  but if a woman get raped and is impregnated she had to carry a baby she never wants
the us has taken a step towards protecting the most vulnerable and returning to its founding principles namely the universal rights of all people starting with the right to life thank god 
the right to kill a child you have all lost your minds when you think a babys life should be terminated good will be called evil and evil will be called good these are the last days of a dying civilisation god help us
in 1973 roe v wade literally made up a fake constitutional right to abortion which is found nowhere in the constitution its the same thing as happened in 2015 when they made up a fake right to samesex marriage which is found nowhere in the constitution justices are supposed to uphold the actual text of the constitution not make up new legislation and force it on the states constitutionally both those questions must be left to the individual states to decide via the legislative not judicial branch of government
baby lives matter i am happy for this finally
"i like to play a game these days when i watch the media news  i like to try and spot the narrative  is it for or is it against  forget the good old days when there was neutrality and they just gave the news
did you manage to spot the narrative  try the game its good fun"
land of the free nonsense 
thank god
they terrified because they dont want to take responsibility of their actions what happen to being an adult save the babies and human life
tell us about the rules  limitations of abortion in bloody uk  eu 
voting matters  all these morons vote in these fascists and this is what we get  its a war on women  and they dont want all these unwanted black and brown babies either  and will the gop step up and offer any services for all these unwanted babies  dont hold your breath  but they will make sure each one gets a gun
i blame religion  its a womans right  stop going to a mans church
miscarriages will increase dramatically i would guess this law seems pretty medieval its not good
notice how all the people celebrating are so fing ugly they never need to worry about needing an abortion separation of church and state land of the free you gave up your rights to the vote of 5 people thats not democracy
biden struggling to read just the one paragraph on the teleprompter this time
yet the gun law just minuplaite ppl  with some think else to forget the gun crime  ets just add somethink else to keep ppl happy with
guys are going to be dateless
sex is not a casual thing
whats next for this extreme court
yes yes at last after about 60 millions babies killed by abortion and planned parenthood now we will have generations to comenow babies life is granted
usa going back to the good old days with the right to carry arms its going to be like te wild west its going to get real interesting
ladies the only thing how we can take a revenge no random sex to men lets make them married us first and take full responsibility about unpredictable pregnancy well see how they would all get nuts from such perspective no more tinder and one night stand wanna have sex  make a commitment
why do some women support to not have rights i just dont get it like what the fuck is going on inside thier heads
we are waiting for another ruling that ban gay rights
ah yes the land of the free
"we are basically fighting for the right to kill is this really how our world will end guys take responsibility for your actions having sex means you can eventually get pregnant face it every choice has a consequence and please dont come and tell me that abortion will help you get over a rape believe me abortion will not make your trauma go it will make it worse 2 traumas

the baby would have chosen to live his body his choice"
im 21 and im terrified wow
well come to the 1970 and the republican morons you are look on as backwards thinking country this 2022 we have freedom
taliban states of america
too much skanks this generation allways get knocked up sad times
this illegitimate puppet dictator is such a hypocrite he and his agenda is the worst hindrance for abortions the demonrats in control of the government are the biggest hypocritical hindrance to the people period
great decision killing an unborn baby is absolute murder and anyone who does this is going to hell
"this comment section makes my stomach turn

im in favour of a womans right to choose"
republicans pro life until elementary school
suzy boniface and people like her mentioning children killed in schools  but how many unborn children have been murdered just because the baby cramps their lifestyle in say the last 50 yrs far more than children murdered in schools  which is every bit as evil cos their all children
in a short time the courts take away womens rights and at the same time let gun toting maniacs roam the streets armed if it were a movie it would be deemed to far fetched to  be credible
disgrace  no court of old farts should tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body  its not an unborn child is a foetus that is growing because a male cell fertilized a female egg  and in the cold light of day the woman may well  regret a moment of 
seeing some crying over not being able to kill babies anymore is disgusting that one nurse said getting an abortion saved her life but extinguished the life of another who didnt get a choice to decide like she heartlessly did
yeah keep breeding morons the world is already at breaking point animals
"the woman who claimed that she was rapped  and therefore  that 
 case became  into  law said before she diedpassed to the other  world that she lied about it because of  her and the greedy ones millions of babies were killed their blood calls for justice  no more killing of babies we are not under  mullok sacrifices or are we  were we and if left to the radical demonds will be no more sacrifices to mullok"
have a feeling its not just about prolife prochoice standpoints you seen the demographics of wealthy nations whos going to do wage slavery and keep people supply up for the rich people to exploit else if the poor people get abortions to prevent bad situations both for themselves and their children the rich lobbyists dont care if a child grows up in an impoverished environment so long as such can work whatever occupation in future for cheap think supply and demand high supply of poorer people and they have to compete for your position and get lower wages less supply of poorer people and you actually have to pay them and treat them well to get them to work for you
i still have no words for this appalling ruling of the supreme court and for its  consequences
in other news coat hanger sales skyrocket
"you shouldnt get to make choices that affect the decisions people make in their own best interests
protectwomensrights"
misleading title  the decision just means states can decide if they want it to be legal or not
women have been talking like we live in the 1800s forever men have no option to opt out of parental responsibility so to me this is closer to equality
get ready for civil war 20
america is the laughing stock of the world
i live in south carolina so its probably going to be banned here but luckily i live a 15minute drive from north carolina if ever needed
massive w for humanity
fantastic  isnt it
god bless america
end the tyranny 
where are those biden loving democrats now
violence is never the answer lets make abortion history
"america is based on the god of the bible
the babylonians in the old testament worshiped moloch they sacrificed children
thats fast what was happening to america
jesus christ is the same yesterday today and today
each child is a gift from god"
well appreciated for the decision 
just remember the same people who like abortion  are the same people who want to make saving 18 cents a gallon a federal holiday
democracy innit
as an american i will say this  any woman who wants to have an abortion can still get one  america is a big country and they can go where it is still legal
abortion is not banned its left to each state please do not add to miss information maybe ladies and gentlemen can take precautions to stop a pregnancy and even in states where abortion may be restricted for rape victims 65 million babies where terminated last year please bbc tell the truth dont add to the destruction at least tell all sides you may get more people to watch
thank you president trump
they went past the bedroom and straight for the womb next weeks ruling skin color sex partner and religious authority
lol joe you know how unpopulated you are right now why are you talking
"if all life is so sacred stop eating anything that used to be living  its impossible 
life does not mean the same thing as alive"
will the us be split into two countries
and fathers have no say  it is a disgrace that woman and men of color wil not say anything about
this is lile movie apocolypto
protection an ounce of prevention after all
pro life conservatives are evil vile people using their bible to control people so much for small government
why is abortion divisive everyone knows it is murder of a human life
im aged zygote  thnks us
"one side is happy babies will live
one side is sad babies will live"
they will fight everything except their racism
this is just like prohibition it sounds like a good thing but its taking away their freedom of choice people will still find a way around to getting rid of babies by killing them with the taking of drugs or secret operations its just sad that americans yes again got rid of their own freedom of choice yet again
as a social worker in georgia in the united states i see thousands of kids going through the system who never get adopted no life skills the majority of my kids  emulate what they see and at 18 we kick them out on the street and about 11 of the kids do get adopted the rest are just lost working dead end jobs falling prey to addiction and undiagnosed mental health problems and my hands were tied it was sad to witness i really hope they dump lots of money into the system so i can really help these kids
the last time the bbc did this we all took down the video and it was hilarious
they also increased funding to support new mothers right
obortion is south american sacrifice
got this mad idea if your not wanting a baby try either proper protection or celibacy  dont blame an unborn child for your own mistakes either that or put the baby up for adoption theres plenty of women who cant have children who would love 1
america is the most backwards of all the advanced countries
is not like every human born is going to do anything worthwhile with their life theyll grow up to be tax smoochers drug and sex addicts with no ambitions of anything in life no worth in work nor hope in heart no wit nor will to fight soulless braindead and overmedicated themodernconsumer
the end of the black genocide
gotta love hypocrite conservatives its only my body my choice if it comes to a vaccine this isnt saving lives women will get back alley abortions and be forced to birth rape babies pro life bullshit
abortion has never been guaranteed by the constitution the overturning of roe v wade does not ban abortion it just pushes that decision back to the states
i am sure all those who are pro forced birth are going to adopt all the unwanted babies
ok folks no killing of babies until theyre old enough to start school and get gunned down by some coward with a gun nice hypocrisy there
going to be a lot more suspicious falls down flights of stairs in the us
land of the free and home of the automatic weapon
wow what kind of right is this right to kill babies luckily those who are fighting for this right to abortion their mother didnt aborted them
i am so confused scotus decided ny cant make their own gun laws but  abortion will now fall under the states to decide huh
the consideration ls are so weighty and nuanced and yet one reads these comments the spite in your hearts is truly unbelievable
was it a right
"slowly being stripped of our rights
your guns are next "
good  imagine if all the females took advantage of the numerous forms of birth control in which to choose from how many countless thousands of babies would be saved from murder up until birth and instead shamelessly playing babyroullet actually took responsibility imagine  glad i wont be forced to pay my tax dollars to this any more
democrats are going to burn  and riot but life wins
good stop those baby murderers
disgusting  and the yanks go on about the taliban women should own the right to thier own bodies
best news in years
"the same day as germany abolished the restrictions on information about abortions
what irony"
is this the start of handmaids tale
so clarence thomas now wants more power given to the states  let the states make the laws  so now when the republican controlled states all pass laws against abortion  states rights  so when a state now passes a law making abortion legal in that state at 8 months and 3 weeks for any reason states rights  when the suit is brought against it what will the supreme court say   states rights  
people should look into the other rights we the people have that arent part of the original constitution like the right for women to vote the way they worded the decision means they can go after everything that has been put in place since the original document was written religion wins again we will be under religious law soon and youll see your rights go away you just wait
hobo cht  puppy nutta fwit 
so this hands the power back to the people in each state to decide what they think is acceptable instead of dc having the power to decide for the country  the democrats are peed off because planned parenting wont get millions in funding from the tax payer  who then give millions to the democrats election time its all a show and media like bbc enjoy adding fuel to the misleading fire
im expecting huge protests that might even turn violent and deadly over the weekend
a great day for children
blue discount sale in liberal cities across the nation over the weekend unbelievable prices on flat screens and sneakers
oh boy now they can undo mixed race marriages and womens right to vote and birth control after all they arent mentioned in the constitution either i dont think people understand that thomas said last year that legal precedent is something he doesnt believe in
nireland  whats an abortion 
jesus hate abortion dont promote evil
"absolutely ridiculous to take away a womans right 
my god unwanted pregnancies child pregnancies rape victims why should anyone be controlling other peoples lives
going back to dark ages
dont agree with abortion being used as contraception or late term abortion but every one has their unique situation they will drive this under ground becoming more dangerous womens bodies womens right anything else is ridiculous meant to be western country where women have equal rights and choices"
youre 25 heres a plan keep your legs shut or get on contraceptives
deeply disheartening our neighbouring country is systematically dismantling hard fought for rights it is going to take so much effort and a renewed compassionate focus to work towards undoing what the current supreme court has inflicted upon the populace 
whats a women
us politicians and courts keeping the unwashed masses distracted fighting each other on red herrings while they make off like bandits
women if you live in a state where its illegal going forward just get on a flight to california and get your abortion otherwise bring the baby to term and give it up for adoption and bless someone else with a child if you dont want to be blessed
this is not a historic moment this is a huge mistake so many  children will now be killed by there parents and traffickers
the us supreme court decision was inspired by the great replacement conspiracy theory that white americans are losing
thank you usa im from méxico we dont want abortion
these sickos do not represent us republicans and conservatives have put the final fork in this country its doomed over
us sliding back to medieval times real fast first an attempt to hang the vice president rampant conspiracy theories and now this ireland reversed their ban a few years ago and it was one of the last countries
abortion has done irreparable damage to the human race
watch how this ages
well i hope every man in this country has brought enough sex dolls and vaseline to last them a lifetime because it will be a long time before they ever get sex from any of these women out here 
"i guess america _doesnt_ believe in freedom of your own body huh
if they try to say its for the babys freedom then theyre okay with depriving one person of freedom to give it to someone else
morally thats a pretty shitty situation"
as a man who identifies as a foetus i feel relieved and safe now thank you us supreme court
the us of a going back in time and on the world stage
this is savagery
thoughts
i totally agree with what you are saying  i started in crypto in august 2017 and i bought in  i was up 5x by december only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85 during the ensuing 4 year bear market  i took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do  i wish i had bought more  i am in profit for now but i am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from jim brin i have learned from you and other youtubrs  especially my mentor  jim brin who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 11 to 27btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market
"abortion only should be allowed if the womangirl  has a 
lifethreatening medical condition been raped or pregnancy by incest i think there is 
just too much abortions done there are options such as adoption live and 
let live"
abortion wont be banned completely it will only be allowed for rape victims
im so proud of americans today
only on the federal level it puts it up to each state to decide whether its legal or not so stop spreading false narratives
it was never a constitutional right
liberals and leftist 5 minutes in the sun is over and more to come all them lives taken and no chance at life not they have that chance
republican party politicians ended the right to abortion to increase the population of white americans and control the population of black and brown americans because they fear that white americans are becoming the minority
listen man united might not thank me but get the contract out put it on the table let him sign it let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there given what hes done since hes come in ten hags ole 40 at the wheel man hes doing it hes doing his thing man united are back
the bbc has no right to pass judgement on an alien culture they know nothing about
i wish everyone who clicked this video the most love peace and abundance
"im american the damn republicans did this now to distract from the january 6th committee exposing don the con trump as a criminal  twice impeached trump was the worst us president in history for many reasons 1 trump committed an act of treason against the us by inciting a violent insurrection on january 6 2021 2 trumps incompetence regarding his management of the us response to the covid19 pandemic between january 2020 and july of 2020 thousands of us citizens died as a result trumps failure if trump had a proper immediate response to the pandemic the way that the south korean government did then thousands of us citizens who died would still be alive today 3 in april of 2019 trump vetoed the resolution to end us military support of saudi arabias genocide of thousands of innocent civilians in yemen trump was using the us military to support genocide in yemen 4 trump violated the emoluments clause of the us constitution for his entire 4 years in office then in 2019 trump verbally mocked the us constitution the foundation of the usa is the us constitution that is why the presidential inaugural oath includes to swear to protect and defend the us constitution in january 2017 trump publicly swore an oath on a bible at his inauguration ceremony to protect and defend the us constitution in 2019 trump mocked the us constitution by publicly saying the words phony emoluments clause 5 trump misogynistically and adulterously said of women grab them by the pussy trump committed adultery with stormy daniels and then tried to cover it up trumps former lawyer michael cohen was in prison for crimes related to trumps coverup of his adulterous scandal with stormy daniels most republicans claim to be the moral party andor the majority christian party but hypocritically enthusiastically want to give an adulterous donald trump another 4 years in office if a us president who was a member of the democratic party did the terrible things trump has of course the republican party leaders would be screaming for his removal from office 6 trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice 7 trump committed crimes of trying to tamper with elections especially in georgia 8 trumps attempted abuse of power regarding ukraine 9 trump committed tax fraud in new york state which is partly why trump hides his tax returns 10 trump practiced corrupt nepotism as he appointed unqualified members of his family into positions of power in the executive branch of government 11 trump illegally destroyed documents and illegally took documents with him after he left the office of president 
there are many other horrible things about trump here are some of them donald trump is a dumb corrupt businessman which is why he hides his tax returns donald trump is not a selfmade man he benefited from nepotism his daddy fred trump gave him millions of dollars to start businesses many of which have failed donald trumps failed businesses are many but include trump airlines a trump casino and trump university with his failed trump university he defrauded hundreds of students in trumps many construction projects he failed to pay some of his contractors trump committed fraud with his nonprofit in new york state which is why trump recently transferred his residence to florida donald trump is too stupid to write his own book which why he hired a ghost writer to write the art of the deal when trump was in high school he hired another boy to take his sat college entrance exam trump claims that he is smart but he refuses to show us his college transcripts donald trumps daddy bribed a physician to write that donald trump had bone spurs and therefore could dodge the vietnam war draft donald trump and his dad also practiced racism in who they would rent properties to in the 1960s and 1970s that is just scratching the surface of the long list of horrible things about donald trump"
oh no america is finished
the right to abortion was not struck down the federal government no longer controls abortion that decision is now something determined by the states not the federal government
love  ahead everything
next they will also ban male abortions
no sound
christianity the big hypocrisy
"first viewer and commenter 

bbc love from kashmir "
cant hear a thing
fact men cannot fight god and god will never fail because god will always win
no sound
never vote gop again thats how we fix healthcare
a better world with less murder
easy solution if men really wanted to save babies lives they would mandate vasectomies instead of playing politics with womens bodies    vasectomy is safer cleaner more successful a one timer not risky nor fatal and a whole lot cheaper       hey guys how about it    solution to abortion is prevention
extreme  no sorry  a wrong has been righted  roe vs wade was based off lies  using larry laders ideologies
they be illegalizing abortion but still let people sell gun legally
they took are jobs
many churches are evil  dont give your child up for adoption  they want to ban abortion only for their own greed and evil intentions to sell children to pedophiles sexual perverts and into slavery
"1 abortion bans do nothing women will always have the option of abortion whether its banned or not 
2 abortion bans actually increase the number of abortions ironically so i guess you people really arent about saving fetal lives so much as virtue signaling
3 fetuses now have a right that no other human being has and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another persons body to stay alive no other human has ever been granted that right even if you stab someone and theyre bleeding out and you have matching blood types the government cannot force you to give them your blood to keep them alive or if you use a mask gloves etc but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organs start shutting down the government cannot forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organs you used protection so the chances of giving this person the disease that youre a carrier for were very low but it still happened and now theyre dying because of you guess whatthe government does not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive thats exactly what an abortion ban attempts to do however so im not sure why fetuses should have that right when no one else does"
by the order of god a soul is sent to a particular womb but by this contraceptive he is denied that womb and has to be placed in another that is disobedience to the supreme
im prochoice is abortion killing a baby yepbut im good with it anyway we have enough people
people on b9th sides quite  your stupid stuffthere are more life threatening  things going on in the world there using you all to run on elections and money same thing ever year
not government role to control stay out will never please all  waste of time and energy  individual  decision people mind your own business
look at all those people its ridiculous the world is populated with people what the hake do i look like adding on to that im good 
isnt it something how they talk about the one woman in a million that couldnt get an abortion and something went wrong but they dont talk about the other billion of babies that are born safe and naturally ban all abortion pills it goes handinhand with overturning it
every abortion is the murder of a baby  i dont understand how blind people are
the right to lifers tend not to mention the things ive delt with i am mow 62 never had kids because i did not want them to grow up in this world i get consistent  from people in the reichwing because i didnt have any seems it is not all just the gripe that abortion is murder clearly they have other motives the reichwingers will never touch my children
every woman encouraged by dems to just get an abortion all wind up in therapy   dems should get abortions
i wanna get rid of my kids too man yall please help me
it makes me so angry  these people demanding abortions until as long as they want  who do they think has do these things   nurses and doctors who dont have a choice or lose their job   we get to do the nasty murderous things these people demand  nurses and doctors committing suicide on a daily rate because they are being forced to be murderers  assisted suicide late term abortions  they monsters demanding it dont have to get their hands dirty or sin against gods wishes   they dont have to live with seeing babies taken out piece by piece   you are monsters to make medical people who swore to say lives take it so you dont have to be bothered  that is why i left my profession and why thousands are leaving daily  you selfish little snowflakes
till shes on deaths door really
"does abortion cause breast cancer  in medical circles estrogen is a known carcinogen cancer causing when a woman is pregnant her estrogen rate spikes significantly and her breasts begin to change in size and function differentiate for breast feeding specifically her ovaries produce 2000 percent more estrogen and progesterone at this time with the levels of estrogen now elevated if she interrupts the cell differentiation process before full term pregnancy this elevated estrogen introduces routes for the onset of breast cancer this is the triggering process where abortion increases the risk of breast cancer this is why in a late term abortion or miscarriage with this abundance of estrogen the risk of breast cancer increases by 638 percent over those with no such history this is also why teenagers who have an abortion are especially at risk for breast cancer because of the changes estrogen is already causing in their breasts plus the additional estrogen from the pregnancy 

there are a lot more data on this but the bottom line is 1 abortion significantly increases the risk of breast cancer for all women 2 the younger the woman and the later the abortion the greater the breast cancer risk and 3 the breast cancer rate for women almost doubled since roe v wade it is medically established that abortion increases the rate of breast cancer but women typically are not told about this until the breast cancer starts and by then prevention is no longer a choice  if you wish to learn more check out my right to choose on amazon this information will help you make informed choices about what you do and what you encourage your family and friends to do it literally could be the difference between life or death"
jesus is coming folks repent and be saved
the living but unborn are persons in the sight of god from the time of conception since abortion takes a human life it is not a moral option except to prevent the death of another person the mother the sin of willfully aborting a child except in those very rare situations where it may be necessary to save the life of the mother is a sinful act totally contrary to the will of god
i wouldnt personally want to abuse my child but i wouldnt stop other parents from doing so
free tickets to heaven free limbs to be able to afford to get through life
stop the drama and use protection if you cant afford to raise a child then use a double condom actionsconsequences pro life 
happened with biden administration yall voted for him and wanted him dont cry now just like how he left extremely expensive military equipment in afghanistan purchased by my tax money
killing is killing use a condom
yeah it means no babies will be murdered thats pretty much it 
the defining moment of being a modern woman the right to abort your child what a sick position its the epitome of stupid im prolife even if it means the unborn child might possibly turn out as ugly as your disposition shame on you for bringing your hurt to the party and advocating for termination of the unborn go forgive your mother
you can get all these people out on the street to fight for the right to abort but you cant get anyone to protest the current political regime in america even when you cant afford gasoline and your family is going hungry how about a great reset to the american peoples priorities good luck repopulating the future too
women should have the right not to become pregnant  havent they always  it is her body after all her choice  pregnancy is not a communicable disease it is usually a choice for exposure they make for themselves  irresponsibly removing consequences of detrimental decisions encourages more of the same  more of the same meets the definition of perversion   some people want big government to mess in personal lives where individually you own consequences  that you can depend on big government for your well being is a fallacy democrats are selling and failing with  think about it people reach new understanding every day
i know a woman who is extremely  conservative and all about the abortion ban what she wont tell you is that shes had 3 abortions herself when she was younger if she would of had any of those children her life would have been completely different
reverse psychology thats why they did this its to easy the government is smart  they dont want anymore babies born  there are to many people on this planet youll walked right into there hands
we need to fight for abortions so blacks and mexicans are not born anymore legalize abortions n place them in all black communities plz
how about women start using protection and taking responsibility for their actions aka dont be a murderous pos
im a 100 republican and i just dont get my sides point of view on abortion or understand why theyre all so against it personally i think there should actually be a 100 legal forced abortion after a family has just 1 child if that many even none of this adoption garbage either because that just adds to the problem not just because i hate and despise children but also and mostly because this world and especially this country us are all completely overcrowded we do not need more people in it plain and simple enough is enough
abortion is not medicine it is murder
"the movie 2001 a space odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion a space odyssey is a fetus in the womb the clint eastwood dirty harry movies was angry calm it seems nasty but its a good police officer angry calm is how a women chooses abortion

everything in motion makes one error your supposed to park the error where it doesnt matter or you play wack a mole with errors its intelligently designed that if you try killing god you will always make one error a movie is in motion so you have to park the errors where it doesnt matter 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind that why hal computer eye is colored red so it still has artistic integrity 2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made it only has one error to park you cant do better than that"
abortion is not the issue most people want some regualtion schumers bill advocated for 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 months and aftr birth thats murder
simple solution stop spreading you legs
more future wage slaves this is why they decided to banned abortion
they bought the supreme and now this anti abortion law in 2022  this law is bigoted intolerant and make a lot of problems for people  i dont know how this people were elected but sure usa voters have to ponder about it
"exodus 212225

authorized king james version

22 if men strive and hurt a woman with child so that her fruit depart from her and yet no mischief follow he shall be surely punished according as the womans husband will lay upon him and he shall pay as the judges determine 23 and if any mischief follow then thou shalt give life for life 24 eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot 25 burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe"
men have no right to be the ones to decide womens issues especially about reproductive rights if the shoe were on the other foot men would literally lose their minds if women were in charge of deciding mens issues such as who gets vasectomies who is allowed viagra etc
"heres what i dont understand  
1 bearing a child carries an inherent risk of death or grievous bodily harm  
2 one may not be forced to use their body at the service of another that would be slavery  
3 one may not be forced to endure medical risk physical pain and mental anguish that would be torture  

so how exactly is abortion anything other than self defense"
i dont understand how people who arewere against government mandated covid vaccinations but are in support of abortion bans its enraging that some only support bodily autonomy when its in regards to themselves but dont care that womens rights are being violated
more lies and propaganda abortion has not been banned check with state voters msnbc cant  be trusted beware of these propaganda news networks americans deserve truthful reporting
us democracy is a broken system and it does not represent the majority of americans the majority of americans approve of legal abortion they approve of stricter gun control laws support raising the minimum wage recognize our southern border is in crisis with illegal immigration and etc yet our representatives continually fail us playing political games back and forth prioritizing their own needs and the needs of corporations and special interest groups over the average american voter
gops cant respect a womens right to decide what to do with their bodies in order to protect when it comes to gun and violent though they dont seem to care about those lives
we are all here because our parents choose life for us and yet in 2022 we are still killing babies in the womb so wrong
hopefully what the supreme court did will be the undoing and the permanent removal and destruction of the republican party and hopefully we can have term limits
you can only ban legal abortions
just wait itll be 2055 and the country will be so overpopulated that you have to live in stacks like ready player one imagine banning the one form of population control we had a right to
almost 50 of the adult voting age population are women if they dont stand up and vote these republicans out they will have only themselves to blame when their rights are taken away from them what will it be next the right to vote taken away the right to travel to another state is already in jeopardy will they make it so you have to have a man sign for you if you want to travel or open a bank account or get a loan from the bank to own your own property this is only the tip of the iceberg and women need to sit up and take notice or they will lose all the gains that our grandmothers and mothers fought so hard to secure for women of today wake up to whats really happening here
its less about abortion and more about that some ppl believe they know better how to live your life but dont tell them how to live theirs thats their freedom its your freedom that offends them
abortion bans dont stop abortions only clinics most women are just causing their own miscarriage i am glad women have abortions pro life only want us born so we can suffer every abortion saves a child from this world
"its a woman choice
republicans have no business taking away a womans choice to their bodies period
remind remove republicans roevember
"
"remember remove remind republicans
 roevember

vote to remove republicans across america"
still hasnt changed my mind  these children matter more than you think
dude its up to the states
protection of the helpless babies is never mentioned
"why do peopke think they have any right to tell a woman what to do with with her body no one should be able to my body my choice
if someone doesnt believe in abortion fine dont get one but why bc they dont believe in it they get to tell others what to think how to feel what to do with their bodies i bet most of these people yelled my freedom during covid thing is they werent forced to do anything there were limits and boundaries but not forced women are being forced to do something major with their bodies"
as a mature woman who lived in the times before roe i remember the tears of a teen who missed her period the ostracism of a pregnant young girl from school church andor family the swallowing of pills  potions attempting to selfabort or the horror of nurses  doctors when left with the ravages of the damage a coat hanger can do when a woman is desperate those were horrendous times for women please dont make me live them again

its like a really old computer one is too lazy to get a new one because the old one still works even though its slow and out of touch and doesnt pick up the internet well but it has all your old files and would be just a big mess to switch over to a more functional government ahem i mean computer
over a million dead labor units in the us alone  big money wants forced birth cattle  religious nuts want to control crotches  what a team
republicans dont give a crap about the unborn they just want to keep birth rate up so we dont runout of taxpayers and cheap labor in 16 years
abortion kills alot of babys
can texas please just secede from the us  its a pos state
thats just a small percentage of the general population not as many idiots out there as i thought 
i would like to know if there are any incidents that doctors were charged when treating a miscarriage if not this is fear mongering every party does this if it has happened then that would be ridiculous and we should address it
the staff at msnbc is reason enough for abortion
"come on supreme court follow through on this fair decision based on the same reasoning update the federal voting law
roe v wade was overturned based on 14th amendment and the situation in 1868 look at who were allowed to vote or hold office in 1868 based on the law and the 14th amendment


arkansas constitution1868 
sec 3 the following classes shall not be permitted to register or vote or hold office viz
1st those who during rebellion took the oath of allegiance or gave bonds for loyalty and good behavior to the united states government and afterward gave aid comfort or countenance to those engaged in armed hostility to the government of the united states either by becoming a soldier in the rebel army or by entering the lines of said army or adhering in any way to the cause of rebellion or by accompanying any armed force belonging to the rebel army or by furnishing supplies of any kind to the same
2d    
3d     
4th    
5th    
6th those who are idiots or insane

the first group takes care of the former president many congress members and the insurrectionists the sixth group encompasses those people who still think trump won in 2020"
this will make people less reckless about getting pregnant
it is inhumane to murder your own child
vote blue and get these people out of office
you are being snowed wool pulled over your eyes they tell you custody isnt kidnapping and they tell you child support isnt enslavement and they tell you abortion isnt murder you are being snowed
man imagine not being able to get treatment because you are pregnant but you cant cease your pregnancy to get the treatment that can save your life because of the new abortion law
"i really dont see the problem 
no one outlawed dumpsters"
"what is nauseating is the motive for banning abortion
these so called prolifers  say they want to save a life but they wont sign on to feed and supporting the life of the child
like extending medicaid or raising the wages that will enable the family to function at a humane level
so the family wont be kept in poverty
poverty is one of the tools that the system uses to remove children from the family
in turn an unsupervised prolife  adoption agency will be at the family  front door
how much will an adoption agency get for a new born baby 
its a fact that the younger the child the higher the price
how many people in our society have horror stories of being separated from their family and getting lost in the adoption systems not having knowledge of  their proper identity this form of human trafficking has bee going on for hundreds of years
these preditory prolifers must be challenged
someone need to push for legislation to remove the profits from the adoption process the legal  human trafficking process"
yeah republicans shoot themselves in the footlol
based on this greg abbott is done
with all the issues in the world and as big as the world is why focus on abortion     usa needs to find something else to focus i 
welcome to the islamic republic of america
organized crime is what you are really seeing womens biggest partner in crime walked away from them look at all the custody and child support laws when they really started and youll see it all about the 70s when they legalized murder of the unborn just because they call something different than what it really is doesnt change what it really is custodykidnapping child supportenslavement abortionmurder they just changed how you think about it by calling it something different
no matter how you feel about abortion msnbc is an ignorant outlet that is driven by hate  every valid point they may have is lost in a river of stupidity and ignorance  msnbc sucks
its not that i dont understand being prolife i do understand i get it but it simply doesnt outweigh the reasons to be prochoice there are too many exceptions and too many tragic situations where an abortion is  as unfortunate as it is  the best option and its really nobodys business to impose laws upon a woman in one of those situations
watch out in 15yrs or so crime rate is gonna go up
it is time for americans to man up if republicans win this then we must face some facts republicans have not hidden the fact they are going after birth control next so together with banning abortions this amounts to forced births if they win and you care about children you might want to consider getting your tubes tied or a vasectomy if this sounds a little drastic it is however if republicans win would you really want to bring a helpless baby into this country under their rule
lets vote this republicans out of power
abortion is not for religious fanatics and politicians to decide it is right of the woman to decide with help of doctors and specialists there is so many things wrong with you america
what does msnbc know about people
the republicans are making sure that they will not be elected with all of the very unpopular choices they are making
abortion is not healthcare miscarriage is not manslaughter
if people dont want abortions banned then murder should be allowed
she went into the eyeglasses store and thought i want to look like a woman disney villain
meanwhile in my state no change in maternity or family leave we are literally one of only three countries in the world to have no care women risk losing their job for having a baby no care by doctors for fear of doing wrong and having to carry your dead baby to term after a miscarriage no plans for mental health for these women going through trauma no plans for expanding the foster care or adoption system bc they can barely account for the thousands of children and women especially black women and children who disappear after either being in the system or going in for medical care yeah we really prolife in the us meanwhile all those rich girls who get knocked up come to whatever doctor or clinic they want before the clinic office opens and gets the deed done under the table
you know the same christian brothers that want to deny food assistance to our continually starving kids  want to force more starving kids that we cant afford or raise religious scum
"it has nothing to do with keeping babies alive and everything to do with control
if you cared about those babies youd stop killing them in your schools"
"this will be the same as brexit and trumps election people make important decisions based on emotions gut feelings and stereotypes decisions such as these should always be grounded on solid thinking through 

people are acting more and more rushed hot headed and arrogantly these days and its impacting our democracies"
enact a law the requires males who father children and do not financially support their children to be chemically castrated
the american dream just gets better and better 
in antiabortions states could people set up planned parenthood clinics on native american reservation lands
"if everyone votes the gop handed the democrats a major share of both houses 

the majority of people believe in human rights where as the gop believes in billionaire rights and bad faith politics"
"a big part of me is desperately trying to hold back from laughting at them for allowing such rights to be taken away
another part of me tells me that not everyone of the voters knew what it meant"
the problem is not the banning of abortion but its performance
so are we going to have punishments for assisting women in getting pregnant
"take a measure of our schools of how disgustingly underfunded undersupported deprioritized our children are 
see how the gop fights to take away wic and food stamps that feed hungry children
see how the social workers are handling 10x the caseload that they should be and all the instances where horrible abuses go undetected because we arent lookig out for children in the system
see how utterly dysfunctional the adoption gordian knot is

you think these unwanted pregnancies the children resulting from the forced births that they are going to be taken care of give me a fvcking break that is a fantasy

doctors and pregnant women need to be able to make healthcare decisions without government interference"
"i tell you whatim so fvcking livid
itching for the ballot box time is now this is an attack on women"
its always been banned in my country
senator raphael warnock stole 60000 in campaign funds to pay his child support thats how demonrats operate
"heres the thing it doesnt matter it doesnt matter if a fetus is a full human being it doesnt matter if they have a heartbeat
thousands of people die every year because they didnt get organ transplants theres no law forcing anyone to give up their organs medical schools need corpses to study  but they legally cant use a body that did not consent in life
so even if  and the if is very exaggerated here  abortion is murder then that doesnt matter because you cannot force someone to preserve another persons life"
if women dont care about ending the life of a future baby why should we care about their life
"and yet planned parenthood tells protesters not to say woman on their signs they claim to speak for womens rights but wont even dare to use the word woman
cute right"
msnbc get your subtitle system sorted so that it is close to what people are saying
as women die due to self abortion or unsanitary ended pregnancies it will be revealed just how little the male population cares all the natural miscarriages that occur will be considered as an abortion where are our rights as women as voters this sickens me being pro womens rights doesnt mean being pro abortion it means as it says being pro womens rights
can they not have a referendum on this let the people decide through a vote
thats why when november comes all these women all over this country  have to vote to let the supreme court and gop hear them clearly that a womans right to chose is hers and hers alone
the handmaidens tale is merely boot camp according to the repukeliekkkons
if abortion is murder than every person you didnt donate your liver kidneys or blood to and they died is your fault murderer
"bottom line law makers are all about creating more human suffering
theres just too much money in it for the people at the top"
watch the movie the silent cry i guarantee you will change u mind about abortion if that movie doesnt affect you  you have no soul do you know what the leading cause of death for blacks in this country is its abortion 15000 or more black children are murdered every year
all you biden democrats dont worry about it abortion go down to the border pick up 10 or 12 people call them your kids call them whatever you want and then while youre at it let your president know whats going on down there
texas wants to finish the wall all on its own but you idiots have tied them up in court for a long time disallowing them to finish the wall discuss that this whole administration is disgusting n a lie
should be banned every where you people are evil
really dont care about females rights to abortion  because its not that you cant vote but wont vote for your rights until you do you dont deserve them
i hear they are building a mayflower to sail across the great pond to get away from religion persecution
"why dont they do something about the root cause  the reckless fg

in this day and age there is simply zero excuse for an unintended pregnancy
wrap that rascal snug panties just say no a solid punch to that horn dogs throat

terminating a pregnancy should be so onerous that couples will think twice about doing the dirty deed
lol10 

abortions should be free cheaper for the state than unwanted children they cant afford or parent

but if you still have one walk into any starbucks there will be a free clinic in back
when you leave you will be sterile there will be no repeat and certainly no threepeat
and we will hunt down the dumb sob that contributed and fix his junk too"
every time a democrat fights for more rights they end up losing more then they gain hey dems stop shooting yourself in the foot while trying to win a sack racelol  just about every state gave women 15 weeks to decide to abort or raise the kid you challenged for more  now you got nun when ya gonna learn
hay lindsey g heres your people in the streets
fun fact the democrats  have already taken away everybodys medical rights bye forcing injections into peoples bodies with out consent democrats just passed a law a gun bill that strips away the second amendment from the constitution so democrats have already started taking away and stripping away fundamental constitutional rights from every single american citizen and we the people are allowing this to happen and we dont have the courage to stand up against joe biden and his tyrannical administration
impeach the supreme court judges now
stay out of my body the govt didnt have say on the moment of conceptionunless they were peeking its none of its business
must be hard to live in a country that takes backward steps on large issues
overturning r vs w will cost the gop just as much if not more than 45s indiscretions 
the overturning of roe vs wade was a political choice by republican lawmakers to help their party get religious zealots on board to vote for their party during the mid term elections  think about it  the timing isnt just random  whether these justices are religious zealots thou isnt an argument i am going to get into now   what is a religious zealot  well in my opinion its a person who has a faith and that faith dictates their lives and they attempt to force others to comply with their beliefs by any means necessary whether it be changing the laws mobs all the way upto death squads and such  they do not believe others who do not follow their ideas or their faith have the right to exist  and by their actions others of faiths with anything in common with them will be forced to help them or face their wrath  and that is how you get anyone who is religious to get in line and support the zealots  fear and the desire just to survive take prestant to fit in even if these ideas are not your own   so ya in my opinion roe vs wade being overturned is a means to buy religious folks compliance to the zealots and to force the population to follow the ideas of the zealots   either the population acts or it lays back and accepts these religious zealots rule  which has only just begun next it will be public schools science medicine the list is endless but attacks have already started on every front people fight back and hopefully it will be enough to retain our democracy and not fall back to being pre constitution days
everything happens for a reason i believe this is happening because its damaging republicons reputation to the point where even diehard supporters are saying theyre voting blue this year effectively removing the gqps power over us one election at a time
i hope that every woman that has been denied medical assistance and has suffered for it  sues every pro abortion government
everyone needs to plan ahead and make sure these cheaters have not purged you from the voter registration list  we all need to plan ahead and know where when and how we are voting this november  they have passed a ton of voter suppression laws all over the country  we gotta do our homework well in advance  there are fewer drop boxes for ballots to be dropped off at you may no longer be eligible to vote by mail so check now  they have closed and or consolidated many precincts to make the wait time to vote in person prohibitive in minority areas  the maga klan red hats will be out trying to intimate voters  some of them have run off the usual poll workers so that they can intimidate misinform or discourage voters that might not vote for maralardo  we should all expect obstacles and be ready to overcome them quickly  know whos running and what policies they stand for and against vote against the fascipublicans or we will loose even more of our rights and freedoms  these crazies will make handmaids tale an american documentary if we give them a fraction of a chance
living in nc near the border still wanting sc money for it we go for fireworks they come for abortions crazy
i cry for all the women who will die because their right to safe care has been taken away too many women will die when we could have helped save them i live in texas and im terrified of having a complicated pregnancy now
overturning roe was a beautiful thing
if a man is against abortion they need to be sterilized meaning a operation
im a democrat but am against pro choice
biden was against abortion in 2006 i only support that version
land of the free
im so happy i live in kansas i think this is the most my state has ever been in the news
"abortions are not taken away the question of abortions was put back to the states where is should have always been
abortion is not birth control"
abortion needs to be legal again its a womans body and her choice unless she has an abortion to spite someone like her husband or wife while we are on the topic circumcision should be made illegal his body his choice
blessed be
its about the total ban of abortion for me no exemptions is a fking joke
can we ban msnbc fox cnn the biggest virus is the media
see some people think that abortion is a religious thing and some believe its killing of a life but it still is a womans right now women have to walk around with dead bodies floating around inside of them this is not the old dark witch doctor days but it seems the right far right religious nuts want us to do everybody dont live by god every word
i am so ashamed to say i am a texan abbott cruz and crew are horrible human beings and even worse for texans
i registered to vote this year specifically for abortion i will be voting from now on
"what if we just remove government social programs that pay for womens contraceptive and reproductive health bills

 women want the government involved to pay their reproductive health bills but then they go around saying i dont want the government to touch my body its my choice
the biggest problem women face today is thier own stupidity and utter lack of perspective"
some will be happy that babies wont be killed some will be angry that babies wont be killed
15 percent of pregnancies end up in a miscarriage women have known this but legislators do not these bans will affect women choosing to get pregnant because the risks are too high
gop christofascists are the american taliban forcing women to give birth is just a start for them
womens rights being taken away are just the beginning the gop plans to take more rights away from many different groups the gop say the democrats want all your guns not true they only want to ban weapons of war being sold to 18 year olds
texas violation of the pregnancy act
when children lose their mother due to a complication during pregnancy i hope the fathers get worthwhile help from their pastors  jesus wanted your mom to die just doesnt seem that helpful
99 years  premeditated murder carries a life sentence usually only 1520 years depending on circumstances  these people are waaay out of line
where and when is the next march
we should either take away the penalty for doctors for making the wrong call or also put in a law that prosecutes doctors for delaying life saving treatment
america gives more rights to corpses than living women 
texas is terrible
this has worked just as well as banning alcohol or drugs complete and utter failure
"2 sides to everything  if the state can force a pregnancy they could one day force abortion  its already done in china  
the state shouldnt decide"
those who take life will answer to god all of this evil increase is just getting us closer to end times  jesus return
does this mean were gonna have organized groups that secretly provide adequate medical care for women similar to people that were supping up their cars to evade police for alcohol running and eventually become the first nascar drivers drug cartels in mexico the underground railroad
if they dnt want to have a baby they need to use a condom n they wont have to worry about having a baby just use a condom
democrats should use abortion booms banning and other things to get support from both side to win this midterm
"i am an example of women that morally had no right to have children zero 
my children would have become burden on the state"
its ridiculous that a corpse has more bodily autonomy rights than a living person
conservatives babies having babies thats hotstrokes m16
easy to pass laws    but the consequences    these right wingers are clueless
can a conservative please explain to me why you dont want to save a dying mother therefore her baby will also die im so confused or why you want a woman to die over an etopic pregnancy which is never viable
"the court that did this are bonkers causing extreme unnecessary suffering for an already vulnerable population
poor women  government is bonkers  anyone who enforces this persecution of women doctors police lawyers etc are guilty too"
sorry but if your going to make us wear a mask then screw you then the unborn deserves to be have life at anytime
i love to see the strength of women
the loudest group is almost never the most popular group this is why we all must vote and vote for the candidate or issue that you really support not just vote to be on the winning team the quiet dont need to necessarily protest in the street just actually exercise their vote
india is with republicans and trump protect the child 
by banning abortions they thought that it meant just stopping abortions now theyre seeing that its so much more than that
abortion is murderthank you almighty god that roe vs wade was finally overturned
vote the antiabortion jerks out
texas lul shes my cousin i seen her first go murica
why is nobody talking about not get pregnant in the first place other than extreme situations   the pill is free and there is the morning after pill
just wait til the people see the private water tanker hooked up to the jackson mississippi governors mansion while the 150000 people have no clean safe running water its way past time to eat the rich before its too late
fortunately none of these people were aborted and have lives and freedom to protest
abortions is murder the insides rights or dont get pregnant simple as that
people are welcome to move out of the state youre in to a place that is better for you im planning and preparing to leave mine already is it quick and easy no its not impossible
black is the dominant color lol if we as black men impregnate a bunch of white women i promise those white males will change the abortion law so fast your head will spin lol ill do my part 
america had a high maternal death rate before roe was overturned  now its just going to get higher  no one would be okay with being told sorry cant treat your failing kidneys until your kidneys have completely stopped functioning just go home and come back when theyve completely failed youll smell a rotting smell thatll make you gag  sepsis sorry the law told me i cant treat you until they are dead and rotting inside of you  so why are we okay with telling folks they gotta wait for their unviable childs heart to stop beating and come back once its actually dead inside of them when the child would have died shortly once labor starts or exit the womb anyway
why dont you stop the false narrative the supreme court handed it to the states and people to decide  fake news and the democrats and nuts are causing chaos and should be ashamed their doing it
yup babies get to live
if you cant trust me with a choice how can you trust me with a child 
this is similar to brexit a lot of people voted without really understanding how they would be affected then suddenly 
how can the united states hope to lead the world in important issues when they are busy fighting over problems that belong in the dark ages
the democrats were in power and they did not sought this out
shame on these lawmakers for not thinking of womens health and only thinking of their own selfish religious beliefs whatever happened to separation of church and state maybe we need to ban vasectomies and make it a felony for doctors who perform them i guarantee it would never happen because it involves men
they is the devil they know the world overpopulated but the devil wants a war
conservatives should be the first to complain against abortion restrictions since they dont want government to be involved in their lives as little as possible
"the republicans have created all of these problems that we are suffering from in our country right now they have done this to try to trick american voters into voting for republicans
every american voter needs to understand that democrats are not to blame for inflation high gas prices rising crime or any of the other problems the republicans are blaming them for
the republicans desperately want american voters to be totally distracted and confused about the absolutely most important things to vote on thats why republicans are doing this
just vote democrat all the way up and down the ballot in the midterms and in 2024 if you do this and the democrats control the country all our problems will start to go away trust this"
"heres the secret every single bill and law the republicans vote on is deliberately harmful to the american people in some way either directly or indirectly and this is not an accident
the republicans do not have any policy or any intention of ever helping the ordinary average american citizen the only way they can succeed is if they make democrats look bad
americans need to realize that the only people who actually care about you are the democrats you must have faith that the democrats are the good guys you need to vote democrat
the republicans want americans to think that the democrats are doing the wrong things so that american voters will vote for republicans this is the biggest mistake you will ever make"
oh i know this one its barbaric  thats what it means  there is a reason most of the world offers abortion one way or another  its because when you dont allow abortions to be performed  women die for no reason  we have the technology to save them and we arent using it based on the decision of a few judges that werent elected  they were appointed by a president who didnt win the popular vote  based on the preference of a minority of deranged religious fanatics  a loud caustic minority but still a minority
"women do you think it is time to take to show we have power now is the time to fight
this must be much bigger then my time of burning bras
we never kept it going equal pay for the same work
why is it these men feel they have the right to a womans health
who was the republican sob who wanted as part of a bill excluding age which would mean he could marry a child
if there is a god thank you for givi g wisdom to catch it expose him for the predator he is and what wanted fing children"
if its your body your choice then why were people being threatened to be fired from their jobs if they didnt get vaccinated its the principle of the matter my body my choice not to mention all the people who are dealing with the side effects of getting vaccinated they wont even publicize that our principles are not your body and its not your choice thats what we should stick to so too bad
im so glad we have put a stop to the wholesale slaughter of babies yeah i said it
002 tangent wow face filter much does she really think no one can tell shes using a face filter 
pretty sad when its better legally for a doctor to let a woman die or become maimed by her pregnancy than to help her and give her the care she needs to maintain her life and health
why arent obgyn doctors fleeing texas why arent pediatricians fleeing texas why arent women fleeing texas
they didnt ban abortion if dems hadnt promoted same day as birth abortions  then supream court wouldnt t have made that decision until ms turned it into genicidal murderof infants thats the reason they did this left it with states pluss pregnant teen sarearesultof leftist minoratracted persons
"about half of children in the united states 40 million are now insured through medicaid or the childrens health insurance program chip  the vast majority in medicaid 
54 of child support ordered by the courts goes unpaid so tax payers pick up the tab
we should put a human services dept on every corner there was an abortion clinic so women can enroll in all the entitlement programs possible in their state and federal programs 
every poor woman is entitled to wic welfare medicaid public housing free day care phones and internet"
so glad i dont live in the us what a joke
"abortion is a womans choice across the majority of the world
the us constitution has been amended 27 times and its easy to amend as abortion law
americans are like taliban men who pretend they can dictate what women should do land of freedom"
i am so confused 99 years for necessary health care while they fight for cops to have the right to murder can a republican please respond and explain to me why a potential life is so much more valuable than a living one
"nickson started a political war on drugs reagan made it a real war will laws clinton provided the prisons  and militarized police
 
politicians use abortion right for political gain nationalist made it a real issue states are providing laws and the same militarized police  

curious do history repeats itself"
"i grew up hearing horror stories about the aftermath of back ally abortions of doctors using the equivalent of a coat hanger to pop the placenta of women hemorrhaging and ultimately needing a hysterectomy in order to survive the fact that the country took away necessary medical procedures based on religious beliefs is an affront to the very constitution the freedom to believepractice a religion or even to not believe in religions 
the fact that only now people are realizing the toll that their close mindedness is  causing is as tragic as it is selfish"
choice is about letting the person have the freedom to choose  why are religious people so adamant about dictating over other peoples choices  you dont agree with abortion then you dont get one  but who gives you the right to determine another persons choice
this is really heartbreaking
yea we never asked for it the supreme court did it entirely against our will but go off
the simple solution to this would be to make americans who want to force women to give birth pay for the cost of raising those children medical bills food shelter and education should be paid solely by americans wanting to ban abortions take responsibility and put your money where your mouth is
let the voters decide women bodies are not to be controlled by   men telling them what can or cant do about their body whats next bare foot and pregnant it aint happening millions of women in  cant and wont be controlled like their puppets
these people have no idea what our bodies do
sanction every state with a total abortion ban no federal money no loans and no tax breaks for people in states with total bans
"yet every right wing seat has purgered
oh but pinks dont have laws only color people"
"elephant in the womb
vote for democracy 
vote blue"
you voted for trump knowing this is what he would do and now you are mad do better white voters
more vasectomies and women getting sterilization is the result of this supreme court decision
scotus didnt ban abortions  they overturned an unconstitutional ruling and reverted the decision back to the states where it belongs  if you dont like the laws in your state move to a state that more suits your desire to murder innocent humans
"every ahole is prolife until their preteen or teen daughter gets pregnant

unless prolifers want to pay child support for every orphan you might want to let financially burdened parents make their own decisions this is going to be a ton of kids depending on taxpayers to pay for them till 18"
"a lot of people were eligible to vote but chose not to in 2016 hillary clinton tried to warn us about trumpappointed judges overturning roe v wade  maybe these nonvoters thought she was being hysterical
please remember that youtube comments dont win elections make sure youre registered to vote  while you still have the right to vote
if youre tired of seeing red vote blue in 22"
i simply dont understand why women are allowed to vote in the usa
these people want to make sure their position is very clear the lives of women mean nothing to the white men who have control of all laws
wtf is the party of small government about taking legal control of other peoples uterus or telling people what books they cant read or how they have to pray
"only 69 days left to save democracy  magats make it a point to go vote their guys in  get up go vote your guys in or die at the hands of christian nationalists
dont kid yourselves people this is a defcon one to get out and vote to save the democracy or sit back like its 2016 to let the republiklans end democracy for us
i strongly suggest that each of you get everyone you know who can vote to get registeredverify youre not purged and exercise your right to vote if you still can
if revoking womens reproductive rights and restricting whos eligible votes wont be counted isnt enough of a wake up call to go vote all blue on ballots then what is"
yes people realize that murdering babies is evil
texas ag shouldnt be fighting emergency abortions
laws need to be clearer so that doctors know what they can and cannot do removing a dead fetus should be legal of course but banning abortion is still good
banning abortion with some exceptions is good policy enforce the law as a deterrent to reduce abortions keep your legs shut if you dont want a kid
anyone that is against abortion should have been aborted
most arrogantirresponsiblederangeddelusional step america has ever taken
ridiculous that politicians and insurance companies decide on what kind of care we will get
its obvious that the majority of americans prefer blah blah blah than actual social justice for all
just call abortion right guns rights
you want abortions allow fathers to have a right to deny paying child support it takes 2 to make a baby but you crazies only want the woman to have a say so why should you have 100 say so in killing an unborn child if the father wants that child thats not equality that you clowns scream you want
being forced to have children is more important than gas prices   the traditional birth control that contains estrogen strings the clitoris volume by half theyre castrated only the mini pills w only progesterone is the one that doesnt completely ruins women   this is not a male issue the fetus is not viable up to at least week 26 its not killed bc its not live yet take it out and the tissue has  no possibility in any way with all the money and medical help in the word to survive its not alive yet so this is only about controlling females women need their clithead rubbed to get off that does not take more than 5 min or longer than mensex education the angle of the dickrod need to rub the clithead while thrusting thats it we all get off and live happily ever after im just posting it here cause its like people dont know these  basic things in the us a law just passed forcing all men to have vasectomies that makes u feel a way that pain is what women are feeling now i am an md
the gop is an enemy of the people
lol see the power of inertial mass
the biggest unintended consequence is that doctors will choose to not go into obstetrics because of the insurance all of these babies pl is obsessed about will not have proper doctors and women will still get abortions because as long as you can get pills through the mail itll continue and you cannot stop it so all of this and youre not saving lives like you think
"the republican party is the party of no their only agenda is to defend a fascist criminal donald j trump  democrats put people first over party
its a no brainer people"
trump and the horrible justices he seated should be arrested because the agonies that they have initiated against women and their access to healthcare should be considered criminal
trumps  scotus made zygotes more important than women rapists have more rights   this is the what republicans believe vote democratic if you want any democracy left
its called life happens abortion means murder
"exactly that is what emergency care is an emergency is some thing that happens that must be treated or it could result in deformity lose of lame permanently damaged health or death 
normally if a woman is pregnant she has an obgyn if she comes into the ed her doctor would be notified because that doctor has already been to care for the woman until her child is born so it wouldnt be some unknownto the case ed doctor but her own doctor so it isnt like some women is just thrown to the wind well it might be if the woman wasnt getting prenatal care but that is different level of stupid 
people like the woman in this video who base their argument on hysterical emotionalism are no help to anyone"
women and girls in the usa are fkd
the hippocratic oath is more sacred than that of the bible
if you didnt see this coming you are truly ignorant if you are a woman and didnt see this coming you should be ashamed of yourself
this is fake news disinformation
"theres more supporters for access to abortion then there ever were for benedict donald

let that sink in"
too bad youre numbers are no where near what you claim you will lose just so you know now
land of the free lol
i completely support abortion even know you actually are killing a baby 
if youre a young woman in texas good luck
most voters are morons its a terrible idea to put such important policy in the commoners hands
ben franklin anonymously published the poor planters physician in virginia in 1727 it was a guide to living in the colonies without aid of doctors to treat a variety of things in it there is a section to treat the suppression of courses entry states that it was an affliction to mostly unmarried women and included a recipe for a treatment used by the greeks for contraception and termination where are the historians calling out these idiots using the founding against women
leave women alone and neuter these men
and these said people that are going to get voted for who are running for congress etc whats going to stop them from lying just like the supreme court justices
just another example of how the gop crazies hate women they hate everything that doesnt look like them walk like them talk like them or agree with them question i have is who died and made them think they are god i dont think any of these bible thumpers actually read the bible what happened to gods free will and isnt this between me and my judge god
texas should go independent  problem solved
public service announcement dont feed the bots in the comment section
i am sick of people trying to control womens rights
abortion is health care issue  if it were not for religious influence we would not be having a debate about it
yall think this will be expensive wait till the college bailout charges hit our wallets
"christine  most hateful group 

hate and discriminate anyone with a different view from theirs  they use the name of jesus to hate"
irresponsible abortion legislation will lead to the deaths of mothers the lengthened suffering of terminally underdeveloped infants increased number of children suffering in the foster care system and increased crime including murder abortion unlike murder is nothing but healthy for society and can only be painted as evil by arbitrary moral or religious arguments i dont really care about personal morals about abortion mothers should have a right to get an abortion just as much as mothers have a right to not get an abortion at the end of they day its the mother who has to live with any sins society bears no responsibility for her actions
"unfortunately as someone who lives in a country where abortion is illegal it is very hard to show actual evidence to those people who are fervently against it
they will celebrate when a woman dies in a backlash abortion they will demonize her and call her death justice
and as the many comments showed here they will deny the examples of women suffering from the repercutiam of these laws they will say those examples dont exist minimize it and say their suffering is justified

it is sad how good humans are to demonize and remove the humanity of actual living people those things are easy to do when you dont view women as humans anymore"
americas really going backwards and so many people are trying to fight forward towards a better future
we should start suing every politician that has voted for this
the world is laughing at you
am i glad i dont live in the us if it turns out that im incapable of carrying a baby to full term because im too sick i at least get to live and to adopt and care for all the babies and older children me and my partner want
it was such an insanely stupid and shortsighted decision to overturn roe
seperation of church and state self autonomy and revamp the supreme court
i feel like even women didnt really appreciate abortions until now based on what ive seen on social media and online this is probably the first bad thing to happen to them collectively in years theyve had a nice run and now people are starting to actually think about where all this is getting us low birth rates low marriage rates no one needs a man so why tf do i care they arent having babies with guys like me so why tf do i care
republicans are clowns they just like controlling people
just saying there was a reason why we okayed it in the 1970s a time when the nation was by admission of todays opponents of it was much more moral and grounded if even they knew it was something we needed to allow than why cant we figure it out we just have to see for ourselves and this is the problem with people who cant move forward they forget all the bad things of their glorified past
this backfired for the republicans beautifully
prohibition will always cause trouble
i dont know why anyone would listen to this old woman with purple hair
both sides are wrong on this abortion is not about cleaning a womans womb after a fetal death abortion is killing a fully functional baby in the womb it is asinine to say it is only the womans decision
i hate abortions but the fact is theyre necessary  what we will see happening more and more are dead or abandoned babies left in boxes garbage cans side of the road and in parks because people cannot provide for them  you think the cost of abortions were high just think of the cost of court cases will be and the cost of finding homes for these abandoned kids by the way god hates those who turn their backs on the needy
pro life people have created a religious tyranny  they never meant to help women with unwanted pregnancy  scotus is nothing but a religious extremist court  all gop and conservatives that voted for extremists laws banning abortions need to be voted out
i think the gop now stands for something like gruppen obersterfuhrer partei
it took 8weeks for all this to happen i
for every woman who dies from not be able to get care during a pregnancy where they could die from complications the governor of texas and those who banned abortion should all be held accountable and prosecuted for each death
there should always be an evidentiary test for any ban or law  it should be unconstitutional to take away any right without that  just as assault weapons bans have no basis in evidence to show effectiveness banning abortion has only emotional arguments it is utterly stupid to ban either   there are better solutions for both
abortion isnt banned you twits its just up to the states
poor women being forced to have unwanted children is going to lead to a huge increase in the crime rate in red states fifteen years from now
kudos to corporations like walmart that are providing transportation and time off to its employees seeking abortions
the president this country elected put justices in the supreme court and now they dont like what theyve done oopsie
shes talking about extremism  these clowns are so unhappy they cant go on killing babies boo hoo  i guess they dont call killing babies extreme just another sign of the degradation of our country and all the values it holds dear ill bet when their children get married and then get pregnant they dont hold fetus showers but i wonder why not after all its just a clump of cells they should hold clump of cells parties for the unborn 
"all the cope in the comment section because women cant sleep with deranged drug dealing psychopaths and murderous godless degenerates anymore without true consequence

who would have thought holding women accountable for who they sleep with would bring so many tears lmao lets go brandon"
trump  stopped hillary clinton from becoming a usa presidenttrump  gave us   3  excellent supreme court judges  in one term 
all this because a bunch of delusional cultists have convinced themselves that zygotes are people
im a religiouly conserative person but i dont agree with this at all  these people are forcing their religious beliefs on others  i am happy to resectfully explain why someone should not end a life and the biblical reasons for it  if they dont agree thats up to them and their conscience  but i dont feel like forcing it on someone without there consent is right at all   what if the reverse was true  what if they ban religion because they did not agree with it  forcing them to be secular how would these people feel then  god is our judge not humans  stay out of other peoples lives if they dont want you there
"dont let these republicans make you women into a handmaid  that is what the supreme court see you as just a baby factory and not a human

remember remember november roevember"
regardless of how you feel about abortion the bottom line is if youre not the one who is pregnant then its none of your business its that simple if youre against abortion for what ever reason then dont get a abortion  vote in november
the government needs to differentiate  between an abortion and a life threatening circumstance getting treatment if the mother or baby would 100 die or if the baby is already dead is not an abortion and these lawmakers need to guarantee that right to health care other then that specific circumstance then yes ban all abortion
get out of texas now younger women leave while you can
vote blue  stay safe
i can hardly believe how stupid americans are even if i support the ideology i cant possibly think that the law with no exception is ok they will rather let their women die then end their pregnancyif a woman is dead the child in her womb is also dead makes no sense whatsoever this is insane situation no exception to protect the health and life of the women sounds like a dystopian novel coming true
prolifers who care for the unborn while hating people who breathe
crazy religious zealots have caused this ban on abortion to happen religion  poisons everything you have to be really stupid to let religion  guide any decision
these laws about medical necessity are so vague medical practitioners are delaying lifesaving medical care because they dont want to risk going to prison for life poor women are disproportionately affected by these laws this is despicable and there are likely dictatorships that have more sensible abortion policies
or why idealism is moronic
if no one goes out and votes then the right doesnt care keep that in mind
republicans will now have to provide provide healthcare provide whatever it takes to raise a child provide for what the father refuses to do provide for the ignorance and disdain republicans have for their fellow americans thats going to take a lot of money states wont have republicans really know how to screw up their own country theres nothing like it you can see in other advanced and industrialized countries us conservatives are the worst curse that has ever happened to this country
"supreme court needs to put back roe v wade
and not take any rulings already decided by past justices away by overturning them
these rulings were fought for and fairly won and they should  not be in jeopardy based on some minority group with a personal ideology or political agenda of their own

government can not run properly if laws are constantly going to be at the wim of whos in that office or position at another time

you cant have laws of one minute its legal then another min its not then another min its back legal again

how can citizens be held accountable to the laws if they dont even know whether its legal or illegal based on constant change of it"
its hard for me understand how other women going along with this abortions laws
who knows next theyll be wanting to bring back coporal punishment in the schools oh
"scotus didnt ban abortion if your state did take it up at the state level
havent women ever heard of birth control"
pro life unless your an actual living woman
america got what it deserved when it put special interests above the people its easy to blame republicans but democrats are just as much to blame lunatic trump would have been cast aside like the joke he is if his opponent wasnt hillary clinton this stupid choice doomed the country
"remind republicans of this error years later 
hey remember that failed experiment where you banned abortion in red states and it had dumb consequences"
abortion is a lifealtering event that will affect a woman for the rest of her life whether she has one or not she will have to live the consequences all of her life i would not want to trust a politician to make such a decision for me i am quite capable of making my own decisions thank you very much perhaps the voters need to elect new state legislators who will accept the advice of a licensed trained physician rather than some fascist who wants to take away a womans right to direct her own life
there is no reason women should not have power over their body especially how society says men can treat them
abortion is killing a human alive baby in the womb
republicans are out in force out voting the democratic party we saw this in the primaries where the majority of trump supporting candidates won if we want to see a change democrats have to get their butts out there and vote i just dont know if they will
enough out in the streets to fight maga civil war  lock him up lock him up
"nah it hasnt even come close to showing the true ramifications of these bans  wait about 26 years when all those forced kids are now taking moms out of employment because they cant find or afford child care  wait for the social safety nets to really strain at the seams for welfare snap wic subsidized housing smart start school free lunch and health care  wait for obgyns to flee states where bans are in place and women who want to have babies cant find doctors to deliver them  wait until those forced birth kids become school age and everyones taxes go way up to provide for their education 

most of us never wanted to see huge numbers of abortions  but there are much better ways to fix the problem  this is nothing but a final failure in a long list of failures"
the women in federal state and local government as well as the supreme court judges that implemented this nonsense threw half the population under the bus
umm we already knew what criminalizing abortion does  it kills women who most often are already mothers leaves children without their mom and families without a loved one have we so quickly forgotten the image of the young mother killed by her married lover when he tried to play surgeon in a motel room and left her to die alone as she bled out ms magazine published that photo
these male lawmakers really havent thought this thru  pretty soon some of them will be in a disastrous loselose situation  how long before one of their daughters has a life threatening pregnancy  it already sounds like a woman has to be in great jeopardy for a hospital to treat her  if that happens to a lawmaker they have two terrible choices  run the risk of using your influence to run interference contrary to the laws and risk having the press find out or having your daughter die  in the first scenario the daughter will be inundated by the press and all those families who lost their daughters in that circumstance  in the second she will lose her life  you can bet in both scenarios that he will be cast out of his family by his wife and all the other women in his life his political career will be over bc he will either cause a huge firestorm by being a hypocrite or he will be the guy who let his daughter die  chew on that
"i mean theyd be about 40 years too late but isent it about time for all those ammosexuals to put up or shut up
if youre saying we need to complete deregulate firearms because our government might become too oppressive and remove rights youre late on address this but now would be the time to act on what youre saying right  just a thought"
the republicans go on and on about how the democrats are responsible for inflation they arent  but whats more inflationary than having a child you didnt plan for and cannot afford how does that compare to gas being over 4gallon
maybe how about thisuntil this all gets settled maybe women for once should stop getting pregnant all the time when they arent planning a familyyou know you can act like an adultits not like you cant control just how you spread your legs
this is why bernie sanders needed to win the election
the desire the will the goal is to never have a loss of life before its natural fait but reality is that we as humans have not evolved to that point as yet and as unfeeling as it may appear abortions come under that category you have to look at the human condition as a whole you cannot separate abortions into a different category politicians have twisted and used abortion purely as a political tool the day we evolve and there are no more unnecessary loss of life is the day when we dont have to bring laws to stop abortions that day will happen but not as yet
first off no uterus no say so oh yes secondly thirdly etc

yea but the federal constitution never protected access to abortion and thats why it was struck down if people want abortion access protected then they need to lean on their lawmakers to create laws to protect it this issue is not and never was a constitutional matter
remember  voters  your vote only counts if you use it
its just stupidity to punish the doctor or women for having a medical emergency to save her life this is inhuman
please vote democrat and dont abandon the women like me in louisiana and other states
all those paid protestors  now i can see where the ukraine money is going
watching this from europe is just painful i really hope that people wake up and show those religious bigots the middle finger and while the backlash lasts first make sure personal rights get protected by law and then fix your godawful voting system
mandatory vasectomies  stop abortion at the source
texas is ran by bible thumpers
women stop sleeping with losers  you abort when they dont want you andor the baby  use your power make choices before he dumps on you
there are so many children already in the system eg foster care and so many children already that are in homes where they are unwanted and often abusedit boggles my mind to see how this will be exacerbated thats who i think of  the children who arent in homes where they are loved and wanted i dont think of the people who are pushing their own agenda and telling women i care about you do they really im wondering if they care about anyone but themselves theyre clueless about whats going on in the world around them and most likely have never had to work with an abused or neglected child its heart wrenching lets actually care about each other
"99 years in prison
that is ridiculous and republicans need to go "
this guy really asked for the silver lining
murdering an infant should not be allowed
blacklist season 7 episode 7
yall are so dramatic and nonsensical medical procedures are not your right they were developedinvented and now its simply discontinued
their is a path forward for women and that is voting you have to ask yourself if your a republicans democratic independent or a child of god and your body is yours  vote
man those guys in texas are extreme were impressed the taliban
all due to the uss own taliban
i was horrified when roe was over turned  abortion wont go away it will go under ground and women will die like they did prior to the 1970s  women are now suffering because doctors are no longer allowed to logical calls  the supreme court has made women second class citizens
banning abortion would create more maga republicans so of course the right wants to put a stop to it
if i was in charge  i wouldnt have allowed travel for an abortion make those people in states with illegal abortion vote the elected officials out if you elect those people you should have to live by their rules
think of all those babies saved
shame on all mother effing republicans
so much bad information on this video do your own research abortion is illegal in texas treatment for miscarriages  ectopic pregnancies are not illegal in texas the confusion comes from the doctors
"id be curious to know what plans are being made to care for all the unwanted babies that will be born next year
are the antiabortion states prepared to house feed  give the babies medical care for years to come
noone seems to be addressing that issue"
"technology changed in the blink of an eye
yet her legs are stil up in the sky
while the nurse tells her to 
slide down lower
and the doctor holds his 
vacuum like its a damned hoover

it takes a seed and his came by the thousands and its her who they want to send to prison because shes free
but not really and its her body but not really
so she cant drive and she cant vote and high schools feels like a damned joke
but here shes got a doctors note
and she is holding her doll
with her belly starts to poke

its not your fault baby girl
and it shouldnt be your burden to carry
when his sentence is to force you to marry
 your abuser and the state
will accuse her
 because its her body
but not really and its her right 
dont be petty
 when his seed comes by the thousand and he still gets to walk freely

she watches witch burnings on tv
and she hides in the alley not wanting to be seen
a hanger in one hand and a needle in the other
shes not ready to be anyones mother
and its her life but not really
its her body dont be petty
he held her down like so many others
its his seed one in thousands
must she die to save her child
who will care for the millions
he walks the street feeling cocky
claims his innocent like its his destiny

he walks into the office he claims his seat at the table
he lives his life like cane met able
its his seed one in thousands
he feels no shame and no restraint

so who is trapped in this economy
when all the world loves new technology
should she bear societys hypocracy
when its her body but not really"
america is going in the wrong direction after abortion ban
vote blue in november  so we can codify  roe v wade
as per your headline the real meaning is that innocent babies will be born and not murdered in the meantime keep your pants zipped guys and your legs crossed gals it has worked for centuries
understand this the bible is a fictional bookfictional everyone has a right to turn to which ever faith they so choose if they choose to but it has no place in the rules of modern society if the bible was used to make laws a father would be allowed to murder his children if they dishonored him and if his wife cheated on him or disrespected him she could be stoned to death or murdered by her husband these are not concepts that should be applied to laws and rights of a modern society not to mention that in this country we have freedom of religion which means that the ideas in the bible are not the beliefs of the majority of people on this earth theyre not even the majority of people in this country that book of childrens stories does not mean you get to tell every single woman what she can and cannot do with her body or allow her to die because you miss read or misinterpreted a fictional story to suit your own needs if you think that an abortion goes against the teachings of the bible and goes against god then dont fking get one that is where your contribution to your faith begins and ends keep it in church and not in our hospitals or our courts oh every bible thumper is as bad as every other religious extremist thats why theyre called beliefs because you choose to believe that they have no place in a modern society
its not banning abortion its taking rights away thats what it is and sensible americans do not want a political party that is living in the dark ages to be in power
what ever happened to using ways to prevent pregnancywhy are there so many unwanted pregnancy happening
another consequence of the abortion ban is all the unwanted babies who will be born  and an increase in the number of people on welfare  and they will mostly be minorities which the pro life people hate so they should have thought this through more clearly
so they are banning abortion on a state and federal level but dont medical students learn how to perform a dnc in the case of a miscarriage if the procedure is taught it is for a reason and im going to assume that reason is to preserve vital lifewhat the federal government needs to concern themselves with is the homeless pandemic hunger pandemic gasoline pandemic social media pandemic because covid blew the lid off of the real issues that arent being dealt with and making abortion illegal isnt going to solve homelessness hunger or any of the other thousands of issues this country has banning abortion but doing nothing about the foster care system in place in americai mean make it make sense
they didnt ban abortion  the sc made the logical decision that abortion was not in the constitution and sent it back to the states
that 56 number does not say what about abortion will be an important factor  ill vote for anyone who will promise to make abortion legal and i will vote for anyone who will make sure abortion keeps being illegal both trigger that abortion will be an important factor the 56 number means nothing
i see this as a problem of politicians letting their feelings determine their policies  religion and state are supposed to be separate right  so why do we let all these political leaders stand on religious platforms and not call them out on it  religious zealotry should be something that makes it harder for you to become a politician not easier
teach your children empathy folks
"so what

stop killing children

is that sinking in yet"
the supreme court is going down the donald trump road of crimes with trump in office there wont a need for a supreme court
this has nothing to do with ethics of abortion never did this is goverment enforced breeding and mandatory delivery laws as well as direct assault on peoples medical safety regardless of the aspect of pregnancy alone its yet another decision over peoples lives actual existing living people it will hurt wanted pregnancies and the safety of the wanted children and especially mothers way more than it will ever restrict the alleged harm of abortion itself once again america if you keep telling yourself you are the leaders of the free world start leading in example and not showing the rest of us the worst case scenario alternatively mandatory vasectomies could be beneficial in the meantime at least just an idea since youre making peoples medical decision for them now
women of america you outnumber men  if every women voted for abortion rights it would be a slam dunk especially when there is a large number of men who agree use your vote to vote for your rights 
just stop no one is buying the bs we know when an abortion is right and when it is wrong stop playing games you trying to make it so that everyone can do it for no reason other than i dont want too 
america is going back to a neanderthal age
i guess i need to avoid having a kid and putting my wife at risk this is sad and i live in texas
im a 73 year old catholic abortion would not be my choice if it wasnt a necessary pregnancy  that being said each and every person  situation are different and no one  should be told what to do  that decision is between the woman her doctor and her creator
biology is way messier than the average ignorant christian thinks in their heads every spermegg results in a perfect baby
"expontaneaus miscarriage is not same as abortion a miscarriage as painful as it is you are not going to bleed to dye in most of the cases thank god now drs have to explain why the miscarriage occurs or if was poison
abortion is not a woman family planing thing but very irresponsable medical options if it is abortion is destructivemutilating killingagainst humanityspecie dreamsfuture etc"
wonder if abbot would send along some women wanting or needing abortions with his migrant busses
to samual flores for some reason i am being blocked from responding directly to you start with exodus 22 god ordered the sacrifice of every firstborn male child as well as the firstborn of every clean animal the firstborn human could be redeemed by replacing the baby with a lamb or by the payment of 5 shekels to a priest that is why jesus is called the lamb of god because he redeemed the sins of man by his sacrifice there are a few verses dealing with this god also said that humans were no better than the beasts of the field just more arrogant
monsters cant control us woman we are not animals nor their slaves
gop were projecting bigly when they complained about obamas imaginary death panels
"america is now in decline due to the combination of half the population being uneducated as well as religious zealots a perfect storm 

for years republicans have chipped away not only on abortion rights but also democracy itself and now youre seeing those factors come to fruition effecting americas standing as a whole hence the us is in decline its turning into gilead from the handmaids tale"
ladies you need to vote these creatures out of existence or they will just keep coming back and youll have to deal with them again give the democrats the numbers they need to put roe v wade into law everyone needs to vote they need to win the house and senate with enough seats to get things done
why do americans  die  when the republican talaban is in charge
banning abortions is so dangerousso many things could go wrong
as someone who saw the abortion stories in the news in the 70s im expecting we will see a lot more stories given social media
none of the men involved in passing those laws have mothers daughters or wives they love clearly disgusting
as the old saying goes people tend to not appreciate what they have until its gone
its so stupid  women will get abortions  abortion in our state is protected by the law in our state  women are travelling here to get abortions  there is more to terminating a pregnancy than an unwanted one  so many medical reasons
the same people who melt down at the thought of governmentmandated vaccines and masks that save lives want governmentmandated pregnancies births and maternal deaths go figure seriously folkslets teach empathy especially to republicans
i dont want to hear any republicans complain about this
dark brandon will abort the republican agenda
anti abortion is a terrific way to make sure the poor get poorer and the people who are anti abortion are the same people who want to end social security ssdi and other means of helping people to thrive dictators know that if a population has to struggle to put food on the table a roof over their head and clothes on their backs they wont have enough energy to protest the regime thats in power north korea is a great example of this
a bunch of baby killers repent
"you know who else wants more children russia 

women should do whatever they want"
you have the right to choose what you want to do with your body but that baby inside you doesnt have the right to live cuz the baby cant talk on cam neither protest on the road
"republicans on covid my body no vaccine not mask
republicans on abortions not your body not your descision"
this is what happens when you awaken the sleeping giant the sideline voter
imagine the irony of the women who supported these laws dying from miscarriages because they cant get medical help
i think the reason this is an issue is because people think its murder  its not about womens rights  there is no consensus on when life begins and those for abortion feel life doesnt begin until the fetus can survive outside the womb  those against abortion feel life begins at conception  you have to resolve that before there is a chance at resolving this whole issue  not that it will really  but if there is law that states life doesnt begin until blank there will always be this stance
well lets hope this inspires the democrats 
why am i not allowed to post in comments
i dont think its the act of abortion per se it is the government telling women what they can do and not do with their own bodies
lol you elected these old azz rapists eat that pie
well the good news is getting dragged into a global war will bring yalls domestic focus on such nonsense as abortion issue into appropriate priority im sure the russiachinairan alliance is enjoying the destruction from within the us makes their takeover of the western world so much easier and they wont give a rats a what pronoun you prefer in the encampments either
i am 78 yrs old and dont like even thinking about abortion but it is a womans private life  its a womans decision to make  if you dont like abortion then dont get one  what others do is none of our business
the republican politicos that pushed the antiabortion movement in the first place never took prolife rhetoric all that seriously as we are seeing abortion in the us still exists and is available if you are willing or able to pay for it   it was all about dividing the working class vote
all the protesters that know one wants to have children with
taking away womens rights and endangering womens and girls lives is not democracy or american this is fascism it must be stopped
republicans already lost the november vote with women coming to vote in masses
the abortion is murder rhetoric is a red herring i dont care if the fetus is curing cancer or writing poetry it doesnt get to use anothers body without their permission in the same way you dont get to take my kidney just because you need one
this is what fascism looks like texas is controlled by fascist the gop has become a fascist dictatorship cult  maga domestic terrorist
abortion is not murder a fetus is not a person its just a blob of cells a fetus is not worthy of having rights since its not sentient nor does it have emotions
from the outside  its hard to feel sorry for american women when they vote radical conservative policies they have a choice elections have consequences hows that working for you
its abysmal that rule of law and democracy in the usa have become fragile and vulnerable as they are under attacks by domestic terrorists in the shape and form of the socalled republican party the world is watching the syndromes of the american experiment degenerating into chaos anarchy and threats unleashed by fascist elements against democratic and federal government institutions and public civil servants within the usa the rot and stench of a republican party turned fascist is there for all to see the orwellian spectacle is ominous the world is watching gibbons decline of the west
none of your business its a womans body her choice period
it is really about women getting access to reproductive health care republicans dont seem to care about health care services funny how republicans are not emphasing changing abortion laws
how did the supreme court get taken over by the american taliban
get out and vote period
"all baby killers or anyone that facilitates the murder of a baby should get the death penalty
eye for an eye"
oh now people are seeing what happens when women cant abort people sure dont like to remember the past huh like its in textbooks and even on the internet how it was in the early 90s for women who had unwanteddangerous pregnancies
"greg abbott and other governors are taking medical decisions without medical licenses whats the consequence of that can anyone practice medicine without license and with no medical schooling and training

i dont understand why there even needs to be a law for or against abortion its a medical decision that a person and their doctor make and under hippa they have the right to keep that private its no one elses business period
can we sell texas to mexico then they wouldnt have to waste money on a wall
unfortunately there is a population shortage crisis happening this could be the governments decision to grow the population unfortunately ive always been against abortion  thats my moral decision i understand emergencies also believe women can choose what they want done within their bodies god will decide in the end who to address
well at least we can sell our nuclear codes to russia thats really all that matters who cares about women when we can sell our nations security
maga reps vote for us and you will never have to choose again
the states that have banned abortion and made draconian laws have made it very risky for any obgyn to practice in their state when women on either side of this issue are no longer able to find a doctor willing to manage their pregnancy it will be too late obgyns will have moved to a safer state for them to practice and no political posturing rhetoric or finger pointing will change the fact that their state is no longer a safe place to live for women and girls of childbearing age which i feel theyve already done politicians have zero business making medical decisions or imposing religious beliefs on the citizens of their state
lets hope the logic and intelligent people understand to vote out the republicans everywhere there is nothing more damaging for a country than to have a trump as president he brings ununderstandable fear among his party members he makes them behave like headless puppies like hitler he has the power to blind the least gifted and poorest among the people he has created his own ss the oath keepers are his troops leaders when trump lies that the election was stolen they believe him and storm the capitol end of story trump has tried to destroy democracy in so many ways send him to jail today use the document story if needed but for me his talk after losing the election and before the storming of the capitol is in its selfevidence enough to put this dev behind bars until he dies
as a canadian the rest of the world is losing all respect for the united states
imagine if the government stepped in and decided what men can and cant do with their reproductive organs
long live babies
this is a consequence of religion
women have had control over their bodies for millennia we dont need roe or any mans laws we will control our own reproduction regardless abortion will continue because womens lives depend on it dont like it ts
whats next will they find a loophole to eliminate our right to vote  are women going to lose the right to own property  will we once again become enslaved to others  these are all legitimate questions i am willing to die to prevent this from ever happening again i only wish there are others willing to stand with me its time to fight for our rights before they take them all away
give us back our right to choose
never forget that the democrats want to murder babies  even after birth  theyve said so  remember that extremism when you go to the ballot box
some people care but most of the republicans dont give an f about anyone but themselves  and only know suffering when it effects them personally
funny how im being censored on here a bunch of baby killers
americans rave on about being active in fighting for their rights and how politically aware they are but that is all bs they dont have a clue while they vote republican their rights will reduce if you want more rights vote in democrats into every post stop banning and burning books stop using godfilla to fill holes in your knowledge check your beliefs your word definitions and demand proof of whatever people claim to be facts if you had checked trumps claims you would have found nearly all of it was bs
we need to rise up and get rid of the fascists in our government who are out here making insane decisions replace the entire house and senate
remove them from office no more im sick of this obscurantism
women want to roll the dice as many times as they like without ever losing and want patted on the back when they are finally satisfiedyou dont deserve a pat on the back what you deserve google wont allow me to sayits very similar to what those babies you like to call mistakes experienced difference is you will have earned it
they will never starve they will eat  each other
smart people will not risk a pregnancy republicans you have stop population growth in america
baby killers take all the respect or reverence away from good mothers
so i just have one question how come you all make this about the womans right to choose to end the pregnancy or not then these same people turn around and say that you have no choice whether or not to take a vaccine or not take the shot and shut up if you dont you are shamed and ridiculed for making the obvious and right decision
i didnt realise the gop took their public health policy from the taliban
doctors need to stop providing medical services to republican elected officials
republicans are the bane of humanity
too bad they werent aborted so ironic
roe roe roe your vote blue no republican vote until they understand who is in command we the people
prochoice is the only choice in the us the democrats are the real prochoice party vote blue in 2022
dropping roe was literally the worst thing republicans could have done and now theyre trying to bring back assaulting children in schools with bats  way to really fire up your opponents ya morons
what makes the people banning abortion any different than serial killers whose motives is because they hate women and want to remove as many people as possible from voting
just ignore all those ignorant people who believe a fetus is a baby 10 week old fetus is only 13 centimeters long call that a baby again lol put that fetus in someones food and they wont even notice it
they want to protect all life so they will let the women die forced birth is not protecting life these laws must be changed and given back to the doctors and the women involved this gop insanity must end before more women girls or even ten year old children die criminalizing pregnancy is not protecting life what is wrong with these people who voted to do this
the gop is a cult enough said
well its hard to see or hear  the people who got aborted
no bans on ar15s or abortions
the desire the will the goal is to never have another abortion the same goes for any other loss of life but we dont live in a perfect world and death occurs all around us therefore abortions are required the same as executions and wars are required you cannot have it both ways to pick on women this way is wrong when the fault lies with all of us in this iimperfect world
one dumb country 
this is why you commentators will never know power
ironically it will be conservative women who will ultimately return us to some level of sanity with regard to abortion and bodily autonomy bit by the predictable consequences of their own rhetoric its already happening
well then men should not be allowed to be treated for  prostate cancer or erectile dysfunctions
we hold these truths to be self evident except for defenseless unborns
vote vote vote for life not the insane
this is mid evil torture to have lawmakers change laws when we the people are going to work and are paying taxes stop trying to get us to believe in a fake false illusion this is absolutely absurd and barbaric to deny tax payer their rights is disgraceful distasteful unconstitutional inhumane and unacceptable
there is no changing the supreme courts mind a crisis situation is a very small percentage of abortions north carolina will be put in its place  she is lying through her teeth and he doesnt care
we need to be vigilant in everything there not gonna stop there theyre gonna strip people from every facet of their rights while still calling this country the greatest country where your free and have opportunities i wonder when well decide to just say enough is enough theyre pushing and pushing and eventually everything is going to go belly up at some point control seems to be the objective there are too many laws within bylaws to even keep up with that im sure people are breaking them without even knowing
you can aways see the baby murders in politics  just listen to this old bag
remember that when there is a new law put to a vote that limits your right  and when  others dont like or feel the need for that right theyll vote against you and pretty soon everyone is going to loose their freedom really think it throu 
just like when they tried to ban alcohol prohibition
come to california and we will happily get rid of your bad choices you can take monkey pox back for free
the republican leaders dont care how many women and girls they hurt or take the lives of with this they need to be voted out
religion should play no part in politics it does nothing but cause harm religious people should never push their religion on other people what about those women that dont believe in your god why should they not get to choose
"how effing political for the liberal media to leave out the following

embryo  an unborn or unhatched offspring in the process of development in particular a human offspring during the period from approximately the second to the eighth week after fertilization after which it is usually termed a fetus

fetus  an offspring of a human or other mammal in the stages of prenatal development that follow the embryo stage in humans taken as beginning eight weeks after conception"
indiana didnt get a chance to vote  our supposed lawmakers voted for us  at least they had the grace not to claim it was the will of the people  they know that if they had given the voters choice it would have been another kansas or even a greater margin for freedom of choice  i woulod tell you what i think of our lawmakers but youtube would block the comment
didnt god destroy sodom and gomora according to christians how many innocent fetuses died in that little operation in fact if you believe that event then what about the flood how many innocent fetuss died in that world event god wasnt worried too much about that was he  i can start hearing the double standards or host of other weird logic ready to burst
better wake up white republican women you sat quietly while your men has  screwed over every one else now its your turn how does it feel he wants you bare foot and pregnant with a house full of kids so he can feel superior and not become a minority in this country
antiabortionists always wanted people to die
funny the ones screaming loudest about abortion are the ones least likely to get pregnant
crusty old white men who know absolutely nothing about a being a woman b being pregnant c giving birth d caring for a child yet these crusty old dinosaurs are making laws on all these issues which they know absolutely nothing about absolutely mind boggling
its going to require a constitutional amendment to set this straight once and for all
the republicans are about to reap the whirlwind serves them right
i never thought we would see taliban mentality take a hold of the largest democratic nation in the world america is no longer a democracy old white republican males will have women in burkhas next christians and wealthy people are self centred people
these people make it sound that every woman that gets pregnant will want to abort it and if their state bans abortion maybe they should be looking at less invasive forms of contraception than ripping a baby from their womb because they couldnt control their sexuality
"we are going to see increasing instances of girls and women dying from pregnancy complications because doctors and health care systems in general are too afraid of or too hamstrung by antiabortion laws to provide timely care
you know just like we did before roe v wades decision we have completely forgotten the horrible things that just suddenly didnt happen anymore once the decision to terminate a pregnancy became the domain of the pregnant person and their team of medical professionals"
"a dead corpse has more rights 
you can not use any parts of the body of a newly deceased corpse to help another person stay alive without strict legal permission  given predeath organ donor permission  from that now dead corpse
so a dead corpse has more say over what happens to their body then a women does"
pregnant women need to move out of state until they give birth or they might die  even cats die giving birth   it is not simple  men are stupid idiots   women need to be in office to protect pregnant women from death
give it time republicans will start blaming democrats for not stopping them when they republicans started stripping rights away they will never accept responsibility for their bad decisions
"these laws these abortion laws and the penalties are unreasonable unwanted and unconstitutional to even be on the books they should immediately be expunged never to be repeated again and automatically we ought to put roe v wade back into effect and make it a law proactively 
the supreme court is fixed it is a primarily conservative supreme court and thats not fair and i think that rovie wage will be overturned in time but im im really starting to think that these republicans need to be taken out of office and never be allowed to go back in"
this is why the fascists dont want us voting when we vote we negate their agenda
women need to change this in november do they have power or not lets see if they listen to old white men or if they call their own shots
okay you can still get abortions its up to your state okay nobody is going to ban abortions its just theyre saying you cant have an abortion when the baby is fully developed and if you think thats okay then you were inhuman
the usa is a nation of religious violence no wonder christian usa created islamic fascism they are one and the same
lives to be lost that will never be conceived because getting pregnant is too scary now
some extreme legislators what to impose travel bands on their citizens trying to control what their citizens may do in other states  insanity
"i love all the comments about vote or vote blue etc good luck with that
no amount of voting blue will change the discourse in the us it wont get the church out of your life or out of your body
not when theres political hay to be made by subjecting the masses to such inhuman conditions 
if only there was some other option besides r or d but its a 2 party system both full to the brim with people that are the same age old the same color and basically the same insane views heres a shocker for ya none of them care about you at all at most you are simply a vote in their eyes
cant we all just enjoy the descent into decline"
im glad i live in the uk where for now sanity prevails and abortion is easily attained
if 1 shoots and kills a pregnant woman double murder even if she had an abortion scheduled for later that day  sup with that
yes their androgynous god moloch is displeased and demands the infant sacrifices continue
register and vote ladies register and vote vote vote fantastic that women will be the ones who finally squash the arrogant overreaching authoritarian gop
it seems that the texas taliban cares more about their ideology than womens lives
keep in mind that this is about power keeping women pregnant when they are not doing well or dont want to be pregnant should be up to her vote vote for womens rights
our abortion is more liberal than china or europe you talk about abortion like its some walk in the park  its a mom sitting in a bed with strangers that come in and remove a baby now people are fine with doing it late term or after i see society just wants conveniences rather than morality the fear of god is no longer in style its selfish society that terms their own rules whats next  msnbc you are so wreched god will and is protecting these children he has stepped in bc he heard the blood that is crying out for justice moms that have abortions dont walk out and have an ice cream afterwards if they do then their conscience is seared
i was born in soviet union usa is quickly becoming like soviet union there was provision is criminal code due to which nontraditional sexual orientation was punishable by 5 years in prison i had been arrested there for being autistic usa is getting there when it does i will leave i do not need another soviet union experience those republicans that shame communists are communists
should be banned killing babies is not a good thing personal responsibility is a good thing
"surely every thinking human being is anti abortion
no young woman or their mother ever sets a goal to have x number of abortions 
by the age of 30"
i find it ironic those who support abortion are already born 
women will vote republicans out  roman emperors each and every one
america are always shouting about free speech free will a women should be able to do whatever she wants with her body i mean this is going mental their are over 100 genderssupposed now the world has gone mad im just happy in ma wee house in beautiful scotland 
love that this woman is filing lawsuits on behalf of womens healthcare in abortion women are being treated like we are controlled by the taliban
this is all a bunch of manure and riddled with lies anything to protect sexual immorality  
roevember is coming and its going to be huge
ooh jesus look at all those baby killers
january 6 the supreme court why not youll be patriots according to gopers
i agree it should be your choice to opt out of pregnancy whether its for personal reasons or medical reasonsyour life not mine who am i to judge i can only make my own choices not others but i dont get that option because im a male whose opinion doesnt count just like every male in this debate because ladies made it clear its thier body the only thing i can do is make sure my dna stays in my body lest someone besides myself uses it against me
one good thing about trump is that he exposed how stupid the republican party really is
judges made it dangerous to get pregnant or be pregnant good way to slow population growth then destroy social security because less people paying towards it i see that shell game  they also harmeddestroyed privacy rights doctors oath and safe practices hippa law besides destroying constitutional rights and womens rightsall in  one judgement call by rogue judges builds authoritarian culture and also races a 2 party system towards anarchy they all need to be charged treason and obstructing our constitution
things could happenget rid of those judges  now lock them up for harming women they lost credibility they are dangerous and biased and merging religious belief and destroying rights cant wait until they decide to destroy more rights
its not to early to get stickers yard signs and tshirts for november that read roe roe roe your vote  get that message out in every community
we need to execute all these right wing terrorists trying to destroy the country
all that is forced into having the baby should just give it to the state once the state gets the thousands of babies they will figure out its to expensive to raise these kids until they are 18 then they may change their minds
as meidas touch tshirts say roe roe roe your vote
abortion is just the present day prohibition pushed by religious people to try to make society better and more moral what they dont seem to realize is that it will play out exactly like prohibition people going to jail being killed cartels that control the product will rise and thrive everything except actually getting rid of the product they are seeking to ban
if texas were to jail all the doctors and women that they want to jail it wouldnt work too well  for varied reasons
its not just about abortion its personal freedom without big brother intervening
theres a procedure that is used post abortion but also stops bleeding dr will let u bleed bc they fear the procedure being reported as an abortion that means sepsis death or blood need banning birth control also is an issue ppl use b control as a meds to cut pain due to other med cond
we particularly dont want old saggy white men telling us how to run our personal health rights
meanwhile in the country that officially hates women 
thats good no more murder of babies
it means whores are out in droves
if you call your self a christian you must be mad to be among this woman
so the children of god is among this woman that is absolutely madness
what it really means is far less babies being murdered by their mothers end of story
dont forget to sign the petition to impeach clarence thomas
when all this happened i really didnt have any input one way or another i could have never conceived the notion this could effect me or my love ones i have a young family member who is married and they were trying to conceivethey did and we as a family were elated they were 14 weeks and went for a ultrasound and they couldnt find the babys heartbeat they ran all types of test and imaging ultimately they had a  miscarriage its been two weeks and the doctors are trying to figure out how to proceed because the process of removing or anything is treading on the lines of abortion i dont understand how because there is no longer a heartbeat why should a woman have to be subjected to the mental anguish of this situation how do you move forward im really confused on who this helps one size does not fit all
im pro life and choice but you need to know your choice you child will likely be named if aborted their spirits live on and are likely to spiritually and typically sexually enslaved by people running the clinics and people running msnbnbc ze vanderbourgh 
if you dont believe in abortion then dont have one do not dictate to me what i can or cant do with my bodyi will deal with my soul on my own
"if people were not getting abortions just because i doubt this ban would have happened imo this is a reset no abortion and then slowly lift restrictions so that we all agree on when its acceptable saw a woman post a video a year ago about her being 7 months pregnant her bf left her so she nonchalantly was going to get an abortion and start over with someone that wants to stay with them

why not just save up the carcasses of the entities that are removed from women and pile them up in a public area just leave them all out in the sun to rot let the pile grow and then if anyone wants an abortion they need to go and see that pile and sign off that they are ok tossing their own lump of cells onto it"
pure propaganda democrats what about inflation the illegals what is democrats plan for that trump 2024
when the democratic party hangs its hat on abortion killing your own for convenience  that is sick to see us fall this far 
a socalled principle of right to life for a foetus should never be upheld and enforced over the rights and desires of human beings who are real living beings   since this has happened women are made slaves or otherwise held captive to their wombs  the whole issue is so clearly religious   church and state should be separate  i dont transgress your boundaries by insisting you abide by my religious beliefs  you dont transgress my boundaries by insisting i abide by your religious beliefs  this is how we agree to disagree and still get along in society  we agree not to turn our religious beliefs into political issues
i would love it if someone conducted a research survey on who and how many objectors have had abortions in their families this is the same with religious zealots they spew god and violate every religious doctrine when it suites them the hypocrisy is dripping from these people
over turning roe v wade shows the american people which party is really trying to take our rights and freedoms
oh look sexual promiscuity has checks and balances now for women the same way family court checked deadbeat dads live with your decisions unless it is from sexual abuse
"if you are a republican woman you should stay silent if you are angry about this for obvious reasons 
to the rest of women when it comes to abortionwelcome to equality men had no choice financially even if he did not want the child 
women now have to live with their sexual promiscuity
sounds like equal treatment to me"
"people should wait until they get married and have a home established   then have children this would solve many problems  i can understand what some of the comments below are saying  people would like to be loved and not feel alone in the bedroom  they want to end the suffering condoms and birth control pills are the thing now   

it really fires me up when i see democrats using this abortion ruling by the us supreme court as a tool to attack republicans so they can win in the 2022 midterm election  i believe chief justice john roberts has a hand in this  i think democrats got a hold of john roberts and got him to put the abortion up for a vote  then when the other 5 republican judges voted for it  john roberts voted against it and said  it is not my fault because i voted against it   even though it was john roberts that put it up for a vote"
republicans cant tell voters they represent very rich people corporations so they have to use these cultural issues noam chomsky
texas  other like minded individualsconglomerates dont care if the mom dies an orphan under the right circumstances is easier to manipulate and exert an agenda upon  thats good for them in the long wrong easier to brain wash texans y companions to their point of view  its a long gamea long con if you will its effective look at any close minded group over time  youll hopefully be able to see that to all good soulsthoughts actions  deeds matter in the long run that is all carry on
only person who should have any kind of say on a womans abortion is her husband but he cant have veto power just hey can we talk power
dear dimwits dont blame the supreme court for something they should not have been involved in to start with go to the state legislatures if you want change but first decide what the law should be its difficult to accomplish when you arent sure what you want
this is so wrong i mean these poor transwomen have lost access to safe and secure abortions
assassinate the judges that did this
good old texas  its been said that the state is purple but the government in texas is so vulgarly red and in bed with the evangelicals
the usa cannot be considered as representative  of democracy future mindedness and leaders of the world the usa can be considered as an apartheid state that actively and wilfully promotes intolerance ignorance and irrationality
you people are evil no response necessary
i have never voted before it felt pointless ive already registered to vote and will vote from this upcoming election onward religious conservatism needs to be removed
not exactly reassuring theres so many baby killers out there
south carolina republican state representative neal collins recently said he is reconsidering his support of his states socalled fetal heartbeat bill  that weighs on me i voted for that bill these are affecting people  why yes women are people  thanks for figuring that out
the fauci wheel house of the satanic titanic women folks and life boat philosophy that dude in a dress yes yes satanic life boat athletics the devils standard of kiddy stomping excellence 
msnbc is an abortion of journalism
gop is a death cult
so giving states the power to allow people to choose is wrong for over 40 years people didnt have a choice these democrats lie and inflate the numbers to scare people why do democrats want so much control over children abortionschoolsand raising of them
yes people are seeing what it means to ban abortion it means more responsibility for your actions it means abortion is not birth control and it means more humans  especially black babies can live
this is a reason why religion should have no place in court decisions and even political arenas especially since texas and a few other states abortion ban laws pretty much proves our point on how far they can go by trying to shove their religion down peoples throats especially wen it comes to trying to control a womens body
looks like your tying to make people think there are masses of people but its a small percentage
its funny how you spread false information
no we are seeing just how much they want to murder full term babies
put every wanted child on the steps of the supreme court
the outro says it all this is who we are baby killers
if you see what these republicans did to ban abortion it created so many more problems and now laws they shouldve just leave it alone and let people make their own choices these republicans created a problem for womens rights and choices that didnt need to be addressed
so everyone needs to take note of this this one issue should let all americans know that the republicans want nothing more than to become dictators if they come in to power in the future
this is straight up an attack on women
look leftists think scotus is radical republicans think and has proven the fbi is biased and favors the left
ladies dont date republicans  they dont want you to make your own reproductive choices
"if a woman get into any legal trouble because shes getting or got an abortion the the man who got her pregnant needs to face the same persecution  she didnt do this to herself and we all know how babies are made 
then again the majority of these laws were passed by male officials they would probably never think to to that  would probably never think a man should get in trouble for having a good time"
my personal belief is that so much more could be done if we stopped saying abortion rights and actually call it what it really is womens rights
is having our breasts removed due to cancer also illegal  they are part of our reproductive anatomy
this bias anchor needs to be fired how can his opinion of being better off before allowed to be on here  propaganda fake news
continue protesting but obey the law  great job scotus  thanks again rbg for sticking around long enough allowing this to happen your legacy will live on 
i dont like the republican vision for america
i like the no choice no children this would be worse than abortion if it came to play  stupid law and justice would have real problem on their dirty hands peace
frankly this is a good side effect of roe v wade being overturned even rbg wanted this to happenthe voters will have to mobilize to protect their right to abortion and not depend on some unelected judges staying alive until theyre replaced by similarminded substitutes thats a ridiculous way to preserve what ought to be a constitutional right now momentum will build over the next five years for the right to abortion to be enshrined in federal law passed by the us congress lots of work ahead especially with mobilizing the huge prochoice voter bloc the best part the antiabortion forces now have to defend their radical fringe notions at the ballot boxes and its not looking too hot for them outside the deep south
voters need to vote out all these politicians and lawmakers that supported removing womens rights to have abortions and vote for lawmakers that support abortion
all this nonsense because the white supremacist want to keep the white majority
vote blue because we want our freedom to choose back
amazing how yall ignore hunters laptop and sleepy joes illegal business partners from russia and china
reproductive rights  is that the opposite of production wrongs 
somebody should tell some of these women that there are forms of birth control rather than abortion 
let those who have an abortion experience the pain that baby in the womb goes through watch what is done to that baby
if you have to watch people actually suffer at the cost of your belief system your belief system failed and you should no longer be affiliated with it
you baby killers and supporters have no right to point your fingers at anyone criminal murderer rapists nobody your the lowest of the low
been murdering kids for the last 50 years in the millions upon millions and now they are exposed and want to keep doing it smh
hopefully more republicans daughters and wives will die because of abortion banning karma
"i really effin wish that so many people werent so keen on the fo part of fafo how can one rationalize letting one human die of sepsis because they were all for criminalizing a medical procedure how can one make excuses for tormenting people with uteruses just because of one of the many after effects of sexual activity 
and i bet dollars to donuts  just like the height of the covid pandemic there will still be yahoos clinging to the flag and their bibles to soothe that ever encroaching feeling of desperation because their mother or sister or auntie or any other family member died because they couldnt access an abortion and didnt have the finances to travel to another state for one
this is a human crisis"
i hope women and the men who support them on this issue really flex their political muscles and vote in force in the midterms so hopefully we can get the womens health protection act passed to insure a womans reproductive rights nationwide vote all blue in 22 you go girl
the land of the free really
take away all your human rights starting from banning abortion maga ultimate goal is a white christian nationalist kkkchurch run slavery system women minorities and children are properties of kkk banning abortion so white men can make any women reproduce like life stock animals 
all through history anything the government touches falls apart housing railroads industry schools infrastructure farms natural resources health care etc etc the list goes on now people just let us all do what we do best and you guys well i dont know what you really do go somewhere and sleep i guess would be safe
im a british man and what is being done to womens rights in america disgusts me if i could i would be voting blue with you
dont try to stop the scum of the earth from killing their babies cnn is the mouth piece for the depraved i got news you are about to see voices and protesters for the aborted babies of america  and who do you think  will be more  dedicated those acting to save lives or those trying to take them
"we all are reacting to this deadly new virus  the moronic agent orange plague 
worst than the corona  this poison orange killer does it in our face   lies obstructionshate death to brother death to our children in school at malls at churches  at parades fraud  robbery of our vote of our democracy  our wombs the corona did it silently the moronic virus with such in decency  splashes it all over our face  mind and heart everyday in the stupid media that goes for profit over truth did the moronic virus contaminate all our news  or is it an advertisement for mar a lago for sale  we had enough  
 though have faith we believe in this great vaccine  love   vote the moronic bully and all its variants out  
let us lift again  the light  of respect kindness like the subaru  campaign for love over this moronic pestilence that has made america putrud   stench infecting all the is noble  just beautiful about us let   us get vaccinated with the love vaccine  it is 100  safe vote them out they have no right to steal my sacred womb  this is between man and woman or between you and god
and no one has the right to steal our national security ans sell it to putin   treasonous crime of espionage  we do not need no other over sight we the people  are the truth jury"
if this doesnt start it i dont know what will
this is why supreme court anywhere cant or allowed to be political or interfere with politics
roevember will hopefully be one to remember
did the gop have a meeting and say how can we guarantee we lose the next election
all prolifers should have been aborted the world would be a much better place
"even if you are firmly and immovably republican tell you representative that you dont want womens rights stripped away
if you cant do that you are a horrible person and your god will judge you for every woman who dies from a failed pregnancy"
again abortion isnt banned just left up to the states as the 10th amendment clearly allows god how people cant accept this and just vote people out who dont support abortion is beyond me
it means some innocent babies wont be killed by some doctor who makes money off of killing babies
oh poor satanic baby killers dont want a baby use birth control better yet keep those legs closed
if these states are forcing women to have children can the women sue the to state for the medical and care of the child until theyre adults
"thats a mere drop in the bucket
compared to what you will see over gun control"
republicanwomen think it doesnt affect thembut they just wait and seeunless their rich
"a comedian named hofstetter once said there was a time that widows werent allowed to get married then one day a really hot womans husband died the everyone was like this is a stupid law the only time politicians care is when it happens to them george carlin also commented on this saying its a big club and you and i are not in it they dont care about you at all at all at all at all according to the dsm5 one of the hallmarks of sociopathy is that a person doesnt care who they hurt or how badly so long as they get what they want and history has shown sociopaths make great cult leaders as shown by manson the oracle in matrix 1 also commented by saying what do men with power want more power sun tzu predicted this also when you back an enemy into a corner it fights hard and recklessly for it knows its at deaths door

also i encourage you to look into the college prison experiment it was ended after just days when the guards got too violent with the inmates they were classmates doing an experiment on themselves


so what do we do keep pushing this tyranny is about to break it wont go peacefully so be ready for that but talking marches tweeting these will not work no tyrant in human history has ever ever gone quietly yes voting is the least you can do but in times of life and death do everything you can do"
the longer ive lived the more weird and twisted i see usa wtf does anyone has to say in women own body crazy crazy
"republicans pretend to care about kids but also dont care when they get shot in a school cant afford food or are abused by one of their catholic priests 

conservatives are hypocrites and liars and it isnt difficult to prove it"
maybe greg adams was correct  why all the illegal immigration  because they have babies lots of babies the government is all about that
99 years for abortion  meanwhile you could murder several people and not serve 99 years
keep the government out of peoples personal decisions
pregnant women in texas are being hunted like animals
see who is extreme  and vote them out
what madness
so if youre trying to say that you can have an abortion all the way up to the ninth month youre all sick and need serious help
vote blue get rid of abbott  get rid of his cronies vote
"why are americans moving backward 
the rest of the world looks at america and we see stupidity bigotry racism and truly uneducated and horrible people"
republicans have sealed their fate the blue wave is coming
giving states power back is not extreme  it would be more viable to argue the opposite   she dumb
its not really about abortion  its about freedom privacy and choice  how can the government tell an american citizen what they can or cannot do with their own body  in this case the women of america thats unconstitutional and unamerican
using the word extremism does not help life begins at conception period
there are forms of birth control and the majority of women and all low income women can get them for free  they need to use birth control abortion is not a form of birth control
something to think about pregnant lady gets murdered they go for a double murder charge if its just a clump of cells why double murder
i dont think ppl who voted for banning abortions care too many of them arent impacted by it too many men dont care how the women in their lives are impacted by this and theyre not informed on womens health issues
"dead women and children giving birth is the desired effects of these bans the goal is and has always been for more white christian babies
christian nationalism is quite an old term anerican nazi sympathizers and klansmen used the term proudly"
as a canadian i find this unthinkable that the government can decide what i think i am so glad to live in a truly free country in canada
roe wade never banned abortions its now up to each state to decide what their abortion laws will be so this channel is basically lying to the uninformed
maybe we need to put a personhood amendment for women as in you are fully vested in the same personhood as men and therefore have the same right to bodily autonomy
how bout people keep their legs closed instead of creating babies just to kull them
 woman have a choice and it doesnt involve murder pretty simple really
the only  pregnant woman a man should be concerned about is his own
imagine a man that thinks another mans wifes body and her  health is their business men should not even have a say in this
this matter was settled decades ago the usa has bigger problems like preventing mass murder it is mental health the very stupid continue to try to bring us back to a time that never existed
the founders never put abortion in the constitution abortion has never been a constitutionallyprotected right why would the founders have wanted to violate the rights of the unborn by allowing them to be murdered inside the womb
i find it interesting that the republicanschristians are die hard supporters of israel a country that provides 40000 abortions annually we provide aid to israel they have healthcare question is why do republicans deny their own citizens
i dont want to pay your loans or for abortions your not gonna pay your loan dont take it  abortion outlaw this inhumane practice narcissism run amuck
its not a ban its the right of states to legislate a ban  if you dont like it elect someone else who you favor
how about the politicians focus on the terrostic threats caused by trump and clean up that mess how about focusing on worrying about our national security how about climate control things that affect all citizens themselves as well and quit trying to take womens rights away banning books deamening the lgbtq community etc none if that affects them except maybe on the next election lets hope we can turn this mess around with the right people in office vote blue in 2022 and 2024 thats our only hope  otherwise welcome to communism
thank you for everything you do ms nancy i love you 
america is becoming south america with its harsh abortion laws that ironically ranks among those with the highest estimated frequency of abortions administered abortions will happen laws do not reduce abortion
"no question
wait until the  important women are not able to get their abortions or become septic"
why do americans have to put their hands in the fire to see if its hot
sad  nooooo ladys u can not murder your own babys anymore hallelujah praise jesus
not to the christian taliban who want to control women
that roe was not codified is a failure of leadership im a one issue voter and i ditched my gop in washington state in favor of the candidate who was pro choice
as far as i am concerned wherever women have voted republican they must own the consequences of their vote
"complete idiocy american legislators have not learned about history they just need to look at the 18th amendment to the constitution created basically 100 years ago only to be repealed about 25 years later
now they have the same crazy ideology in dictating women what they have to carry for the next nine months and raise for the rest of their lives based on a religious belief just like waybackwhen even though the first amendment clearly states 
congress _shall_ make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances
my grievance to the government right now is their imposing on and suppression of the freedom of choice for women to do what they feel is right for them at the time

_murdock v pennsylvania 1943_ plainly a community may not suppress or the state tax the dissemination of views because they are unpopular annoying or distasteful if that device were ever sanctioned there would have been forged a ready instrument for the suppression of the faith which any minority cherishes but which does not happen to be in favor that would be a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the bill of rights

today people  both the public and the ones in power  lack the lessons of history and seem to have lost their sanity again i fear for the future of our country in what it is becoming  in what it has already become"
are you telling me no one was aware that the ban of abortion would increase the oppression of women and people think i am mistaken when i preach the failings of our education system smh
remember christians set people on fire threw acid on people and assassinated doctors to bring all of this about
men and women both should be terrified about getting pregnant and getting a woman pregnant 
but abortion is just the start and not even nearly as bad as what the far right nazis will do to the rest of our rights
state voters should decide this issue not politicians its inept that they even consider this their job
"lets be real americans are being agitated by american news again as they always are when a war is on
its obvious the democrats are in control of this new ukraine attack another viet nam and washington
as fronting for the pentagon is making it easy to keep that military activity going the republicans driving
american voters to the democrats making them look as legit as possible problems with abortions not"
well when 10 of those miscarriages causes death or 50 of them causes permanent sterilization happens well see whether the gop realizes that blocking your own population from wanting to have babies is a good thing or not hint its not china has already proved it
time to vote out the  vile slime that think they can take our rights drive them back under their rocks where they belong
all you pro choice remember one thing if your mother was at a time she didnt feel completely sure about her pregnancy you wouldnt even exist right now
forcing each state to codify and strengthen abortion rights we will have barrett kavanaugh and gorsuch to thank  let that notion consume them
next republicans are removing birth control they are at it allready
do you not believe in god anyone who is for abortion does not have one bit of compassion for life itself who cares right your living your life to its fullest so it really doesnt matter huh what if you were the one being aborted god said i formed you by hand in the womb if you do not want the child i suggest abstinence
praise god abortion is an abomination thank you lord for this correction
takes the churches at 75 of income to pay for programs  to offset their need to abuse women
the repubicons shot themselves in the foot perfect and good riddance

check out whats happening in new zealand
bharani  thugs go do some yoga and meditate on that
if you grew up wondering why everything around you seemed oddly contradictory and hypocritical and couldnt quite put your finger on it now you can you was surrounded by baby killers
"ladies it is cheaper to borrow money to go interstate to get back your right to decide than it is to borrow money to allow a fetus to develop into a child you could not afford 

what makes the supreme court think the state government is better qualified to make this decision on abortion for you what does the state governments know about your circumstances that you dont know yourself 

from the supreme court dear mr abbott you know better than all these women so you decide if they can have a termination a crippled man in a wheel chair knows better i dont think so "
i belive a corrupt scotus has woken up a lot of people and will hand the democratic a  big win in the senate and the house i believe 3  judges committed perjury under oath and should be impeached
this is insnae 99 years wtf
todays empowered woman is so trashy and gringe 
i cant even get insurance to cover a laproscopy to check for endometriosis because im not in enough pain yet i cant imagine what its like to have pregnancy complications be miserable andor at risk for severe damage or death and be told you cant have care because we dont want to be arrested for aiding in abortion
this is why christian cultists dont want people to have their voices heard because they know that they wont get the ability to make women second class citizens when it comes to full autonomy over their own bodies
i got a lady angry once this will not end well for the gop
l be damned if ill ever vote for a woman abusing republican again in my life
rich people will just fly their daughter girlfriend  gets pregnant
f all that them mfs better get back to the ice cubes contract with black america and the president trump platinum plan including the schools choice vouchers or stfu
"maybe its just me but i seriously hope that everyone who voted to take away womens rights to choose for themselves dies in an excruciating way 

its 2022 and we still have people using religion and egotism as a means to write laws for other people that they have no right to choose for ive had more than my fill of it and its enough 

the us was never great but this just adds extra anchors to an already sinking ship"
an individuals rights will only be protected so long as it doesnt conflict with the state nothing could be more dangerous to a society
why abort
this is an outstanding example of why the individual vote counts   taking away the power of choice from half of the us population  is outrageous   particularly as a separation of church and state matter which is a basic tenet of our democracy
if you are going to ban abortion then why not make a law to get every mans should have a vasectomy  its only fair this really shouldnt be a political issue because its ridiculous just study the problems ireland have had with this topic
from outside america i saw in you news a lady whose foetus has no skull yet she cannot abort how medieval is that you dinosaur judges
"when law becomes ruled by ignorance and religious zealotism certain things should stay separate 

law and religion 
politics and religion 

religion should stay away from everything 

experts should be consulted before dumb decisions are made especially concerning something like this"
there was never a constitutional protection to abortion that is why the ruling was overturned
thanks nancy
if i didnt have abortion rights id have 3 kids instead of one because men didnt use condoms because i was on birth control
when the financial consequences of the radical texas abortion law hit texans will stop whining about secession and run to dc for financial help once they gett it they will go back to whining about secession again hypocritical much  nah sniveling opportunism you betcha
this is a lying communist news network fake news all lies all day
killing helpless voiceless children in wombs is murder
i want to see one of these supreme court judges having a oops baby the scandal  karma 
with this usa takes one step back in terms of womens rights freedom of rights where it just got taken away by the gop so trump commits crimes he does not jail but a doc can get jail for 99 years if an abortion is done to save a life 
with the country awash in guns thanks to the court i wouldnt want to be a gutless doctor especially in texas just think about what is going to happen when someones wife or daughter becomes disabled or dies because the doctor gives up power to the republicans and refuses care to the woman  it will be interesting
if abortion rights were put to a vote in each state individually none of them would pass this rediculous abortion ban period the republiquanon domestic terrorists party know that  that is simply a fact
give this time some  woman related to these abortion haters will die cause of these crazy laws lets see how these gop nuts react when their daughter or wife or sisters dies when their pregnancy goes bad and an abortion would save them it will happen at some point and it will show they are using this for votes not true belief
i am disgusted that men in power can decide what a woman can do with her body
nothing hates like american christian love
its clear that more and more people have begun to realize that banning abortion isnt just a fun little game but is actually an action that has consequences that might effect themselves or their own loved ones
25 of all pregnancy self abort usually early on but not always thats why its customery to wait 6 to 8 weeks before even telling people youre pregnant  what are you going to do about those abortions arrest god
we need to codify our rights and take interpretation out of the hands of the judiciary
republicans will still vote republican democrats will still vote democrat it wont matter for 90 of people
not all but the supreme courts are full of rich white men the majority the big majority
when protestants were allowed on the supreme court we didnt have justices taking orders from rome
young women took their rights for granted
"this is not about abortion but about human rights this is about the health care of an individual how come nobody says this this is cruelty at the highest degree
the world is in awe"
i also wonder what would happen if mandatory financial support levels were set it takes two to tango but np one wants to be the men actually paying support for children that helped create  suggest government support in lieu of the father and watch minds get blown  how about adding in the same charges are applicable to any man facilitating an out of state abortion so his wife doesnt find out hes wick dipping
the lesson from dirty dancing was never learnt
the unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for they never make demands of you they are morally uncomplicated unlike orphans they dont need money education or childcare they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships and when they are born you can forget about them because they cease to be unborn its almost as if by being born they have died to you you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth power or privilege without reimagining social structures apologizing or making reparations to anyone they are in short the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe
"the worst results of antiabortion are yet to happen once again wait until a woman dies from getting a back alley coat hanger abortion then the worst results will have occurred again and the reason proabortion laws came about in the first place proabortion is not about protecting rights but protecting the life of the mother what gets aborted is not much more than a parasite when it happens a potential of being a person is fact but at that stage it is just a blob of cells leaching nourishment off the host

abortion and medical technology is also being held back in the future right to life could be a thing of the past when it comes to abortions parasite removed from the host just like a standard abortion will still exist but the parasite will not be harmed but transplanted into a electronicmechanical womb where it will gestate into a newborn baby newborn baby without the pain of being shoved through a vagina but a tank draining with the same butt slapping to cause the amniotic fluid expulsion from the lungs mother 78 months prior already put the child up for adoption she just didnt need to birth it

and point being right to life should also include allowing abortions the focus of the movement should be on the technology not being able to save the parasite though it saves the mother an artificial womb is not impossible"
abortion was used by republicans to get christian votes
if a state is legally responsible for a banned abortion then the resulting child should be the legal responsibility of that state all costs incurred until 18 years old
what do you think would happen if a married texan politician got their mistressgirlfriend pregnant how would they then get rid of the evidence wait  i know they legally own an ak51 lol
common laddies move on n down here to cali we banging and not carin over here
"easy solution most if not all doctors have enough money in the bank to do without work for 3 to 5 years a general walkout by doctors from hmos and private hospitals should turn the tide the ball is in the doctors court the money running the hospitals in america has sufficient political clout to turn supreme court decisions upside down 
america had ample opportunity to keep religion out of government they failed and religion got the upper hand that can be reversed christian sharia has no place in america if that is not so then what we call democracy is b and the us constitution is little more than toilet paper"
its funny how many people are pro murdering babies  sad state we r in
you know who doesnt care the majority of republican leaders and the majority of the supreme court the voices may reach them but its easier not to care
the soviet republic of texas stands by its decision to make women carry dead fetuss why would anyone want to live in the great state of right wing idiots who hate women and books and free speech

somebody wake me up when this prequel to the handmaids tale is over
"hello 
every doctor swear to follow the hippocratic oath 
the hippocratic oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians it is one of the most widely known of greek medical texts in its original form it requires a new physician to swear by a number of healing gods to uphold specific ethical standards the oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the western world establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today these include the principles of medical confidentiality and nonmaleficence as the seminal articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value it is enshrined in the legal statutes of various jurisdictions such that violations of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oaths symbolic nature
phil belgium peace"
even children know its wrong but not you
as the old saying goes be careful what you wish for i think the blowback from this horrendous supreme court decision is going to shock the extreme right and cost them a lot of elections which it should being a man i dont think i have the right to tell a woman what to do with their body plain and simple
"those middle aged and elderly mostly male politicians would not think twice to have their mistresses aides and personal assistants seek an abortion for an unexpected inconvenient pregnancy
hypocritesall of them"
keep in mind  this is the 1 trying to become the 01 they bribe to make this happen so everyone is distracted from the rich not paying taxes  demanding free handouts while most people cannot pay their bills
"2018 say a huge increase of ppl showing up to vote which helped and 2020 made mcconnell a minority leader 
2022 we need to the republidiots again that we want the gop gone so our rights can return and so the gop wont have power to revoke more of our rights like reversing the voting amendments"
abortion is ending of a fetus life so that it will not result to birth because of various reasons what are your reasons may god enlightens us in our reasons
alito and the maga justices on the court should be aborted
giving the power back to each state was a fair decision by scotus it gives the people of each state the power to decide for themselves and to vote for the officials that align with their prochoice or prolife ideals if you live in a state where you feel you dont have rights as a citizen then you should consider moving to one where elected officials and citizens alike have the same ideals as you it is only fair that through voting the people decide their own fate
i want to know what they are gonna do w all those kids the state is going to have to place them somewhere  plus its tax payer money

30 of women are unable to terminate a pregnancy in this country an outrage which will not go unanswered by people whose rights have been trampled by the gop
the reality hit folks daily desperate women are seeking clinics for abortion demand clearly exceed supply anger and frustration will climb and spread among women folks will die and drive women to vote midterm will be a nightmare for republicans
as an er dr i like many physicians wont do locums work in any state that criminalizes elective and therapeutic abortion that means you take your chances with adequate er coverage hope you dont get into and car wreck or have a mi
the republican party is a party of taking away it isnt a party of giving they wanna strip away your rights your human rights they are extremist the republican party after trump became president has decided this is the decade to show people who we really are white extremist who hate minorities and hate women
lets not forget that in the republic of ireland even when abortion was outlawed the maternal mortality rate average between three and four per 100000 live births in 2021 the maternal mortality rate in texas was nearly 34 per 100000 its not simply a matter of access to abortion it is also a matter of women having access to healthcare
the two things that have always made murica an idiotic country racism and religion its going to end you soon
stop calling it abortion its murder no one can justify murder of innocent children and if they try to its a red flag
"first ladys abortion
oh my goodness i have a demand for sanitizer"
certainly not just a womens issue there must be millions of men who are scared to death of the results of their sexual activity
its really pretty basic if you were against abortion and you strongly feel that your religious beliefs do not believe in it  then dont get one however you dont have any right to inflict your own religious beliefs on every other american in this country who may not share them who may not belong to your religion or may not belong to any religion whatsoever thats whats protected in our countries foundation  that anyone can practice the religion of their choice or no religion whatsoever
what most of the anti abortion people simply dont know is that many medical procedures pertaining to womens health that run from infections to cancer treatments can and do come under the abortion umbrella they likely wont know until it personally affects them or someone they know or love  the religious right and political extremists dont make that known because they know it will make them lose supporters
texas should be another country
remember in ohio the florida of the midwest having an unplanned pregnancy would be considered an opportunity for girls as young as ten vote
"the crap that starts in america most often comes to australia 
"
they could ban every other form of birth control  i dont think anyone would notice
if they cared about kids they wouldnt have went to the nra meeting after 19 kids got killed in school play like they are pro life for a vote they are pro birth  for a vote
the bad part is that strawberry women s is on the side of evil strawberry weak mens
just wait until they have millions of women living on welfare because they cant afford the children they are forced to have and also any medical issues they might have from carrying dead babies or ectopic pregnancies i wonder how many abortions trump has paid for over his lifetime
abortion should only be allowed at the very begining otherwise live with your decision
americans is a jokelands the worst country in the world
its awesome thank you scotus
republikkkan taliban party of cowards of america like it or not thats what they represent
first of all its a womans body and abortion use to be very private n discretion was always required alot of the woman issues are exposed to the entire public which is stupid only christians try to interfere with womans rights its none of your business is it woman get fixed or take the pill like a daily vitamin

"the summer of rage will continue until the midterms and beyond
guaranteed"
"this has happened before

in 1919 congress passed the 18th amendment to the constitution which prohibited intoxicating liquors in the usa

the unintended consequences included speakeasys and gangsters plus decreased government revenue from not taxing legal liquor sales

once the government realized it had made a big mistake it ratified the 21st amendment which repealed the 18th amendment and made alcohol legal again

in the same way people will quickly realize rightwingers made a big mistake and repeal their stupid abortion laws"
"educate yourselves before making stupid comments on this feed
can we please have a debate on here only with those who are well informed spewing comments based on misinformation or extremism accomplishes nothing we dont have to agree but we cant debate if only one of us has bothered to read something other than extremist tweets"
"had law makers bothered to educate themselves interview women interview doctors and other medical professionals research before jumping to action then maybe they would have been well informed enough to understand the consequences before they took action

but ofcourse they did not do anything other than pick up the phone and do a yesman routine when their donorowners called about  in return for their vote against womens right to healthcare

some of these law makers dont even understand basic biology or reproduction 

we the people expect better than what our tax dollars for their exorbadant salaries are giving us"
"1 women are not going to simply give up having abortions just it is against the law think prohibition and drugs
2 if and when the republicans get their hands on both houses of congress and the whitehouse they will enact a nation wide federal ban on abortions
3 banning abortions is going to turn out to be one of those things republicans are sorry they asked for because they got it"
"america already had an abortion law

they just want to make it from clinics to street shops

how many dead fetus will america produce in a year"
why do you think the repubpigs are trying to take away our voting rights
overturning roe vs wade may turn out to be one of the best things to happen to america with one misguided effort the repuglicans have alienated half of the population of the country alienated try infuriated this may prove to be the death knell of the republican party as we know it and that will the the first step in really making america great again
here is an idea   if you dont want to have a babydont get pregnant   this is not the old days when women had no methods other than total abstinence to avoid pregnancy  things are different today  if you want to have a child later take birth control pill use a birth control patch get an iud use spermicide   if you dont want a child ever get your tubes tied   bottom line there is no excuse whatsoever for using abortion as your birth control solution
the actions of scotus have guaranteed dems win in november and likely again in 24
get out and vote

why cant women just let babies live  adoption should be the alternative not abortion
doctors that refuse to provide life saving care because they are fearful of being prosecuted for performing an abortion should have their medical license revoked
it means alot of people have no self control or sense of responsibility
keep voting blue till we destroy the right wing party
its more than about controlling womens bodies some states are pushing to control womens travel as well a little like saudi arabia where women cant leave the home without a male relative
america needs to see a new political movement like was seen recently in australia  we saw several key conservative politicians lose their seats to the teal movement which has changed our political landscape  republicans are too dyed in the wool to change their colours  overthrow them
abortion rights are human rights
they are not concerned with taking the life of a baby that  could live if not aborted it is murder any way you look at it
the right wing hypocrites who claim to use the word in their name are blasphemous
"how would be the proposal
takes away a mans right to reproduce at any time
every 18 year old should get a vasectomy which is only temporarily reversed if the partner wants to have children
men would take to the streets in their millions to demonstrate for their right to selfdetermination"

" seems like short of legal changes that women in america have even less rights than women in the middle east and areas like that they might as well put those hoods over their heads along with big black robes and all walk together some 20 feet or so behind the men like they do in the middle east regions 
 wow with the men being treasonous repugnantcan terrorists and the women dressed in black hoods we now have our very own taliban jezzz  "
wheres the ban i meani can still buy coat hangers so i see no ban just some more made up words in a made up court
"another big wftys to all of you who said that our handmaid tale memes were overthetop paranoid hyperbole apologies accepted if you get 3 or more of your progressive friends registered to vote 

on the plus side this crisis could be used as the impetus to rally enough sane adult americans to finally end the absurd electoral college andor make the senate reflect the will of the people instead of a medieval minority that live in podunk red states these institutions were created solely to get slave states to join the fledgling union any excuse that is made to keep them has now been proven to be outweighed by this wave of dark ages nonsense "
"fyi  leader of major texas antiabortion group arrested for soliciting a minor

"democracy is waay better than an authoritarian totalitarian fasist dictatorship that tries at this fragile moment where we can stop the destruction of our freedoms

the right wing extremists want to keep people uneducated and sleeping

we need a nation that is awaken to those who oppose our god given freedoms"
stupid men none of their business none lets get them in the balls grip tight hold on for dear life until they act right
fascism is cumulative it begins in back halls and expands to nations
we should give texas back to mexico
would everyone be ok with abortion if it was only legal in very rare circumstances say if the mothers life is in grave danger
i am well beyond reproduction ability but what this supreme court has done to womens rights  i cannot beleive what is happening to our medical institution  and not to mention our rights as women  what is next
women either use effective birth control or abstain all the women ive known over the years who got abortions were just sleeping around
thats funny because a lot of you voters dont know what your rights are so what rights do you think theyre taking away 
there too many people on the planet i just say that
yes democrats please dispose of your offspring
didnt you guys just change the definition of a woman saying this is an issue about womens rights is pretty transphobic and you all should be ashamed of yourselves
nary a word about the terminated having any kind of choice the majority of which were victims  of elective abortions and not a threat to womens health
"abortion should be free and there should an incentive they also be more available conservatives dont realize that abortion cuts back on poverty and crime imagin if one million less kids are born its like one less baltimore or detroit to complain about plus less population would mean better healthcare schooling and public housing as there would be less to take care of
there is enough people on this planet as is there is no benefit to having more people 
a mother of 5 gets pregnant its her right  to choose but picking abortion should be  in her wallet


obviously women should have a choice"
need more nonwhites to make love to maga groups
why is it the left always wants regulations until we talk about abortion or immigration abortion is not a form of contraceptive 
so people its great that droves people are making their voices heard about keeping choicebut this wont be remedied in a year or less its going to take a few election cycles minimum to make a lasting change budget on 46 years of activism we need 60 in the senate to codify roe vote vote vote and help organize
abortion is no more healthcare then the gas chambers in nazi germany
this is a human rights issue the right to life abortion is pure evil and so are its supporters
vote all republicans out of officeperiod
remember when republicans were yelling at the top of their lungs about it was their right not to wear a mask to protect anyone from covid ladies yell at the top of your lungs its our right to have an abortion go vote blue keep your rights
"time to take it to the streets 
shut the whole system down 
the system is broken 
the fascists want the american women back in the alleys and in the kitchen 
under a men rule 
unite or forever be enslaved and oppressed by big bullies lying politicians and deranged elite"
if you didnt vote against donald trump in 2016 and you were old enough to vote then you chose this 
dont worrycalifornia will always have abortionsalways i adore democracy
yeah but the republicans are not allowing women to vote on it so the laws are not even legal not to mention it violates hippa
anti abortion people are idiots they want to band abortion until what everyone was telling them effect their families now women cant get care because doctors are scared of jail
joe loved hot steamy showers with his daughter gross
having been forced to have an illegal abortion when i was 15 and a half years old by my mother in 1966 let me assure people that abortion bans will not stop abortions they will be done in back alleys in some dirty office space by a quack like my mother forced me to have i was saved when my father realized that my bed was covered in blood i was unconscious and he took my to the nearest place he could get help for me and that doctor saved my life my mother had not told him what she had done to me so you folks who think banning abortions will stop them are dead wrong what they will stop is safe abortion access moms will die leaving young children without a mom poor women will likely die but then again nobody actually cares what happens to poor women regardless of what the right to lifer types claim
it was about time that all this republican anderstand was the republican party is trying to dothey are taking the right of all the womens and this is the begging for what they have in place look at florida texas and all the states that are republican they are even changing the history of the usa in the schools and taking the books so they would not know the real history this is how hitler started we cant let this happen to america we are in 2022 not in 1940 we have to stop them before they do more harm to the usa
abortion is the killing of a child bottom line
"doctors need the page from the police handbook   write a bonus account of the incident with misspelled  illegible language i feared for my life
then a page from the republican handbook   i do not recall i do not remember i plead the fifth the left extremists set me up abortiongate fake news"
seen where arizona republican erased his websites antiabortion agenda knows hes losing so he hides his stance
"reproductive rights where is that in the constitution how about the child and their right to life which is in the constitution
selfish selfish selfish to choose your life over your childs when your friend miscarries and is sad do you console her with the words  it was only a clump of cells why be sad you just got saved from a life of aggravation and who knows what else  i dont think so or you friendship would be over"
vote out every republitard judges secretaries of state govenors ags ect with 60 control of senate we make laws democrats force supreme court to enforce laws we as the majority want
"i want to know how outsiders are getting medical records of these females  
how does anyone other than the immediate  medical team know the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy "
not to mention the fact that they want to send women to prison for having miscarriages
this is what happens when people place bumper sticker politics over human beings
the people that wants to ban abortion doesnt have a clue what they are doing they are nothing but control freaks and blind with a one sided view without any knowledge of the risk and problems that a pregnancy can present it not the same for all women and every pregnancy problem do happen and will continue to happen that is why this decision should be between the doctor and patient  it would be better cheaper and more effective to help provide contraception and tubal ligation to women and those above the age of 35 that elect to do so but most definitely let it be a choice of the women
guess white males in texas want all women to be stepford wives and breeders
vote blue   and vote against them who voted against you on health care a living wage good paying jobs the republican party have constantly voted no on all this  
this is an easy callrepublicans are idiots
abortion will never be stopped no matter how hard the anti choice brigade tryillegal abortions will still happendeaths of not just the foetusbut the woman as wellwho may be the sole provider for other kids perhaps its time for compulsory vasectomies its a small operation and can be reversedor is it my bodymy choice for men
females keep your legs closed until you are ready for children if you keep your legs closed abortion will never be an issue for you women have always had the right to keep their legs closed abortion is not birth control abortion is used by weak females who get impregnated at the club on saturday night abortion is not birth control pathetic cheers
i dont understand why these people hate women so much why do they want to sentence women to die well they will learn in roevember
it shoud be called reproductive rights
"the murdering of unborn babies in their mothers womb has resulted in over 
62000000 slaughtered children"
so the republicantaliban party taking freedom from american women 
hooray for life and the protection of it
hooray hooray for the united states supreme court decision to overturn roe v wade
free will 
murder murder murderby any other name is still murder
the extremism of allowing abortions up to birth and letting the newborn die on their own is beyond the pale the right wanted it to be returned to the states to decide we got what we fought for now the voters get to decide
it seems everything in texas is big but there  brains
maybe if you raging feminists didnt throw the whole  my body my choice into the garbage when it was convenient to fit your narrative  the average person would have a little sympathy
abortion rights is like screwing up and then make it go away in life you can get away with many things as long as they  are not found  it also means they are illegal
"what it really means is the usa has become a theocracy under the rule of god and anything that threatens that is against what the us stands for a theocracy fueled by capitalism

capitalism wants to own the means of production literally and figuratively to keep it churning the more overpopulated we become we will resort to more poor working conditions lower salaries and even more uneducated voters

yes the conservative front with their christianity spiel are a threat to individual rights and freedom time to fight back and vote them out"
vote bluerepublicans are all about taken freedoms away
if the woman dies from being denied care due to the abortion ban can supreme court justices be held liable for manslaughter
enough of the redcoat republicans this is our body not some old white mans vote blue
"this is what block obama was all about and in 2016  43 of registered democrats refused to vote 
they just couldnt support the dnc or hillary clinton for arbitrary and subjective reasons 
only 41 of registered democrats refused to vote in 2020
not voting is more deplorable than voting republican just to block our liberal agenda"
republicans are doing gods work it only makes sense to legalize raping next
america has always said freedom freedom freedom what a joke
we also vote we plan and we plot expect us at the pools i feel rage
"thats cool murder babies and brag about it
plan having a child and dont use abortion as birth control"
roevember people
"oh really are they now
would have been nice if they didnt need to be self centered as in order to figure it out but better late than never i guess"
women need to vote blue laws in texas and florida are just outright horrifying texas will not let a woman that is in danger of dying get an abortion so gop pro life is bs
shame they didnt see this coming as its obvious it will if you let the republican into power i mean the republican dont make a secret of this anti abortion stance and yet people affected either vote republican or dont vote same with low taxes for the wealthy and all the other antisocial ideologies vote democrat before the republicans get their way on other issues
"things have to change
they will keep making choices on how people can live"
i dont think the magats understand whats happening in america right now
"canadians who are for the choice are with you american women 
dont stop your battle your sisters cousins mothers and daughters need you
we are in 2022 not in the end of 1800women fought for this right and every evolved countries in the world have that choice"
any reproductive freedom act should also codify mens rights into law  it wont and major networks never discuss this  until they do i dont vote
why does texas always come off as being so backwards after enough women start dying in emergency rooms because a doctor does not want to get locked up for 99 years texans are going to kick every stupid republican religious extremist out of office  we cant have gun nut religious zealots who want to ban books tell everyone else what to do this all boils down to a minority rule its got to stop
regardless of your position on abortion if we elect our politicians on that single issue its just bad karma
1 in 3 women unconscionable  unconstitutional the religious extremists are harming citizens by penalizing their autonomy rights of choice the are committing crimes of forced birth against women
"and i saw the dead small and great standing before god and books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged according to their works by the things which were written in the books
the sea gave up the dead who were in it and death and hades delivered up the dead who were in them and they were judged each one according to his works 
then death and hades were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and anyone not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire revelation 201215 nkjv


today while you are still alive and able may you repent from your sins believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that jesus christ is your lord and savior so that through him your name will be written in the book of life 


for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him 
should not perish but have everlasting life 
for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved john 31617 nkjv

by gods grace  the gift of salvation and eternal life is available to all you can receive it you can reject it may you choose wisely"
ive seen more women then that  at  trump rallies
"its not just the doctors at risk of prosecution if a woman comes in to the er with a miscarriage is she going to be treated or be accused of self aborting and arrested

abbott has got to go he is an evil bitter old man"
misogyny is still misogyny  it just goes to show you how some people have such a hatred and bigotry towards women
vote republican to force women to carry their rapists nonviable fetus full term even if it kills them
somebody needs to be talking about the mandatory inbreeding  its the law now if your blood relative gets a  family member  pregnant thats called inbreeding
this will bite gop badly at the polls
its as bad your own doctors unable to dispense meds for covid19  being controlled and limited to what your told
the red state regulation of women proves the gop freedom bombast is a crock
ftexas  the gop too 
no man should have to pay for a baby he doesnt want either
because people do not care about others rights  your ability to vote will be next this is no longer a nation you can trust by law
how did this happen lol feel so bad for anyone needing an abortion right now
no one is going to tell me what i can do with my body  i used to have respect for the supreme court but no longer  some how we let stupidity in to the white house in 2016 now its in the supreme court
"looking at this logically  the cutoff for abortion should be the same cutoff for forcing premature birth  no matter what a woman shouldnt be forced to carry an unwanted baby  either give premature birth and put it up for adoption or abort it  

the world record for this is born 19 weeks premature  so whether the cutoff is 45 months or 3 months or 6 months no woman should be forced to carry it to term if she doesnt want to"
yes we are seeing thats a whole lot of murder sympathizers yhvh is also watching he created the lives of the innocent being slaughtered woe be unto these killers
texans need to wake up and vote for a governor with a heart beto will serve us well blue 
reversing a womens rights to abortions was the final nail in the coffin for the republicans as a so called political party 
"please remember that youtube comments dont win elections

this is for people who were eligible to vote but chose not to in 2016 hillary clinton tried to warn you about trumpappointed judges overturning roe v wade  

this is for people who are eligible to vote this november but arent planning to vote if you want to keep the rights you value you need to vote while you still have the right to vote

whatever your values it only matters if you vote"
lets vote out as many of these fascist pubs as humanly possible in november before we start looking like 1930s germany
our loved ones are not fing property and others should have no say in life altering decisionsas if it wasnt hard enough to begin with
democrats must get americans to focus on how republikkklans have used republikkklanstate legislatures to enact their nonexistent platform a platform that is mainly a culture war attacks on womens rights voting rights minority rights lgbtq rights and 1st amendment rights they will make those barriers federal
women vote too maybe they are going to take that away too the abortion rule is no mistake a obvious control over women thats the only way to look at it
the myth was promiscuous women  note not men  getting pregnant and having monthly abortions the reality is a whole lot different
thats the weird thing about most americans they only get it once they are personally affected  whats so difficult about informing yourself before you make political decisions that have farreaching consequences
an observation from australia like the fpotus the federalist judges need to be jailed judges should not accept money for positions in the supreme court
this is how you know anericans know nothing of history they have to see the tragedy and suffering for their own eyes to fully grasp the situation
"well its a good thing the people can vote on it
let each state decide not unelected judges"
the usa is not the ccp
coat hanger sales are through the roof so are bible sales
the turtle can see his chances of the top job in the senate disappearing and who can he blame 
"it means women are not allowed to murder their children
it means we stopped child killers
it mean more babies will live
it means trump has save thousands of lives
it means we have a good lawful supreme court
it shows demoncrats are child murdering demons we need to vote out of office"
shame on all that identify as a democrat
if we cant turn these abortion bans around far too many women girls and their families are going to cruelly severely and needlessly suffer
vote blue because freedom is on the linewe must save america from run for future generations
voting is like driving a car if you want to go forward select d if you want to go backward select r
lets hope that americans realize just how the usa got into this messthanks to the gop lining the supreme court with right wing members of the gop that court is now just a political arm of the gop and they will not have the best interest of all americans in their decisionsnow the minority of america will rule instead of the majority and that is just plain wrong
make this a roevember

if texas sees a fetus as a human can it be insured i mean if you have no choice can you at least make sure should it go bad you can afford to pay the medical bills or will they allow pregnancy insurance so like after 9mnths you get a pay out for medical fees and extra things for this human real question usa medical fees are crazy are yall at least getting paid for the risk you have to have the baby did they at least increase maternity leave to at least 6 mnths paternity leave what are the benefits of this law"
the miracle of god and they throw it away like a gum wrapper its just plain murder
texas legislation is criminal what is wrong with these cretins
it wont end with roe v wade the gqp feel empowered now and they will take away as many rights as they can from we the people  tre45on 
hello everybody life is precious please take this moment and receive god in your life pray to god everyday for his help in life situations read the holy bible everyday believe in god more than you believe in anything else trust god more than you trust anyone else praise god more than you praise anything else love god more than you love anything else and remember with god help all good things are possible all you have to do is never give up also a great place for you to start in the holy bible is psalms 1 and everyday after that read a chapter in psalms till you finish all the chapters in psalms then after that start on proverbs 1 then everyday after that read a chapter in proverbs till you finish all the chapters in proverbs and after that read every chapter of the holy bible until you finish it for it will change your life in the most amazing way
it means 5060 million babies every year worldwide would be alive
if the democrats retain or even increase their control over the senate and if the expected red wave in the house is a washout with the democrats retaining control and the post election data all points to the elimination of roevwade as the root cause watch how fast the republicans abandon their stance on a womans right to choose vote vote vote
doctors enmass in  the us have to go ahead with emergency care for pregnancies and proper dnc procedures now and i know these states will back away from law enforcement of these legislations
women have always been clueless you want to see how a people destroy themselves with the majority vote keep watching
for those who believe in gods will god is the biggest provider of abortion 15 of pregnancies are naturally aborted when things go wrong
so called christians forcing religious control over womens body is the same as islamic sharia laws
why would the texas government want to imprison a doctor for 99 years for doing what they have been  trained to do that is to save lives in a life or death situation
whats that pics of protests in europe over stealing land from farmers or babies not being murdered by the millions as a form of depraved birth control or maybe its the death of the elites sick evil form of eugenics
no man dreams of putting a ring on the finger of a baby killer that cant keep her panties on they are going to figure that out soon
"this collective angry crowd is incredibly at least 100 times bigger than any of trumps rallies its definitely bigger than trumps inauguration crowd
funny how gops plan for total domination is failing"
bharani  learn about this and youll learn why the thugs want to take innocent life is really all about go do some yoga and meditate on that
i really believed a few months ago that congress would be taken control of by republicans it happens basically every midterm of any democrats first term in presidential office the supreme court really poked a hornets nest by this bs overturning of roe v wade the progressive base is not usually this excited during this time of the political 4 year cycle but if we all go and vote we might actually give democrats the tools they need to make significant change
yo ohuckkkk republicans and trunip supporterssssssssss
those 5 scotus members are gonna keep going until they get their bigoted evangelical paradise the only way to stop this is to fight back and fight back hard
they are exposing themselves for who they truly are everyday more and more excellent every mans eyes will be opened
republicucks screwed themselves by showing us who they actually are never again
i had to change my opinion on abortion after seeing the type of women protesting for it   do we really want that type of women to reproduce   i dont
supporting and demand and cheering for killing your own children is not the path you want to take thats all im going to say
random comment for channel interaction
saying it for years and it fell on deaf ears racism and abortion the democrats bread and butterfunny how the two are also related
overpopulation people think about it were already overpopulated
it also amazes me that they could even make a ruling like this  pregnancy is one of the most dangerous things a woman can do with her body  yes your body was made to do it but not all women can physically do it not all babies come out correct or develop correctly sometimes a baby dies during pregnancy  and if you dont get that baby out you have a strong possibility of sepsis and many other problems  this law is pretty much telling women that if they get pregnant they have no ability to protect themselves if there is a medical problem or condition with that pregnancy  so for instance a 16 year old girl gets pregnant theres a severe medical emergency and the girl is going to die if they dont take out the baby but if they take out the baby the babys going to die  now so that girl ends up dying then the baby has depending on the time frame how developed it is as you know a 20 to a 60 chance to live maybe even a 70 or 80  and have a few kids later on in their life but how many kids could that 16yearold still had so youre killing one person to save another person for what reason why is a infants life more important than anyone elses   and lets not forget for all you religious nuts out there god kills thousands of babies everyday why do we have to serve a 99 year term for killing one to save the mothers life
if you are miscarryingyou dont need an abortion it will happen naturally   do people believe this bs
the only way to save the lives of women aside from voting is for the women in these states to strike  take women completely out of the workforce and their economies will fail
neither the elephant nor the donkey are capable of leading  vote independent
how did some women get so militant that they put killing babies ahead of everything else sky high has prices soaring inflation squeezing family budgets an invasion at the southern border bringing in deadly fentanyl which is the number one killer of our young people and outofcontrol crime in our cities killing babies in places like new york right up to the moment of birth is infanticide
i hope banning abortion buries the republican party
and you guys complain about russia  but not about ukraine who has banned opposition political parties  ukraine sounds like republicans who take away voters rights
do you actually expect the folks that pushed for this to care rather we live or die this rolls back to when women were property men telling us what was what im not sure the women who supported this thought was gonna happen this means you cant have a dc if you miscarry but still retains some tissues or products of conceptionguess what you get to maybe die my lord i pray for us all
the  same people that were screaming my body my choice  about wearing a mask now want to control womens bodies  vote for womens right to choose civil rights equal rights voting rights  climate change  vote for your rights and your childrens future  never vote for any election deniers vote blue  it may save a womans life
looks like a celebration of life to ban abortion  go to blue states for infanticide let that blood be on their hands  looks like judgement already on democratic states
no one is stopping anyone from reproducing  what it is stopping  is killing what you have produced  so disingenuous
they really make no beans about it
the supreme court and the republicans messed up  bigly
protest for peace and unity as well out with  racism and  not equal application of the lawwith all the crimes trump has committed and hes still free defaming degrading threatening persecuting the fbi which is under a  new reform
this comes down to money in the pockets of big business because they do not have to pay for abortions in the health care
"lol that pic tells it all  lol
many stupid that dont do the pill "
make the lawmakers retrieve the dumpster babies themselves personally none of this can be enforced and there will be black market abortions count on it government doesnt need to know youre pregnant
the fske propaganda cnn is at it again why lie to the people and say abortion was banned its trurned back yo the states itself not banned so the people should sue yall for your propaganda lies
"do you really want your govenors making your health care decisions for you and your family
vote for womens right to choose vote for civil rights equal rights  voting rights  climate change  protect your rights  vote for your rights and your childrens future never vote for any election deniers"
lol we havent even gotten to the part of all these babies going to orphanages then over burdening the social system
women in america have now become second hand citizens wow republicans will lose the vote of all women under 40
once that child is born and added to the gdp these terroristic shills on capitol hill and holding office could care less about that child if they cared we wouldnt have child poverty and homelessness in the richest country in the world your oppression is their profession
is birth control illegal
"abortion hasnt been banned just returned to the states where it should be
this is what democracy looks like each state can make its own laws
in ny and california you will be able to abort your kid up to age 21"
it wouldnt be a problem if some of these females stop using it as a form of birth control
liar liar pants on fire its not banned it just means i dont have to pay for it because you cant keep your legs closed or use any sort of contraception
the land of the free huh  unless you are female
"dont let the scammers distract you
biden lures in millions and millions of illegal immigrants bribing them with freebies through the trillions dollar social programs while americans suffering from biden recession high inflation and soaring gas price now you know why the democrats are pushing the voting rights bill  no voter ids the democrooks scam american people voter ids are racist something to remember in the november midterm democrats control wh house senate and you get a trashed us"
what right do these misogynistic old men have to force women to have children america is not free  it has become a place ruled by extremists
go american women how dare these politicians interfere with a womens body and telling them what to do disgusting
most of the horrors people are encountering now have been experienced before this is history repeating itself but this shouldnt not be surprising given that it constitutes essentially a christian crusade
extremism is killing babies as birth control
this is what you get with a totally partisan supreme court and the results of minority rule which goes against the position of the majority of americans americans want to leave the reproductive rights in the hands of each woman whether they themselves are prolife or not
well all those rich people better start building more prisons
its a mostly peaceful abortion ban right mr velshi
abortion is high on a list of concerns to me when i vote this year
now the gop and the supreme court have woken the sleeping giant  opps
abortion is legal killing period muff said lying thieving evil obama administration almost done trump will be back real soon
we should have started castration back in the nineties
the religious people who think the overturn of rvw is a blessing dont know what theyre talking about how is being denied medical treatment for a miscarriage by doctors afraid of going to prison a blessing
i live in washington stateso were ok here for nowim glad voters in kansas voted to uphold abortion rights id like to think and hope that the majority and common sense always wins in the end
men won this issue
"men have been wanting to control women every chance they have gotten  just look at how women are treated around the world
dont go backwards  vote for your rights   lets go girls"
make sure you vote these extremely religious politicians away in the upcoming elections
why people are not having the same response to the law not being applied equally the handling of trumps criminality even taking compromise material hes getting special treatment
the supreme court has fd millions of women over by overturning roe v wadewe will not take this st lying down and women will not be pushed around
a fertilized egg is not a person  there are a million things that can go wrong naturally to prevent it from ever developing even to the point of birth and in the ancient times that these religious nuts want to return to it was iffy for it to survive after that  an adult human being is a person and takes precedence over a pregnancy  many pregnancies end in miscarriage through nobodys fault  many fertilized eggs are defective in some way and should not develop  or they land in a place they cannot develop ectopic pregnancy and become a serious threat to the life of the adult  laws are being made by hopelessly ignorant religious bigots that profoundly affect medical treatment for these wellunderstood conditions as well as manhandling the ability of any woman to make decisions about her own life  its not about somebody frivolously ending a pregnancy on the toss of a coin its about millions of peoples physical emotional and economic survival
abortion is murdering babies  msnbc have you ever seen a late term abortion  they use a suction to remove a baby in parts and chunks  a life being sucked out tearing a living baby in parts out of the womb
for women that think the abortion law is good i only have to say this isnt about whether you think abortion is okay or not  i tried to explain to my daughters this is about having someone else the government telling me what i can do and cant do with my own body  for me it isnt about whether you feel abortion is good or not that is between me and my religion or what is right for me and my family or the particular medical circumstances someone is in  just recently a woman was denied an abortion when the baby she is carrying doesnt have a skull  this is absurd  it was a medical issue  vote these people out  i respect other womens decisions they make for themselves but i do not want my state telling me what decision i can make
yeah some are it means to keep murder illegal it means to enforce that no one is above the law and that if you play around and get knocked up you have to accept the consequences
to all who believe in abortion  most of you if not all do not believe in god or bible but that doesnt mean god do not exist or the bible isnt true but it is and god is real and he is going to judge you and he will judge you and he doesnt play politics you people are murders with no regard for life and you will be judged as such
imagine a man not standing up for his wife and childrens healthcare they are just as bad as politicians
i dont get how anyone is this upset over abortion add it to the november ballot and let the people decide all this crap over laws that went into effect 1920 and before should be thrown out until new ones are replaced
no doctors are leaving dead babies in women who have experienced a miscarriage  stop lying lady
as long as people who call fetuses babies exist this will never get sorted out you cannot reason with people who are unreasonable i think its best just to ignore them vote blue then change the laws to protect womens rights im done with these mooks
hasta la vista baby is what comes to mind when i see this the fetus terminator
a blue vote today keeps the gops deadly laws away
"banning abortion to be even more burdensome on nonwhites and poor whites
nra never replacing anglos playing the game by any means possible legal moral  or not jk
certainly following the taliban  the game book for christian fascists"
the same judges that called roe settled law essentially lying to get on the supreme court can do whatever they want and biden is too worried about the democrats image to stack the court  hes already dropped the ball for a woman right to privacy  lets see what else the court has to undo before biden wakes up
dont like abortion dont get one the government should have no say in your health care
next theyre going to say women cant vote anymore
why are politic stupid people saving what women can or cant doit is not up to them they are disgustingevil people
the republicans want to control american women uteruss this is going to be a major take over by the new democrats  american woman are going change these authoritarian republicans for ever vote blue  keep gross old man out of your wife and daughters uterus
vote blue or leave texas
never forget specially when you hold that ballot in your hand remember your husband pastor slave master wont see who or what you voted for dont be afraid dont allow anyone to intimidate you
whats awesome is now blue states will keep killing their kids and not even having them to begin with while red states will keep havings kids and thus more power
texas really really really doesnt like women huh
oh yes less dead kids what a terrible thing
"ditch the electoral college  for federal elections forget about districts  one person one vote  majority rule  true democracy  the electoral college was designed to keep rich white men in power  imagine gore instead of bush  possibly no sept 11 2001 attack  bush family and binladen family business ties
gore instead of bush possibly more attention to climate change  no electoral college equals no trump presidency  no tossing out of obamas pandemic protocol the majority of voters know whats best  time we listen to them  get rid of the electoral college"
if americans are supposed to have freedom of speech and choice how did this happen
its interesting also that the majority of people that support abortion rights are men because womens rights bro yeah right they just dont want the responsibility when they mess up
men come up with not taking a pill when one is ready by fa men must take the pill
killing babies is whats extreme abortion cant be a right you have to ask yourself where do rights come from hint they dont come from men with robes and pens
if you think your vote is too insignificant to matter try sleeping in a tent with a mosquito
the republicans are setting us back 500 years
america where the only freedom of religion is christian white nationalism where your only liberties is our commands where women and men are not equal where justice for all is only for them get it welcome to our way states of america there is no united anymore foreigners are not welcome here and your only allowed to be rich if your a christian this is what america is turning into fascist
the women will be voting democratic this year
well that takes care of the vaccine argument  people have a choice
a lot of women lost their human rights
libs stay doing nothing of course
would someone please explain to me how 5 people get to decide the fate of millions of women
funny how the gop says its for smaller government but wants to tell women what to do with their own bodies and lives plus they refuse to help mothers and families in any way
99 years n prison for a foetus over a human life i thought men and women were equal why is it that men are leading the way to deny women that right
your citizens must be of interesting intelligence when they only understand things that they can see
are they really though  i think just like all other topics those that caused this to occur wont ever agree they were wrong
its not just about abortion its about treating women half the population  as property again unable to make decisions for themselves for their daughters without the approval of the mainly male lawmakers in america its shocking and shameful and the supreme court needs to be adult enough to admit that they got it wrong and change roe v wade back to how its been for years
see its the dog catching the tire of the moving car it was chasing and is getting beaten to death until they finally let go of this issue of womens rights desantis and abbot are both very likely to lose their governorship this roevember
alot of white babies and white women are going to die  but they didnt take into account this occurring as this is what happens when your politicians are out of touch with society and only go along with a minority group  just so they can feel loved and held in high regard by a bunch of sheep  baaaaaaa baaaaaa    they only want the black babies to die not the white ones
no the dog has gotten in front of the back tire while the car is going forward it is only a matter of if the car goes over the dog
texass is a laughably backward state
what the abortion ban really means is a woman forced to carry a fetus with no skull to term
contraception learn them use them dont tell me about the exceptions abortion requirements would be cut in half
i live in tn and we already had restrictions before the overturn now we are just screwed ill say this until i die if you dont have a uterus you get no say in the matter
the supreme church has totally lost the respect and admiration of the general population  they are a backward draconian pack of christian fascists

you take our rights  we take your jobs just ask trump
women should be mad  all women have a right to control there own bodies  dont let the antiabortion radicals win  vote blue all the way in nov
it is like they had 40 years to think this through but like everything on the conservative side they make it all binary youre either a babykiller or not but there are so many variables and the american public has never been over 35 on absolutely no abortion any time for any reason the incredibly out of touch supreme court has its lowest ratings ever now but clarence thomas wants to go even furtherno birth control for any reason their ratings would be under 5 of they go there
for every woman who dies because of a medical situation where an abortion would have saved her life that womans family should  have that states governor legislators  attorney generals  charged with murder of the patient then sue that state into bankruptcy
if your the age 18 n 50     vote   blue   blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue  fight for what you need and going forward 
this is exactly what biden was talking about when he characterized maga extremists as semifascists these people despise freedom democracy civil rights  you name it they are desperate to impose an actual medieval theocracy on america wake up
abortion is not specifically in the bible but lying is cheating is murder is divorce is fornication is and christians everywhere including priest and pastors break these commands daily go work on your pathetic selves and leave us normal folks alone
"my first thought of this scotus ruling was  welcome to the horror show  and its coming  
we will all understand the difference between a red state and a blue state   i think there will be way more blue states soon  the pendulum has already started the other way  it will gain momentum  even mcconnell sees it  he will die in office before leaving somehow 45 has decreed it by telling him to get out  in other weird premonitions i dont think biden is gonna make it two more years he will make harris the first woman president but i doubt she is reelected for a full term she will lose in the dem primary to god only knows who  by then 45 will be on a never ending court cycle"
see this is what happens when you get distracted by tiktok and instagram and whatever kim kardashian is wearing
"liberals stop killing babies meanwhile 
under the joe biden economy say goodbye to your 114 social security raise in 2023"
texas is currently being run by the christian version of the taliban expect to soon see women being publicly stoned for seeking an education
protesting is ok  voting is much better  get up and vote
yes millions of the innocent unborn are saved from willful murder behind the excuse of court  invented  rights
extreme republicans are more than happy to accept dead women as collateral damage for their authoritarian control over them
as a republican i just want to say i totally support abortion especially if the parents are democrats
make anyone involved lose their political career anyone whose election you have a say in
abbott sues his neighbor for getting crippled while chopping down his neighbors tree illegally paxton proudly wears the white hood and bankrupts black businesses  yep my state of texas  
its especially despicable that not only do some conservative women haters want children to grow up in situations where they cannot or will not be cared for they also want to ban abortions in the case of ectopic pregnanciesunviable medical pregnancies where the woman is absolutely certain to die and the not even fetus will never develop past a lump of cells its unfathomable
as a human being who still has hope for humanity how can anyone sing the national anthem with pride and conviction the land of the free thats a joke surely
im pro life  it also believe early on  it shouldve an option but this abortion thing is being horribly misused its not meant to be birth control 600000 babies a year murdered is ridiculous why are these people so blown away that other people have a difference of opinion if the people of a certain state vote as a majority they dont want abortion and youre not willing to be accountable for your sexual acts then i suggest you move
"in the very near future in the states which have the most serious criminal penalties it will be impossible to find an md in an er who has been trained  and has the skill necessary  to perform the medical  surgical care a woman in an emergent crisis must receive in order to live   medical schools in these states will not teach these procedures on the basis that state law does not permit a qualified md to actually perform them during an mds medical practice  

women in a crisis rushing to an er hoping for the care they need will instead be hundreds of miles away from an er which is prepared for these events  its only a matter of time before news breaks of women dying in ambulances or during an air lift if that is they have health care coverage for those transports or enough of their own money to try to save their own lives  

those deaths will be but one consequence of the patchwork of state laws which exist now or will be extant across the nation in a matter of weeks"
emtala protects women who need urgent care sue the state doctors hospitals schools or anyone else that tries to prevent that its federal law it supersedes all state laws
if men could get pregnant abortion clinics would be like starbucks one on every other corner
with trump and the sick extremists he put on the supreme court were going to see history being made in this coming midterm the party in power sweeps its way back into power again this disgusting criminal grifter will keep destroying the republican party until theres nothing  no one left
ultra maga riding the massive red wave in 2022 and 2024
the antiabortion movement is purely class warfare rich people will always have access to abortions poor and working people dont nothing creates a more desperate employee willing to work for lower wages and under poor working conditions than somebody with a child and nothing prevents poor and working class people from getting an education and competing with rich kids for jobs than a baby to take care of
the republicans are the american taliban
we need neutral supctjustices impeach the judges that lied during their confirmation hearings 
this is the only program i have seen that dares to say one word about the families suffering unnecessarily this is a travesty and unworthy of america we are not perfect but this is beyond savage
totally not acceptable by republican leaders its totally wrong to have government take away your rights im voting to make sure we have more democrats in the washington this november
people dont understand the meaning of total ban maybe they just didnt think about the implications for themselves if they were to need pregnancyrelated life saving treatment heres your death panels
wait till the see what it means to be a trump for president 2024 supporter 100 times what you see here
when people vote republicans lose gone are the days of voter apathy we all saw the disastrous results of that back in 16
imagine a blue tsunami of victories across the board in 2022 then biden gets reelected in 24 with a 47 approval rating imagine the msg that would send  the panic that would set in with the republican party they cheated  it didnt help even worse by 2025  26 2024 republican candidates are being arrested across the country for mass election fruad if that happens the last republican to run for president would run in the 28 election
"strength in numbers
to all dissenters brave enough to take it to the streets  brava "
christian confederate conservatives just have nothing better to do   not understanding how they are pro life and against abortion and also against welfare and support programs for single mothers getting government assistance thats why voting red is like shooting yourself in the foot voting blue you just have to fight to keep your guns and gas prices low 
yet releasing toxic pollutants into the air and water is ay ok drive through texas in the small towns its a toxic waste dump a thirdworld country
the answer is leave if you can
"apparently its got to the point where nobody can openly express their opinion anymore 327 women mask up to avoid persecution by christian taliban for taking part in a demonstration against abortion laws

opus dei paid 16 billion to buy scotus to undo roe thats how much women and girls are worth to the holy mafia end citizens united
sounds more like an up graded trafficking scheme to me
if abbot and his cronies dont want to obey federal laws about providing proper healthcare what makes you think theyll go along with election results texas is a potential jan 6
its not just about abortion  using their religious beliefs to control another persons life is violating our constitutional rights  this is a religiously free country
if preforming or receiving an abortion is a felony biden needs to give a blanket pardon
this could be kicked around like a political football  this being womens bodies and lives
the radical right needs to mind their own business
if men could actually get pregnant this wouldnt even ever be a debate it just wouldnt happen no discussions would be heard not a single person would say or be able to say a single word in regards to this situation
back off men you rule everything let women make this one big choice on their own  how dare you
land of the free denying human rights to half the population
so if its up to 99 years in prison for a woman that has an abortion then abbott should face 99 years in prison for manslaughter for each and every woman that dies from not be able to get an abortion to save her life
shows us how out of touch the rep are with women
99 years in prison for seeking healthcare  why not just stone women to death  murderers dont even get that kind of sentence  i swear the gop wont be happy until women are required to wear burkas and chastity belts for life  american taliban
some states are already talking about banning birth control missouri is one
want change dont only vote donate to a group that is fighting for what you want done and volunteer to help peace to all
i think this goes into two different camps the first is appalled realizing the unintended consequences of having a total abortion ban and the second doesnt care if women die they are perfectly fine with that
for 40 years the only thing you heard was right to life and my bible says now they care suddenly about the rights of the motherthis is your gop base complete lack of foresight
abortion is murder
who are going to take care of the millions of babies born in america after babies are rejected and abandoned in  hospitals across the country are they  willing to lock up parent for abandoning their babies
how did the republicans supreme court think this was a good idea  vote blue america  freedom for democracy 
first vote in the democratic primaries to ensure that we get candidates that will really fight for our rights and for whats right 
the disgusting gqp men are holding american women hostage in creating their own personal wealth and societal growth
pro choice is the only way to go
register to vote locate all voting places near you and vote blue or kiss womens health goodby then what will the republicans ban next and after that
it sounds like she wants babies to die
here in texas they should let the people decide and vote on it abbott would never let that happen we need to get rid of these republicans running our state vote them out
actually not having access to legal abortions can get a lot uglier  i remember the sixties when this started to be openly discussed
im in texas and i am so embarrassed by the gov and others abortion rights and voter rights infact the state aborted voters rights to stay in power roevember
i suspect well see most states pass laws putting abortion on a firmer statebystate basis than roe ever did and as the conservative justices knew would happen within 10 years i suspect there will only be three or four states who ban or highly restrict abortion these will be the four or five where there is a genuine majority against abortion
hes a handsome advocate  why does the media think all republicans are against abortion it is a flat out lie
the biggest problem with america  one country but in reality is 50 countries rolled up in one each state its own laws  who has the upper hand there is no united
forcing your religious beliefs on someone else is just wrong wrong wrong  what abortion law ever forced you to have one cite that law for me please
always always always keep this in mind when deciding where you stand on this issue if men got pregnant this would be a total nonissue spoken as a man who knows how powerhungry men like politicians think
just remember texas you voted for these people and in the primaries you voted for them again
"vote so there wont be a need for recounts 
we need to win by huge numbers so theres no room for the gop to lie"
she is absolutely right
if these socalled christians were real christians theyd be healing metaphysicaly as jesus did  told his followers to do instead of trying to force their own ungodly will on others
hyperbolic fearmongering channel not newssensationalism and propaganda
if you dont like abortion then dont have one
"red states are blocking abortion trigger laws

gop regret rushing roe they panicked over the hearings"
the meaning of mess around and find out
vote vote and vote to all women lets stand together and vote all the the republicans out republican will let us die
the taliban is moving in
if texas sees a fetus as a human can it be insured i mean if you have no choice can you at least make sure should it go bad you can afford to pay the medical bills or will they allow pregnancy insurance so like after 9mnths you get a pay out for medical fees and extra things for this human real question usa medical fees are crazy are yall at least getting paid for the risk you have to have the baby did they at least increase maternity leave to at least 6 mnths paternity leave what are the benefits of this law
america so backwards
"345
if leaders dont support their constituents having access to abortion its obvious 
the women and their loyal familymembers will vote someone else
dictators wont prevail in a democracy"
christian extremism is as bad as any religious extremism and texas is becoming like the centralist republic of mexico ruled by santa anna
good grief texas maternal mortality capital of the first world so much  winning
single mother of five  here i support roe wade  bc i dont want my kids having to have  kids  bc they have to i want them to have options is their life  ik no one  came to help me  with my kids  were where all dose  glorious religious ppl  only ik  what i went thru  day by day raising my kids  and  last time i didnt vote  these time  i will get my asup to vote   blue  come on we can bring it back just the way  it was vote vote  plz
america is becoming an extremist roman catholic nation in which women are not considered equal to men
personally think abortion is disgusting but dont see as how you should be allowed to tell someone their not allowed to have one if they choose too
how come we cant get ar15s in california  this is ameruca isnt it  usa 
republicans are americas taliban
dont be mad if a pregnant woman is using the carpool lane
if mary whos childs father was absent had had an abortion we would not have any christian evangelicals and the world would probably be a better place
"nope
all phony"
"what boggles my mind is that a they forget back when abortions were illegal or in other countries that have similar laws and b they have no longterm thought process what happens when people are forced to carry children they dont want people were getting backdoor abortions which werent always safe and hygenic often dying in the process women died in pregnancychildbirth because something went wrong and the doctors were unable to give them the care they needed more babies with lifechanging disabilities and problems are born causing stress on a system that already has limited healthcare unwanted children are more likely to be mistreated or abused the already problematic foster care and adoption systems become bloated with kids babies start getting dumped even more so than they already are and thats not even touching the issues weve seen lately where children are being forced to carry their rapists baby despite the danger to a body and psyche that is not yet fully mature
yep that sounds like a great plan sarcasm"
people couldnt even understand a viral infección which was covid you want me to believe they understand the medical complexity of an abortion hahahaha 
roe row row your vote
more and more what they do down there makes me wish texas had never joined the unionsighs
"school shootings fact of life 
police executing black people fact of life
little girls being forced to miscarry to term now also a fact of life"
perhaps thomas jeffersons 1802 letter to the danbury baptist association concerning the separation of church and state should actually be added to the constitution to keep religious beliefs out of law
whether you agree with abortion or not it is none of the governments business health care should be between the woman and her doctor and nobody else
make it a blue tsunami in roevember
so naive to think that banning abortion stops abortions it hands it over to exploiters drunks extortionists quacks people who have lost medical licenses for a reason and desperate teenagers it massively increases the number of pregnancy deaths of mothers the number of babies born damaged by medications and chemo because mothers whose periods stopped during illness realised they were pregnant too late for these new deadlines the number of babies killed soon after birth the number of babies abandoned soon after birth the number of babies born into massively dysfunctional families who end up being horrendously treated and republicans be prepared for tax increases to support the number of people who will need total long term care because of being born with catastrophic congenital conditions
all these ppl picking up cardboard never picked up a condom 
people forget god flooded the earth killing everyone except one family even god kills
think of these women who are waiting for the outcome of these lawsuit i cant imagine their despair please hurry up
we need to impeach clarence thomas
we now live under white christian talibanic laws
"that antiabortion dog has been chasing that abortion car for 50 years and now it looks like the dog has finally caught the car 
now it looks like the dog has gotten its teeth stuck in the tire"
i want to be a mom one day but i know pregnancy has massive complications keeping it prochoice is the only choice for me when voting
the horrors we will see i work in ld and i am afraid
"fascist  putin trump kkk  neonazis  maga  nra  jim crow  jim jones  fox
vote blue"
one important difference between now and prior to roe is that women and those who support their rights of self will not be silent this is a critical difference and one that can make far reaching positive changes across all areas of our lives
this is why all or nothing politics is the wrong way to go   compromise is necessary in a civilized society  lawmakers should never vote on anything without knowing all the facts  it is blatantly ignorant to assume you know everything about an issue you are voting for  i personally need all the facts before i can form an opinion and im not making decisions that impact the whole country  it blows my mind that citizens and politicians vote for bills they havent actually read
"over the past 50 years roe has brought nothing but extreme promiscuity depravity and  mores decay this resulted to the destruction of the family as we knew it 

we didnt know things would get so bad when they promoted and encouraged abortion in the 70s but now we know 50 years ago we could claim ignorance but not this time passing a law that promotes or encourages abortion would undeniably be a curse this time please men stay away from this 

you dont have to be religious or a god fearing person to see how bad society has become  as a man if you dont stand up for something in life you will fall for anything and everything 

life is sacred  we should protect it and cherish it at any cost 

ty"
what about the women in texas and florida who cannot afford to move to a better state
i dare you to give a thumbs up show your support for medical adoptionmaybe one day it will save someone you love 
vote blue in roevember toss out these angry old white men who have no idea what they are talking about no uterus then you dont get to decide for those who have one
any woman or anyone who assists a woman in soliciting an abortion who is arrested is a political prisoner
absolute and utter madness put in place for political reasons without due care of women is absolute madness
"vote blue this november
in effort to overreach the supreme court has awaken a sleeping giant  it is obvious that the sc is absolutely out of touch with the millennials bearing age and the power of social media they will find out in november  
all the ultra right has but but inflation and gas prices and the whole world knows that those two factors are a global phenomenon due to covid19 putin war supply chainshipments companies taking advantage due to greed greedy corporations greedy republican multibillionaires and more"
which would result in more child abuse forcing women to raise a child they dont want or forcing the fathers to raise children resulting from having a good time
if you dont want your rights taken away vote the entire democrat slate in november
the disclaimer under the video why not give us the exact details  snap the neck of the baby while in the womb and pull it out
another of america moaned about wearing a mask in a pandemic was taking their freedoms away no a real issue of over turning roe v wade it really sinks in about what a freedoms are and how they impact you when taken away as you know it
imprison dtrumphis children alike republicans judge thomasginni   seize all assets pensions  liquidate for the people 10 concurrent life sentences 
would the supreme court justices be like the president and are above being sued who would handle that as the 5 justices who voted to rescind roe should be held accountable for deaths related to their decision but who would handle the case
to bad the abortion activists mothers didnt decide for an abortion  it could have saved the rest of us from having to see such ugly obese and  disgusting people
we need atheists in the supreme court evangelicals are cancerous and a threat to democracy
keep up the good work thank you for the fight women are awesome  abbot is out of his mine so is his knuckl head assist governor that want older folks to die for what ever he can go
stop the christofascist takeover of america the world is watching and emulating this fascism vote blue november 22
women will help vote them all out traitors vote blue
i cant believe that women have to fight this battle in 2022 surreal
message for gregg abbot texas governor you want to punish women for having an abortion you want abortion providers to serve long prison sentences and pay enormous fines for merely helping women yet you support the former president who currently is the worst criminal in us history having botched the covid pandemic and therefore is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths he incited the jan 6 2021 insurrection that killed five people injured many law officers and did serious damage to our capitol now he is under investigation by the doj for stealing classified documents from the white house that very likely has endangered lives around the world and caused great fear for millions how you can hold any political office is a mystery to me after your numerous failures especially the uvalde tragedy  i hope voters in texas do the only thing that will make sense to most if those who live there elect beta orourke on nov 8 and send you packing along with your corrupt enablers and sycophants
the history of christianity  and all religions  should warn us against allowing them any control of us torture burnings castration of little boys to keep the childlike voices to praise god anti science dont listen to religious zealots religion is not good for you
republicans cant wage war on women and still hope to win elections
what bothers me most is that scotus made all women of america into 2nd class citizens overnight
midterm manipulation to scam female voters
these people have no regards for life  they love mutilation of the unborn
"women brought this bann on themselves with the 1 million abortions for 19 years straight abusing the system over 19 million abortions from 1993 to 2012

most unwanted pregnancies came from promiscuity not from rapes there needs to be access but it needs to be regulated  tracked

noone should be forced to have a child but those that abuse the system should face consequences its not the doctors its the loose women making it bad for everyone like the criminals in society make it bad for the rest of us theres always those that abuse the system even with abortions  that should be addressed nationally"
its crazy to me how mad people get about not being able to murder there offspring
"anti choicers are pro life only until birth and then its fend for yourself republicans are hypocrites unless each and every anti choice hypocrite has a house full of adopted unwanted children they need to stfu they have no right to tell women what to do with their own bodies 
i think the scotus should pass a law that all men get vasectomies so women stop getting pregnant men getting women pregnant has created this problem if men didnt impregnate a woman she wouldnt need an abortion vasectomies for all men"
abortion rights are very important to me
i feel like im living in afghanistan the misogyny in this country is insane
"the issue here you have those pathetic justices republicans states that have decided that woman dont have any rights that is pathetic dont want any pathetic republicans infringing my constitutional rights
leave your cristian believes on your rear end
your are there to protect our rights shame on all of you"
"i cant wait til the day a daughter of a right wing crazy gets pregnant not intentionally 
then there will be change 

but we just need to vote out the nuts"
you wanted biden you got him
it is now in the hands of the states to decide that is how our country works dont like it vote or move
denying a woman a lifesaving emergency abortion does not protect the fetus if the woman dies her fetus dies too republicans dont seem to grasp this
this is crazy
biden has tough enough time choose what for breakfast shouldnt be make decisions that affects people lives when republicans defeat u biden hope they put u and your son in jail
im so glad i had a vasectomy already got screwed over once by a woman wasnt about to ever let that happen again i wish they would make it mandatory for all men no sperm donations just snip and no more kiddos then women can focus on complaining about everything thing else in their existence
i hope this inspires people to vote
"repugnitians need to be disbanded after failing the country so badly 
t rump mrdisinfectant killed over 4500 directly 
tge his faliure on cocid lead to to thousands more deaths  
they have so much nerve trying this reverse of rowe vs wade 
throw them out 
they do not represent voters clearly"
the majority of the states that banned abortion supported slavery during the civil war   just saying
"we must absolutely gain an overwhelming majority in both the house and senate that makes it possible to codify the right to choice and right to abortion permanently into federal law in a way that does not allow individual states any leeway to override it or the supreme court to nullify it

it should have been down a long time ago"
margret sanger the founder of planned parenthood  negros and other undesirables must be eliminated
register to vote and vote out all the people who want to control 52 of the population
"so what youre saying  is  even though a majority of women were protesting making their voices heard republican slammed the door in their faces and ignored them now the small government party has put the government directly in the bedroom of every woman and disenfranchised half the population and they are surprised about it
heres something  if you are opposed to abortion then dont get one"
"
vote for your rights
vote the authoritarian republican party out
authoritarianenforcing strict obedience to authority especially that of the government at the expense of personal freedom"
texas is what lack of separation of church and state looks like note this quote from their constitution the last part you can be excluded from public office if you refuse to acknowledge the existence of a supreme being its appalling how did they get away with still having that in there since 1876 sec 4 religious tests no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust in this state nor shall any one be excluded from holding office on account of his religious sentiments provided he acknowledge the existence of a supreme being feb 15 1876
only in america you guys voted for those republicans voted for trump to tip the balance in scotus and now you are crying about the damage that is done shouldnt have let those persons come to power in the first place but still you all proclaim to be number one and the best in the world good luck with that nobody believes you anymore
save the babiesabortions is a sin
"as a disabled us army veteran and christian i dont understand why other christians think they have the right to force thier beliefs down the throats of others this is not christlike behavior and thinking
    its pretty simple if youre against abortion then dont get one no one is forcing anyone to get an abortion i served so everyone has the right to make thier own choiceseven if they may differ from mine freedomchoice"
and the elderly disabled and vetrerans  the worst aspect is that they lie about these issues  thats the crazy making which is the ultimate destruction of a society
i had no idea 15 of pregnancies result in miscarriages arent miscarriages gods little abortions
there is a similar country that enforces laws such as this the us was there for 20 years
why arent prolifers handing out free diapers and formulaif they care so much
people see what happens when religious people have power aka voting for republicans
when prochoice became the law  support for prolife have gone to so many extreme measure including murder
this is creating a huge blue  wave
calling a woman who has an abortion a murderer is like calling me a lumberjack for plucking an oak seedling from my lawn antichoicers are absolutely ridiculous
denying emergency healthcare to women experiencing miscarriage is egregious vote these mofos out
"you accept
life starts at conception 
 not first breathe as adam was birthed
 you agree god numbered our days when there were yet none of them
then trust god  forgive as you have been forgiven"
"woman are going to take down the republicans for this
never underestimate the power of woman"
i have never been more grateful to live in washington state than i am at this point in time
115  texas doesnt want to comply with federal law that says you have to give emergency care to pregnant women who come into a hospital in a crisis situation  they dont want to do that until shes on deaths door  the one key word that has been inexplicably missing from all of these discussions is misogyny  this needs to change just as biden has now found the courage to say the fword fascism
"the sextreme court is out of control or maybe were going to be under their control 
these catholics are neo fascist christian nationalists and will if they get a chance force us all to have to participate in their blood magic rituals and death cult theology
i will not drink the blood of someone or eat the body of someone even an imaginary one just because old white men in dresses have the audacity to say they they know what that made up being is"
why is it illegal to smash a condor egg its not a condor  bird eggs have more rights than human babies
tell that to the babies that were aborted i bet they  kind of took that personal id imagine
i think you forget the fact that the only thing rowe vs wade did was move the decision back to states where there is more ability to hear and put into law the will of the people it requires an answer from medical doctors ethical contemplation and social considerations the killing of the most innocent amongst us is a community decision regardless of what any one person feels about it if there is a point where the mother is at risk due to her pregnancy then intervention of a medical doctor is of course available so lets not misrepresent or lie about that fact when you lie on your news in attempt to trick your listeners into your narrative you lose all credibility and it exposes your insincerity in the matter you are discussing it proves how little you care because you are lying about it and are not operating in the reality of facts because your real aim is to control your listeners for a political narrative that is just a display of how little you care about anyone
it was a surefire way to get everyone to vote against republicans silver lining
arrest the khasarian fake news mafia
its being mislabeled as christian nationalism its actually christian fascism
"abortion rights 
you mean baby rights"
"death to the fascist republikkkan party

vote blue and watch the magic happen"
roevember get government out of my uterus  enough  vote these magas out
no man should be allowed to govern a womans body if it were not for their participation this potentially would not be a matter
people are seeing what it really means to ban abortion so lets otherwise convince it forward
the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states
fake christian fascists have taken over scotus and the country
religion in churches and at home nowhere else
it is time to crack down on religion no more tax exempt status and a nationwide education program teaching people how truly ignorant and evil religion is
its the turn for juries to have a voice let republicans whine when juries refuse to convict
the fact that the father doesnt get a say in whether his child is aborted or not is unconscionable
where is abortion banned
just like 1980s moral majority our radical rightwing extremists are very immoral and they are definitely a minority put all our issues on the ballot and lets have our representatives do what we want them to do
letting women get close to dying while doctors are on the phone to their lawyers because they are worried about going to jail is the result of this ban  this is ridiculous  how is this health care   ninetynine years to life as a punishment  murders dont get that
forced motherhood is female enslavement
just wonder who would accomplish most protest from baby killers for birth control that work at mcdonalds or protesting farmers and truckers that transport supplies
religious zealots are the worst
abortion bans harm the most vulnerable poc poor people and children children are vulnerable especially according to rainn statistics every 68 seconds an american is sexually assaulted and every 9 minutes that victim is a child a person can get pregnant as soon as they get their periods there are children under 8 with periods heck the youngest i could find was an 8monthold girl who was reported to have had period blood in her diapers it disgusts me because i am a survivor of childhood sexual violence and im shocked at how common it is
more like the car running over the dogs head it seems to me

the right evangelical neofascists now control the reproductive rights of 66 of all us women  donald trumps gift to the right via scotus appointments
i dont understand how is voting going to change this law back biden and all the democrats have an opportunity to increase the court now but they dont  im not sure how voting blue will make roe v wade reverse
the silver lining could be that some of the women who are going to experience these emergencies are going to be the ones who supported making abortions illegal that will be a major eyeopener or an eye closer if they end up losing their lives because of it but stubbornness can be a strong force and martyrdom is applauded by some time to vote
jazz how scary what a crazy country the us is its so sick in so many ways
no matter how strict republican men make abortion legislation they still cannot get pregnant no matter how hard they try
hypocrite republicans like lauren boebert who is ok with having abortions herself but will vote to deny other women has no place in politics
joe biden on the cutting edge of boomer politics   watch out kkk gonna get yer mama
banning abortion is impossible only legal safe abortion can be banned
i like to how women feel that the states owns there body 
definitely bigger crowds than the rallies of the politicians responsible for the overturn bigger than the insurrection itself ill bet they hate those pictures of peaceful protest they should be very worried the insurrectionists are in jail or convicted and cant vote most maga are liars about actually voting these protestors and women will vote
these selfrighteous selfserving evangelicals act like the most oppressed people on earth where theyre trying to push their religion on everyone else keep your religion that you mixed with your politics out of womens uteruses apparently they want small government the republicans small enough to use women and tell black people know your place as every republican is crying to bring back the glory days of white christian nationalism
its time for all to rise above this political madness i will vote  for womans health we must unite and fight this injustice we need more kindness  grace 
so if you have cancer  get pregnant you will have to stop your cancer treatment unless it harms the pregnancy  thats worse than having cancer

solution to problem  say no to mens advances and keep your legs together  or is that too much to ask of todays women
"republicans dont care about womens lives
all they care about are tax cuts and power"
women now have the same rights as men in a case of pregnancy when privileged people get treated equal it feels like oppression
"even the so call god believed in abortion 

numbers 51131"
they wrote these laws against abortion to be as cruel as possible because that was the point and this was never about a life this was about control and these people want to control their property quote unquote back and what is their property you ask everything women and anyone who doesnt share their skin tone included
i stand for the people who require care and rights for their own body because they are more important than a bunch of cells

"california has a measure on the november ballot to make abortion access normal in our state  it is proposition 1 and money against it is again being poured into our state to undermine 
women  we must vote to normalize our health care and take care of the 50 of the population that is female or pregnant possible  my abortion was in 1965  it was very expensive  difficult
to arrange  but it was a very simple surgery and i have no regrets and no guilt  never have had  has anyone looked into what it is to be an opus dei catholic  all 5 of the justices who voted to
overturn roe are opus dei catholic recommended by the neo fascist federalist society"
i live in missouri and i hope that the women and men in my state wake up and vote out the politicians who banned abortion in my state how many women will suffer and die because of this why do these republicans want to see women die vote blue this year
religious people need to keep their beliefs to themselves  and keep thier noises out of others lives until the clump of cells can live on its own and not leaching off of the womans body its not a person  its a clump of cells  just like cancer is and if the person doesnt want a clump of cells growing in them and leaching off of them and possibly costing them thier lives they have that right to have it removed  any person who believes that they have a right to control what someone does with thier own body deserves a trip through maximum security prison for a few months  they can experience what not controlling what is happening to your body feels like
you say people are finally seeing what happens when you outlaw row versus wade but people already know what would happen if youre outlawed road versus wade because its happened before anyone old enough to tell you the horror stories of relatives who had to get back out abortions but of course these men who lived through that time said we should do that again
unfortunately the american taliban in the scotus cant be voted out

and you can always vote them out later without any of them trying to overthrow the government and destroy your votes"
evangelicals who say theyre good christians because they care about the unborn baby but then dont support funding for healthcare food stamps and other family welfare programs sure are awful christians
what it now means is democrats will keep control of congress

it would be interesting if margert attwood handmaidens tale and anita diamant who wrote the red tent had a conversation and what would that sound like
133 youre wrong they dont even want to do it when the woman is on deaths door these people think that a dead baby is more valuable than sentient human womans life who has been using resources for decades they want a bunch of babies they can mold into being illiterate race baiting taxpayers
if you dont want a child use birthcontrol 
remember when red hats brayed that all people would care about was inflation and gas prices 
"from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand matthew 417

does anyone out there remember being a fetus or being born abortion is necessary needs to be reformed not just have the baby and see what happens too many circumstances involved poor quality of living if complications mother could die or zero nurturing
just tell republicans that you feel that your baby is a democrat theyll let you in
abortion is not a right and just staying out of peoples private lives is an inane argument that ignores the moral recognition of human life within the womb pregnancy should end with birth and life respected always
"heres something republican jesus freaks may not have thought about which is people can and often do say they believe in something when they know there wont be any consequences its a big reason why so many claim to be religious

but with abortion now there will be consequences and they will effect conservative women just as much if not more so than any other group  and were already seeing signs some of them are now thinking you know maybe i dont really think abortion is murder after all"
there are 18 states that allow abortions  oh and washington dc too i almost forgot  it may be a further drive but saying its banned is kind of poor reporting especially since its obvious that there are states where you can have this procedure accomplished
once again the religion posions everythin

i was thinking about buying shares incompanies who manufactures birth control since abortion is or no longer be an option in many ststesany opinions
if republicans only would have known women demand the sovereignty over their own lives they would have asked the supreme court to wait until after the midterms who would have thought women dont want to go back to the dark medieval times when they were part of the possessions of men not republicans
these radical nutcases need mental health evaluations before they are installed in governmental positions if they were later deemed to be lying they need to be terminated
this is what happens when you mix religious beliefs with biologysciencereality
roe v wade wasnt decided because people loved abortion it was because women kept dying so the system changed itll go back just have to see a lot of women die first
"put it on the ballot in every state
let the people decide whether or not they want abortion in their states  get the government out of the abortion issue"
"and texas will reelect  abbott  and those pushing this because  they  put party over what is best for themselves

i wouldnt drive my uterus through a fascist fiefdom they might not let it leave also i wouldnt risk having to buy 50 cents worth of gas and giving them a penny of tax support these are flyover fiefdoms

well women are second class citizens  it would be interesting if women end up losing their rights to crossing state lines let alone drive by themselves and have to have a male family member in the car and if crossing state lines women and teen girls have to pull over and step in a out door bathroom and take a test to prove shes not pregnant and get questioned as to why your going to your destination

old men have no right telling women what they can or cant do with their own bodies
the republican party has spent the last 50 years working up to the point where they could gain control of scotus and overturn roe and during all that time they never realized they were on the wrong side of 80  of the voting public    thats kinda like trump surrounding himself with a circle of would be felons and surprised that someone dimed him out on the stolen docs     color me shocked 
i still believe it was bought  a conspiracy to distract americans while were fleeced by the oil companies and the corrupt system politicians who allow them  something to fight for instead of fighting the higher price of oil  even though the demand keeps falling with every ev sold  like i said just a conspiracy i believe  why else would they do something so blatantly stupid if it wasnt for money
"democracy is on the ballot

i am against abortion in general but there are certain circumstances that must be considered desantis needs to be gone his purpose is purily selfish he has gone way overboard with everything

"this is a horrible situation for the women of america 
incomplete miscarriages cannot be medically treated until the life of the woman is in danger
there are no humanitarian considerations happening in these circumstances and the quality of life of these women going forward is in serious jeopardy"
conservative today means we need to go back before the age of enlightenment say maybe the dark ages
republicans know that the only way to get elected is to cheat so what do you expect them to do
if the democrats women as well as men cant see what the republicans are trying to do to 50 of american citizens then i feel very sorry for women in the usa you all have a chance on november 8 to make sure that this will never happen by going to vote in masses you cant let it happen vote vote vote

"we see more media propaganda 
    abortion is not banned the supreme court examined the constitution and found that nowhere within the framework of this document is there any mention of abortion they came to the realization that roe was an improper decision and they corrected it  now the subject of abortion or abortive procedures goes back to the state legislatures where it shouldve been in the beginning
    it is now the duty of activist on both sides of the issue both sides of the issue prochoice and pro life to convince their elected state representatives to do the job that they were elected to do  some states will allow abortion and aborted procedures and others wont what we are seeing is democracy in action we need to support democracy"
thats a hideous and fallacious analogy with a  dog hitting a car clearly you and katie phang have a contempt and disregard fo dogs and moreover the analogy is fallacious because the differences are greater than the simliarities

oh the bots are out in the comments section
"aww look at the desperate trolls trying to convince the other 70 of the population that antiabortion is more popular you trolls are laughable at best but pathetic would be the more accurate description

scotus and republicans sealed their fate when they went after women new voter registration among women is at an all time high all polls are shifting and popularity for those who are in support of a womans right to choose is off the charts

magats better get their kleenex ready because youre about to see what happens when you motivate the voters we outnumber you neofascists by a lot by a whole lot"
people are seeing the result of democrats failing to protect and codify roe for the past 40 years  turns out campaigning on the pledge of protecting rights  and the fear of losing rights  is preferable to actually doing something that would have prevented this
red wave coming to congress
republican candidates will pay the piper come roevember

well i am happy the women are rising against the man system to make the females baby factories
we must come together and vote out all communist christians they are the very false witnesses that the bible warns us of
democrats are obsessed with abortion why is it so hard for 21st century women to prevent pregnancy with easily obtained birth control
this is to distract you from the fact that hunters laptop and ashleys diary are not russian disinformation like they told you which means joe is a pedo  democrats constantly lie and report it as truth
i guess they never need kids just unborn baby they dont want

abortion is wrong it is murder i am thankful these men are standing up and trying to get through to these selfish women
it is sad how people get singed of as creeps for trying to stop the killing of a child
"abortions are and always will be one of the most sick and wicked acts one could commit smh

once i researched and saw a video on something called partial abortion i realized how cruel and aweful abortions truly are 

people should stand in front of clinics such as these and protest  "
goddamn these people need to get a life
it is so so sad that it is necessary to have escorts in order for women to make their own choices regarding their own bodies 
before a child is born these people are so eager to protect it but after a child is born  they leave the child into the world to suffer substandard elementary education substandard high school education no healthcare no free college no parental leave for parents and no government aid i think abortion is a lot less cruel than letting the child come and live in the usa

"this video is so freaking bias if they were telling the truth they would say that those embryosfetuses have a heart beat brain signals feelings and pain that they are brutally killed alive in their mothers womb while they have each of their members pulled twisted and pulled until its dismembered off their bodies each arm and legs then the body is pinched and pulled to achieve the same goal  rip off everything into pieces  until only the head is floating around into their womb and then the abortionist crushes it down with a tongue tool and sucks everything left with and intra vaginal vacuum minutes earlier though there was a happy and peaceful baby protected at hisher mother womb the most sacred place they couldshould be 
and ohh before i forget they also forget to tell the women that shell most likely live forever with emotional and spiritual andor physical damage  things that can vary from like hating men and having hard relationship issues way higher chances of all sorts of cancer depression anxiety suicidal thoughts and tendencies having their uterus perforated during the procedure having a hard time trying to get pregnant again in the future when its desired having nightmares with that lost child feeling empty and hollow like they are only existing and like theres no life left for them and yes even dying 
so yes while you all celebrate and fight for the right to kill another human being  a powerlessness one  while you celebrate this oppression to the weak this ability to kill the most pure being that youll ever face that one that can love you like nothing else cure your heart and bring you strength like only god can you deny the fact that your killing your soul in the process and that youre losing hope for your own self youre getting cozy in hell good luck and keep finding excuses to let the devil slowly carry you down to denial as you say to yourself all is well but you know you cant even find the light switch of your own existence anymore 
i hope though that when you realize that your inside of one of the darkest and the deepest hole that you could be living in i hope youll know and remember that theres one that died for your sins and that hes waiting for you with open arms with immeasurable love and peace that hes the only one capable to offer i hope your path into repentance will help you to find healing together with your real self while enjoying the real freedom that living with christ can only bring he lives"
thinking its ok to murder an unborn child is sick

women the way to take control back from men is not to have sex with them if they dont want to legalize abortion they have a right to their body but we dont have a right to ours

"if people appreciate the value of existence then they should realize that life will be faced with hardships both expected and unexpected when faced with a decision women should understand that whatever decision they end up making there will be scorn either way is there a tie breaker yes whichever leads you down the path of honor is the path you should take then whoever scorns you will have nothing but empty words because theyre angry you didnt take their advice 
final word those women who have love for their fellow humans should realize they cant kill unborn children because they didnt ask to be created but they would ask for a chance to be human like you"
"you guys are delusional  all the hate and anger comes from the abortion side  i had an escort on saturday say the most foul things to an elderly women that was with me  call her a filthy cun and that she stick her brochures up her cun and wished death on her and her grandkids  this was a 20 something male speaking to a woman that way  where was the feminist females  laughing as he said it to her  hypocrisy at its finest  apart from the god you know exists you have no bases to call anything right or wrong without appealing to gods law and absolute morality

bombs she just made that up so everybody thinks antiabortion protesters are violent i havent seen any violence maybe the only violence is the babies that are getting killed

man abortian is evil she is quite mean and confrontational tho
i dont believe in abortion but i dont believe everyone should be allowed to have a kids i believe in eugenics  what the pro life people dont understand is we have a lot of useless and worthless people in the world
id be fascinated to see how much help theyd actually offer if a patient walked over and asked for help
abortion should only be allowed if the fetus consents to it
what is this asks the escort   this idiotic escort cant appreciate that many people view abortion clinics the same way they would view the gas chambers at auschwitz if they feel strongly that abortion is the murder of an unborn child what should they do  how should they be behaving  like its no big deal  frankly given that many view abortion clinics as babykilling stations i am really surprised more clinics are not burned to the ground
033 take a gander at yourself 
when protester scream murderer and ask if your interested in signing an petetion thankyou for my interest inthe abortion clinic protesta my desire to know more about these protesta im familiar with all of these sir
the bottom line is abortion is killing a gift from god
lets go this old man knows whats up keep babies alive
40 of women who get 1 have more than one
why does she look exactly how you think she would look
why do these moms feel so bad about getting an abortion
"all cellular life is sentient its just common sense theory of cellular bias of consciousness

the main argument for the termination of human multicellular life is that the fetus doesnt feel pain

well there are multiple ways to terminate multicellular life without being pain involved for instance captivebolts are absolutely painless because the brain has no pain receptors and the brain is destroyed before the brain can receive signals from pain receptors

vegans constantly state plants dont feel pain so its okay to eat them well the brainstem the hub of the nervous system doesnt actually feel pain either it interrupts it destroying the nervous destroys the argument its immoral   

if its acceptable to terminate any cellular life form on the bias that it doesnt feel pain thats a pandoras box that should not be opened"
it aint no cookie cutter solution humans lead difficult and complex lives dont matter which side your on pro or anti hope we all can come to a middle ground
abortion is not reproductive health care especially for the innocent unborn babies
i hope the army of god finds where this is
lmao as if making tiktoks is going to change shit these pro choice  people are hilariously idiotic
i love that she has the same name as a legendary jazz drummer
im sorry im pro choice but third trimester thats a bit much unless there is a serious health threat to both the baby and the mother not going to judge the guy or the mothers not my place but whoa
good for that man

you are guiding people to a eternal tormented hell"
"im kinda surprised that people feel the need to stick their noses into others businesses yes abortion sucks but we cant deny that its necessary at times

we can always do the one thing some tend to do shut up because its not your place to judge 

we can also find solutions to to the problems that lead to abortion ideas anyone"
as a protestor please know that you are litteraly harassing people over there with your opinion well turns out people can have different opinions about the same topic learn to respect it
men need to use contraception all the time
it would be nice if these busybodies actually helped the people they are trying to bend to their will with financial support if a patient ever decided to keep their baby
its always the men who cant find the clt andor never made a woman cm outside of these abortion clinics
good job joe  god bless you brother
for people who say the pro life why would you shoot somebody 
she is a hero we need to network support for people who help us keep our rights both of those individuals the doctor and the escort are truly amazing people
the anti abortions are the same people who shame single mother
the mom from detroit rock city said  im here to support the mothers right to choose life 100 chance she hoards cats and calls it a rescue
god wants unsullied warriors he gets them from abortions do you want satan to win        why else would a all powerful god make pregnancies he knows will end in abortions 
this has become the hearts of people cold abortion is murder revelation 921
im pro life but actual medical abortion  as in one that is needed to save the life of the mother is obviously something that has to be done but apart from that i dont agree with abortion  if you dont want a child use protection what gets me with the whole pro choice people are the way they dehumanise unborn children  as a father who watched my son grow throughout the pregnancy  saw him in the scans and watched him being born on what was the best and proudest day of my life to then lose my beautiful baby boy at 2 years of age  the past 2 years have been hell for me but its taight me that every life is precious  an unborn child is very much alive and deserves protection
"1 why blue some of the posters do they show disgusting acts done in the clinics
2 im not saying that there have never been death threats but lots of people in the comments are talking about them and how much screaming the protesters were doing and how violent it was from this video which is obviously edited for maximum drama by cnn to only show the worst of what they saw all i saw was passionate people pleading with women to not make the terrible choice of murdering their own child they offered help and they tried to inform the escorts were yelling just as loud everyone wants their opinion to be heard
3 these violent attacksmurders all happened before 2009 from what i can tell most in the 90s i cannot justify these attacks of course but crazy people exist and when a large group of people believes innocent babies are being murdered legally violence is going to happen this is not a threat i would never do this and i strongly disavow anybody using violence in a movement that is supposed to cause peace and life for all people but when a system like the one we have currently is in place it is one that breeds violence by default so maybe its time to change the system im surprised there havent been more deaths honestly furthermore in the past 2 years alone so this is recent there have been hundreds of attacks on prolife churches and pregnancy resource centers these include firebombing physical assault and more that arent counted like the murder attempt of prolife judge bret kavenaugh im not saying because there is violence on both sides that that excuses violence on one side can we all agree that all of this violence is bad but please stop trying to paint an entire movement through the actions of a few crazy people in the past 30 years again statistically im surprised there arent more crazy prolifers who are willing to murder in this large time frame also why pregnancy resource centers i kind of get churches although thats bad too but why attack places that provide a bunch of resources help and love to women in need everything except murder basically"
the right to life you mean the right to forcibly use another persons organs against their will thats not a human right
"forced birthers we want to kill people for having abortions

me i definately dont see the irony here"
lol why are these pro abortion woman always the last woman any sane man would want to knock up
vote blue it is our only hope
abortion is murder you dont want kids  keep your legs closed
i find it funny that the far left can get through their thick skulls that even though abortion may be illegal in some states it doesnt stop people from getting abortions in those states but they cant comprehend how making guns illegal will not stop criminals from obtaining firearms the irony is ridiculous
the bloke in the red coat your god hates you
if prolife people are so sure they are wait they should wait and let god be the judge
killing people kind of sounds like the opposite of prolife to me
prayers dont pay the bills
a baby being able to suck its thumb in the womb is a reflex all animals have reflexes therefore we can equate a fetus to the level of an animal in terms of its development at that point if prolife people eat meat they shouldnt have a problem with abortion unless they believe in the bible
i think maybe i should protesting outside of pregnancy crisis centers telling women dont let them talk you into a choice that isnt right for you maybe they will finally realize how annoying it is to not let people go about their business
"come on
youre being extremist with this false portrail of the anti abortion activists
if they are anti abortion then they believe they are being anti killing  anti murderer 
they will not hurt anyone 
they are just giving a chance to mothers to reflect 
had you leftists not been aware that you are disempowering women  robbing them their rights
you wouldnt have been so scared of dissent
i am not pro not against abortion   at the end of the day no matter what you or your opposition try to either push for abortion or prevent abortion 
it is going to be the parents call
not either one of you
can decide 
but you leftists 
your fear of opposition is what alarms red lights on my side
dictators are afraid that their subjects realize they are being oppressed 
dictators are afraid that their subjects will wake up one day
 overthrow them
that is what makes them afraid of opposition 
 that is what make you leftists also afraid of opposition 

guys what i am trying to pass to you is that
your handling of the matter
shows that you are
a bunch of
dictators"
welllll  to tell you the truth the violence shouldnt have happened but i dont feel bad for the people who were killed because they were the ones helping kill hundreds of innocent babies in a way it was karma  i see them as stupid people that allow the devil to use them because theyre not smart enough to see thw truth or the fact of they just dont care  i feel sorry for the people who have tht mindset that abortions are ok
abortion is murder and anyone who does not see this is subhuman
she is doing gods work thank you thank you thank you  
abortion is murder
repent abortion is evil watch an animation about what goes on during an abortion or even worse a late term abortion
we arent going anywhere
and jesus supposedly said and if they dont want to hear your message shake the dirt from your shoes and move on  these so called christians clearly dont experience the love of the christ as he thought 
if i lived in that town i would burn that building to the ground b
this woman is pathetic
that walk should be hard 2 go in alive 1 comes out the innocent baby murdered it doesnt matter their story theres no excuse for killing babies and this lady is evil she would of been assisting hitler it should be hard you killing babies babies babies
thank u for showing the world we are trying to save babies your a demon and you just exposed yourself why dont u protect the babies your helping murder  u think
more people dont have an idea of what happens inside the clinics most women who face how sick it is end up changing their mind seen dozens and dozens of accounts multiple personally
bro shes a bouncer for a fuckin abortion clinic  jesus christ
abortion should not be available to the general public only to victims of assault or to those whose lives are actually in danger and those are a small portion of the population
imagine how many directors and workers have to suppress their thoughts feelings and consciences after seeing what they see of what goes on inside suppression is a major key here
120 omfg she literally has to scout for bombs because of radical prolifers i need to look for some real radical prochoicers if there are even any out there if im to civilly conversate with prolifers
dan is going to be disappointed when he just dies and rots in the ground
fight fight fight fight i want stuff that i can upload youtube to get hits off of and make money from
why dont antiabortionists start with labs that create embryos for ivf  at least attack labs before women  i have yet to see a bunch of these people picketing labs  its a desperate play to control women that comes before actual love for life
this woman is brave and committed  thank god for people like her
how many abortions should a woman allowed to have  i have done this myself and i really regret it after loosing my 15 year old son
"016 ironic she says that i for one think folks dont have a knowledge what goes down inside the abortion clinic and their history


planned parenthood aint interested in yo ass they literally had a history of forcefultricked sterilization of minority groups so they cant have babies and these are the people women goto to abort kids they were first established with sterilization and castration for men and women in mind dont let the cute name fool you look up their dark history and even with that 1 shouldnt be an excuse for the 99 people need to stop using something as bad and horrific as rape to push their agendas sure rape and imminent danger to the womans health are good reasons to abort but the reality is in a good chunk of pregnancies the women are in absolutely no danger just giving birth but they still abort heck abortion has way more danger and complications than just giving birth kill the kid and risk moms life abortion is not contraceptives and shouldnt be used as such they literally giving out day after pills etc etc for free go use some"
"016 ironic she says that i for one think folks dont have a knowledge what goes down inside the abortion clinic and their history


planned parenthood aint interested in yo ass they literally had a history of forcefultricked sterilization of minority groups so they cant have babies and these are the people women goto to abort kids they were first established with sterilization and castration for men and women in mind dont let the cute name fool you look up their dark history"
what is so wrong with just keeping your legs clpsed i just dont get it
if kids didnt want the baby they shouldve never gotten pregnant but when the baby is killed they go to heaven this is like the same when jesus was born when the soldiers were killing babies
the people abortion need jesus and its wrong killing babies
what a brave woman
are you seriously trying to have me empathize with a fat abortion loving women who thinks disagreeing with people is life saving work i sincerely doubt someone advocating for execution is someone to empathize with also 516  for those who are not aware assault by mutual consent is defined as an application of force that arises out of a consensual fight cannot be an assault because both parties have consented to the physical contact  also known as she was also responsible for engaging in violence but cnn wants to make it seem that she was victimized
people need to mind their own business
these people need to get a life
i wonder how men would really feel if the child they made instantly became the full responsibility of the father and he then owes big bucks for pain suffering and permanent physical disfigurement and also future mental anguish of mother and child when that child comes around to be mothered ect oh lets not forget to rip open their tiny hole 20xs bigger on their sexual organ n make them gain 20x pounds on their abbs never to come off againstretch out their  pecks to sag all that fun stuff they judge us on  also its the end to working that good job w no paid leave but expensive child care and loads of chores for 16 years  just saying it takes two to tango so why is it only the mother that gets all the pressure   wheres insurance paid male birth control  afterall viagras covered by insurance 
those anti abortion people who target abortion clinics should be put into the gulag express train and make them work hard labor and teach those prolifers the harsher consequences for making woman have miscarriages and forced pregnancies
assault by mutual consent really do you think the poor woman trying to protect these clients consented to the assault sounds like the authorities in the area are sympathetic to the right to life folks what a load of shit
i dont agree with that doctor being murdered all murder is wrong 
stop killing the innocent babies if youre so prochoice let the choice making begin before the sex occurs
good arguments on both sides tbf thats why its such a dividing issue i feel like its left vs right with every issue tho
goddess bless these brave escorts doing the ladys work protecting these women from the abuse of anti abortionists
everyone has the right to life no one has the right to live at someone elses expense im quite certain that everyone of these protestors do not want someone else to make a major decision in their life for them why then are they so insistent on making decisions for others
apparently the doctors killer was home sick on the sunday they taught the commandment thou shalt not kill
the main lady in the video giving me communist karen vibes lol
whats a little funny is that a only 11 adults have died in the last like 20 years just imagine the thousands of babies killed in that time
just walk up and ask them to adopt the child that will stop them in their tracks
how is it not illegal to stand outside an abortion clinic and yell shit at people i would love to see all these protesters thrown in jail theyre literally just there to harass women
they are not children or babys its a clump of god damn seels is you listened in school they fucking teach you that sorry for the spelling mistakes english aint my first language and also why just why what do benefit from doing this trumatizing young woman ok yeah you can put it up for adoption what do you do when they come to look for you what do you say you cant just say oh yeah i didnt want you thats heartbraking for the child what do you do when you got sa what do you do keep the baby no fucking no you dont want a reminder of what happened to you like who wants that these people are so selfish saying its what god wants like no one gives a shit no one
"my grandmother is proabortion she gets mad when a woman has lots of babies but then goes on about a womans right to choose and a womans body i guess that only applies when you want to murder a baby not have one

prochoicers dont care about womens rights they care about murdering babies"
you will eventually find out what side you should be on
"the ignorance of anti abortionis kills women some of them bomb clinics and attack people others are voting to ban abortion maternall death rate in abortion ban states is at least 25 percent highter than non ban states 
they have no idea of the health reasons for abortion 
when pushed about the mothers health they back track and try to make exceptions at the root they are about slut shaming really"
your ignorance of reproductive difficulties killd women
men who have never had s cimplicatec pregnancy telling gjose who have they cant have an abortion
goodjob pro choice or should i say pro infanticide wow and the fact that the pro choice woman forces the camera is the face of a poor grandma also why is she insulting the peaceful protesters so aggresively like walking up to them and yelling saying that your adding humor is just messed up when your talking about murder
men have no right to say anything plus who thinks the choice is an easy one these people who help the clinic and the patients and amazing
i wonder how many of those probirthers have filled out paperwork for adoption or have actually adopted
notice that its mostly white males leading these protestswho gave them the right to make decisions about womens bodies
i wanted to hate this but the comments says i shouldnt i still dont know if i hate this or not
"during the third trimester your fetus continues to grow in size and weight the lungs are still maturing and the fetus begins to position itself head down by the end of the third trimester the fetus is about 19 to 21 inches long and weighs on average 6 to 9 pounds

that dr murders babies"
some men and women are too stupid to be able to avoid unwanted pregnancy so we have to allow the murder unwanted children before they are born
how do they know they werent married women who had an affair and got pregnant according to the bible the husband is supposed to make her get an abortion  oh what great christians we have in this countryreserving judgement for god alone murdering doctors and nurses and staff harassing peeps littering and not helping out the poorbet they didnt give away their possessions to the poor eitherbet theyve never adopted a baby so they could be a part of their own solution  i believe the men had even shaved bad christians thats not allowed in the bible  women had ears pierced which is called defilement of the body   before you accuse me take a look at yourself
"whatever help you need we have
birth control paid leave child care food stamps social security and medicaid
fuck you"
"matthew 65 when you pray do not be like the hypocrites who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on street corners so that others may see them amen i say to you they have received their reward

learn it and throw it back into the face of any uppity christian you come across they probably dont even know that verse or have ever read it to be serious here if they couldnt cherry pick their religion theyd have nothing"
god bless those men and women encouraging  and praying for life children are gods gift not a burden our constitution names our god given rights as unalienable life liberty and the pursuit of happiness without life there is nothing else
notice the differences between prolifers and prochoice prolifers think they have the right to enforce their beliefs and opinions onto others one woman who would rather die than abort expects all other women should agree um hell no another woman who would rather die than have a baby wouldnt expect anyone to agree with her prolifers stereotype abortion as being evil and those who have them are evil sluts one woman chose to die so her baby could live the baby was never taken off life support and only lived 17 days not so much being noble as it is senseless and futile if someone else wants better than that for their baby how can they be faulted people have debates between length of life vs quality of life in hospice its no difference for beginning of life
shame on these religious fanatics who persecute and bully vulnerable womenthey have no right over womens bodies and shd mind their own businessthey shd be put on prison instead
"prolifers killing and making death threats who would have thought 
amazing how they are completely blind to this equating to exactly what theyre protesting against"
simple way to get rid of them is pressure them with adoption papers
on my pack of cigarettes it says smoking can cause my unborn child to die if antiabortionists are serious about saving fetuses then they would also have to treat smokers like criminals that would mean no more smoking in the red states like kentucky and virginia where the tobacco grows just another example of republican hypocrisy
oh is he is for a big shock when he realizes that there is no one there
lady you are a saint or better still you are a good human being
they so called prolife and antiabortion they take away abortion rights but then after birth of the child they will do nothing when the kids are killed after starting their  k12 education its like a delayed death yeah we support you being born but when you start prek bye bye baby
abortion is a violent and barbaric act it has no place in a civilized society
dan when were you pregnant did you have an abortion or did you give birth  were you ever forced to become pregnant and then forced to get and aboprtion no never etcthen mind your own fing business
my body my choice  thank you to the escorts you are sadly needed but women are eternally grateful for your time and effort thank you
they respect life but will on occasion kill someone involved in receiving or assisting in an abortion  very christian of them
sad to see these comments you people need to take responsibility when having unprotected sexand cnn shame on you for thinking abortions are harmless
"yep
turn the spotlight on them
their ridiculous platitudes
their lack of compassion
their ignorance of basic science"
bloody good on her these people are criminals not to mention hypocrites they really couldnt give a shit about unborn life they only care about their money and their guns put them in maximum security jail
im glad these guys are trying to do the right thing have any of you seen that video of the baby in the process of being aborted on the ultrasound trying to fight off the big scissors the baby is trying to push away the tool by which it is murdered at the hand of an abortionist its heartbreaking these doctors punch a hole in the skull of the baby and suck out the brains depressing the skull to kill the baby how can anyone supporting this procedure call themselves human
ive been looking so much of this and its so horrible and depressing that people think its okay to murder their children in the end its god who will judge these injustices and jesus will come and wipe away every tear and im happy to know that all the babies who were slaughtered are in heaven jesus come soon
sick to see women believing they are some kind of heroes truly shameful that they are so immoral they waste the time the should use to go on a diet lose that fat find a man go to church and build a family for the betterment of our country and the world its tragic what has been done to the young women of this generation
who ever thinks they have the right to tell someone what to do that is none of their business and  if you really believe in god and meeting your maker when you die and paying for your sins what you are doing is making no sense at all because who ever chooses to have an abortion will have to meet their maker when their time is up but theres nothing you can do because its not your sin to confess so why do you think you have a right to take choices away from others because you are not god we are all living the laws of this free country to make our own choices and in this case these choices have nothing to do with anyone except the woman who should be able to make her own choices whether anyone agrees or not so if you disagree with them choices thats fine but its not your choice in a free country to make decisions about anyones life or choices instead of ridiculing them or yelling at them maybe just pray for them and let god be the one to judge their choices i know god would not condone the violence being used to make a point either lets not forget who ever does these violent acts which in some people got hurt and in the end these people will also be judged this is my opinion on this subject
"the doctor said if women cannot have access to abortions that women will start dying which is horrible  if he thinks this is horrible imagine the absolute horror of having all of your body parts literally torn off of your body one at a time while resting safely inside your mothers tummy he can have compassion for the women dying but not the babies dying where is the logic and morality in that if we take the babys right to life away it is only a matter of time until that right will inevitably cease to exist for the remainder of us this will undoubtedly lead us down a path where if someone decides in the future that your life doesnt matter they just take it away from you and you cease to exist is that the kind of world you want folks  

the doctors last statement is i just pray that it wakes people up  ironically the one who needs to wake up the most is the doctor  i do not think god would be pleased with anybody who takes the life of an innocent person and especially those who make their living slaughtering innocent children  if the doctor is a truly praying man he would be wise to repent from his taking of innocent lives and to pray for forgiveness that god might be merciful on his soul  that doctor is in his sunset years and it wont be long now until he will stand before god and will have to give an account for his atrocious actions"
these people need to sign a legal agreement to give 20 of their income to sustain these women in dire straits and to place their hand on the bible and swear to god to fulfill the agreement
this is terrible what if you were aborted
i wish people stop talking about this stuff this society hates anything truthful
shelley sums up the prodeath image looks like a bulldog chewing a wasp
how many kids has dan adopted
the sad people who believe that their views should be forcefully imposed upon others demonstrates their fanatical tendencies the deeply held belief that their have the right to scare and intimidate others show that they are akin to nazis
i wonder how many of those self righteous religious extremists have adopted
no not to choose life your not letting her choose her life
whatever it takes to save a life
were here to help youwe are praying for you  but would you adopt my baby or help pay for prenatal care or help support me so i can stay with my child  unfortunately all these dimwits can offer is prayer   they wont spend one dime and vote for political hacks that echo their baseless ideology
so since 1977 at least 11 people have been killed in anti abortion attacks and people claim to be pro life
"i support abortion if a womangirl got pregnant from rpe or if giving birth will kill the mother but having an abortion because you just dont want a baby thats selfish and inhumane

if you dont want to get pregnant then just dont do it in the bedroom if you end up getting pregnant then thats on you and the sad thing is that near 97 of women who get abortions do it because they feel like it"
thank god for the amazing men and women who oppose the murder of innocent children shame on those who support abortion repent and follow jesus christ he will forgive you and give you peace like youve never had
since this seems to be a religious issue has anyone asked the antiabortionist where in the bible it says abortion is wrong
we dont know their heart we dont know know their story what we do know is they are murderers 11 people have been killed at abortion clinics more than 60 million fetuses have been killed
the reason for shouting is the patrons are murderers
i see that if people die because they should abort and the state should be held responsible for all deaths open the court imagine killing a doctor may all repubs that ignore a death of a pregnant women rot in jail it is now the blame of anti abortionest if a woman dies
abortion is evil and you dont have the right to kill your child  no one has the right to kill another human being unless it is self defense
that one guy had been doing this since 1973 that is a mind that has been unable to alter its position in 50 years geezlike living in a cave
so theyre anti abortion but think its ok to murder someone whos just doing their part to keep women safe youll find that the women who choose abortion usually dont have a choice leave them alone and live your own life
looks like the average street antiabortion protestors are on social security or unemployed
making money by butchering small bodies what a shame
i would literally i volunteer for this job  these people will harass people over their beliefs which is absurd  i would love to use my sarcasm against them  every day i drive past a planned parenthood in my town  they have protestors any they dont even perform abortions there  they send you offsite to another town  the planned parenthood in my town provides many other important services again they dont even do abortions there but they stand out there with their signs protesting their beliefs  i would just let them hit me and laugh
why are pro abortion women always the ones that dont have to worry about it
god bless her
until those abortion protesters do more to alleviate social injustice it is clear that their real reasons for their stance is they want poor women to have their babies so they can have soldiers to defend their standard of living they dont give a fig for unborn babies in any other country
"they say its hard to them to do their job as a murderer of a innocent chilld 

i know this isnt right to say because maybe they have their own reason 
but remember if live because of blood on your hands youll die by the same the blood in your hands"
sanctimonious murder
"shelly shelly shelly you are not humorous at all i wonder how much humor youll find in hell 

she said this is literally like life risking work hello no shit sherlock risking the lives of innocent children wake up shelly and all you naive people"
woah such empowerment we are killing babys yay
you cant pray and  perform abortionpraying is talking to god he doesnt give consent to kill he said thy shall not kill
shelly is a hero
pro life moms got birth to all of this pro abortion activists irony ha
did she filmed her mom on tiktok too
08  of women have health issues from having birthmy daughter told methat she support abortion1 time then  her name goes on the whore list also the whore needs to pay the billnot tax payers
the irony of these people crying about 11 deaths at abortion clinics no one you literally murder babies everyday
i know those evil men who you know care about babies being murdered and she should be more concerned with the fact she doesnt have a neck diabetes and heart attacks are in her future
these are strong people protecting babies and protecting the lives of people that cannot protect themselves im actually surprised that there has only been 11 deaths compared to hundreds of thousands of dead fetuses there is no excuse for people that do this to other human beings that are born in the socalled greatest country in the world and say that their life was not going to be good just a bunch of excuses
should carry a sign asking the pro lifers if god is pro life then ask them to answer except noahs family god drowned every man woman child and fetus  doesnt sound like pro life to me
all the forced birth ppl here is sick
who has this much spare time to protest against someone elses choice  their body their choice
these murderers
people outside the clinics protesting prolife need to foster babies so many that they need help you are so prolife then take care babies in need of foster parents instead of complaining and protesting outside clinics and praying occupy your time taking care of babies
why is it that most of them dont need to worry about getting pregnant anyway
chossing to get a abortion is a painful enough decision without putting up this judgment and endangerment if you dont believe in abortion dont get one but please dont hinder everyones rights
personally i dont like the idea of abortion but people have no right to decide what someone else wants to do with their life we are not the ones raising it
what is this land whale talking about
what a dog leftie women are all ugly only good looking people deserve to have opinions
how you gunna fight for somethings life that aint even alive than kill an actual living person 
why all ways prochoice look like lgbtqias  gender fluid cats whatever they call them self 
i pray for these protesters in jesus name great is your reward in heaven
there is deadly violence at abortion clinics every day it just doesnt matter because those lives dont have voices yet
i dont care who you are but if you dont make any exceptions for sa victims then youre disgusting
"i loved the very loud leaf blower
lets get this straight if these ppl think its ok to murder ppl who help women get a abortion they are the worst type of hypocrite it doesnt matter if they use religious beliefs as justification or if they are simply saying all life is or should be protected once they commit murder or advocate for it then they are doing the same thing they accuse the clinic employees are doing no man has the righteither religiously or morally to take another life"
what people dont have a realistic picture of is what happens in an abortion
people need to understand that these people dont need help from prayers or gods they need help financially how are you supposed to raise a child when you get minimum wage and even if there is a way to raise said child what will they turn out to be prayer doesnt help it never does sure praying makes you feel like someone is helping you but that only strengthens your will
the reporter at the end is so misinformed  there has never been a constitutional right to abortion
lets not act like everyone that goes to the clinic has been rped 90 of them had sex and didnt wear protection and now want an abortion because the baby is an inconvenience i understand people that get raped  but most of them are slgs that have been normalised in society
dont worry sweetie you will never be in the predicament to gave to choose to murder your baby
what a line graphic and violent messages no way why would someone do that to people wanting to tear babies apart piece by piece and proclaim it as a right you really shouldnt be trying to guilttrip other people for responding to your heinous and atrocious actions and fyi violent protests come from your side of the aisle not mine
these people are decrying murder while facilitating it
a baby shouldnt have to die so u can be a 304 its wrong dont care what the trolls say if u add up rape and incest it accounts for less than 2 percent so ur argument is trash everyone in support of this disgusting procedure should sit in and watch watch little faces being put on a table arms legs brain tissue etc then tell us its not a baby you are some vile disgusting people it should be illegal its murder plain and simple
thank you for helping women
wack conservatives
shes awesome she must feel really good helping out those womsn kill their babies
we should be using artificial wombs it would give people far more options and the parents wouldnt have to make the horrible decisions ask all women what type of birthing they would prefer i bet artificial wombs gets chosen first if you explain it correctly
the baby is alive give it up for adoption its murder satanic murder
how about the rights of the baby you are murdering
abortion is murder end of story
this is literally liferisking work yeah exactly risking the lives of the unborn
once again to people that get abortions the baby insidethe unborn baby is in your body its not your body if it were your body you would be the one getting aborted
i mean yeah these are abused by people alot and do need to be closed people use them as magic eraser factories for disposing of humans in some legal round about way whether people want to hear this or not most of this comes with irresponsible choices and very few from seemingly legit unchosen decisions but at the end of the day the human growing inside of you didnt get to chose the circumstances as to how they appeared and formed inside of you you chose to make them and then destroy them such nice people
what a hero wow she risks her life to help women end the life of the innocent baby  it is a tragic death of those involved in the premeditated taking of thee innocent  women are dying and maimed in the process of abortion every day babies die at the hand of the these people who will answer to god
third trimester abortions should not be elective expect in very rare circumstances such as a baby developing in a lifeinfeasible way i am more prochoice the farther back into a pregnancy but if a baby can survive outside of the womb i see no reason it should be ok to kill it that thirdtrimester abortionist is disgusting
you can also look for the telecommunication lines going into the building  although electrial wires are likely in thick conduit telecommunications are lines that go to peds next to the building property lines   it only takes a second to cut the lines and to disable the building
hey if the protestors want to make it difficult for abortion clinic to function there is a very simple fast way to do  wait until dark when the clinic closes and quickly apply super glue or epoxy to all the door locks   the glue will harden making the locks impossible to open
shelley is only helping selfish women she is not helping babies to live abortion is the most extreme form of child abuse
can we not normalize killing babies  i understand that certain situations are sensitive but most are just inconvenienced by a baby just dont have sex lol
even especially if the woman is raped she should have the right to have an abortion
it should be a womans choice to have the abortion 100
of course she was a rainbow vest
"finally a rational  comments section feels like coming home after fighting a battle out there 

youre doing amazing work keep it up

all of you here are amazing and i appreciate each one of you "
performing 3rd trimester abortions is murder no one should be murdered including staff
im against the murder of unborn babies to but no one likes protesters this is why so many people dont like groups like political groups like antifa blm lgbtq no oil these groups dusrupt the community and dont care about the people that they are supposed to be supporting
why does it matter to these prolifers what someone else who they do not know in any way shape or form do with their bodies they will never see these people again the fact they get so involved for literally 10 mins and then move on to the next person to scream at is despicable jesus would not be standing outside these clinics and they believe they are following in his footsteps pro choice literally allows pro lifers the ability to have their babies and not abort them but they want to take that away for everyone else give me a break theyre a bunch of clowns hiding behind this veil of being a good christian there is nothing holy about the torment they are giving the most vulnerable people
those protesters stop the support after its too late
those protestors lie about abortion
all humans babies to adults have a right to live thats a god given right and no one should take that away from you protect all lives protect thy unborn lives but good thing the anti abortion support grows more n more younger generations are actively protesting against abortions more ppl waking up god bless america
funny how most of these proabortionist are the ones least likely to be pregnant
i really cant wrap my brain how anyone who thinks they are christian would think that taking away my freewill which was given to me by god can possibly think they are doing gods work wow
im proabortion as long as they destroy the vessel during
life risking work yeah not your life tho right just the babies
how many fake ectopic  pregnancy storied can there be and no pro life doctor pro life  hospital or state would allow a woman to  die due  to an ectopic pregnancy its silly thats all you pro baby destroyers got   the ectopic stories are just not true
these same people protesters are the type to death threat someones trans child maybe even theyre own
because shes so likely to get pregnant right
instead of encouraging people to kill their poor little baby why dont you hop on the treadmill for a bit help yourself first
she is not a hero
your killing a innocent baby the bible literally says their innocent people are stupid and you women that has had an abortion you are disgusting and a horrible person for killing a innocent baby your literally carrying the new generation in your stomach be more responsible because abortion is disgusting and you are disgusting
thats honestly disturbing to lighten the mood that much about death you dont have to get political or religious to get the feeling or sense its morally wrong to kill any living thing
i dont think she ever has to worry about getting pregnant
its always the crazy religious loonys
"they need to get a lifemind their own business they have that crazy
look evangelical nut looknot one 
looks normal i believe they all have
mental issues just look at them tell
me im wrong"
"let the women decide for themselves whether or not to carry the seeds of the evil men do to them i will agree to ban abortion only if  they also pass a law
that will allow the court to order the castration of men who commit the crime of rape and incest"
"yeah this go is so horrible saying things like you are wonderfully and beautifully made
what kind of horrible person would try to convince a woman from murdering her unborn child

abortion activists are sick
this woman should look in the mirror and ask what is this

lady you are the big mouth  these people are not on the murder clinics grounds
the fact is she just cant stand it when someone holds a position that she disagrees with

lady you are a sick horrible person  you should be ashamed of yourself
or better yet track down those sickos the vandals and arsonists who terrorized and firebombed crisis pregnancy centers"
since may of 2022 there have been 99 attacks on pro life organizations and facilities just thought id share that
i wonder how many adopted children all these pro lifers have
"can someone please explain

if a 15yr old has been raped and drs say that continuing the pregnancy will severely hinder her chance of children in the future when she is  physically and mentally ready for motherhood you demand we follow your minority view based on a fictions gods book 
my thoughts are towards the pregnant childs life and i make no apology"
resorting to tic tok says everything
shelly shows up to protect the business of treating the unborn as just bags of money making parts
a rubber fetus really and the liberals claim they know science
a rubber fetus really and the liberals claim they know science
o lord god of vengeance o god of vengeance shine forth rise up o judge of the earth repay to the proud what they deserve o lord how long shall the wicked exult they pour out their arrogant words all the evildoers boast they crush your people o lord and afflict your heritage they kill the widow and the sojourner and murder the fatherless and they say the lord does not see the god of jacob does not perceive understand o dullest of the people fools when will you be wise he who planted the ear does he not hear he who formed the eye does he not see he who disciplines the nations does he not rebuke he who teaches man knowledgethe lord knows the thoughts of man that they are futile blessed is the man whom you discipline o lord and whom you teach out of your law to give him rest from days of trouble until a pit is dug for the wicked for the lord will not forsake his people he will not abandon his heritage for justice will return to the righteous and all the upright in heart will follow it who rises up for me against the wicked who stands up for me against evildoers if the lord had not been my help my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence when i thought my foot slips your steadfast love o lord held me up when the cares of my heart are many your consolations cheer my soul can wicked rulers be allied with you those who frame injustice by statute they band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death but the lord has become my stronghold and my god the rock of my refuge he will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness the lord our god will wipe them out psalm 94
abortion bans on demand and without apology
and now nyc has abortions up to 9 months  wow now we murder a full term baby
this pitiful woman i hope she realizes soon that by supporting abortion she is supporting murder
lol kinda an overreaction to protestors these people arent protesting abortions out of survival nor miscarriages the recording was fine it was mean blowing them with a leaf blower theyre allowed to speak their mind without getting leafs and dust in their face and eyes antiabortionist who commit crime are criminals
what a pathetic job abortion escort a new low in humanity
pro life call women irresponsible and stupid for not keeping their knees together and getting pregnant by their logic are they expecting irresponsible and stupid women to also raise a baby
no to abortion no kill babies dont be killers when gods judgment comes what will you answer to your creator
theres a difference between needing an abortion and willfully killing your baby because of selfishness or irresponsibility the child is alive no matter what you tell yourself and everyone knows its wrong to kill people rationalize evil practices in todays world people who are against abortion are there to help people really think about and be honest with themselves about what they are really doing before they make a decision theyre going to regret for the rest of their lives dont listen to the world listen to your heart and listen to god god is that small still whisper inside your mind and heart that ultimately knows killing your child is not right thats hard to do in an evil world that promotes and standardizes evil
so in the last 45 years 11 people have been killed by unstable people claiming to be right  okay    taking away your virtue signaling point  yes those 11 people did not deserve to die  they deserve justice in the prosecution of their murders   however that stat along with your own video and claims of how prevalent protest occur suggests that the vast majority of those protestor are peaceful even when being antagonized
this lady is evil beyond belief
they arent wasting them  they feed them to the prisoners
pretending you have a make believe friend in the sky and pretending they talk to you means your  nuts 
women know what they do we are not incapable of making decisions and we know the full consequences of abortion we are not children we can decide  and until this fetus child is in my wombit a part of my body
biased report from cnn
that moment when people have a problem with killing babies 
"the murderers in the abortion pretend to care with their lies without realising the utter hypocrisy and insanity they speak  
349 this is literally like life risking work can you not hear the hypocrisy of that and how laughable that sounds 
you are helping to end the lives of innocent babies in that clinic so you cant talk life risking work oh what a joke

there is absolutely zero reason for abortion to exist abortion is murder which leaves mental and physical scars and youll have to give an account of that on the day of judgement murder is not a right youll find that out the hard way when condemned to the torment of hell if you dont wake up and repent"
if you dont agree to the possible consequences then you shouldnt have it
the people comparing your right to abortion  to property rights and stand your ground laws 
the baby has every right to be there as its a natrual stage of human development for everyone
she needs to learn to accept different opinions liberals always want to preach tolerance but they are intolerant themselves
why are people always bringing god into this im not even religious wtf leave me and my body alone i make whatever decision i think its better for myself
that protester says when he meets his makerhe hopes the good lord has a lot of mercy  he should hope for that because hes going to need it  he is not treating his fellow humans with honor or dignity and he spends his time in judgment of others which is not his place   he will be judged harshly by his good lord for being a lousy human along with the rest of the protesters
these people are delusional  let these people be and let them get their healthcare in peace mind your own business
according to science when does life begins
that clearly is a demon woman she will escort you straight to hell
"abortion clinics are mostly in poor black areas
everything else is rascict but not that"
in islam religion the abortion is not forbidden before the 40 days of pregnancy if the woman raised her child that better for her but if she doesnt want it she can do the abortion before the 40 days of pregnancy in her womb but she must understand something very important if she do the forbidden adultery she must stop  after that sin and if she was a victim of a crime rape if she doesnt remove it that is better for her because the great god will give her great boons after life because she was a victim innocent woman but if she was married she cant do it its very big sin but sometimes the doctor says to her your baby in your womb is to dangerous to your health care we must remove him before he kills the mother and that happened rare in life that happened because some womens have accidents like when she falls into the ground or she have accidents in car or anything else etc  why i said before the 40 days of pregnancy because the great god doesnt put the soul in the body of the baby in his mother womb but after the 40 days of pregnancy the baby became a human with a real soul in his body that is not my talk or my words this is in holy book holy quran not me 
i have a friend who is a volunteer to escort people into abortion clinics she has a few pairs of noise canceling headphones she can link spotify for any music for those people so they cant hear anything the protestors are saying
"republicans be like 
war yes 
torture absolutely 
guns everywhere you bet 
abortion no im pro life"
how much do you want to bet these pro life idiots ate bacon and sausage mcmuffins on their way to the big pro life rally  
a more attractive woman would be an easier selljust some helpful advice  you have to make the face of the campaign someone a man would actually want to impregnate or else its just not believable
i wonder if any of these pro life losers are vegan or if they only care about specific kinds of life
why do all the women who appear to be the loudest pro abortion voice also appear to be the ones least likely to have to worry about unwanted pregnancies its a trend i cant help but notice haha they really are some big uglies am i right though 
big respect for these people risking their lives to make people able to make the right choice for their life
the piety makes me sick
i want to be this woman when i grow up
ignorance is loud and wisdom is louder through silence 
never seen so many low iq sky wizard worshippers with a hot line to god knowing what he wants and doesnt want
im so glad that i live in a civilized country i pity citizens of the usa
delusional fake christians
any one of those obnoxious protestors butting into the lives of those unfortunate women if they get too close or in the way should get the firehose  full blast  its why god invented firehoses
bottom line  women choose what you have to do  but dont use it as birth control and think the rest of the country will pay for it 
this video is downvoted into oblivion im sure
yea its wrong to tell  pregnant women to tell a women not to get an abortion due to rape or insects but what about the women that gets pregnant due to there own actions with there partner but still get the abortion and they can keep up on doing that bc its normalized now adays but we dont want to pay attention to that part of abortions just the ones from rape are insects smh
so what think they care about tiktok lol
in australia its illegal for these christian extremists to protest within 100 yards of a sexual health clinic
love this lady these idiots believe in a so called all knowing all powerfull god who foreknew the outcome of everything that would happen and chose to create that world he could have just as easily created a world where abortions didnt exist
the sheer arrogance of these bible thumpers ill pray for you save it for someone who cares you are no better than anyone else
weirdos for jesus did you see the size of that cross i love god too but these people are extremist
they say prolife but vote against funding foster care and jails to house all the unwanted kids
i support pro life advocates with my heart and soul good job escorting them into the clinics i feel for those who were killed in their line of duty
thank you for your work at the clinic you are a heroine
"they are sad bored lack attention have strange friends and most importantly
in desperate need for serious mental evaluation"
its all fkrd up sadly is early yearsmen were pissed killing mothers fathers and such because of dangerous work educationthe other fkrd up thg is too popular for the otherfame fortunelooks amenities as of extras to providethe all too infamous booze pharmaceutical another demeaning is fame fortune moving on with a better career divorce marriedthe infamous latter steppingthe sickness goes on wooing to some fandom oof delusional realities ambience and vanity alongside perversions with ill intentions with walt disney facade etc  giving these ideas for children
so the antiabortionprolife people murdered someonea prolife person murdered someone listen to how that sounds
do these people not have jobs how are they there every day to harrass these patients
when he gets to the pearly gates god will ask him who died and made you boss
"well done walking woman with their unborn baby to dead 
you must be so proud "
why do these assholes think they have the right to force their religion on others its not their body and not their choice
as a christian i believe it is a sin   to have an abortion but every one has a right to choose their own fate
here in greece we dont have specific clinics hospitals have to provide all sorts of healthcare so those lunatics would have to stand in front of a normal hospital and try to guess who goes visiting a relative whos had a heart attack who is having an xray and whos having an abortion
"this woman is so brave protecting women who have a already suffered enough mentally and probably physically before even getting to the clinic  
my response to half of the antiabortion protesters is if you werent born with ovaries and a vagina then stfu
"
what a country we live in that those people spend all their lives harassing women
a lot of these folks are paid to protest at the clinics
abortion is a crime dont kill babies abortion cannot be a choice like murder cannot be
god bless shelly you are doing what is in the bible an abortion is legal in the bible life doesnt even start until a child takes their first breath genesis
its a tiny rubber feotus  thats exactly what they are and between a patient and their doctor will always win since 78 of americans are prochoice and not antichoice
shelly is an angel she is helping people with difficult decisions but who have made up their mind i respect her prochoice stance
notice theyre all men
"it pains me that these self righteous jerks do not understand that abortion is necessary to save the lives of women whose pregnancies have gone horribly wrong due to no fault of their own 

i knew someone who nearly died of sepsis when a minuscule hole in the amniotic sac allowed germs to infect the fetus the fetus was already doomed but the doctors could not do an abortion until the fetal heartbeat stopped 

my friend was lucky that they were able to bring her back from organ failure considering that this was the 1970s she was lucky indeed

when abortion is banned women die what sense does it make to value the life of an embryo or fetus over that of the host without which the embryo cannot survive this is religious tyranny as far as i am concerned"
"they have no right to stand there and yell at women  
no right to hold pictures and posters 
these protesters say they have responsibility to do this they are not helping
they could help by providing baby clothes  diapers  formula  changing tables  baby bath tub  car seats  pay dr bills  give maternity clothes  nursing bras  maternity underwear  baby blankets  provide transportation  housing  childcare  daycare there is so very much to do to support new life and the mothers  
what they are doing out there  now  is useless "
how those shitheads protesters will help women that decided to have an abortion will they provide them for 9 months  and then take the baby away and take care of it yes  it  if its not after birth creature its not a human yet
those protesters look lunatic  who doesnt even understand what they talk about and should get their heads out of strange womens wombs lol
these protesters dont give a damn about the born
all this yelling and protesting when they can do something useful by actually helping kids in foster system kids in the streets who are homeless and hungry and not actually be judgmental which is ironic for them to do when they say pray
"obama and biden had 8 years to pass roe vs wade federallybut they didnt
they had the white house senate and house and promised they would pass it"
religious nutbars pushing thier shit on everyonethey should put their energies to the poor
im sorry third trimester abortions this is disgusting to me thats to far along
doesnt the bible actually command one to abort a pregnancy if its from adultry why does nobody ever speak about that
men have no business speaking about abortion its not their body or their baby dan the person you call your maker is also the only one that judges you or no one has a right to judge anyone read your bible you who have not sinned cast the first stone you have no right to judge anyone only god has the right to judge
they look like lunatics
at least 11 people have been killed by antiabortion activists gotta save those fetuses but its okay to kill fully grown living humans
this is why abortion care needs to be something provided by every obgyn so that you dont need to go to some weird place that announces what service you are in need of   it should not be legal to try to interfere with a medical procedure
how is this allowed can they a restraining order
11 people seriously 11 people a dayweek die here in philly over stuff they had nothing to do with now thats a real problem foh 11 people cant be serious
what is it with these ridiculous men
was there ever a bomb why sensationalise like that my goodness
are they going to help pay for the pregnancy birth daycare food hmmm thats interesting how this is so important that they spend their time harassing women than volunteering and donating at food pantries and shelters and funding free healthcare how bout just mind ur own business
of course they support the unborn because they arent a burden on prolifers  they dont require money they dont require caring they dont require anything until they are born and then they are no longer unborn and thats the moment when prolifers dont care about that child who could now starve and die in swallow and strife
thank you shelly for being there for women in their time of need you are a terrific and noble person
you are there for woman when they need help most the protesters have no interest in helping anyone they get a high off of feeling superior they dont adopt they dont vote for health careeducationhousing they just terrorize women at their most vulnerable
these men need to really go sit down somewhere dan god doesnt like it when people get in the middle of other peoples business
no man should ever have a voice over what women do with their bodies as someone who is not female and does not have a womb these male idiot antichoice losers have no rights to have any say in the matter if i was a cop id sit outside that clinic and arrest all those fucking protesters for harassment and abuse
if pro life activists really stood by their words they need to take fully economically social and emotionally responsibility for both mother and future child for the rest of mother and childs life i some how doubt they are willing to do that if not they are nothing but self rictus hypocrites
well youll find your muclh and theres nothing bug darkness dan
christianity is pure evil
tell god when you see him it wont go well abortion is murder
everyone for abortion has been born
"yeah those idiots cant hate or kill you for who you are unless you are born  they just want more death more inmates more abuse more poverty more homelessness more unemployment more of us forced to obey their personal religion
i should stand out front with pictures of murdered clinic workers and mothers forced to carry babies with no skullor raped  abused children forced to carry babies at 10 years old  
 how christian   right up there with nazis sadists and other psychopaths"
funny how they want to take my gun my freedom of speech my freedom to think what i think not what they think but take the option of abortion off the table and the freaking world is ending there cant be that many white girls getting abortions the whole reason democrats loved abortion was to keep the black population down
adding an element of humor anout killing babies yeah so brave
thank you escorts for what you do for women and girls obtaining abortions lets focus on why a woman needs an abortion rape incest poverty illness ectopic pregnancy does making abortion make these causes go away no so the need for abortions doesnt go away neither will abortions they become dangerous and even deadly trust women to make decisions for their lives
oh i cant wait to see this
at least 11 people have been killed prolife huh
shooting bombs and threats of death  these  anti abortion hypocrites  are not pro life they are pro control
if you have to remain name less you really dont believe in what your doing why not just wear something over your face while your at it and who are you to push your beliefs on someone when most christians break the commandments probably more so than non christians i think the clinics should release all names after verification that are christian women that had abortions im  sure their are millions and if you think not then your plain stupid
they want to force mothers to have babies but help with taking care of said babies no thankyou they say we are pro life but turn around and kill doctors that could have saved more lives or kill people they do not like  sounds like they are only some pro life
a bunch of ignorant religious nut jobswho are they to tell a woman what to do with their own body
i will decide what i do andor do not do with my body these self righteous delusional religious hypocrites can stuff their bibles their crucifixes and their bullshxt up their backsides and then they can fxck right off to somewhere very very far away
obviously somebody needs to tell them that prayers don t feed a child
"wow so brave enabling the murder of the unborn isnt an easy thing to do but faking compassion while doing it is even harder
stunning so strong so beautiful"
sadly these guys think we all need their personal approval dman them
what accent does the narrator have
sure youre walking next to a patient recording with a camera they must love that
"these protesters supporting life are doing the right thing 

sad about the doctor and the 11 people who lost their lives to extreme protesters

sadder still the millions of babies who lose their lives to abortion"
im watching this again and i have a question those women who died because they couldnt get an abortion the bombings of the abortion centers etc i think the same people who banned abortions should be made to pay for all the destruction they caused thoughts
shes a legend
prayers dont buy diapers prayers dont pay for prenatal care prayers dont buy food to feed your little ones prayers dont give you a job prayers  dont put food on the table prayers dont help with your postpartum depression prayers dont help you live in a safe neighbourhoodetcetera etcetera stop the government from funding viagra men have no say unless they have uterus ovaries fallopian tubes cervix and vagina  make vasectomies mandatory for men as soon as they can procreate and have it reversed when both want a baby my body my choice
you are fake news and everyone knows it so we can not believe a word you say and its called a staged interview and murder has always been illegal and turns out it still is its just so very very sad that a judge had to tell grown people that murder was rong so nice try but most american people are not stupid ask liz the truth will set you free lonnie ray
i agree woman should have control over thier bodies thats why intelligent women use precautions before murder if you cant control your body than get sterilized abortions are for health mental incest or rape purposes only
"all i see is some people concerned about abortion pretty calmly trying to talk to people and convince them to not get an abortion most shown here arent angry arent yelling aggressively and arent getting in peoples way burning anything down threatening or killing anyone theyre not taking over half the street occupying the building or anything crazy

maybe stick to showing only the worst of the worst antiabortion protesters because showing the typical ones that arent that bad is really exposing how overblown people make this whole omg prolife people harassing me thing is maybe try showing the ones offering tons of money to help support the child adopting the child etc too theres a million other options out there than to choose abortion most obvious of them is to try actually using birth control methods some people dont even make the attempt"
what a wonderful woman protecting women about to murder their babies from a crowd of old people  is she a saint or what
how come all these anti abortion protesters are all altacocker men  maybe women should start voting in laws restricting their bodily functions like banning viagra for example 
whats so upsetting is that the republicans sided with the terrorist the logic of that is beyond me
imagine if american women were legally allowed to forego motherhood through abortion and adoption without being legally responsible for child support yet american men are unable to legally forgo fatherhood without permission from women and are forced to pay pay child support double standards and female privilege are fun kids hands off their bodies hands off our wallets
how about the protesters give that attention to homeless veterans
shelley is a freaking superhero 
when they aree so pro life why they not protest against guns protest for free healtcare free childcare free education for all children payed parental leave from the company the right of home and other things to help this woman and kids instead of threaten them
lets lighten up and help people feel more comfortable about killing babies  these protesters are very polite and kind  they are prolife not prodeath like the escort is this is so twisted  i pray your minds and souls will be healed  may god have mercy on you  very sad to think what will happen to this escort after she goes to the other side
"if my mom aborted me in the womb i wouldnt care because i wouldnt be conscious enough to know and also id be dead so i couldnt have cared 
why are you all so obsessed with human life to begin with honestly obviously its cause its self serving though we dont like to say that no its gods will or whatever so noble
where is god when all these unwanted children are being forced into the fostercare system after having been born to parents who cant have them or dont want them is he too busy turning a blind eye to kids being raped and forced to go through with abortions too busy giving people cancer but praise the lord praise him from the dusty old book written by people 2000 years ago 
did anyone ever play that game of telephone how did it go 
oh but the bible is as true and untainted as the day it was written right god bless 
if a woman want an abortion let her have it life is too short to have it dictated by people who think only their opinion is right cause their god has a bigger dic than your god"
what sort of evil is it that would kill a baby in the 3rd trimester i just cant believe how twisted you would have to be those predominately fat ugly man hating cat women that guide people in are exactly as i would imagine they would look like
future gop candidates  im not joking
abortion is sometimes a necessity it should be a womans choice government needs to stay the hell out of everyones business my body my choice
he wasnt yelling at anyone 
999 of us are ok with early abortions for convenience  lets negotiate a gestational age 999999 are all in for abortion to save the mother at any time we got used to you reducing life to a clump of cells you lost most of us when you try to claim abortions of convenience are for health and went far left looney for convenience abortions until the moment of birth  men getting pregnant and not knowing what a woman is didnt help
the protesters seem to be extremely respectful what a bunch of pro baby murder propaganda
you dont have to listen they have a right to be there there not going in the clinic dont want to listen to them walk away simple
yet another pro death propaganda piece
abortion escort thats a thing now
notice most of these protestors are older men and before anyone comes at me yes i see there are women there too i am just making a point i am a survivor of minor sex trafficking severe child abuse and csamchild sexual abuse materials i work with minor victims of trafficking these young girls are usually around the ages of 1217 after coming out of trafficking they need so many different services they need time to process and heal i had one girl who was 16 she had a child with her trafficker who had taken her when she was 14 when she was rescued she was 5 weeks pregnant again by her trafficker she was so lost and didnt want another child with the man who had kidnapped drugged raped and sold her for 2 yrs imagine for a moment being this child because she truly is still a child put yourself in her shoes also think of all the children that are out there in broken systems all over the world
absolutely mindnumbing how many people in this comment section are insisting that patients in with lifethreatening pregnancies are not being denied appropriate medical treatment due to these new laws yes they are take responsibility for the effects of your extreme ideology in action
this is total fear mongering so sad
" a letter from the voiceless
dear mom
  i want to start by saying i love you you were my first connection with another person and i hoped i would get to see you face to face hear your sweet voice sing to me sleep but that never happened whatever i did im sorry i didnt mean to hurt you or cause you any trouble i just wanted you to be my mommy what i went through physically hurt me and i hope no one ever has to go through that again but what hurt me even worst was the fact that my mommy that i love so much hated me so much that you wouldnt even acknowledge that i was alivelacking the ability to breathe unaided you called me ita clump of cells and after all that you threw me awaylike garbage you wouldnt even do that to a pair of old shoes now its to late for me but on my behalf can you try to stop this from happening to any other babies please
                        love
                  the unwanted

ps i forgive you"
a hail of gunfirehmmmso much for prolife huhhypocritesall of the so called prolife cultists
"see the problem with the anti abortion lot is its mainly made out of menmen who will never get pregnant or have to have the child and so suffer none of the hardshipswomen should be the ones to decide if they want abortions or not since its them who get pregnant them who have the child them who would have the majority of childcare problems if they did have the baby
i just find it funny how women dont seem to have a single say in the matter despite abortion being for women not men"
"proabortion protestors 

the sheer degeneracy is palpable"
ill save the suspense this is about a security guard at an abortion clinic
dr leroy carhart yes hes the victim here making money by bullying the unborn with his scalpel
in the 90s i went to planned parenthood and ran into these type of people they didnt believe me when i told them i was just there for birth control they kept saying things like i was going to hell and give up my baby instead of killing it their faces were priceless when i walked out holding up the birth control for all to see only one of them apologized
nasty to escort woman to kill a babyit no differnt than leading a slave in 1800 to be sold at auction
sad woman cant hear about those woman who die at the abortion clinics getting their abortion and realize abortion is murder that all lives are made in gods image and a gift from god and should be loved by mom or someone else if the mother isnt ready to be a mom people protest black lives mater yet theres more abortion clinics in black neighborhoods killing and has killed more blacks since 73 than any 1war in history or combined people get their souls in the womball these souls that were aborted are crying out for justice     in heaven kids could have grown up to be doctors to save peoples lives or a firefighter or be president their future is gone forever god will have mercy on the children for being innocent look up the great tribulation gods wrath on earth for all the evil that has been done its not to late to repent and be saved from whats comingif you have a contrite heart when you come to emmanuel jesus and ask for forgiveness he will forgive youconfess your sins what you have did wrong to him and he will take them away he will set you free
this is what religion does
and then went home and ate a dozen donuts
now you may notice everyone that is against abortion is a crazy brainwashed catholic non separation of church and state anymore
i do not believe abortion should be used as birth control if you have sex be prepared for consequences if you dont want kids use birth control or get fixed it really seems extremely simple no need to kill an unborn child
his maker is the most prolific abortionist of all
they always look like that
this is insane
we need a woman just walk right up to them and ask for money for rent and diapers
funny how most people that are for abortion like this tiktoker  are usually people you wouldnt want to f in the first place    she butthurt because aint nobody wanna do her lmao 
if abortion isnt murder then why do people have funerals for miscarriages
all very sad and poor unborn children that will never get to take a breath this person walks babies to their death she must be very proud
"why is al qaeda more compassionate than prolifers

the 911 hijackers got to die instantly"
if you dont like babies why do you make them just dont make them how easy is that seriously
the greatest challenge of the human race  getting the pale face to mind his business
assisting in the murder of the unborn doesnt make you a hero
thats another cnn producer acting in their own story
abortion is a business to people they make money off of killing babies but there going to end up in hell for eternity
the good lord is not letting you prolifers in heaven thats a fact
every man is pro life until we get the wrong woman pregnant
wow what genius she is
prolife people are all about choosing life yet they are violent 
shelly is awesome
i was 15 15 when i had to give birth 15 when it was married off to somebody who beat me for the next 10 years you dont know what the f is going on in peoples lives mind your business god gave us the right to choose that right was taken away from me and ill be damned if i let it happen to anybody else
the next idiot that tries to pull hate into this just remember god gave us free will god give us the right to choose god gave us our bodies and they are ours
god gave us free will god gave us the right to choose those are our godgiven rights
for every marjorie taylor green we have we need about a hundred of you sweetheart keep it coming mad love mad respect we have a right to choose this is our body women are losing their rights we must stop it now vote against republicans that try to take our rights away thank you woman thank you for everything youre doing
these pro life people send death threats to people  how pro life is that
the killers profess to be prolife  theyre so pro life they killed people
its ironic she uses self righteous
abortion is not a constitutional right that is why it should be up to the states
it breaks my heart to see how degraded the world has become i feel like i have been watching freedom and empathy slowly slip away like sand through an hourglass for so long people are worse than ive ever seen filled with hate envy ire and so obsessed with control they could be spending their short lives doing what makes them happy making choices that affect their own lives instead they choose to lash out at others strangers even for disagreement at this rate i would guess 2 to 3 years before we are completely overrun by the true depths of human depravity
"all actions  have ramifications    once pregnant its no longer just your body 

if you go out  on the turps  have  an unprotected wellington boot  then  fall pregnant   your actions have results   such as having a living child under your care  protection    adopt the child out 
its not the babies fault  a woman uses abortion as contraception  

what about the father   it takes 2 to tango 

abortion is infanticide   before an abortion  mummy must be shown an abortion video

planned parenthood was started by kkk member margaret sanger  

abortion is only permissible if the mothers life is at immediate risk due to the baby  eg  ectopic pregnancy   only physical risk  not mental health therapy can combat that issue snd is treatable"
when those lazy protestors start praying for you it sounds like the thoughts  prayers white male domestic terrorists who dont think twice about murdering innocent children so spare us the phony lectures about protecting babies because you are going to sit back and hear about priests raping children and republicans murdering them and vote to cut food stamps health care and education go do some voluntary work that counts and that literally protects children
well at least these folks arent burning the building down like janes revenge destroying pregnancy crisis centers where they do help women keep and take care of their child
i hope you are as concerned with the babies after they are born
maybe if this people wher aborted we would be in a better place
great job shelley for helping women with their right to choose youre awesome  those anti people have nothing better to do than harass that clinic pathetic if they want to save a life they need to start with their own jesus did not force his truth on anyone and neither should they 
hey at least these scums are doing their part and showing people that there is still goodhope left in the world
"she shows up to the same clinic to protect the women from the protesters who are violently screaming at them youre beautiful your baby is beautiful they deserve to live and then they offer to help

this lady is pretty cringy"
im not personally against abortion on occasion but think its good we keep it discouraged and frowned upon because at the end of the day it is cheating life
seriously people  if you do not want or cannot afford a child please do not put one in the oven  just like you wouldnt put a pizza in the oven if you dont like to eat pizza get it be responsible ask your parents how not to get impregnated not hard
"has any woman ever changed her mind due to protesters like this 
because ive never seen it happen just saying"
deep in everyones heart everyone knows abortion ends a human life
im pretty sure not a single one of those protestors have any adopted children theyre not pro life theyre pro fetus
abortion is absolutely no men or fg religions business
"but what i wonder always always is that why do this proabortion people see it as a right for a woman to have as many abortions as she wants cause cause its her body but when a woman wants to have a lot of children they forget the right that its her right and her body why
some even call for legislation on the amount of children a woman can have which clearly goes against their principle of its the womans body and she can do whatever she likessome even go to the extent of looking down on this womenwhy"
let them defend what is right also not news worthy
shelley you are an angle some of us have prayed for to protect our loved ones during one of the hardest times in their lives  bless you
the so called prolifers 359
i wish antiabortion protesters would stop bringing religion in their arguments and actually bring up stuff that can be proven
this lady doesnt have to worry about abortion
i appreciate the escorts patience and good natured approach which is beyond me  i am irritated just listening to this harassment  good on you  i can see women are in good hands with you  much respect
its weird to hang out outside of these clinics and yell at people these good christians need to go practice their faith in a way thats not harmful to others but they cant help themselves
why dont they build a security fence and have people buzzed in by appointment
one of the reasons i get sick of entertainers politicizing everything especially musicians and actors is their overall cluelessness about how things work heres my obligatory prochoice psa whether children of the 60s who attend woodstock or werent alive during gw bushs presidency or are cuban immigrants who dont understand how a real democracy work  how the system works its nice for women yeah whatever the fuck proceeds to post clueless observations on twitter ive stopped listening and following a huge chunk of various forms of entertainment due to their stubborness to constantly push personal political views on their audiences
i applaud the escorts work it amazes me how removed from humanity the antichoice group is they believe in faeries and wizards that dont exist and ignore the realities of people and life
"where does a womans right to choose end and the unborn childs rights to life start in my opinion thats the question that must be decided its a sliding scale that as each day and month passes moves from the mother towards the unborn child i dont believe that just because the female is the one carrying the baby it gives her absolute rights over the life of the unborn child from conception to birth in my opinion after looking at medical information after the first trimester the child has its own right to life now this could and should be debated but somewhere in the time between conception and before birth the childs right to life takes precedence over the womans right to choose the physical health of the mother and possibly rape or incest are exceptions that should be debated
why is no one talking about using condoms contraceptives and even abstinence until you are ready to have a child yes it requires more effort but doesnt the prospect of aborting or bringing an unwanted child into this world make it necessary and women because you will have to bear the burden your first choice is refusing to have unprotected sex until you are ready to have a child
also access to contraceptives must be cheap if not free and easily accessible child care has to also be cheap if not free"
all men protesting should get mandatory snip snip then they would be doing their part instead of telling women what to do with their bodys fair is fair
"why do women wit
 after3mo 2 get an abortion"
if women got 2 c a picture  if their fetus they wouldnt get an abortion
most of the ones protesting look dumb af honestly lol
kill babys at the borders but dont kill babys in the womb
why cant they put up a privacy fence
so many bigot retards in the usa you dont see that anywhere else
"if women can have an abortion without any input of the man then a man can walk away without paying a dime thats equality 
women my body my choice
men my money my choice"
dan should be protesting at the pub to remind the men not rosie their seed and keep their junk and sperm to themselves
its a protest they are excersing there american right people died for
"great dan well drop off all these babies at your house  for you  to raise then you and your uterus got then 

were you graped  your moms latest boyfriend uncle they  brought home by an actual relative that supposed protect and nurture you by somone that was supposed to be your friend have your boyfriend leave you once they find out youre pregnant and say its not theirs and youre a slt that slept around have fetus die inside you
no well dan maybe you and your nonuterus ought to sit this one out"
maybe we should adopt a non religious view point also for you snowflakes that are antiabortion this country is not your church dont force your religion on to other people
shame to all republicans
abortion was created by the kkk to exterminate minorities margaret sanger was also a devil worshipper stop stabbing babies in the vagina smdh
pro lifers are mostly christian men saying the same arguments and being a thorn to all women
hey america welcome to the middle ages
so are you supporting the women that have to have the children dan oh dan gives us our daily bread by your hand we are all fed
shelly mans job is to prevent women from hearing any other option last i checked a choice requires at the very least two options
god bless these antiabortoin protestors theyre trying to protect the vulnerable unborn babies
im not into butt sex but i dont go out every weekend saying it should be illegal
if you were really prolife you would want these babies to have healthcare housing and education after theyre born you would want to help their families provide those things for them but you dont you dont even want to help the women who have to carry those babies to term or help in the smallest way in their postpartum recovery by providing adequate paid maternity leave youre not prolife youre probirth and after those babies are born you could care less what you are is antichoice and antiwoman
most of them are mentake note also how are these people pro life when this woman has to search for bombs makes no sense these are old retired folks who are also sinners with nothing to do
if men shouldnt have the right to talk about womens bodies i also feel people who are not parents should not talk about parenting
i want this job do you need help
"why do you want an abortion          want it so bad you act like it is a wonderful choice in life not the unborn life thats for sure
if you need it i am all for you getting it otherwise hell if your want it i wouldnt want you to be a parent either"
all i see is peaceful protest unlike george floyd blm ones
"babies lives matter 
evil satanic lost souls chanting to abort babies"
god believes in free will
we will emancipate the unborn just as my ancestors were released from their chains  we will stop the democrats yet again from denying the humanity of others to fit their political agenda  we must end abortion nationwide
could you imagine planning for a baby then you have a medical issue and it dies so you need an abortion you go and are greeted by men shouting dont forget your baby is it a boy or girl like dude she wanted that baby and your out here making it seem like shes murdering her child screaming at her not only that but imagine being raped then going to get an abortion and your greeted with men telling you your awful for not keeping it i dont even know how thats allowed to be honest its just sick and wrong these women are being punished for things they cant help and they are going to die because of things they cant help  what is wrong with these people funny how pro lifers protest to save life then have no problem killing the mother when the life saving abortion she needs isnt allowed i think they forget women who want their babies need abortions too
yall a bunch of baby murderers
my body my choice also lets give the medal of honor to drmengele also anybody that doesnt put a covid vaccine in their bodies are terrorists 670000 murdered babies per year in the usa that is the biggest silent holocaust the prosecutors should arrest the doctors that dissected whole babies from the mothers wombs and charged with murder the mother also
and now with it being illegal woof
imagine telling a little girl to carry her child when she doesnt want it or cant take of it referring to the 10 year old ohio girl
my body my choice but not vaccines   i dont care about women dying 
third trimester abortions are infanticide
you dont have an accurate picture of what goes on inside an abortion clinic these abortion clinics sell your baby parts to pharmaceutical companies are they cutting you in on the profit
this is why i hate free speech
if it wasnt for abortion women might resort to plan b 
if you were a meme youd be a great one keep up the awesome work fk the protesters
they sometimes protest outside a toronto station they are loud and have no consideration to any children that are passing disgusting mostly old white men who have no right to say how a woman chooses her healthcare revolting to try and force their religion on others
so much drive and tenacity to comfortably walk up to peaceful protestors so brave
cnn is downplaying the significance and immorality of abortion they are making the prolife party out like they are uncool or somehow primarily linked to insane people who just so happen to be prolife most liberals arent smart or wise enough to realize that they are just being manipulated
"it is a simple math equation 

alive  human  has rights

once you begin adding more to this equation 

alive  human  sentient  autonomous  justification for ulterior prejudices"
make contraceptives sterilization and reproductive rights readily affordable accessible killing babies should not be available without medical reasons it will wake people up to not have unsafe sex and to protect themselves as much as possible hook up culture should die down a ton because of this sex makes children it is for procreating biologically if this becomes a landslide into making birth control illegal that is not ok at all women need those things to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies to begin with
good for her  i dont think i could stomach those loons all day every day without beating the shit out of them
this woman is a hero
can we hold up signs in protest with the riddled bodies of children that have been shot with ar15s
anti abortion law should accompany with mandatory male vasectomy atleast over 40y old menthen it will be more sensibles
why ppl dont understand that abortion is women health issue
does anyone know where to find data on how many unwanted pregnancies would be avoidable by making better sexual choices and how many are simply unavoidable like ectopic pregnancies and drastically changing situations after wanting to get pregnant
she was fed up with them so she focused on them
since 2007 11 workers have been killed and also over several million humans as the direct result of abortion
this literally life risking work yes idiot that is exactly what it is its abortion it is literally risking the life of every human with intent to kill
that walk is the loneliest walk if you are by yourself those women do not walk there alone they only leave alone thats what abortion does it kills humans
"all the way from norway full support for you and your pierce shelley  
i cannot wrap my head around these morons prolife this is christian fanatics with the narrowest view possible 
no sense of the real world and what is going on 
this is deplorable"
i started trading with forex trade late last year and till date have made over 127 btc even with the ups and downs since the journey  with forex trade help i no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of bitcoin  you can easily get in contact on my channel
i dont understand why an unborn fetus is more important than a womans life give people the opportunity to choose what they want for their body
good for this lady actually caring about other not like these dimwitted fucktarts who harras families who are dealing with reality
shelly is an evi person l abortion must be  stopped
and if any anti abortion activists assault me you will end up in the er
if theres something here that looks like a bomb   
these antiabortion protesters need mental health assessments they claim to protect a fetus but in doing so threaten the lives of those protecting others their religious beliefs show they dont care about other people either false prophets
whats wrong with them saying theres help and other options than killing your family member  they said deadly violence but there have been bombing at pregnancy centers there has been violence on both sides the facts they try to present are horrible women will start dying weve been dying since the womb especially us black women womens rights start in the womb
just like people can protest for abortion they can protest against it i think everyone is being a bunch of idiots
ridiculous wouldnt scare me at all people have the right to make their own decisions as to what theyd like to do with their bodies assaulting folks and threatening to kill them does your little black book encourage this behavior is god sending you dms asking for violence towards innocent people bullying people into submission will never work youll encourage folks to give you the fight youre looking for  
my favorite is when pro abortionist say its a fetus do you know what a fetus is its the third phase of the first stage of the human life cycle look it up you terminate a fetus you ended a human life its appalling that youve dehumanized the human life cycle to support your perceived right to end an innocent human life history is full of people that dehumanized others hitler did it to the jews america did it to the blacks and now yall do it to your own children
religion does this to people
prolifers dont have a damn life ironically
its so funny how its literally just old men
haha i got an ad for tiktok before this video
what i want to know is how many unwanted children have these antiabortionists adopted
what child gets to choose life the mothers choosing death for the child every single time want to talk about the inter workings of planned parenthood show the baby being aborted at 9 months
these hypocrites arent prolife they are antichoice if they were truly prolife they would care about what happens to that child after heshe is born is that child going to get proper care is that child going to get shot with a gun these hypocrites have no moral standing they have the right to believe what they want but they dont have the right to force their beliefs on everyone else to them i say 
conservatives have a fetus fetish the bible states that a fetus is not a child until god breathes the breath of life into it unfortunately the anti choice folks ignore that and think they are above god they will try and force their beliefs on god and everyone else these are not good people
this woman is really sad
the utter arrogance of the protesters is mind blowing its like they believe their own preferences should be the forced upon others and that their chosen religion should be forced on people making a very hard in many circumstances choice the utter reprehensible hatred of those protesters is vile
if one day they changed a womans mind in abortion and then that woman casually ask them to take care of the child do yall think they would accept that child absolutely not  they will definitely not do anything to that child and leave it to the mother after a prolife movement that cant even take care of a life in the real world
only in america killed by pro life people
nebraska no no i am in kansas that is so terrible
keep this thought in mind if its not beyond your comprehension when someone walks with the real christ they never have to look back wondering when someone is going to grab or harm them live in the world and do these heartless cold blooded murders of children or twist their minds with sodomite perversion you will live everyday wondering when someone will obey gods laws and commandments and send you to judgement its time to quit being puppets and open your eyes to the wickedness and heartlessness around you and either take a stand against it or burn with them
i do believe my body my choice but what about the babys choice 
bless her  those putting their lives on the line to protect  defend these women  only god knows whats going on  their needsreasons to make the decisions they have  
"i wanna butcher babies   
come on "
what a gutsy and courageous person  that doctor deserves credit too whats happening to my country
so i get pulled over for doing 5 mph over speed limit have to pay a 210 fine this guy man assaults a woman and gets a 50 fine what the f
that poor old man first of all the bible is phony there is no such thing as a god so hes an idiot there after that hes just a fascist
its killing a baby it has its own dna its not your body its a babies body
it is always better to force women who dont want children to have babies so they can neglect and abuse them for many years during the most influential parts of their life which makes them who they are as a person  it makes for great human beings in the future who are very appreciative of being put through that  its also better to have women go to illegal abortion clinics where unlicensed physicians can perform them or just do it themselves with hangars and then rush to the hospital afterwards bleeding internally  go prolife people
the problem with pro lifers they focus on their zealous beliefs and not the children that are born and are in horrible situations  once the baby is born they wipe their hands of any responsibility and thought  they should mind their own damn business and stop pushing a fictional book with antiquated beliefs on to others  i hate religious fanatics  practice your own faith to yourself and to anyone who wants to listen  not everybody believes in the same thing  most people who claim to be christians are the least chris like people i know  rarely do anything productive to help people
shell never have to worry about making the decision
lets talk about why youre so guilty so instead of making amends and repenting you decide to harass innocent people
boy that virgin mary couldnt get any paler
this just brings back memories of the people begging me not to have the abortion i was having to save my life they are so incredibly selfish and thoughtless
prolife anti abortion protesters killing and assaulting people in abortion clinics speaks volumes of their christian convictions
i drove a friend to a clinic before there were escorts  it was infuriating they mobbed my car
shelly serves the devil killing gods greatest creation is not the answer god forbid anyone use contraceptives humor about killing babies shelly promotes sin and shes worried about a meme show your narcissism shelly if you dont change your ways you will not live for eternity  just the moment
"whod want to knock up shelley
that big fcking wildebeest
mrs mann
she should have no need for an abortion that raggedyass prochoice walrus"
women will die every state allows women to get abortions if birth risk her life scare tactics most abortions are just another form of birth control for the majority of the women women close your legs men keep it in your pants or both use protect its really simple
look into how much these clinics make on the sales of the body parts of the unborn they murder to labs for studies thats on top of the price they charge the mother to murder there unborn cant you see its a business and the mothers are the incubator for the product and that womans rights to be used as a cash cow and incubator for a product they sell 
why r they showing her and the location
how come none of yall are saddened and hurt and distressed over the terminated babies or as yall like to call them fetuses
i rode my bike past protesters outside of an abortion clinic across the street was a huge billboard with a picture of a child and the message that 60 of american children live in food insecurity do these protester even care what happens to these children after theyre born
this subject is between the woman and god  
antiabortinists need to understand that the bible has two iconic characters mentioning use of the abortion pill bitter water joseph and isaiah divorce during trialmarriage joseph offering honorable separation until the 20th century most societies allowed forced birth aids until the quickening whatever these types of selfproclaimed saints of their judeochristian god will stop at nothing to be violent
"their religion  and its dogma are irrelevant on that soil find a pulpit somewhere but this isnt it

notice there sperm is past its expiration date and so they are upset"
you never hear about these antiabortion people adopting children or starting foundations to help pregnant women who feel they are too young to have a child you know how many children already suffer abuse and neglect how overpopulated our planet is which contributes to negative impacts on the environment poverty the economy etc they dont want women having children to be on welfare but thats whats going to happen more if you force everyone that gets pregnant to carry to term these people are all about making a woman have a child even if she was raped or if carrying to term could kill her but once the child is born nothing they care more about an embryo than living women or children religious hypocrisy you never see prolifers protest to get better childcare or better options for women who dont want a child but also dont want an abortion this is why there is a separation of church and state people should not be affecting the lives of everyone because of their religious beliefs
judge not least you be judged christianity is so selective these days
they want to keep bringing more children in the world and tell women on what to do with their bodies but the children in foster care or live on the streets they dont care about explain that
they should arrest these nuts preventing people from heathcare
shes extremely snobby and forces her unscientific personal emotionally charged views the pro life community ate offering help why is that being demonized its a baby they ate trying to save and saving the mother from murdering the defenseless baby
once born they all could care less
self appointed saviors   doing gods work apparentlybecause god needs them doesnt heonly they decided that
how many kids have these clowns adopted themselves yathats what i thought
men instead of protesting at clinics go volunteer for a vasectomy
i demand that you cant have an abortion and also that every lunatic  psycho can have as many guns as they want
these women chooseto go out and aleep with every guy they see and expect americans to pay for something thet dont believe in i guess to make them feel better about themselves
be more outraged by the overturning of rowe v wade america this is the hadmaids tale it here its now be more outraged
thank you
these bloody prolifers offer to help these poor women with thoughts and prayers but buggerall else send death threats to escorts and have even killed medical staff  but noo theyre the saintly ones caring about a fetus that even if it does survive its birth will most likely struggle in poverty andor a potentially dangerous home environment these nutters need to stay out of other peoples business
im pro choice but what irks be is activists who make it out like its just like going to dr for a normal surgeryprocedure a life  potential human is most def being killed and that ie heavy shit  it should be like a last option kinda deal for woman who are raped or their life is in danger  it bothers me who some woman just be huge irresponsible hos and use it as a form of birth control and then brag about it as if its some kind of activism
if youre going to take a life and its not an unborn baby what makes you better leave people alone and live your own life everyone has their own cross to bare its not your business
i would happily escort women safely to their doctors in these cases if theres one thing these women need its not a group of selfrighteous elderly bigots screaming at them outside the door they need a kind compassionate ear and guaranteed safe entry into the clinic
shouts out to the escorts you are doing amazing
when he meet his maker hes going to ask him when did he hire him as his hit man and killing people at abortions clinics way to go prolifers way to go
dan and the other protesters could actually help the children living ones like foster children i bet that would actually quench his guilt
these clinic escorts are such wonderful people thank you for protecting women
raising a child is a heroic act but should never be mandated
antiabortion is completely misogynistic wake up ladies 
right to life should start with the man not dipping his wick and end with a young person not dying in a bankers war
poor lady to stupid to know there standing up for her rights to if they get by with this next time it mite be her voting rights
always using god as their backbone there is no god its just a big scam
"people are literally attacking people going to church and firebombing pregnancy centers and trying to kill the supreme court justices but the terrorists at cnn want to talk about crimes that happened in the early 90s when i was still a toddler as if they are relevant today

leftists are irredeemable monsters who know they are going to hell and that is why they want to cause as much chaos and destruction as they can before they suffer the karma they have wrought upon themselves"
does she broadcast them on tiktok so theyre up on a social media platform for everyone to see  pretty awesome right its kinda like that person that posted content of people that in their own words were saying all kinds of radical stuff what was the name of that oh libs of tiktok its called yeah waitcnn you hated it when they did itdo it but ya think its great when this person does it so ya have zero moral compass just follow an ideology and if you agree with someone doing it its amazing stunning and brave but if you disagree with the person doing it then its awful deplorable and they should be deplatformed  maybe threatened or intimidated ya see where this train is heading right not much of a leap to go from here to throw em in jail if they disagree with our poiticsideology  seperate rules  punishments for people based on political stance ya know how this movie ends throw em in jail becomes hurtingkilling based on politics
its crazy how u trying to show this women as brave and doing the right thing when shes actually trying to justifies killing potential human beings there is no excuse  u can utter that can justify giving anyone the right to kill stop sleeping around and stick to ur families and drop that feminist way of viewing the world
thank you protestors you make such an amazing difference there have been countless women that changed their mind due to prolife advocates and ended up choosing life
"i love this dont worry women wont stand for this much longer and abortion will be legal again
we should pray hahahahah too soon"
god bless those fucking assholes
these escorting employees are so appreciated thank you so much for all that you do protecting these women and their right to choose
i wish i had 0 issues and free time to make someone else problems mine
abortion is murder repent and turn to jesus christ
when you meet your maker he wont ask you about the sins of others youve lost the plot
they are praying for you give me a fng break
why do these people think only their opinion counts
the planned parenthood clinic in philadelphia is in the gay section  there used to be weekly demonstrations there  i remember watching one and i loved it when these activists were saying dont kill your baby dont kill your baby to a man dressed as a woman
all i heard is ive been harassing people since 1973
theres a good reason that there are only a few doctors left in the country that will perform third trimester abortions and its not because theyve all been killed off most doctors know better than to think that killing a 6month old fetus and beyond is just terminating a pregnancy youre seriously mistaken  delusional if you think this man is a hero for what he does
dr carhart is a hero i hope that he finds someone to replace him
ive been in this movement since 73  awesome so how many parentless children have you adopted and raised in that time sir
wow 11 deaths dont really seem like much when you consider that over 15 million babies were sacrificed last year alone
amazing woman keep up the fight we shall overcome
i love her so much thank god for her
i would love to know if any if the antiabortion people adopt cause if ya dont you are not doing the work of our lord jesus christyou are working for the other guy
"dont these folks that have nothing else in their lives to do like protest the
bigger problems for our world"
adding an element of humorshe says abortion is nothing to be humorous about lets  not forget abortion is a big business follow the money just look at how many people they have escorting the clients
how is 3 trimester abortion not murder when all of these fetuses are viable
"pro life and pro choice is all about divide no one is listening to the victims after listening to 50 testimonials from girlswomen that had an abortion some of those were sa and are minors i can say for one is that these beautiful females did suffer mentally and emotionally most of which is guilt most of them could not let go of that strong bond with there baby despite there circumstances they have faced some of which lasted for a period of 30 years or more simply saying abortion is health care is a far cry what it really is 
some of you on both sides and i dont care which really need to listen to the victims of abortion except really having your own opinions 

if i could try to explain the connection between human beings of experiencing unconditional love
its like this my friends had a new born babyi didnt have children at that time and they told me youll never know what love truly is until you have a baby i was like yeah what ever and it didnt matter what it meant at that time a few years went by and i settled down she is 2 and half now and now i understand what it really feels to love unconstitutionally something i cannot explain 

that bond if taken away even if earlieri would not be the same person i feel for these people that chose abortion 

i hope you all find peace in knowing that your baby is back with god"
anti abortionists are right  abortion is murder  why bash chritians   they have to blame someone 
she not exactly easy on the ole eye
hey cnn instead of posting this old video why dont you interview the elephant after the roevwade decision  i really want to see it cry on live news  like all the other unhinged sjws of tiktok
prolife activist embarrass me as well as the other behaviour made by prochoice activist and the fact that the clinic escort is trying add humour to this very sensitive and sad topic how tragic is it that people are fighting for the right to kill fetuses
screeeeammnmm mm
the pro lifers also like to complain about poor people and how much money they get to support a child someone couldnt take care of
absolutely disgusting that people stand  yell at people who are often making the hardest decision of their life  they dont need some prolifer yelling lies at them or praying over them   leave them the hell alone  its none of their business  really sad that escorts arent necessary
its sad that normal people are being terrorized by religious zombies
yall are messed up
if you need an escort that would be a wakeup call for what im doing
you do not need to kill to have a good life you may opt for an adoption to give life for the child however if it means a life and death situation though so be it
would you ever abort your cats or dogs why humans then
im sure the help they offer is to send you to welfare and sign up for the circle of never ending poverty
this lady is a monster the doctor is a monster how horrible of a person do you have to be to take a job were you kill or help kill defenceless babies
3rd trimester abortion are you people nutsthats capital murderthats a fully developed babyit can live outside the mother in the 3rd trimestermay god have mercy on your soul
desperate sure because shaming those crying over babies being slaughtered is so much more righteous than shaming those slaughtering babies to keep from having to raise their own  choice begins at consent after that i still call it murder
maybe men should stop getting women pregnant go into schools talk to boys about birth control about treating women with respect no women gets pregnant on her own
you people expesselly the men how gullible you are a women can choose but a man cant choose no child supportwheres the equal rightsmy wallet my choice you know why women cry at abortion clinics hummm because there killing babies
i am not for abortion but lets be honest no one can force his or her believes on anyone that think otherwise god gave us the right choose our own destiny love thy nabour as you love yourself 
they are crazy its it harassment 
anti abortion idiots are dangerous violent imbecilic and need to be arrested
"all these protesters should have to sign a legal formfor all babies that are born unwanted for them to each adopt one baby  start saving now
adopting is more than you think how many of these protesters would agreeaybe a thirdat the most the rest go back into the system so 
 are these protesters willing to stand for the unwanted babies"
good thing some of these are about to pass
what a stupid thing people are so scared of kids getting murdered at school but not afraid of babies being murdered before even being born
send all those antiabortion activists to the cities and tell them to take care of all the homeless people instruct them to instead tell a homeless person that he or she is beautiful to feed him or her and to make a lifetime commitment to continue doing so then  maybe  ill take them seriously
these protesters could better spend their time adopting or fostering children
"conservative extremist  im prolife its wrong to kill another living being 
but will support the death penalty 
conservative extremist government mask mandates violate my freedom and rights my body my choice 
but have no issues with the government telling a woman what she can or cannot do with her body 
conservative extremist cancel culture is ruining our society
but will support a man who uses social media to incite hate division and bigotry regularly attacks people on social media and demands they are fired or ruined politically financially for disagreeing with him 
someone please help me understand the dichotomy that is the conservative extremist 
conservative extremist aka trumptard"
how do u sleep with a 3rd trimester abortion on ur hand really the world needs to end coz we r becoming mad too mad
thank you you do a incredibly tough job that im sure is mostly thankless our country needs  more people like the patriots in the video
cnn is a demonic antichrist channel that needs to repent
"i believe these children are being violated
i wonder what he thinks about the 10yo from ohio who was raped and impregnated
would he have been outside the clinicnshe had to go to for services when she couldnt go to one in her own state"
i guess everyone missed the fact that god will judge them 
this is just harassment by self righteous lunatics nothing more there should be a safety zone of at least one mile around any abortion clinic where harassment like this and protests are not allowed
"i went to a clinic one time where protestors were constantly out front

i went in to ask some questions and get some information about the services they provided

i wasnt doing this because i had any involvement at all in a potential abortion

i did it because i wanted to be informed 

as i pulled into the parking lot the protestors started yelling at me presuming i was someone going there for some nefarious reason instead of just trying to educate myself

that speaks volumes about these protestors"
keep your legs closed
how many kids have they adopted how many are foster parents how can you be a prolifer but racist at the same time
try to take a gun away from a prolifer and see how that turns out
escorts to protect people seeking health care wow  the usa is a sick country you have no idea what its like to see the insanity of that country when you come from a freer saner safer place
i guess i dont understand why those same people care so much about the unborn but dont protest gun violence that is actually killing children in schools
none of these people have permits to protest there why arent they forcefully removed by the police
"theres nothing more christian than shaming threatening assaulting and killing those who doesnt share your view 

say it together with me people christian extremists"
in the city i live in there are laws with real punishments that excludes people from protesting with 500 metres of a clinic  but we have legal abortion here in australia and i doubt that will ever change  no illegal abortions no backyard butchers no rabid christians shoving there bullshit beliefs down peoples throats
the usa are such a strange place
all these anti abortion protesters should just be asked how many children have you fostered or adopted rj in oz
"shelley is a new hero of mine  thank you shelley
and hey antiabortion cruds
you are concerned about human life  fetuses  then how do you justify killing abortion clinic workers  or not providing child care and paid leave for new mothers in red states
since when is that prolife"
is dan going to take responsibility financially and otherwise for these children
those religious nuisances are the american taliban
thats exactly what we need to do
them people are amazing theyre trying to save lives
how can i donate to the clinic escorts how shameful those people screaming are
i remember my abortion the planned parenthood i even went to initially didnt do abortions i had to call different doctor i didnt want to have an abortion now these ladies hes harassing wants to have an abortion its a need its a necessity for me it was life or death this man is despicable and disgusting and his maker will probably condemn him if he actually took the time to read the fucking bible hes throwing everyones face at and forcing upon everybody else maybe he would realize what it actually says
dr tiller was killed in a church just down the road from me
god bless these people for fighting those people who need their service  its not anyones business
theyre prolife yet they kill and hurt peoplelololol such hypocrisy these prolifers are stupid
antiabortion protester i am here to help you but i wont give you my name
what even sort of bullshit charge was that mutual consent that says something about how messed up the law is i hope shelley and all abortion clinic escorts stay safe they are doing depressingly necessary work
i have been watching her tiktok for quite a while i think she and others who do this are amazing people they deal with the probirth people days so women can get healthcare
were praying for you right now  were not doing anything
her reactions are gold joe cmon are you done
what a hero she is
imma take a little break from escorting  
would  any  human being end up with these guys  for sure not that is why abortion is invented on the first place
i love reading these comments complaining about not killing babiesby people that are alive and breathing because their own mothers allowed them to live stupidity muchwhy dont any of you take one for the teamtake yourself out if life is so meaningless to youone word hypocrites
"i volunteer to be a honker 
i am sure i can drown out those protestors"
didnt god send the angel of death to kill all the first born sons 
the taliban has a as new heartland
till all these poor people are forced to have children and their taxes ho way way up to pay for their welfare no one looks at the long picture
already saw this video but yeah antiabortion laws and protests are not gonna work if there isnt a healthcare system in place to solve all of the fundemental issues related to struggling and vulnerable mothers and children
"thank you to all the protectors who stand with clients going to the clinic 
you are so brave you make a huge difference
and countless thank yous for the medical professionals who chose to take on this work and put a target on their backs you are all heroes"
they could be volunteering in the community with kids who need attention but no spend your time harassing people trying to access health care im sure god will be so pleased with how you chose to spend your time
do they think women who have scheduled abortions should go to prison for life andor be executed because those are the typical punishments for 1st degree murder im sure some extremists have this view but the vast majority dont  because it could always happen to them or someone they love
story time i was 7 months pregnant and donated time to pp for election call purposes its important to mention i love being pregnant i love my children id even consider being a surrogate however i do believe in a womans right to choose anyway driving in to pp i was harassed and almost blocked from getting in it was scary and very overwhelming i wasnt even going in for an abortion and still felt the weight of whatever emotions the womengirls feel when going into the building i guess the moral of the story is that abortion clinics are used for so much more
"these escort women are amazing 
the protesters should be  ashamed they have no idea the men especially
hypocritical sods they have only followed their own agenda not the truth of suffering 
jesus said never to judge others or you will be judged  dont look at the stick in someone elses eye look at the plank in your own  
be strong ladies your doing a great job"
 seems odd the only females protecting abortions are the ones nobody wants to get pregnant in the first place    
truly abortions should be available right alongside other care  then for all these wackadoos would know they might be heckling a women on her way in for a tonsillectomy jokes on them
love this woman
"so these anti abortions kill people  and yet they protest about  pro life 

this is what happens when stupid organize religion takes over 

we need to destroy organize religion"
i dont think that people understand what goes on inside an abortion clinic
amazing that derelict men take no responsibility for the fruits of  their sexual abuse violence or exploitation
thank you so so very much for the work you do shelly you are an incredible human being 
im watching the handmaids tale and looks like that bookseries is slowly becoming a reality starts here so scary america so scary
i think when a minor gets raped they should implement law with death penalty for rapists other methods should be castration or injection for infertility for the rapist if the woman is adult she should decide what to do with the rapist s life  since her free will was taken by force from her i think he should no longer have free will if she decides she wants to marry him he should comply with her demands and be forced to work and be a provider for her and the baby
this country should be purged they have people ok with killing babies but get mad for people who dont support them blessed be the god of israel please show this country no mercy
imagine a group of people being so dangerous that people make a living being protected from them
"i dink the male does terrible job  
abortion is a sin"
men need a womb  nobodys business 
the religious extremists huddle together like bowling pins sure would be unfortunate if the incoming patients just 
"mostly men and a few brainwashed women
hmmm

edit the fact she has to look for bombs every morning is beyond disgusting"
that was brave of shelley
why is it almost all old men 
why do they not offer to adopt the children if they care so much and thats if they could even be able to support it properly unfortunately we do live in a world with limited resources well who am i kidding its the greed why the resources arent enough more than anything else but if they want women to stop having abortions they should go to the root of the problem start protesting against greed and then against abortions
all these crazy religious people are ridiculous the irony that they want the baby to live yet theyll attack the mother  clinic these people are full on narcissistic crazy people
stop pushing your religion on to us  not everyone is a christian not everyone believes in god
funny how these god soldiers arent protesting in front of walmart because their starvation wages create child hunger guess they dont care once your born
studies show liberals have a smaller amygdalayou can stick a plate of rotting meat in front of their faces and they wont react as badly as a conservative would liberals are not biologically capable of feeling reluvsion at things that disgust a normal person
they should put headphones on the clinic clients when they get out of the car and also have a covered walkway of support or something
"god will be the judge  not men and women 
i wonder will they be there to raise the child for 18 years 
house the child as it grows feed educate pay for medical care  
when does the commitment begin and end 
if it happens and is followed through 
we never seem to hear them  other than we can help you 
yes perhaps carry the child and then be coerced to give it up for a so called perceived life with an adopting family  who may or not give the child a better life 

or as i stated help the mother raise it to 18 years old "
the fact she has to inspect the surroundings for bombs every day says all you need to know about how far these self righteous nutjobs are willing to go to push their extreme christo fascist ideas onto the rest of society
she acts like shes walking sometime down a red carpet but shes helping to kill babies and shes so proud of that hate to see when she meets her maker
"my sister had an abortion a few weeks ago
the cells stopped dividing and wouldnt implant but also not spontaneously abort on itself so she had to if she didnt want to risk a sepsis
im glad we live in germany where it wasnt an issue as soon as she found a doctor"
thank you to the brave people like shelley who stand up these sanctimonious zealots and male anti abortion protesters have nothing to say on this topic power hungry control freaks please go home and stop harassment of women already going through a horrendous ordeal
thank god i was a christian before i heard of these so called right wing christian anti abortionist  god has told us that killing is a sin whether its those who do abortion or the murderer who kills the doc who does the abortion  however we cant get away from the fact that sometimes aborting a fetus is necessary for whatever medical reason god is the ultimate judge and if he does not strike these people dead why should a human kill them these people are the same type of christians who use to lynch blacks after church on sundays now that past time is forbidden they must find another cause celebre to exercise their violent traits sad that the name of christ is misrepresented and vilified because of these people  god is love
why are there men protestors sorry what do they know speaking of a man myself
i miscarried conjoined twins i needed to have a an abortion afterwards because my body could not pass them its called an incomplete miscarriage they died i saw a ton of specialists if i would not have had the procedure i wouldve become septic and died
you dont give a crap about those kids once theyre born why arent you fighting for those ones the kids in foster care the kids who are looking for people to adopt them how about the mothers that are basically forced to have babies they cant afford and cant feed what are you doing about them instead of wasting your time doing something that isnt going to change a thing dont you go and do some thing to actually help what is your god gonna say to you about the fact that youre judging other people when his word says not to not everyone has to have the same beliefs as you also it depends on what version of the bible you believe in in original versions it talks about the fact it is not all life until quickening which is moving around four or five months the worst part is there are people out there who have genetic mutations and illnesses that cant have kids because their children would just suffer and die they would never be able to even afford the care for these types of children yet these people are forcing them to be born to suffer and then bitch about the fact that we the people have to pay for them these people are so twofaced it makes me crazy
last week my wife and i had a scan for our baby yes the scan is lovely to see and hear the heart beat and find out the gender but that scan is also finding out if the baby is developing properly it finds out if mother and baby are healthy and the birth will be safe with both surviving if not if one or both may die or live a horrible life then an abortion needs to be talked about if that happened to us we chose life but an abortion is what would happen
my girlfriend in 1977 had an abortion when she was 17 a few years later when she was ready she married a man and they had two children shes a grandma now my mother born in 1918 knew women who used coat hangers and she was prochoice before there was such a thing glory be to a womans right to choose what is right for her own body
these protesters are stalkers and they are sick
its 2022 and since 1977 11 people was killed im not saying i have no sadness in my heart for those people who has died that is something that never should of happened but do you know how many children are denied the chance just because there mothers decide there not ready to be a adult and take responsibility for her actions even if its under the situation of rape or father left what is another example of someone choosing to stay a child instead of taking responsibility for there actions abortion is never a good thing if you was raped or the father left and you cant take care of the child on your own give it up for adoption the only time the practice is a good thing is if the mother and the child is going die if you dont terminate the pregnancy if there is a possibility of saving one of those lives you need to take it if you can save the childs life by getting it all the mothers womb as quickly as possible but the mother will still die then you need to save the childs life but if there no possible way of saving the childs life and you can save the mothers life then save to mothers life but other then that it is never ok to take a life
so why does the supreme court allow this type of harrassment at legal medical facilities but expect   freedom from protesters at their homes
i wish they would do a piece or all the clinics posing as medical facilities provider when in reality they are religious groups how is that not against the law if i set up a stand outside and say im a medical provider i would be arrested in less then 30 min
thank you for your service to our rights
god bless these escorts goddam the evil protesters they be overturned roe but they wont be satisfied even that
these peeps protesting are wasting their precious lives trying to save some
she is a bad ass  thank you shelly
yes praying for them is the biggest help theyd get from you to raise a child they cant afford to and money  time just falls from the prayers
i do not agree with 3rd trimester abortion thats a full grown baby a person has plenty of time to get an abortion before the 3rd trimester
i didnt think the walk was lonely at all there was no way i was giving life to my rapist baby who probably wouldve been a rapist too i also needed to protect my son from the monster it was 26 years ago  i never regretted it
women should be able to choose if you get an abortion at 6 weeks its not even a baby let men trying being pregnant with a baby from your rapist
baby daddys dont pay child support or approve insurance
hopefully no one trust this child murder to watch their children because she would rather see that child in a trash can dumpster instead of a crib or paying games
shelley is a literal angel xoxo
the difference between the 11 deaths by anti abortion and the babies whom have been aborted by pro abortion is a huuuuuuggggeeeee difference im just saying   its a touchy subject but pro abortions arent any better then the ones whom have displayed any acts of violence on others
if only they would stand infront of orphanages group homes homeless shelters to help the children who are already alive
the protestors dont offer to adopt the unwanted children nor do they offer financial assistance for unwanted childrens welfare they are all talk
these anti abortion protesters sre nuts  im not crying crocodile tears over an direct action that happens against them
415  only 11 people killed in antiabortion acts since 1977  thats sounds 100x safer  than being a teacher in school
"a message to evangelical radicals be not like the pagans who shout and pray on the streets or in the open market 
niv"
more men telling woman what they can and cant do american freedom i dont think so
and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not  so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more
this picketing kind of reminds me of this s those westboro baptist church bastards do
god bless you keep the faith
if you are a man you have no responsibility of being there
wow they say choose life but they kill people  now isnt that an oxymoron and and hypocritical
funny the lady in the video says she wants the choice of life but that kids are a choice if you cant have an abortion then you dont have a choice if youre pregnant and living in one of the backward states
the escorts are heroes to people seeking abortion protestors think theyre doing good work but theyre just making a nightmare situation worse no one goes to an abortion clinic without being in a very tough place in their life the shouting and guilting is awful its her body her choice end of story
i just never knew what venue i could use get to young women living in red states  but get out now  get to a blue state you dont have to live in big cities but there are a ton of medium cities with job opportunities and reasonable housing  save your money get on a bus and get to a blue state and start a new safe life  do not be controlled by a man who loves his gun more than you
omg i would probably beat these crazies with their own placards  notice they offer nothing for the women who are seeking abortion
were here to help you waitwhat your baby is born ugh get lost chump youre on your own ive got kids of my own to take care of
"im sure she wouldnt oppose the illegal protesting at the houses of supreme court justices thats not harassment or disturbing the peace thats womens rights she should record janes revenge and ruth sent us firebombing crisis pregnancy centers since roe being overturned

that being said many prolifers use the wrong approach imo and any person who physically attacks these women or kills the doctors is a disgrace and should be locked away"
instead of standing and saying theyre praying why dont they donate that time to a homeless shelter lots of young women with children do they really think god will be proud of them for harassing women who are making the hardest decision in their lives that behavior is not the god that i love
so your antiabortion but youre willing to assault or take peoples lives wtf how about all of the children already here that need to be adopted or are in foster care theyre definitely is not enough people helping and providing homes for them why not spend your time doing something that could really make a difference in the life of children
its not cool because i didnt have insurance when i was 17 and was going to get a check up at plan parenthood and had a bottle thrown at me i wasnt even pregnant i was just there to get a pap done so they dont know why girls go in some of the time
i had an abortion almost 40 years ago and later an ectopic pregnancy that almost killed me i have 2 grown daughters and no regrets over the 2 i lost these protesters are fools if it was their child who was raped or had a pregnancy complication  theyd be getting it taken care of most likely hiding and denying it
anti abortionists should be ashamed i dont see them stepping up and taking care of unwanted children they are not righteous they are selfish that guy dan in the video i have one to say how many children have you adopted
you can see why theyre anti abortion they look like the ones that probably should have been aborted
of course cnn makes a hero out of the abortion lady and mocks the people that would like to save lives discusting cnn mirder supporter
i would love to be a clunic escort id be screaming at these people to get a hobby or go to work
prayers are not going to help these women who need medical care
god given right to be ignorant though it pisses me off they choose to be willfully stupid 
im just puzzled at what antiabortion protesters and clinic bombers are going to do with themselves now will they find a way to keep living or is the spice of life all used up now
these are probably the same people complaining about babies on the border getting formula
the hypocrisy in the us its revolting i have the right to own a gun because its my freedom to do what i want but you dont have the right or the freedom to choose for yourself and your family you have to give birth to that child woman or else ill kill you with my beloved guns because im sooo prolife and goes to church every sunday like all good christians not my problem that the child i force you to give birth to is raised in poverty because you are in debt after paying hospital bills because the us healthcare system are a joke to all other civilized countries not my problem that your child that i forced you to give birth to ends up being shot in their classroom at 8 years old guns dont kill people people do background checks you say nooothat is treading on my freedom my right to own a gun even if i am a raving loony toon is my freedom freedom to walk down the street without being afraid of being shot you say never heard of him thank fck that i live in a civilized country that gives a sht about their own people and not only about money and power disgusting
i love her
i am so sick of listening to all these religious zealots force their beliefs on others
theyre all pro life until the baby is born
you wanna protest show me how many unwanted children you have adopted personally and are raising  one for each woman youve harassed and any number under 50 doesnt count if you dont live what you force down other peoples throats you dont count
moral or religious protestors which have more of and which group is more aggressive my guess is there are more moral protestors and the religious ones are more agressive that would be my guess i could be wrong
she is awesome
the abortion choice whether it be a sin or not is between the woman and their god  not self righteous pieces of crap that have nothing better to do than pass judgment as if they can walk on water as jesus did
these religious nuts are just living in their own lonely fantasy world i bet they dont even get along with one another if you talk to them they are really hard to relate to they are so lost and looking for purpose just lonely crazy people its kind of pathetic
you know what i find so funny about this video is that liberals have a record of non peaceful protesting and have a history of causing so much damage to property and especially physically hurting people  im sure on the prolife side there are always gonna be people who do not protest peacefully but the side that mostly causes damage are the liberals which carry a majority of prochoice advocates  look it up  the prochoicers are known to protest violently  recently a prolife institution was burned down by protesters
people need to mind their own businesswell help you these people dont give a crap about the child after its born
at least they arent firebombing and destroying the property of family planning facilities and their mobile vans like the proabortion extremists do a story on janes revenge next cnn
i believe is a womens right to make her own decision but waiting until your in your third trimester should not be legal
id setup a big screen tv or projector that plays something really loud on loop to annoy them maybe a biology lecture or a heavy metal band
why dont these  people adopt children and care for them in their home instead of this more importantly now what do these self righteous freaks do are they at home looking for another cause
id say okay give me your address as soon as i give birth im leaving it on your doorstep and you can pay for and raise it
what do you think will happen when these selfrighteous people meet their maker and are asked what gives to the right to interfere in someone elses life   didnt you trust me to handle my children  how do you know that i didnt give them permission to have an abortion  they all prayed and asked me what to do and i referred them to a safe medical procedure and forgave them  what gives you the right to interfere in someone elses life
none of these men look like they even babysit 
i dont think people have a realistic picture of what happens inside of abortion clinics please show us
hold on let me get something straight so if someone murders a pregnant woman they are held accountable for 2 counts of murder because 2 lives were taken one for the woman and one for the fetus reguardless of what stage if pregnancy the woman is in but it should be ok to go ahead and kill your own baby and not be held accountable for that life yep makes perfect sense now youre thinkin
god gives you the right to choice
baby killers justifying their existence looking for bombs as if anti abortion people are the killers
"an omelet does not kill chickens  abortion prevents life but doesnt take life  if these prolifers want to save children why are they not protesting gun companies that kill 1300 living thinking children every year  why are they not protesting car companies for the 1000 child deaths every rear

today 12 million american children do not get enough to eat  why arent they protesting that   these prolifers do not give an ounce of effort toward the quality of life the children that are born will face

500000 children have their lives ruined by sexual abuse _every year_  why not protest state administrations that have weak abuser laws

in 100 years that one fetus if taken to term will average 32 additional people on the planet  what about population management  do prolifers think about how to feed all these new people  3 billion world population in 1960  8 billion world population 2022  the population will grow an average of one billion people every decade

pro life isnt about life  its about the noise  its about morality  its about religion  its about putting their noses in where it doesnt affect them  its meddling

they are probirthers  those lives that are lived doesnt matter to them"
thank the clinic protectors those women are just getting health care
revelation 21826
anti abortion means anti science  anti democracy  they go hand in hand with that group of goons why wait go meet your maker in a history museum  australopithecus  oh  wait the goons think the planet is only 6000 years old  and some guy gave e rib to make a woman brain dead people are very dangerous
crimninal murders are prolife how ironic these republican peasants are
hold on you murder people who have families and friends and responsibilities but want to stop abortion to protect fetus  why some the can grow up have a family have friends then you can murder them
oh i want to do this but the restraint it would take not to choke out these nutcases
omg i cant stand christians always a pain
they dont show up with their checkbooks to support children they rail about welfare
our society has become so sickthat the elderly man who is trying to protect the life of an unborn child is looked at as the monster and is confronted by grown women trying to protect the women who is about to walk into an office to kill her child like wtffff
all this energy could be spent helping kids that are already in the system instead   how about their lives
the people that call themselves religious are the first ones to criticize single mothers and block them from any help or resources
"this is really yet another crazy uniquely american thing 
mass shootings school shootings antiabortionists who call themselves prolifers  until the unwanted child is born"
thank goodness for her shes an angel the protesters can go to hell
abortion clinics should be eliminated and all reproductive healthcare done at the hospital that way nobody outside would know where the people going in are going  no more protestersridiculous that someone had enough time to waste to sit there outside of a clinic and not mind their own business   if you dont believe in abortion dont have one  what gives you the right to know whats best for someone else
50 bucks for assault welcome to saudi america
you have the choice to close your legs or use protection any one who abort is evil
imagine your life is so pathetic you stand in front of an abortion clinic holding a sign all day
i love how we have people  running  around killing  kids and random people  with guns but yall got energy for this like what wheres the gun control u would  rather save this life so they can be killed  later in a classroomor anywhere  else they are not safe i would  rather not have a child  suffer  that at all and god forbid its a girl because  it looks like we are going  to be living  like the hand maids tale soon in this bitch also lets not not forget the fact we are killing  our earth they wont have a place to live anyway and with the cost of living  shit rising damn i can go on forever 
shocking how its mostly men w their ranting such a joke ok so she keeps it  than those men can pay for that child for 18 years
america isnt it time to not have dedicated abortion clinics which are just begging to be targeted have abortions in regular clinics and hospitals like in my country so the woman gets anonymity
this ladys attitude is so bizarrebut you know she may be another abby johnson in the making
they supposedly value life and then murder people  the hypocrisy just astounds me  maybe anti religion protestors should counter demo  there are many arguments against organised religions  wish i could do it damn my original sin
just mind your own business is your life so perfect that you really have the time to involve yourself towards a perfect stranger for living theirs how they see fit  my belief is simple do you i will do me as i see fit that goes for religion abortion your sexuality for everything that does not directly effect others you dont believe in abortion dont have one and dont push your agenda on others 
the amount of hate american have for each other is sad to see i hope one day you forgive each other and live peacefully 
people are sick in their minds thinking they have the right to dictate to people through their god 
"miss withheld name  i want u tell children that have been raped that got pregnant to keep the baby because its a beautiful gift of life  tell them that   tell that to the girl in indiana who was 10 and denied 

let women or young girl have their right to choose what it is best for them "
it would not make much sense to plant a bomb if they want to save lifes
this is the womans choice  leave them alone
"quick question all these pro life protesters that murder doctors sick women and occasionally healthy women seeking nonabortionrelated prenatal care like cheap vitamins how many of them have been killed how many signwaiving pedophiles and terrorists have been gunned down by heroes defending women

none huh that seems strange to me"
every single one of those protesters should be arrested each and every one is a rapist and a pedophile and should be locked away from civilized society
jesus wept every time they use knitting needles and the us is exporting this trash policy im not happier with my mums illegal abortion in hospital not on the corner shop ladys place than anything im norwegian theres no way someone can convince me my mother made a bad decision regarding her abilities to carry out a pregnancy  what we have now  information free access and freedom with responsibility is so valuable  no child should be born unwanted or families experience the tragedies that follow unwanted what solves this is short decision times and long preparation periods
the supreme court should now hang their heads in shame
it seems to me that these protestors are engaging in intimidation and it should be stamped on they are ignorant self rightious bullies they should be moved on in fact banned from doing what they do
people should stand outside regular protesters homes on public property and yell things at them non stop
   i can tell you what it is psychosis in american society and religous fundamentalism now its happening in scotland alba uk we scottish people will not tolerate it  foxy pagan love fae scotland vvxx
if youre pro life then just dont get an abortion
america is soooo fcked holy sht 
equal protection under the law and a right to privacy ought to be the legal basis of reproductive rights  instead we have a bunch of nuts on the street and idiots on the supreme court telling women what they can and cannot do
i am glad that the prolife movement has protested against that clinic in nebraska and everywhere else in this nation thank the lord that the supreme court has overturned roe v wade thank the lord that the institution of abortion is now illegal the next tasks that the states must do now is to 1 make all abortion illegal and punishable as a the horrendous crime that it is 2 finally make abortion pills illegal as well and aggressively pursue all people who dare sell those horrendous horrible pills
abortion is healthcare telling people someone got an abortion is against the health insurance portability and accountability act
thank you we need more people like you who are willing to help people who need the help
its ironic that dan worships the most evil character in fiction  poor delusional dan will never be able to ask god why he had 2 shebears savagely kill 42 children
i am so sick and tired of the religious sects coming and trying to push their religious mumbo jumbo agenda on everyone else if its their choice to be anti abortion cool thats your choice as thats a deeply personal choice to make i cannot believed this choice was taken away for all women i dont believe in god and just because these people do doesnt give them a right to vote away every womens choice but they did now here we are another big wtf america i seriously struggle with my daughters future here now with what little rights she has with her own body and the safety of this country truly disturbing and sad
antiabortion protesters are just bad people theyre completely full of themselves
this is good propaganda
shes a hero and so is that dr
shes a hero and so is that dr
if you are antiabortion dont doit its your right however dont tell other women what we can or cant do mind your own business and back off
what really pisses me off about antiabortionists is their hypocrisy they say that the babies should be born but once they are they dont give a damn anymore
"democrats have not been this angry since we took away their slaves those who worked to abolish slavery were called fanatics and told to keep their religious and moral beliefs to themselves shelley is no better than a slave auctioneer 

god bless larry and every person who spends their life trying to protect babies 

also there are 36 families waiting to adopt for each baby that is put up for adoption so stop with your lies about how people who are prolife dont care once the baby is born we care we adopt we donate money supplies and time 

if you are pregnant and know you cant parent reach out to a pregnancy center they will give you free medical care they will help you realize options so that you and your baby can have the best life possible "
id say so what freedom of speech if they were just standing outside with signs but harassing everyone who goes in is just a crappy thing to do plus how do they know theyre not badgering someone who has to terminate because they wont survive the pregnancy i saw a video of some protesters who did that to a woman who was heartbroken about having to abort her husband ripped into them and rightfully so
"i would love to see the reaction for all those people protesting when their daughters tell them that they got pregnant by minority man  
those same people protesting will be the first ones to fly their daughters across state lines and get an abortion"
"these people are so hypocritical they are making death threats  to harm a living person 
selfrighteous people are the worse "
man americans are creepy and so effed up
sheroe 
as this report states11 people have been killed in anti abortion attacks since 1977   that is 11 people too many  however how do all the supporters of this video support the over 800000 us abortions that occur every single year
i dont understand why the pictures of the aborted upset people if you believe in abortion why do the pics bother you
life is a gift from god genesis 96 psalms 369 he considers all life to be precious including the life of a child in the womb so if someone intentionally kills an unborn child that amounts to murder
"when i meet my maker
if he and the book you read is real it looks like he will turn you away from heaven and send you to hell for your sins of judging others according to your specific religious beliefs you not everyone you run across but just you are not to sin its not your job to judge everyone based on their decisions nor is it your job to tell them what decision they should be making that said i dont think your religion is reality nor is god but if you feel the need to save kids so much spend more time in church with signs that tell your priests to stop molesting the kids a clump of cells cant feel pain nor does it have a brain at the first trimester to register pain that clump of cells will never know it was eventually going to be human nor will it feel pain on the other situation i spoke of those kids do feel pain from what is being done to them as well as the psychological damage being done that ruins the childs whole life so ask your god if he exists when you get to the pearly gates why he helped some people with cancerbecause you know it couldnt have been the medicine doctors or your body doing it it had to be god but he never stopped kids from being molested in his house that means either he doesnt exist and thats why he cant help them he agrees with it and is fine with pedophilia or as most christians think its all part of his plan so its either a waste of time being religious and praying because he doesnt exist or he is ok with pedophilia in which case he isnt worthy of worship at all either way ill never waste my time on this disgusting religion that has stupid people who dont know their history thinking we were founded on christian principles we werent and most of the founders thought christianity was disgusting were atheists agnostic or deists rant over"
mind your business go to a homeless shelter and use your energy there or foster and adopt just leave women alone
aye thats down the street i didnt know that
where do i sign up these ladies rock i remember the taunts and yelling when i went to an abortion clinic in my early 20s having an abortion was the last thing i wanted but having no money or family or support left me alone and scared i didnt want to be another single mother who then needed to turn to public welfare i was young and alone and the father sent 12 the abortion money from 15 states away and went on his business its not that easy for us i wish men understood that the pain of an abortion and the pain afterwords not just physically but mentally i still feel badly for having to make that choice but im not upset that there wasnt more support instead of trying to take womans rights away why not make it easier and more supportive as a country to welcome children in stop punishing woman in the work place just bc ur worried they may get pregnant make health care and child care more affordable hold men accountable how is it fair that men are the ones that get us pregnant but they can ghost u and their responsibilities until what we track them down and force a dna test at our own cost while raising their bastards without help no wonder the birth rate is at an all time low men are crazy out here murdering their kids and wives smh woman need to start building all woman communities vaginas allowedmales under 14 this world is only going to get more dangerous for woman bc of men
my 67 stepdad is a clinic escort hes not had too many problems so far im really proud of him 
"to whom does he have a responsibility to be there
does he feel guilty about forcing a young gf to have an abortion"
these overly religious people doing everything in the name of god are pathetic
classic a man telling me a women what to do with her body 
interesting that those who are prolife dont mind killing you if you dont agree with them  hm
so the old guy claiming he hopes god has a lot of mercy on him because hes doing this he pretty much just admitted that hes harassing these people because he wants services from the lord if you really believe in a cause you do it because you believe in it and not because you want good favors from up above hes pretty much harassing these women because he has nothing better to do with his life 
its coldsquirt them with a hose then turn on a large fan
black lives matter sign at abortion clinic well til your 4 years old and cant go to preschool cuz yall cut the programs or they need food just shut it
thank you  in 2018 i went alone and protesters really really were in my face and no one was out there to help
i was born to a very poor family that was unmarried dad was on drugs mother was a very young single mother i wasnt planned for born prematurely  we lived in substandard housing  some might have said i wouldnt have stood a chance and that my mother was irresponsible to put a child through such circumstances but my mother chose not to abort me as an adult i love life i for one am greatful to be living  not to have been torn apart  dismembered in my mothers womb there are too many other choices than to kill a child abortion is infanticide
those antiabortionists are truly vile and wicked people
blow leaves in someones face you get what you earned b
its funny how the heroes that cnn was trying to push came off as worst then the guys saying they care about the women and children
men telling women what to do  thats the gop cult
"the left can dish it but they cant take it
these are the most benign prostesters
the rainbows are funny you cant get pregnant during homosexual sex"
abortion is wrong so were gonna take it away and cause multiple people to die bc of it im prolifetrump 2020
we will help you yeah until they are born i adopted from dcfs and seen how bad it already was cannot imagine how the foster care system will collapse after this the escorts and doctors are amazing
professional protestersmany they should direct their attention to the foster system
im not anti abortion but 3rd trimester thats murder i had an abortion at 22 years 4 weeks along i would never have one when i can feel my baby move i now have a daughter
i think we should throw used tampons at antichoiceers in case we spontaneously abort they can raise them as children since thats what they believe clumps of cells are
old men have no place in pushing their views on young women who are generations younger than them   enough
i have a feeling all these people who waste their time most days begging women to not get abortions are on government assistance regular people cant afford to stand around all day for a cause that does not even concern them or affect them
sneaky but their actors paid for fake news
notice how most of the protesters are men creepy bastards i was so grateful for my escort these protesters can be very intimidating and in your face
they hang around clinics to so called save a life just to take a life make it make sense
no one is asking these people for help or their opinion  for those men when you have the ability to carry and birth a child then you can have your opinion   girls and women who get pregnant from rape should have a choice  these freezing evangelical are nuts
"funny how they are not protesting outside ivf clinics  if life begins at conception then why are they not protesting the disposal of extra unneeded embryos left over after ivf treatments are done 
the fact that they dont demonstrates how its not about the unborn its about the control of women and slutshaming them"
i actually feel sorry for these religiously brainwashed people they have been culturally conditioned for all of their lives to believe in something that doesnt exist they honestly think they are doing a good thing all the while hurting so many around them i know about this because i used to be a fervent catholic and now i feel ashamed at the ridiculous things i thought were reality
and they say theyre prolife  11 murders  jeez the hypocrisy is sickening  well done to this woman shes an angel for these women 
hypocrite christian fascists
why would she literally broadcast how to end appointments for a day
people need a damn life
i honestly didnt know about the escorts before i found her on tiktok i love what she does and her videos
women should have the right to choose i wonder how many persons who are against a womans right have adopted or assumed the responsibility for unwanted children
ya gotta love when other people tell you how to live
dan from video how many foster kids have you taken in or adopted or do their lives stop mattering post womb how much have  you donated to planned parenthood to help young women get birth control or is that bad in your eyes too can i be a fly on the wall when you meet your maker
these abortion people how come each one dont go and adopt five children children that need homes thank you very much
i think dan is hoping his maker will look past his lifetime of earthly sins if he harasses enough woman and children 
lol certainly a problem she or her or wtf ever will not need to deal with anytime soon unless of course shes at border bar with unlimited tequila shots and a morning after chew your arm off coyote on stand by imo
my body my choice  the baby has no say because you are selfish and only thinking of you  and you are willing to commit murder im sure that baby would love to enter this world  stop being a bunch of sluts
i wonder how many of these prolife folks have actually adopted children or at least have foster kids
let me get this straight they want these women to have children but if said child grows up and is anywhere on the lgbtqia spectrum all of a sudden theyre an abomination and should have never been born sounds to me like they dont actually know what god wants or how it works im a hindu and we dont believe that brahman god is a man or woman but rather encompasses both energies masculine  feminine and not these human biologic labels
walk up to each one of them asking for money to feed said child thatll get em to shut up 
what help are they offering where are these people when the moms didnt have an abortion and they cant afford to feed their kids are any of these people foster parents or adoptive parents
shes obnoxious and selfrighteous
i think education needs for some american
lets be charitable to the anti abortionists you have to realize it takes at least 5 generations of inbreeding to get to be this dense  stupid and incapable of logical thought most anti abortionists have gone thru the 5th grade but because they are the product of brothers having sex with their motherssisters and other female relatives they also cannot stand up to the world so they usually like to b molest children as in anti abortionist men who want sex with their own daughters and expose themselves to children lets pray for them
the idea that women just change their minds and decide to abort so close to giving birth to a fully developed healthy baby is simply an antichoice myth used to anger people 2nd3rd trimester abortions only happen when something is terribly wrong i have a friend who was unable to find a doctor to terminate her pregnancy after the 20 week mark she gave birth to a baby that didnt have the top of its skull she started to show signs of mental illness after the anatomy scan and it became progressively worse with time by the time she gave birth to the baby and watched it pass away in her arms with its brain showing she was never the same person again she became distant from her other children then turned to drugs long story short she is in recovery now and clean still traumatized though
i have os o describe her display of self righteousness  like getting hit in the gut
sad these people dont help they just feel better about themselves judging others once the child is born they do nothing but say get a job take care of your child when they have no idea how the baby came to bedespicable peopleits only their right to choose not to wear a maskdeplorables
these men are doing great work im thankful they are standing up for life just a matter of time until abortion is banned nation wide the prolife generation will not be silent
nobody is helping me with my children
i just hope the protesters are for childcare and other programs that are set in place to help mothers and children
not all heros wear capes but she deserves one
were so pro life well kill you
the same antiabortion protesters who wouldnt hesitate to unalive an actual child in an exorcism and blame the devil for it
absolutely not nobody asked you  she is so respectful and calm
to all those self sanctimonious twats who think they have a right to someone elses decisions on their body the frelling foetus is a parasite its not a human being if you really want to do something wonderful go an be a mom or dad to a child that was forced to be born into poverty stop eating meat and killing insects when they bother you get your own frelling house in order first and then just maybe then if you think you are holier than thou may you possibly be in a position to dictate to a woman on her rights to her choice i want to remind you that this insane comment about women using abortion like contraception is not the norm women have abortions because they were raped or they are not financially in a position to look after a child you might even say she should have kept her legs crossed then well how about the men keeping their dicks in their pants there are also situations where the foetus dies in the womb do you really expect the mother to carry this to term and give birth naturally seriously so again to all those stupid ignorant people standing outside these clinics spouting crap about prolife you do not know what has happened to any of those women so stop judging
im prochoice but i dont care for shellys actions here as they do increase the likelihood of altercations this is selfish of her making her political points when shes supposed to be there for the patients who dont need to see or hear about confrontations at the clinic
"just ask them how many kidneys they have

either you have sovereign ownership of your organs or you dont their opinion must be that you dont and they can save a persons life by donating a kidney the operation is very low risk and actually comparable with the risk from pregnancy

maybe they think womens uterus is uniquely not owned by its owner"
these people belong on fox opinions network
american evangelicals seem to be bent on proving that they are the complete antithesis of what christ commands us to be no one in my church or family behaves like they do and we love the lord and try to share his love mercy and grace with others also not our job to judge we are all sinners in my faith that is our beliefthat everyone is equal on the other hand they aes completely foil the work the rest of us out here in the world are trying to do and they chase people away from the message of christ it is so infuriating if they want to do something positive stop voting for a party that refuses to support vulnerable citizens and especially single mothers with a robust social safety nethealthcare food shelter education child care fullypaid generous parental leave mental health care  but they refuse to support the babies that they think theyre saving its not saved if it lives in poverty and has no healthcare such narrow minded selfishness
jeeeeze theses people are weirdnuts they should be off the streets
am i the only one who sees the irony of prolifers killing and injuring people if they were really prolife they would adopt unwanted kids and give money to families in poverty but no killing doctors and nurses and harassing women is all they can think of doing sad pathetic digusting humans
"heres a reality check 
1 none of us asked to be here to assume you did thats not tethered to reality
2 its a lot of moms who will take to their graves how if they had a chance to do it again a lot of yall wouldnt be here its mothers praying for the strength to deal with the circumstances as they have unfolded outside of her initial intentions
3 ppl arent gonna stop their sexual activity or fulfilling their desires trust if a woman dont wanna have a baby she aint gonna have it laws or not period "
"completely respect their point of view 

that being saidthose same protestors are welcome to spend their resources on raising all those  unwanted beautiful gifts"
bunch of old men with nothing productive to do trying to control young women thats rich and the selfrighteous prolifers murdering abortion doctors thats even richer i guess these people are not really religious after all  they are just selfrighteous sinners
how can women be okay with forcing a 10yearold to have a baby cuz thats whats happening right now because of the stupid antirovy weight stuff were forcing little babies to have babies like it sounds like some type of weirdo pedophile b to me
shelley is great ive been following her for a long time her work is important i worked at a clinic when i was 1819 the things i saw changed me forever we have to keep this legal and safe for anyone who needs this medical care please and the lengths protesters will go to is gross they have no souls
i just love men who think they have a right to speak on a subject that has nothing to do with them smfh men please stfu
its gods will that they abort those cells
how can you support them go fund me or anything
you go girl fighting the good fight mybodymychoice
there is goes their motivation they want to be save by their god when they die due to their own sins  the only for them yo get rid of their guilt is by judging others
i want to know how many unwanted children these protestors have supported
i wish there was an inbetween i hate the idea of abortion but ultimately it is a womans choice and i dont think anyone has a right to choose for her
so the antiabortion folks are there to fight for life even though they possibly could be placing bombs in places where it explodes and take lives curious just curious
ask dan what he thinks about kids getting shot in schools and people being shot anywhere and everywhere
if you dont care after you never cared before
lets be honest by the looks of her she will never need an abortion
but theyre ok with everybody and their mom buying an ar15
"this is a form of eugenics for the first time in the entire history of the human race even of all life women can now choose with whom and when to have their baby women did not have to be forced to accept their fate it was up to them whether or not to start continue or cancel the process of childbearing so they can stop that process rather than have to endure an undesired pregnancy this was a decision that never existed until recently in our evolutionarily timeline now we are one again set back by primitive thinking forced unnecessary to accept ones fate rather than having control of their own lives
religious lunatics thump their bibles and cannot come to terms with how technology has changed our world"
anti abortion zombies are the worst of the worst when they turn up in hell theyll be totally surprised that their shallow selfishness wasnt taken as holy
people need to stop abortion is wrong if its not a cause of rape to abort a child just cus you wanted to have sex is just wrong and if it inconvenience you then so be it there are a lot of f up momsfor real some people would love to adopt a baby or two but you have itches that wanna abort innocent lives i dont feel sorry for any adults murdered  a life for lives yeahsorry i dont care if its not because of rape or health issues then no i dont care cus theres birth control etc these are grown responsible women upset cus they cant abort a baby and go back to whoring or whateverno thats just wrong
why dont they spend their time screaming at men not to impregnate people
register to vote to stop the gop from making this country worse and shape it in their handmaidens tail like draconian society where white old men dictate how we should live
is that enough have u had enough  of feeling righteous today _i love her_ she somehow says it wo sounding confrontational or condescending it was n a lovey jokey way like when u tease ur fam
i am absolutely astonished that millions of women arent protesting constantly the courts have made all women second class citizens whether you agree with abortion or not as a man  i would never be silent if the government took control of my rights  its a national problem when fewer numbers of women blacks latinos turn out to vote than middle aged white men before this comment makes you angry check out voting statistics nationwide
this clinic saved one of my friends lives after her assault thank you so much to this woman and every single volunteer who protects those who are seeking healthcare
if a man beats a woman to the point where she loses her unborn baby  that man is charged with murder if a woman kills her unborn baby by having an abortion its not called murder
how hypocritical not to mention insane is it to call yourself prolife and then murder people  and they keep invoking god but god says that only he can judge us so they are actually the sinners themselves  another womans difficult choice is none of their damn business
somebody should go up to them and say fine you can help give me half a million dollars to pay for the ruin of my life raise the baby for me pay off my student loans if youre not going to actually help stop lying and gtfo
exploiting the vulnerable
in the 80s i picketted a clinic with fetal info from the american medical association to give to clientsescorts lied and said the pamphlets were false lying murderers
speaking of life    these protestors need to get one    way too much time on their hands
"shes a national treasure
we need more of her"
these people protesting are judging others which is something their god tells them not to do they should keep their noses out of other peoples personal issues thank you shelly for doing what youre doing mybodynotyours
these so called pro choice  are the same ones who oppose to death penalty  hypocrites pos want to kill a innocent baby but want to save a scumbag from death what you expect from cnn liars
sanctimonious bunch  smh
selling babies to wealthy families has always been a pro life agency cash cow saw this first hand
"none of these antiabortion protestors appear to be very bright have you noticed that
this seems to be the only way they can feel powerful about themselves
by making young girls miserable"
358 they call themselves prolife
as a man id like to ask all 35 billion of us to just shut up and let women decide about their bodies
would they pay for a child or even take the childadopt i mean how can people and politicans be sooo behindim really sorry for youand hope that there would be a other option that opensbut i think first they need to see what that doesand that will be cruel
its the longest walk from the car to the clinic because its the walk of shame
theyre the creepiest group of geriatrics ive ever seen in my life id be soo ashamed to count myself as one of these antiabortion ayholes
abortion of turtles are punishable by jail time or a fine up to 100k let that sink in
after fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into beingthis is no longer a matter of taste or opinion it is not a metaphysical contention it is plain experimental evidence  dr jerome lejeune professor of genetics at the university of descartes paris discoverer of the chromosome pattern of downs syndrome and nobel prize winner
a bunch of religious nut case who has too much time on their hand 
i dont have a problem with people wanting to protest abortion it the way some of them do it protest the practice not the patients the protesting in front of a medical facility should be illegal dont force yourself on people who want nothing to do with you
"these same people were willing to kill grandma in 2020 so they could eat at applebees  
they dont care about living people"
so much love from these protectors of life
"protesters impede citizens and they dont work
parasites"
those antiabortion crazies are just going to get more violent in states where abortions are still legal now that roe was overturned by the lying christo fascists on the supreme court its terrible what women who need this procedure will go through and like the dr said many will die
theyre just upset theres not enough kids in the world to religiously abuse
dan i hope youve earned points to really meet your maker
those religous fanaticss should move to afghanistan
religious people are the ball and chain of progress and civil society they are dangerous vicious and violent
"go to college  read the bible  get some sense they refused now america is gonna continue to pay for the prolificacy of ignorance and laziness for allowing a career conman become president for voting for a party that continues to mislead and brainwash folks who continue to vote out of fear and hate rather than open their eyes and ears to the carnage of gun violence and physical and mental health importance of abortion 

until the people of america wake up and understand that the pretense of morality thats become the ideologies of the gop and their faithfuls recognize that they been in decades long running con by elected officials who care more about power and money over their voters safety the country is on it path of internal implosion republican senators reps and supreme court justices have money and  access to security and abortion if they so need it the rest of yall can continue to perish ok the altar of their fraudulent ambitions"
religion is a factor of the ignorance being celebrated as a virtue in the us
they need security at clinics
thank you for this important coverage of women helping women
i used to work for  abortion clinic and the word abortion is the complete wrong word from what i have seen the correct word should be dismembering or killing
prolifer killing people thats just rich man this stuff is so hypocritical you couldnt make it up if you tried 
"i truly want to go there just to distract the people protesting lol 
like pretend like im debating on the abortion so the real people they are victimizing can get in with out being harassed"
for the abortion doctor that performs third trimester abortions i swear if i get my medical license i will take on any position of yours necessary
ryan state is currently passing laws to sue any medical worker lawmaker judge or executive official who put bans on any point in the abortion process
ok prolifers are injuring people with guns so i guess they just dont give a shit about life or death after the fetus is delivered
first of all gods not real second dont be an aimless douche and deny people quality healthcare third its not a child its a zygote thats not even a human yet forth it is not wrong for women to make decisions about their bodys
i really really really really really would love for a woman to go for an abortion and to tell them aaaaalll the reasons why they are getting an abortion and calling them out for their bullshit
maybe we should be able to make certain spots free drivebys to get rid of the trash just a joke
"are they gonna pay the medical bills will they care for and feed that child educate them 
if not stfu"
like the women having an abortion havent already had a hard time coming to that decision
60 million babies unborn have been killed since 1973  now its your turn the consequences of this sin are the shootings that are held weekly against civilians in schools colleges shops discos etc  lets count how many are killed
i want to ask these prolifers if they actually think about the child after its born because if the answer is no then you dont have a fucking right to sit there and say well we care about these children
send this video to all the right wingers you know
that guy is right about people breaking the law and having abortions then people will not follow a law that says guns are ilegal
20 of my generation was aborted if america were a family with 4 kids mommy and daddy government would have to explain to the other 4 why they said their brother or sister couldnt live
if you cant speak for yourself democrats will kill you
"when the guy named dan stated he thinks the children are being violated and being murdered by definition theyre not a child theyre not born theyre unborn 

do you think anyone of these women are doing abortions like they go to starbucks wtf be better"
shes a hero for those women keep it up
my gf and i make 120k collectively i would love to have a kid but we cant afford the life a kid deserves in seattle why should a forced birth be a thing if it would make 3 lives worse
"makes me wonder how many things havent been accomplished how many  children are without a friend who could have been the perfect one for them all lives matter and yes im all for gun control because human life from
beginning to endmatters"
well help you well help you right now  i dont believe it  i wonder what they would actually do if someone actually said yes please help me  i bet not a lot other than useless words
"11 antiabortion murders in the us 
50 million abortions since 1973 in the us 

i like how people talk about antiabortion violence like it happens often"
let he who is without sin cast the first stone
keep religion to yourself 
its not pro life its pro birth then its all about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps when you dont have any bootstraps forced birth is basically forced poverty
theyre not prolife theyre antiwoman they couldnt care less about the baby once its born
want to see insane unreasoning fanaticism  just look at any one of these delusional antichoice zealots
i wonder how many of these wellmeaning people are willing to take care of these children theyre forcing people they dont know or care about to carry to term
alot of men are gonna hate child support
any one that kills to stop abortion is exactly what they preach against they only care about these fetuses until they are born then they could care less what happens to them get shot at school starve get abused get sick get rapped get into drugs or alcohol  etc they dont care as long as they get born to suffer
i wish they could put their passion for life towards the living already here they dont give a damn about those babies once theyre born and they look down upon the mothers these people need to mind their own business or really help children that are already born
anyone who thinks abortion is a right should be eligible for euthanasia at the whim of anyone else its the same thing you can end a baby on a whim we can end you on a whim
the good lord is gonna call you a jagoff
germany has a liberal abortion law but also one of the lowest rates in europe why when it is legal you can get accurate statistics on age economics etc then you take action free contraception free childcare increase welfare housing these are proven to reduce abortion bans drive them underground so hypocrites can ignore women taking pills and traveling and pretend its not happening they never take the actions proven to reduce abortion do they
get ready for hell shelly because its coming to you
these decisions of having a child has nothing to do with these people
too bad these people dont do some real good by volunteering at a shelter i wonder how many of them have adopted kids or fostered them id guess none
all these people she is talking to are tent christians bottom feeders they suck the life out of communities for money and power patriots for a better america 
this woman is a hero to every pregnant woman who is a victim of dv or attempted murder what people fail to realize is that the number one cause of death of pregnant women is murder
i like how she talks to them like theyre poorly behaved dogs hey hey no no noohhhh ok stop
and theyre like all men lol
self righteousness thats all that is shame on those people shame on those people for shaming women shame shame shame
the protesters have a right to freedom of speech and the clinic escort has a right to their freedom of speech
best feel guilty for interfering in the lives of unbelievers bible says not to do it so doing it is going against gods word only people you need to be tellen not to have an abortion are the people in your church and as for the unborn    ecclesiastes 423 so i congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living but better off than both of them is the one who has never existed who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun
wonder how dan treat people of color are you an all around good person god doesnt look at one good action if your granddaughter was raped by a beast youd want her to carry it deliver it would you look at that child lovingly
212 he has not been in this movement since 73 lmao bc prolife was not a movement in 73 lying clown 
"really is a shame when people fight so hard to kill babies smh
instead of telling people that are pro life to find ways to help children in foster care how about learning to abstain from sex if you dont want a baby that would also prevent more unwanted kids from going into foster care"
i use to be prochoice until i watched a 5minute video on youtube  its of an abortion doctor testifying infront of congress describing in horrific detail the entire abortion process  hes performed thousands of them  that video completely changed my way of thinking  im now prolife and so is he
the antichoice protestors are the scum of the earth and you cant change my mind
both sides are lunatics look at yourselves in a video
for them to actually think that yelling at these poor women will change anything is extremely misguided
i would so lose my shit when somebody like this would approach me 
instead of wasting your time protesting adopt an orphan and make a difference
antichoice thinkers are hell bent on controlling others as an escape from their own lives the false rush of heroism they feel defending a cluster of cells is much easier and much much much less risk and sacrifice than actually helping actual children
communist media
"its sad these self righteous anti womens body choice will heckle and preach to preserving life while not help those thousands of children in foster care yes all
life needs to be protected and cared for not just heckle people into their political ideology"
they are paid to be there sick
its really dangerous proceeds to show video from 1993
"its simple if you believe abortion is wrong dont get an abortion
if you believe women should be forced to birth babies then you should be more than willing to pay more in taxes so the money you pay goes into social wellfare programs that help raise unwanted babies prayer doesnt pay the bills or feed children"
selfrighteousness is something else
if theres any prolifers out there just know that part of being prolife means caring for the fetus and the pregnant woman even if their decision is against your morality youre supposed to be respectful to every human being prolife for all humans not just the unborn
these doctors who perform late term abortions will be judged we will all be judged
why dont they spend their time helping those who choose to keep the baby because a born baby is not worth their care anymore damm hypocrites
escort work that is something i can do it didnt occur to me im large scary looking and trained in multiple martial arts ive learned how to project my voice to terrifying volumes i can easily out yell a loudspeaker i am going tomorrow after work and find somewhere to help
democrats live killing babies
shining the light of the truth on the cockroaches on the right that patriotic woman made my day
reproductive freedom begins in the bedroom  its your  choice nobodys taking away your rights to have a baby  only your choice to kill your baby because mainly of convenience  be responsible and be accountable abortion is not healthcare  unless life of mother and baby is at risk in which case its done in a hospital setting by your obstetrician not a clinic abortion doctor
"i think that abortion is terribly wrong i have a responsibility to be here
no matter what you believe no matter how strongly you believe it under no circumstances is it your right much less your responsibility to try and dissuade someone from a life changing decision that is likely already hard enough
get a life and stop interfering in everyone elses"
i had just say how crazy it is that you have to look for a bomb that may be planted by someone that is prolife want to kill u to what  save lives how ludicrous
100 the only reason these creeps do this is because they think they will be rewarded in heaven theyre literally doing it for themselves
now fix the welfare system give those single moms with 4 baby daddies a pay hike for they can raise their children well
"i love how these people speak on the behalf of god 

also the strongly religious ones if we could find out if the baby was going to be gay or transgender would they be against abortion

thats what i thought"
im cracking up at all the comments of people thinking you need a god to know its morally wrong to kill a baby how about we thank the 96 of thoses of you had those abortions for no reason other than convenience and thank them the reality is that the 4 that actually did require that procedure like those that had miscarriage or a topic pregnancy or those that were victims of rape and incest like that little 10 year old girl from ohio this weekhad the 96 not misused it all  these people would be able to still have access to it in their states with probably hardly any pushback considering its a lifesaving procedure but i guess youre not ready to have that conversation right were just going to keep blaming all the antiabortionists and all the religious nuts right it most assuredly has nothing to do with the fact that 96 of women who had the procedure since roe v wade used it as a form of birth control and not needed it medically just it was inconvenient time to have a baby the level of narcissism its seriously laughable and im literally laughing as i say all this because were acting like thats not the case here were acting like its the other sides fault and not the proabortion side you dont think all those videos of your advocates screaming they will gladly scrape their babies out and all those videos a fathers crying outside of abortion clinics because they got caught cheating so the mother decided to end the pregnancy rather than try to work it out because revenge is always better that way i guess or maybe it was the fact that 74 of abortion providers in america are men and they have been giving testimony before congress for years now about the trauma they experience as a abortion provider the fact that they see these little babies faces the fact that they go into great detail about how they are ripping babies inside the womb from limb to limb but its totally totally the antiabortionist fault that this all happened they made the proabortions do all these things and lets not forget that you cant have abortion and racism separately because the whole reason abortion exists was based off of racism and eugenics something that you cant cherry pick around so be mindful when youre saying proabortion youre saying im pro racist im pro eugenics i am pro a master race because that was the whole reason abortion came into existence in the first place here in america on a mainstream scale it had nothing to do with providing women with birth control or alternatives it was to control the populace and remove the undesirables and for those of you that are saying well ill go and get my tubes tied well guess what they also did that to 350000 americans that they deemed undesirable same industry but with the us government backing them the fact that most of those that are pro abortionists have some sort of mental health issue makes them the prime candidate so you willingly doing it to yourself means that they dont have to go behind your back and do it youre still fitting into their agenda and a quick google search would tell you everything im saying planned parenthood admits to all this you all just dont read the first couple pages of their website stay woke
hey dan your wasting your time there is no gods
all these old men thinking they are helping people lmfao 
jesus if they believe in him or the bible would never act like these aholes so bizarre i will never understand
we will help you what does this protester do to help
keep it up shelly youre inspiring
id really like to see proabortion people start   protesting at churches
"why would there everin the history of human beingsan acceptable reason for a third trimester abortion 
with that said i believe in the right of a womans right to choose but this isnt a direct to consumer product there should be limits same thing with guns

the second were written when we were a fledgling country with no military and the weapons were musket loaders guessing no mass shootings back then"
its drives me crazy that people dont realize that only 48 of the us considers themselves self religious
wait is cnn saying theres something wrong with being against the killing of  bbis these leftists need to give it up life won murderers lost imagine living in a world where you have all these medical ways of preventing pregnancy but you lean back chill  knowing you can just erase your mistake by taking a life well those days are over go do something and prevent pregnancy in the first place since youre so against being able to give birth like a normal human being
ask these protestors what jesus said about abortion  anti gay protestors what did jesus say about homosexuality  of course they will deflect but they cant give an honest answer
i wonder how many of those protesters would be willing to support that woman and her baby give her a home to live in babysit while she works buy food and gas every time i ask those people about the born children their answer is that its not their problem ive never hated these so called christians so much in my life all they are doing is turning people away from christ and i hope one day theyll see his wrath i hate to hate this much
how many millions and millions of mothers chose to kill their unborn children since 1977 a hell of a lot more than eleven tell both sides of the story
radical christians are going to destroy this country not radical muslims thats even more terrifying
11 people got killed by pro life protesters 
they would be useful if they were at an orphanage helping but i guess thats not their problem
glad shes getting our message out  keep it up shame people are ok killing babies
how can you be prolife say that an unborn life has more rights than someone who is already alive how can you call yourself a prolife when you have no sympathy or care for existing life and you are willing to kill that existing life to exert your selfish beliefs
i had an abortion while i was 15 i tried to kill myself first but then ended up in the emergency room i was raped by uncle for 4 years it is not anyone elses say apart from the mother period
i think these people who work at the clinics should be able to shoot protesters if they get violent
cant believe that the us is regressing back into the middle ages in a few decades saudi arabia will become more progressive than the us
these socalled pro lifers are pro birth not one of them will take one of these babies after they are born the hypocrisy of pro lifers angers me no end why arent they advocating for things that will help the women after the babies are born they are supposed to be pro life but yet send death threats to people i despise the lot of them they are hateful hypocrites
"dan and the rest of these creeps need to shut it 
i hope she get some people to whoop their ass"
you can have your opinion great now leave others to have theirs
thank you for what youre doing
the only person that has any say on wheather or not a woman terminates a pregnancy is the father and if it is rapeincest his opinion doesnt matter the decision to carry and deliver a baby belongs to the woman
youll notice that the protesters are men
killing people for the right to life  that makes sense right
"just like the mothers feel an abortion is the right decision they feel being there protesting is the right decision i have a solution to this problem

 i am a man so i really dont have a say so in this i dont personally believe that abortion is ever the right answer but putting a kid through a rough life or even worse isnt the answer either 

if youre not ready to have a kid you should not be having unprotected sex no matter how good it feels you need to fight that because as good as that feels having to go get an abortion probably feels the exact opposite 

 if you want to write to kill a baby without the fathers consent then the father should be able to opt out of not wanting to financially take care of the baby and you if you were to have the kid women trap men with babies and then take half but put maybe ⅛ of that to the kid  the rest goes to her because she deserves this"
protest these protesters
"here after libs firebomb and vandalize a 3rd pregnancy help center in the  last week just saying its not about safety of the mother or rape and  incest when less than 2 of all abortions counted in the us63m since  73
its about you affording that latte in the morning lefty aint it"
call out taliban terrorists and fascists for what they are complete criminal scum
"no one knows when the soul inters a fetus  the bible never mentions abortion 
  i am for freedom of choice as long as its early or life threatening or rape and insist 
no one knows your story until they walk a mile in your shoes 
  the supreme court is wrong on this one and we must fight for justice for all"
how ironic that the lady at the beginning said their focus is the women and the children and their right to choose life she doesnt even realize the crap thats coming out of her mouth the whole point of abortions as an option is so that women have the right to choose what they know is the best choice for them personally without it there is no choice what a moron
wtf she sounds proud its my job its what i got to do im like this where we are as americans i understand the society place for this but fast stop pop and go is probably sending the wrong message that reverberates long passed that sad lonely walk please think about that or not and someone else will then what we should argue maybe more education maybe parks that unstable people can kill them self before turning on others or even better we mind are own business keep eyes on phone and never help talk or care for anyone but are selves just saying slippery slopes creating dopes is so american god bless everyone i mean it i believe and i believe you do to
its difficult to keep in mind that this is the 21st century
numbers 5 11 to 5 31 god describes how to perform an abortion these religious fanatics dont know their own binle
more emotional manipulation the anger and hate is on the pro abortion side no matter how hard they try to condition your mind to soften and accept the horrific process of murdering a baby this reminds me of the soft lies that lead the jews to the gas chambers the sick twisted mind it takes to believe you are doing the victim a favor is unimaginable
those protesters shouldnt be there i dont even know why they care so much but dontwont go adopt or foster kids leave other womens vagina alone
its ironic to hear dan say those babies are being violated individuals shouldnt be violated by others do you think girls and women are violated when they are raped do you think little girls are violated when they have to endure the trauma of undergoing pregnancy or postpartum do you think women are violated when their government criminalizes their conversations between their doctors im pretty sure all these things take away life as they knew it children are not citizens until they are born born children cannot make medical decisions about their bodies until the age of 18 are we going to see dan outside his elected officials office trying to fight the violations of these living beings 2 guesses
goddess bless this woman  she is a hero
i love shelley what an incredible women thank you
typical onesided cnn report eleven people killed in abortion clinics since 1977 how many millions of babies killed since 1977
so the guy who said when he meets his maker he hopes god forgives him because he holds a lot of guilt for not being there morebullshit its because he did something in the past hes trying to make up for period
i think the 10 year old that was raped and had to cross state lines to get an abortion was violated three times first by the rapist second by the supreme court and third by the state
the abortion doctor is an example of what to think regarding womens right to choose women will suffer the consequences due to the bans and all for what some cells
deathcorts
shes not the hero we deserve but the one we need go shelley
i love it when they say the right to choose life cause that leaves it open to the right to not choose life
shes not even the good kind of escort is the irony lost on anyone that the escorts are dressed in gay pride colors and one has a gay pride umbrella its a womans right to choose is my personal opinion that being said its extremely disturbing that we live in a society where people are more concerned with the rights to kill an unborn baby than the rights of the unborn baby
we defend lifegod sides with those that protect children not those that out of selfishness demand the right to kill their children youve got to be severely mentally ill to want to kill innocent children and think thats okay
i wish i was close by to help block these protesters id just walk in front of them with a big ole white board
i dont see anything wrong with the protesting but i dont think its very effective better to hand out pamphlets with information and engage in dialogue
the shear irony of pointing out the 11 people killed in anti abortion attacks deeming them as extremists then following up with an abortion doctor who kills babies in the 3rd trimester when theyre viable this world is upside down
learn science you will find your maker
god kills more babies in one day than all abortion clinics have in 10 years
only 11 deaths sense 1977 that doesnt make things sound dangerous to me they have more of a risk of death while driving there i hate when people threaten others with different opinions though
they all seem well intentioned just horribly misled
youre doing a great thing helping those women
"your are in  trouble wih your soul shelly
go and look at the open vision of hell
at fatimago see what hell is about
go see the description of hell from stfaustinashe was lead by her guardian angel to he chasms of helland she saw diffrent caves and caverns with diffrent types of tortures in themmost terrifying torturesaccording to how the individual used their bodies while here on earthi hope and pray that you will convert soon and turn your life over to christbecause we all are going to come before the judgment seatand we will all half to take account to everything that we did in our lifetimeboth good and badyou will have no control over your destinyyour soulyou only have these places to goheaven hell or purgatory

fatima prayer taught to the three visionariesstraight from arch angel michaelohmy jesusforgive us our sinssave us from the fires of helland lead all souls to heavenespecially those most in need of thy mercyamen
"
the protestors are fighting for the children but there are children who need abortions after being raped and they dont care
pro life pro death all annoying af took me a minute to figure it out
bad logic saying people will do abortions themselves if we dont legalize it for doc supervision is like saying people will do drugs and wifebeating themselves if we dont legalize it with doc supervision so the logic implies we should have heroin facilities abortion facilities and beatyourwife facilities
my heart is breaking for america right now  how women are stripped away from their rights and forced to endure an unwanted pregnancy is cruel  prolifers dont value life  they just value giving birth no matter what
why is it always weird nasty looking old men that hang outside abortion clinics its true ive been there this is truly beyond my comprehension theres something wrong with them
jesus told everyone not to judge or condemn others to treat others as they would want to be treated to love their neighbors these people protesting are judgmental people who want their will obeyed i bet they feel proud too i know where that pride is coming from they are not getting into christian heaven
i think the lady mad cus she cant get a man
thoughts n prayers  votes on the side of guns guns guns for everyone  protests for the right to not wear mask during a global pandemic  protests to take away the rights of women to make a decision that only affects their bodies  its severe and dangerous mental illness
they are killing to save lives what a bunch of crazy people
those protestors are from godhe will keep them safe
welcome to the unitedstan of murka whenre the cristban are controlling their women but at the same time are bombarding other countrys because they are controlling their women amd put them only in burkas bravo you freacking bunch of hypocrites that are protecting preachers that are raping 10 years old little girls that need to get an abortion paid by the church to protect the reputation of those freaking pedophiles preachers bra vo this is why your country is now the laughingstock of the world
oh no 3rd trimester abortionthat is so fucked up
"catholics should believe prayer works but thats not all we do we have pregnancy centers to help those who do not wish to be pregnant there are adoption centers there are other options than killing the child which cannot be blamed for being conceived blame the rapist blame the drunk blame the irrational actions of humanity but do not blame the child
further the people who attack prolife and pregnancy centers and commit arson against them should be held accountable not because their views are different but because they destroy publicgovernment property all they are doing is taking options away from people who might need them i do not agree with abortion and i can try to persuade pregnant people not to go through with it but i cannot force them not to nor is it right to bomb or destroy abortion clinics just because i do not believe it is right"
the crazies and nutjobs
abortion is a terrible thing that nobody likes just like cancer just like heart disease why would you stop providing top of the line medial attention for it why would you ridicule someone for having to deal with it why dont you stand outside of an oncology clinic and harass cancer patients for being in their situation weather its their fault or not because thats stupid i will say it again for those with short attention spans like me these woman and doctorsmedical staff are not pro abortion  just like oncologists are not pro cancer and firefighters are not pro fire nobody likes abortions
i would just hose them down  give them a blast of water on a cold day
nothing is more entertaining than seeing upset leftscum
assault by mutual consent its not a boxing match she was assaulted had it on film and they were like yeahbut no  the heck is that
who would ever know that a rapist would have more rights than a 10yearold rape victim
the thing is they are not going to help you  despite what that protestor said
stupid people you going to financially support the woman and her child after birth  of course not 
sick people the ladies made hard decision to abortion leave them  alone
yet these people want to ban guns to save kids 
they dont care about the life if they did they would do more to support children after they are born
how do i become an escort
how can someone be prolife and go and murder random doctors and patients 
these holier than though american taliban specimens from the shallow end of the gene pool are creepy  this zygote obsession is just bizarre
nothing as hateful or judging than christian  love nasty bullies of the worst sort they only focus on this one topic instead of the thousand of others things that can help people
abortion is healthcare that woman is a fucking hero 
i dont think she has to worry about getting pregnant
is it too late for my friend to get an abortion how late is considered a later term abortion is 37 too old for one i mean the kid is actually 37 and doesnt know how to change the damn oil in his car or mow his own lawn
those people need to get jobs how do they have all this time to stand around and try to force their views down some poor womens throat this is insanity
interesting that the only bombs have been left by proabortion folks but no point in letting facts get in the way of good old propaganda
of course most of them are men  they have no say
"can we drop off all the unwanted babies at the houses of the protestors 

no because theyre not financially or emotionally secure enough to handle america take care of a child and its not a good idea to force children onto prepared people"
why would you think the clinic for the procedure is the place where these women havent yet made their decisions clearly they have decided and you just dont redirect their decision and are harassing them to change their mind  thats not what i would call a choice  if you really care move your picket signs to politicians and ask for better funding for women and children particularly people fleeing abuse 60 of women that abort will have another baby later most people getting abortions are teens afterwards they go on to get educations and start families with people that arent abusing them many people who sorry consider their fetus and the life they would have lived and decided thats not a good enough life for them they know their decision best 75 of reported abortions happen to lower class women so if you really care about women being able to have babies you would work to make sure the babies we have can afford to live  there is a formula shortage babies are dying from a formula shortage common we visit can barely feed the babies we have
tell them to write a check for 21 years of care
omg these people the woman in the blue jacket go home and mind your own businessthe escort lady is fabulous
what you see are old men former rapists and pedophiles pissed because women didnt have to carry their unwanted zygote as a life long burden
"the people fighting so hard need to be exposed 90 are addicts that get paid also if you ask a lot of people against it 9x out of 10 they had 1 or more abortions when they wanted it but is against anyone to make that choice 
alway remember the one screaming the loudest is the one with the most to hide"
protect her at all costs
why always the anti abortion people are the ones you dont want to fck in the first place
i would love to have this job every morning i could low key make fun of anti abortion jerks while helping a women in a rough time you dont often get to choose both renegade and paragon points neat
this guy is disgusting he literally rips babies limb from limb that is so truly horrific
thank god people fight for the child no one is killing them and protesting abortion their thought is to protect life obviously they care enough to try and help the people
too bad they dont spend time with the foster children who are neglected instead of shaming women
who needs the taliban when you have the christian right in america
living in the usa is like living in afghanistan
if jesus was here he would volunteer to work as a clinic escort
why arent they protesting rape or deaths in foster care or working in a childrens home or teaching the next generation or mental health issues you know something to actually help
"good for her 
vote out all antiabortion politicians"
this is so fvcking weird clinic protesters really theyre crazy
hypocrisyi think these unborn children are being violated having their lives taken away and they turn around and rape them why dont these righteous prolifers care about the already born children being massacred in mass shootings i dont see these prolifers picketing outside washington demanding strict gun laws  protect the unborn but once they are out of the womb they become a fair game
the religious people who are antichoice  forget how many pregnancies ended when their dietys flood supposedly wiped out millions they dont read their garbage book close enough nothing fails like religion 
i dont feel sorry for anyone performing 3rd term abortions f them
hmmm didnt she say choose
"its so sickening that those so called prolifers killed doctors

theyre not prolife theyre probirth

once the child is born they dont care"
the right to convince someone to not abort the unborn is as fundamental as a womans right to deside codify roe v wade please so i can compel a woman she is beautiful and doesnt need money to have children boo on gal dont like it whora servants of life keep up good work
what does your fake sky daddy say about this matter go read that good book no god cares for the babies
sonow it is right for a person to choose babies live or die think about it whether it is a risk to you or youre raped or whatever your reasons are never justifies you deliberately killing an unborn child and woman think its only their decision to make wow we all have a responsibility to protect babiesor
their right to chooselife asshats
be mean these people need to be told fuck you get out of here scumbags
the pro life movement is a religious movement
news in the future research has shown that the god pill works the pill that was invented a year after abortion was banned in america in 2022 and has now largely reduced worldwide religions making the world a peaceful planet again the religious fanatics who were responsible for so much suffering around the world will be given an option from now on keep your beliefs in your home or face mandatory chemical treatment the last generation of selfrighteous god believers are expected to be died out within two years
protesting loud and proud as long as they dont have to tell their names its a pathetic clown show
all these republicans arguing about the value about lifeok lets ban firearms that have been responsible for so many school and public shootings  i can bet the caring of life stops there for most of these hypocrites
hahaha   only 474k views  
scary times were living in
its always people without the ability to give birth that want control over it those old men need a hobby
yo this woman will never have to even think about getting an abortionnuff said
what a wonderful example of strength and love this young woman shelly these people are so fixated on their selfrighteous rhetoric that they cant think logically i hope when we revisit role v wade in the near future under another case the stop the protesting women on a federal level will have the right to choose again
lol what 3rd trimester abortion that is farked
those antiabortionists may be wellmeaning but totally naive and deluded
instead of these pro lifers trying to guilt or assault or cause bodily harm to someone making their choice to do something that isnt their business they could be more productive adopting a child in the system that doesnt have parents that amount of attention could shape a kid and be more pro life than this
"hey women

close your legs"
it made me laugh the opening was all men i cant imagine these people change the mind of many people probably less than 00004
they should show what the pro choice do to the pregnancy centers
if  dan has such a problem he and his nosy friends should got to an adoption center
somehow these nutjobs forget the womans right to her life what a waste of a life to stand and ruin someone elses
dont these old white men have something constructive to do maybe help in a soup kitchen
"more than 60 million legal abortions have occurred in the united states since 1973 

are you telling me the united states had 60 millions medical problems and rape

there is a different issue"
"zachary king a satanic high wizard said without fail there is at least one satanist in every abortion clinic
i wonder if she is that one"
the brainless goop has control over a womans body
to those antiabortion please take all the homeless kids abusive by parents of kids back to your home to raise them before to shoot your mouth on somebody else body business those idiots are not understanding raise a kid need 2 things ready before you want to have them 1 mentally to be ready as parents be responsibility 2 financially has to be ready stable income for long run
to those antiabortion idiots please take all the homeless kids abusive by parents of kids back to your home to raise them before to shoot your mouth on somebody else body business those idiots are not understanding raise a kid need 2 things ready before you want to have them 1 mentally to be ready as parents be responsibility 2 financially has to be ready stable income for long run
"shelley gd bless you for your courage and for your commitment to womens rights to reproductive freedom and autonomy

i was at an executionseve vigil outside san quentin when i saw someone wearing an operation rescuesweatshirt i went up to them and thanked them for being there and for witnessing that prolife means prolife shooting at injuring or even killing someone is not an act of love and compassion but of rank hypocrisy at its vilest you cannot be prolife and support the death penalty you cannot be prolife and not be a pacifist or else you prove my thesis that the christian right are not christian  not are they right"
their right to choose life isnt the use of the word choose ironic
i love this young ladies drive and tenacity to stand up to those who want to impose their religion on a free society
i wonder how many kids have these prolifers adopted
funny how people have to worry about bombs from prolifers
kinda wish these anti abortion groups would just mind their own business women going to these clinics probably have a reason to be there what if its a young 12 year old girl that was raped by a relative is she not allowed to have an abortion or a woman that has to have one due to medical health problems these pro life groups dont know the story of that woman and they need to leave them alone
good for her  an abortion clinic bouncer awesome idea
this is sad
i wonder how many of the protesters actually help any of the children once theyre born since theyre so concerned about an unborn child  do they help any homeless children or any hungry children or any children who are being targeted by pedophiles and sex traffickers  do they do anything to help prevent all these tragic mass shootings that take the lives of innocent children like the ones in uvalde who were really just babies  just wondering since theyre so concerned about an unborn childs life
dont like abortion then dont have one
love this woman
this gal is awesome
the anti abortion protesters should be sent to do missionary work on north sentinel island   good luck
its female right to do whatever they need to do
amazing support  why are those men even there it is not an easy decision for women to make and they only them live with that decision  whether we agree or not with that decision i bless those who allow woman this procedure safely
everyone is here to help until they have to actually do something i dont hear any of them offering to adopt or to pay for the kid how many kids have they fostered what if its sick what if its from rape or incest  should they still think about their baby what about the little girls who end up pregnant from their own family members should they keep it too yeah these guys are just assholes theyre not helping anyone and if there was a heaven they wouldnt be going there the only thing they do with their lives is judge and hate kind of the antijesus _
not today larry   i hope this sweet lady walking these women carries i dont agree with abortion thats my personal stancechoice i would never be unkind to someone doing that lonely walk
abortion is murder
"anyone who gives birth to an unwanted baby should give it to these people
they might as well start taking care of these babies"
"so im wondering about those men out there who intentionally go around impregnating as many women as they possibly can are we going to start enforcing mandatory vasectomys im not trying to be funny or sound ridiculous we thought not too long ago that it would be absolutely ridiculous to have any of our rights as women as human beings taken away from us it seems that everything is our reality as women well what about men how would they feel having there reproductive rights taken from and dictated to them
but no that would never happen  thats totally different isnt it"
i love the fact these protesters are men as if they can relate they will never understand what these women are going through or what its like to be pregnant theres a lot more single mothers out there then single fathers and thats a fact they dont know what its like and act like they dont play a part in getting women pregnant instead of protesting why dont they go help feed poor children or children that have been abandon in foster care the foster care system is over loaded with children and these idiots want to stop abortions so more kids could suffer smart
im pro choice but third trimester abortions thats months 79 i hope these are the rare cases where the mother was at risk of death as thats pretty late in the game to terminate
men should not have any input in this issue it does not concern them
"and their right to choose life sounds more than a little backwards lady 
its the right to choose period now banned by cult politics so you should say the legal obligation to choose life"
help you do what feed them  cloth them pay for daycare educate them its a hell no they just want you to destroy your life and abandon you and the kids
why are there no young protestors hmm
why not have these protesters contribute to raising these unborn children i believe that it would be beneficial if they could cater to all the needstill the kids finish college
at least 11 people were killed in antiabortion if you can kill people people can have abortions because in your eyes murdering living things are fine
"what rights have those men have to say anything about a womans choice women can say something about other women but definitely no men
saw a reporter asking protesters about adoptions as their opinion 4 people holding banners not one are a adopting parent
these people should mind their own business"
overturning roe vs wade is not about giving states a choice but about a small minority of people imposing their religion and their beliefs on the rest of us
"now thats the exact opposite six prolife centers have been bombed and 34 others prolife centers have been vandalized by left wing cults 
democrats at least try to be parents  let your kids know about safe sex if your kids uses condoms the only will they not get pregnant but they wont catch a sexually transmitted disease and its easy as that be a real parent teach your kids the right things dont teach them to spread their legs have sex with anybody without protection we wont need these abortion centers if this happens quit being horrible parents teach your kids about sex"
these people just do not understand everybody is on team life here you are often asking a mother of 2 to die with her fetus that will not make it to birth and will only kill the mother of 2 leaving two children without a mother now all because you think youre saving a life but in reality youre killing 2 when it doesnt have to be you need to get those images out of your head that women are just having fully developed living children killed off because they want to
when you meet your maker he will ask you who gave you the job of condemning women and why cant  you clean your own house before trying to clean anyone elses
this is just so sad  the men out there have no idea what it is to be broke in a america and being guilted into having a child you cannot afford or maintain  to judge someone for having an abortion is outside of the christian faith  this is not about saving lives it is about exerting control over a womans body  we cannot and should not stand for it  our country is going backwards and it is so disheartening   you want to save a life but are willing to kill to do so  makes absolutely no sense
"i love this woman

im also very proud of the men in this country who have gotten vasectomies"
lol so she thinks she is god around that baby killing building 
im sick of these pro life people who clearly dont care about life at all if they did they would see the importance of abortion and the tie between abortion and saving lives not to mention the psychos who claim to care about life who are killing doctors
youre a monster you escort women into kill their children 
we will help you suuuure you will liars all
all antiabortion protestors should be willing financially to help all mothers and babies in need programs wic etc if their so concerned about babies and life but nope 99 are prolifers who deny abortion gun reform laws mask mandates for covid vaccinations up til birth will they care about the mother and baby then they kick em to the curb damn conservative hypocrites
shes a rockstar
your god wont let you into heaven by dictating what someone else does with their body
they are kind of like the us military they go to foreign lands to teach that killing people is wrong by killing them
why do these republican anti christs want women to die i dont understand  im so confused
i can hear karen screeching from here
"abortions are racist 
we dont want the
word to go out that we
want to exterminate the
negro population
 margaret sanger founder of planned parenthood"
this woman and all the other workers and doctors are all so brave and such bosses  that 80 year old doctor whos still working  i think out of a sense of duty is unbelievable in his dedication to the healthcare of women and their right to choose  also those demonstrators saying well help you  its like how  give me an abortion because i was raped  give me an abortion because your loving god allowed my father to rape me  give me an abortion to save my life  give me a couple million dollars for all it will cost to care for my extremely deformed  ill child  what the heckin heck  the us is now about a half step away from the handmaids tale
not all heros wear capes and not all angels have visible wings this woman is a treasure 
"im really wondering whats the percentage of ppl against abortion that have actually adopted at least 1 childand from this country

alsothe stock price for the plan b is going to soar if it hasnt already facts"
"nobody asked you should be the motto everyone follows 

before you say something ask yourself did anyone ask me if not shut the fuck up"
"imagine people willing to hurt or kill someone else and claiming to care about unborn lives
 just sick "
yes because this prayers are gonna pay for baby furniture and formula right 
so a clump of cells with no brain formed get a choice but the woman its sucking the life out of as it drains the life from her so it can survive while acting as parasite to her doesnt matter that she has a choice 
every family has an ancestor who squatted behind the woodpile with a sharpened stickor a knitting needle and they are liars and fools to deny it my great aunt did  a rape victim at 16 in 1949 can you imagine throwing yourself down stairs drinking horrible things a k  knitting needle  a butcher
these clowns dont want abortion there are 400 000 kids wharehoused but the ones with the big mouths will not adopt any of these poor kids just all talk i am pro abortion and i have adopted 2 kids
men have rights women have the right to abortion because slavery has been abolished in this country we can not call this land the land of the free if we still own peoples bodies women need to move to states where abortions are legal
all americans have the right of freedom of speech  pro or con
no love like aggressive threatening christian love i believe in magic and want your rights taken away as a result  thats what this crap boils down to
we must organize and attack the rich  get up now people    theyre going to make us fight each other    when we have to fight the rich
why is it mostly old white men protesting also its disturbing that they keep calling out mom
"abortion murders defenseless unborn babies
there is nothing wrong with that right
"
this is ok but doing it to a supreme court judge doing their bidding isnt horse rap
there isnt a single antiabortion birth center  that offers a denmark box much less factual information about 12000 personal tax deduction per child child care credit  head of household credit  child support eligibility for medicare supports that these prolife people vote against in every way while they slutshame single parenthood
hang in there shelley and these stupid idiots must not know that its not only full grown women that want abortion to be allowed its little girls that actually get raped or molested by older men that actually did the service so keep doing what ur doing bc u know we need it
what an evil woman everlasting hellfire with the satanic majesty shall be her only reward
i wonder if the same people that protest outside of abortion clinics are also protesting after mass shootings  i mean if its about life then
well help you  my rear end those crazy obstructers are most certainly not going to be helping anybody financially they have no understanding of the dangers of what they are doing and why is this old fogy dan dude standing alone outside this clinic how creepy gross is that im thinking this old fart wants to coerce young girls to keep their babies under his care while he abuses them sick pervert 
they will help until that baby is born then you are on your own
these people are disgusting in the uk we have some legal exclusion zones around abortion clinics to prevent these people from attacking these women as they enter they should all be arrested for harassment
why are some of the terrorist protesters allowed to hide their names they are standing on public property harassing and terrorizing women who are exercising their legal rights we deserve to know who they are  so that we the majority of american citizens can go protest at their homes and businesses
yelling out mom is the most toxic misogynistic garbage i can imagine
the thing is all of these people are completely ignorant to the real ethics of abortion its pathetic and completely uncalled for read a effing book  will yas
dan instead of standing out there holding down the sidewalk for decades why not do something useful like volunteer at an orphanage  that is where these fetuses end up that you supposedly care about
dont these protesters have jobs
i wonder how many women have said i will keep the baby if you protesters cover my medical costs and how many protesters said yes i these protesters wont give money or adopt the baby they arent helping they are just doing it for their own religious purposes
"i wonder if the third trimester abortions are for medical reasons only im not anti abortion but i used to work in a maternity hospital for a very long time specifically on a nnu and we treat babies from 24 weeks onwards and attend deliveries from 22 weeks onwards just in case there may have been mistakes with the dates and the babies are older than thought i would find it hard being part of the medical team attending an abortion at that gestation unless it was on medical grounds because im so used to resuscitating them and treating them at that age 
we dont do abortions in the uk over 24 weeks unless its on medical grounds i would however treat any mother with caring gentleness and understanding they are going through enough trauma in their decision and dont need a load of moral crusaders shouting and screaming at them during such a difficult time"
i would permanently eliminate those evil protesters
lmao  that one womantheir right to choose life  yes they get to chooseand it may be to continue the pregnancy it may not
its kind of thought provoking that each of these protesters are a carbon copy
as a man i dont get these men who only want to earn brownie points with god as the one guy said when i  meet my maker i dont want to have any guilt he says this about a situation he has no business being involved with in the first place
people with emotional problems trying to relieve their guilt and shame by projecting it onto others slinging their christian mythology like a weapon against vulnerable women its preposterous
all these protesters have way too much time on their handsget a job and contribute to societyjeeze
she is making herself a targetshe doesnt need to engage with the ppl who are out there she surely doesnt need to be posting it on social media exposing herself to the dangers of the world its no surprise she was assaulted her job is to escort the women nothing else
july 4th means freedom for all  this country is less free than the rest of the industrialized world
they should make a law where antiabortionists are forced to give a 1 to orphanages see how fast they change their tone when they have to take care of born kids
women are 2nd class citizens in this country  when a man talks about abortion it is in my opinion very boring  men have no idea as men will not get pregnant nor have an abortion  july 4th apparently means freedom  but freedom from what exactly  tyranny  well tyranny is right here in the image of greg abbott  desantis clarence thomas alito kavanaugh  all men  men talk about womens choices or lack of them
if youre not the doctor and youre not the pregnant woman its none of your goddamn business
instead of protesting in front of the clinic adopt an orphan child and raise himher youll make hisher life better
i cant wait for those people to find out they get to go to hell and its the escorts who are doing what jesus would do
follow these protestors home  stand on the street and scream at their houses about how their religion is such horseshit and watch them lose their minds  good times
ask all these protestors what they think of states rights thent ell them these women are using the rights afforded to them by the state let them explain themselves
those protesters should be allow to be there only if they give 90 of their income to orphans
i bet if the abortion escorts were 6ft 4in wearing body armour and carried ar15s these morons wouldnt get in their face so much
these people clearly think that aborting is killing  its not killing or murder  its a foetus  most abortions happen in first trimester
the anti abortion protesters look like  cult members
i can see prochoicers havent dealt with their l very well
dont these people have jobs they stand outside abusing people for a living congratulations to shelley
good for her
"more bs in the name of a man made religion

tax religion to fund these clinics"
i like how men are against abortion  gtfoh
looking at the faces of antiabortion is an argument for abortion these people should have been aborted
really scary and creepy those screaming protestors
sooooo happy to be european
a country where whackos are in the ascendant overall decline is obvious to all in the rest of the world
the depressing irony of antiabortion activists who call themselves prolife sending death threats
so doxxing people is the cnn way show videos of an abortion
to the old man in red when you meet your maker you will be judged let everyone else be judged when they meet their maker too many individuals trying to live their lives of others live your own life mind your own business and stay out of the business of others
these people only care about the unborn once theyre born theyre some one elses problem
a gift really of course youd know that every girl wants the gift of a forced birth after being raped you prolife people  need a mental evaluation 
i live about a half mile from this clinic and everytime i see these protestors my blood boils they need to mind their own damn business and leave these women alone
when you meet your maker the good lord will probably send you straight to hell for judging and sticking your nose in where it isnt needed shame on them for being so cruel
this woman is amazing and has an unfathomable amount of patience these people are so creepy and make me so uncomfortable
i dont give two shits if you put me on tiktok so i dont know what thats supposed to do 
only in america land of crazies
so this is where the proud baby killers are if your pro choice go get sterilized then yall wont have an issue with someone trying to save a child from being flushed down a toilet you are all evil people
pro life people are pro birth  they dont care about the life of the mothers or the life of the babies after theyre born they dont care about the lives of the millions of people living on this earth they have one agenda and thats to control women  they do this to prove how very christian they are  look we get it  youre christian  but butt out off my bedroom my doctors appointments my uterus women deserve to have control over their futures
we cant see her placing them on tiktok in this vid
just wait till they see the lords face on judgement day
those creepy horrible completely wrong people hassling those poor women good on you shelley you are a hero
killing babies is not cool murderers may she burn in hell
what if her mom still wants to abort her
"remember that the littlest victims need an advocate they have no voice a mommy who doesnt love  them to even bring them into this world theres no  babyshower for them waiting theres a lonely  painful    death in that clinic
that guided walk  is the walk to extinguish the right to life guarantee by the us constitution
the advocates of life of precious babies   are therein the hope of saving a few
god bless them
q "
i wonder how these prolife christians can worship a god who ordered the stomachs of pregnant women to be ripped open caused women to have miscarrying wombs took joy in watching babies being dashed against the rocks caused nursing mothers breasts to go dry starving her infant to death commanded that every man woman child and nursing infant in entire cities to be murdered and killed jobs family just to win a bet
notice it is mostly men against abortion men cant have babies and when one is coming by surprise a lot of them get lost let the women decide how they want the rest of their life to look like
maybe they should help foster kids with their time that would be an act of love
why is always old white men protesting its gross that they literally prey on young women yes prey
these people protesting need to get a life and leave these patients alone
you baby butchers are so insane
he probably abandoned his kid someone look into that he made a comment that seemed personal
so theres abortion  how about free health care and day care till 13 yrs old then  how about free education to all levels then  fkn republicans  seperation of church and state  theres only like 13 of u that are even catholic
why are abortions performed in separate clinics in my country abortions are performed at general hospitals
this sickness stems all the way from the topreagans trickle down theory at work yes im talking about the way they are taking a crap on all of us  this shyt doesnt happen anywhere els hell it dident happen before reagan the 50s were an incredible time for the regular people every one could obtain a bright future with a little hard work our government is broke and i dont know if it can be repaired
finally the lowest of the lowest human beings can feel better than someone so ofcourse they wont shut up
until they can prove that they have been helpful to  pregnant women by paying the bills by adopting a baby or child they really have no ground to moralize and judge others judge not lest ye be judged  wish the supreme court judges who overturned roe v wade had heeded that biblical quote
excuse me  anyone with a penis shut tf up theres no accountability for the sperm donor in this scenario at all they can shoot their load  and walk away  keep your religious bs  out of our vaginas and our lives  thank you very much
it just kills these people to say pro life because then they would have to admit theyre pro death ooh what a brave move for this pro death women  to aim her phone and put someone on tic tic because she disagrees with them thats true courage
these people have nothing better to do than harass young women
"i went to get an abortion in dayton ohio i was 30 years old and in grad school i didnt think i could even get pregnant
anyways  people were really out there protesting i didnt know this was a thing i on my own decided to keep my baby after seeing him on the ultra sound i was in my 2nd trimester that was a surprise too i instantly fell in love  i dont know how to really explain it i just fell in love 
the screaming yelling and pleas from the protestors didnt make me want to keep him 

my son is now 7 years old  love him so much   i never got my 200 back but thats okay i knew it was  non refundable

i truly understand both sides of the argument 
its a complex issue i wish it was an easy right or wrong issue but its not because the woman does have to carry the baby in her body adoption isnt an easy option either i would  could never ever do that"
"well help you  well pray for you
oh good thatll do the woman a lot of good maybe spend less time on the sidewalk and more time backing up your promises"
thank you
why are you weirdos pushing abortion on everybody stop it  push prevention there are multiple forms of birth control these days and a great plan b at every drug store in every city pushing abortion is just a racket to get money for planned parenthood which is based in hatred for black people and in killing as many black babies as possible  abortion should be safe rare and yes legal but you guys had to push for abortion in the fourth month the fifth month the sixth month the seventh month the eighth month and the ninth month and you want every american to pay for the abortions by funding planned parenthood and paying for any abortion requested  that is fing ridiculous and unacceptable
do you fake religious freaks know what an ectopic pregnancy is its when the embryo develops in a fallopian tube instead of the uterus where its supposed to be after 8wks the embryo is now a fetus until birth if the embryo grows it will explode in the fallopian tube causing the mother to bleed out and die get a grip not every abortion is their choice
i dont know how you define the word screaming but none of the people that you showed on here are screaming at them
hold the phone  he told the woman shes beautifully and wonderfully made  oh no  not that
another man imposing his belief onto a woman
unemployed religious people harassing others
american christians are brainwashed religion all religions just makes people dumb
oh yes and how are you going to help them give me a break give people the privacy they deserve
dan needs to go to hell for his sins
crack heads
"metallica song_ and justice for all

halls of justice painted green
money talking
power wolves beset your door

hammer of justice crushes you

third trimester abortions that she calls rubber  god is watching
losers harassing people nothing more mind your own business
047 their focus is on a womans right to choose their view of life not a womans right to choose whatever her conscience decides only to choose a prolife stance and they dont see the irony or duplicity of their statements
this woman and every womans health clinic worker is a hero
third trimester doctor scrambles the babys brain and then gives birth to a killed infant thats reality prochoice do you have any limits
go shelley  my mottoif you are against abortiondont get one  keep up the good work
she is amazing thank you for all you do
imagine getting up every day to slander people going to do what they think is right for them
do you plead for teenage orphans with no dad and a toxic mom on drugs do you plead for orphans constantly bullied at school for stuttering and having a lisp do you know what type of hell it can be to live like that do you plead when ted cruz cuts social funding and mental health funding for the very poor probably not you are probably to busy judging them
women have the right to choose
who are these old men who think its their business to tell women what to do with their own bodies
what about rape babies being adopted and molested by the rapist do you this god is disgusted you people cherry pick the bible a lit do you protest against sexual harassment and sexual assault in the work place shelters ect you probably are not bothered much if at all the body is the temple of the holy spirit sexual immortality is the only sin against the body god hates sexual sin more than abortion based on what i have read in the bible do you rail against female veterans getting raped at the va do yoursil against fully topless pictures of women bing in display at the welcome desk and make and female shared fake medical clinics what do you think god says about lust fornication sexual explanation molestation oppression of the poor oppression of damsel why do you just take on the one cause does doesnt require grave a baby is easy to live but adult you can blame and judge and you still dont have to give them grave when jesus dies he dies because we are all guilty no one deserves heaven you are supposed to pay grace forward why do you only plead for unborn babies and do you plead for any other part of their life their parents life
what about female soldiers and veterans being sex trafficked
do they vote against food stamps social assistance female soldiers getting raped and retaliated against by chain of command and female veterans getting for ed to prostitute for housing education and medical benefits the earned with their service why is only the birth of a baby and thats it you are done
i hope dan would suck his thumb and shut up as if he should have any thoughts on any individual womans  personal choices about their health
help  you ask him how many kids has he adopted how many kids have they fostered  how many social services programs he supports and contributes too because prolifers are the same republicans who want cuts to welfare and social programs that help the youth they do full of crap it makes my blood boil
okay so pay child support then  men
i just had an abortion todayi regret nothingwill do it again if i want to
what is this  contraceptives for every occasion  no excuse for abortion at rate women are wholly irresponsible  killing babies in mass is uncivilized irreparable an abomination  not in mass limited when and if necessary
we need to start taxing churches in the usa  they pay zero taxes but pay millions to get anti abortion legislatorsjudges elected
the catholic churches  could take care of all the orphans in the usa and still have enough money left to house all the homeless
men protesting abortions is like women protesting vasectomies
wow she is a hero
"that walk is the loneliest walk if you are by yourself

that hit me hard"
shameful that this is still happening i thought we stopped this years ago  i would volunteer at a clinic im not fertile anymore but i remember being a young woman  i have had all the children i wanted  these women need the same support   i dont think i could be quiet after dealing with these hate filled people everysingleday   okay pro lifers adopt them  but you have to adopt all of them  right  all races all disabilities diseases and deformations   if you agree to adopt every single one of them we may have a possible negotiation  we both know that isnt going to happen so until we have a better idea lay off   embryonic transplant taking a fertilized egg and moving it to a new womb is unfortunately still years away  perhaps well have the ability to adopt children before birth but until we can this is necessary
i really wish god existed pretty sure he would tell his believers to stop being idiots and lend their efforts to people who actually need help
but this is the same old white man that votes against feedingschooloing kids
much praise for this brave woman and those who work along with herplease people understand that women who make this choice are doing it because they believe it is the right thing for them to do
all we want is the right to choose you want to choose life great you do that but let others choose as they themselves deem fit
why cant people just mind their own business
abortion clinics think the focus should be on the women and the children  isnt that like orkin saying their focus is on the customers and the termites
thank you for the work youre doing shelley please stay safe 
shes 10
i mean in nebraska you were able to abort a baby at 22 weeks even if you dont have a medical condition so these people dont know how far in you are and if ur aborting a 22 week pregnancy you probably should be heckled
imagine being so prolife you plant bombs that kill women and health care workers
"this woman is a real hero
and with a healthy sense of humor too
awful the kind of stuff she and others have to put up with though"
soooo abortion clinic attacks if thats not the most hypocritical thing ive ever heard like  i thought whaa arent u here to save lives wth 
bunch of fing hypocrites  beautiful gift of life is so beautiful that these same phonies dont support programs after children are born  prolife my a  probirth only
they call themselves prolife when they wont put a mask on to save their own families
229 i believe that the here that he was referring to definitely wasnt the clinic though please dont try to make up for the regrets of your life by putting guilt onto anyone else do something meaningful with the remainder of your days gramps or just get drunk at home for the rest of your days its better than bullying young women
as a follower of the message of yeshua jesus im saddened by those that believe that message has become a club to beat others the simple message is a tool for self examination and self empowerment it is not a weapon for controlling others
in most cases woman use abortion as a form of birth control
the crazies have nowhere left to go and the wealthy are loving the show
the same people that are using christianity as an excuse in this video must forget exodus 1145 god literally killed babies just say you are an asshole
i find it amazing how these protesters think they have any say over another persons life
how about stop the sperm movement or a mandate for condom use where are the men taking responsibility instead of protesting violence and shirking their role women do not get pregnant on their own and many times not their choice
focus on the fetus cult members ridiculous hypocrites
choice 
the reason fewer doctors are doing 3rd trimester abortions is because they know what theyre doing is wrong
yeah patients euphamism for mother choose life your mom did
american the land of the free except people have lost the right to choose when to bring life into the world  a baby is a great thing if you are able to support it but if you can not sadly it can destroy your life and you will ultimately dispite your best intentions you can easily destroy the life of that  innocent child do t we already have enough seriously damaged and disturbed people in the world already
what is disturbing or ironic about these protesters is that they ignore so much other horror going on to focus on this but never realize that destroying our civil rights is a far greater horror and danger to our society than the reality of a few abortions the forced birthers wont adopt vote for healthcare support families at shelters they do nothing for living children or families it seems all they want is to punish women by forcing them to carry unwanted pregnancies
the protesters are not the enemy
isnt it amazing that these right to life peoplemaime and kill peoplethreaten all kinds off the same
it is the absolute height of hypocrisy that some of these protesters want to stay anonymous unbelievable
im sure these women are eternally grateful for everything you and your professionals are doing for them youre sooooooooooo necessary 
there are so many reasons people come to these clinics i never thought i would feel intimidated crossing a line of protesters since i wasnt seeking an abortion i was so wrong these protesters are an abomination
these anti abortionists are my heros not getting into the rights and wrongs of abortion they are sticking  up for what they think is right very important in a democratic society its because people tolerated alternative viewpoints that society is what it is today yet when these same people so grateful for free thinking in the past are now becoming the fascists themselves
you people need to mind your own business
so many commas missing on all those signs one genius after the other
they know that an embryo isnt a baby its about control they dont support funding to children in low income families they celebrate the murder of minorities and immigrants at the hands of police its about taking away personal liberties the gop only care about controlling people
every time a woman has sex she can get pregnant doesnt mean she has to have that baby its her decision and no one elses the bible says life starts at the first breathe so it isnt about religion its about control
wow these ladies are wonderful how can ww support them
that clinic is decrepit and sad just like whats going on inside  the doctor is decrepit too
leave people alone get a hobby none of your business
jesus would say mind your own fcking business
shes doing the lords work which is why i fear for her life
this highlight the hypocrisy of the right assaults and murders justifiable as long as it is antiabortion activist doing it a graffiti against the overturn of roe v wade threat oh hate crime terrorism
"self righteous hypocrites pretending to care about children 
ask them what they have done to help single mothers or their children crickets"
when the cops dont remove the anti abortion  predatorsprotestors they grow in stupidly  numbers
"evil always mocks good this is especially true when evil loses the battle

now that roe v wade is dead good had won a victory over evil and evil women like this babykiller are trying to protect their blood money

im sure slave owners in the antebellum south were no different"
shes as funny as the plague
"very good idea

these sad people need to get their dose of attention 

let us all see how perverted they are"
antiabortion really but aborting the lives of doctors and nurses is not against their gods will
of course its the maga hat jesus freaks that are protesting   they complained about having to wear a mask during covid but imagine being forced to having a baby
wonderful anti abortion people are such hypocrites refusing to vote for politicians who will help pregnant new mothers with healthcare childcare livable wages better school funding etc
i personally dont believe in abortion maybe because i was never in a situation where i needed to choose but that doesnt give me the right to choose for another person  every body have their own experience and need to make their own decisions  also a lot of women that have abortions is because the father wants nothing to do with the babies and they cant support the child on their own is the law also going to make those fathers that dont want the babies to support the child when they are born  or are the antiabortion people going to take care of those babies when they are born do the antiabortion care about a child that is not wanted and get abused neglected they only care about the now but what happens in the future after the child is born
but its okay to form a mob outside the homes of supreme court justices and threaten their families right i dont see these antiabortion protesters doing anything violent if not for double standards the left would have no standards at all 
its a health clinic not an abortion clinic many services besides abortion are provided cnn do better
clinics need valet parking at the door  escorts in to the clinic
i fucking hate them
thats right people killed in anti abortion attacks the irony isnt lost on me what a bunch of a holes
"i hope these old man and delusional woman one day understand what they are doing i dont think they individually have adopted 5 or 6 children leave those woman alone they are having it difficult enough because abortion in not a hobby
those loudmouth screamers should make themselves available for helping families who are poor and dont know anymore how to feed the ones they got
thats in the bible you know help it doesnt say stupidly shout"
these creepy people are selfishly doing this for themselves because they think they are getting brownie points from their god they are in fact quite evil
a developed country
women in america have more rights over their bodies when theyre dead then when theyre alive thats so fucked up
slime using their religion as a weapon
how tf do these people pay their bills and still have time to protest like this lolllll
oh my goodness  these idiots make jesus christ himself look bad
ummm why are they mostly men
this is a sadly divisive issue nonetheless i cannot support either side of the controversy both sides have a point but they also are way too dismissive of each other
what a bunch of saddos who have no job or life and just hang out at clinics all day
something is very wrong with the doj  i am really scared  why is trump not in jail  has ag garland been compromised as bragg was in nyc  are we losing our nation to religious extremist ideologues
yes watched her tiktoks from the beginning and she is brilliant respectful until they get nasty and then she puts them in their place love it
protect shelly at all costs
250 imma call her karen since she had her name withheld
bunch of old white people pushing christianity
love how men aka humans who cannot bear children want to force women into doing their bidding
people equating abortion with death is hysterical people using violence and threats to stop women from getting an abortion arent even disowned by their religious people to their left and right and all these people playing like their religion is the reason they are against it is laughable since its not in the bible and jesus never talked about it at the same time these people talking about how when they go to heaven  they acknowledge the soul and yet know nothing about it or when it enters a human body they dont care that the us actually killed over half a million kids in afghanistan they dont care about the very real starving and homeless children all over the us they dont care about the countless babies killed by hospitals due to accidents and errors and do nothing to create safe spaces with contraception for the youth so they may explore their sexuality without worry of being pregnant and yet they think that continuing to harass and berate other people about their choice is the way to go those people disgust me and are the worst form of blind ego driven soul denying godly created idiots that we have to endure and when they die they will have a really big revelation
love how these cowards refuse to give their names spread their shame
i escorted a friend who got raped into a planned parenthood got a rock to the spine cops watching the pro lifers did nothing next time im going violent in return
the fact that the government knows about this and does nothing tells you all you need to know
"if only selfcontrol were taught thoroughly at the home
then again pp would go the way of the dodo"
if you understand the science you will have to accept that life begins at conception killing babies is always wrong do you really know what happens to a baby in her mothers womb during an abortion try speaking to adults who are grateful that they were adopted and had the opportunity to live their lives remember babys right to continue to live this woman is another crazed attention seeker
yeah but its us atheists that are always so angry
i swear to god i will be her california corespondent
you do know 71 of americans disagree with abortion right gtfoh libs
let the unborn child have a chance to live
it makes me sick to look at someone who rips fully formed babies out of mothers bodies heroicize himself
so much for prolifeso instead they kill doctors and advocates how does that make sense
antiabortion is specifically not prolife  these kinds of protesters prove that fact every single day  standing around unwanted and unwelcomed day after day with annoying signs and shouting their thoughtless scripted shaming platitudes at people they never met and will never know experiencing circumstances they will never care enough to try to understand
people like dan is why abortions are needed his mother shouldve exercised her right back then
these religious nutjobs are out early to harass people into submitting to their beliefs they dont even know whats the reasons for a woman to visit an abortion clinic she could be aborting to save her life from an ectopic pregnancy but they dont care about that
may they all rot in hell but ones killing babies
isnt life precious no matter what age
dont feel sorry for the doctor and nurses been killed that killing thousands of babies every year
"daaang i need new glasses
that thumbnail i thought it was a picture of her  and a man with an axe behind her o"
im still reeling from the striking down of roe v wade i still cant believe it
im not in favor of abortion but the part that people mostly look over is the fact that now religion is strongly influencing government and not just in laws but also in the supreme court theyre supposed to be a separation of church and state once you change that you change the government because whose religion will be over all others religious beliefs and when will it soon be that all other religious beliefs that dont make it to the top will soon be banned because the top religion doesnt believe in what the other religions are saying anyway this is where the line is now becoming blurry its been crossed
yeeeeeeesbroadcasting people protesting the murder of unborn babies on tiktok will really tell them whats what 
to the protester how about going and saving all those pregnant ladies who have to live where the war rages they would love to give a safe birth and raise their child but they dont know if they are going to live tomorrow
abort the protesters
these protesters with all this time on their hands need to volunteer at a food kitchen or homeless shelter  i would say they should foster kidsbut they arent compassionate enough to raise children
if only they would be this vocal for the living
"i would be a lot more sympathetic to the prolifers if they were willing to ensure that every child has the basic needs to function in our society met for them so that they have a chance to meet their potentials unfortunately it seems that prolifers stop being prolife as soon as the kid is born


fyi society was in quotes because of an inside joke and we are all in it"
hypocrites dont care about he kids after theyre born
these women rip these babies apart with their body parts twitching on the table and gasping for air at 8 weeks
freedom of religion should include freedom from religion
im sorrybut when you start your entire point of your conversation off with claiming to fight for reproductive rights when fighting for abortion that is factually the right to not reproduce or nonreproductive rights not only do you try to use psychological manipulation and psychological warfare to give color of law rights to something that you know has no merit in the very fact that you call it something opposite of what it is to claim the rights of the opposite of what it is but you steal the rights of those whose rights you are trying to invoke as your own when they arent such as the women in china who were forced to have abortions when they wanted reproductive rights and to not have abortions when you have to make yourself sound like a victim of something you arent like a woman who may be sterile from a forced procedure or a woman who may have been otherwise injured from a lack of consent you not only make yourself look like you have no ethics but you actually dont have any moral precedents when youre the cause of injury to others from your reckless actions to which many of those women had forced abortions past any point under roe v wade that would constitute murder under american law and being reckless enough to cause reckless homicide is a not just a civil wrong but a criminal offense so justifying you are in the right when proven criminally wrong in both directionsyou would think you would learn something by now and get a clue theres no accidental after that point no unknowing just plain intentional murder
the irony  they assassinate people working at these clinics while calling themselves prolife
"our focus is the women n children  their rght to choose life excuse me but its their rght to choose whatever is best for them because nobody knows the health or history of that particular women 
mind yall damnnn business "
"216 so these unborn children what the fetus is being terminated but in schools children are having their lives taken away from them by the inept gun laws and your inane belief in _ma rights_ to own and carry guns everywhere hey dan go protest outside a gun store because they are responsible for childrens lives being stolen from themnah you wont do that will you pious hypocrite

the clinic escorts are doing a great service and should be recognised for their stupendous work shelly and ladies you are champions every single one of you "
i dont believe in abortion but i also dont think i have the right to tell a woman what to do with her body but those damn republicans do 
i praise this woman 
do you idiots know what actually happens when you kill an unborn baby
they shouldnt make it such an black and white issuetoo many humans are made every daythere is enough of youits nuancedsome people should have the right to end their pregnancy
so why are these people not outside gun shops shouting please dont buy guns that will kill people 
the giant picture dan has of a fetus is not an accurate depiction of an embryo  before 10 weeks
"i love this woman the propaganda surrounding this issue is unbelievable i am so terrified for the lives of women seeking care in the future and the lives of these unwanted children 
i bet all these protestors go home and eat murdered animals even though their lives were taken against their will and with zero regard to their sentience 
interesting that the same people that are forcing women to give life are also forcefully taking it with for nothing more than a sandwich that takes less than 10 minutes to eat"
so shes an escort prolly no one buys her
love this woman
dont want a baby dont have sex or move to a state that allows this irresponsibility
"thank you and all those who do what you do please know that it is not a thankless job 
we all support you and send you love and strength "
notice how theyre all old people who have absolutely nothing better to do with their lives 
i think its time that these abortion clinics start hiring security keep sending financial support to your local clinic to make this happen
hmmm yet there are 700k children in foster care most likely to age out these pro fetus zealots need to stfu
no dan youve been harassing women youre a bad person
i love shelly thank you
god bless the escorts nurses and doctors willing to help women
bitch dont pray for me
saw this 6months ago how did it come out 6 days ago
how can you be assaulted by mutual consent      suggest equpping escorts with tazers  may be fun to print up some contracts for the protesters to sign  they agree to pay x per month into a fund for the support of mommies like those save the children programs where they send you photos and progress reports on third world kids  hand out the break down of  expenses rent utilities food clothing medical care lost wages etc  times that total by 18     lets see how many protesters agree to make that commitment
we are sliding back so far into the dark ages thanks to these horrible judges and politicians that soon enough we wont even recognize this as america anymore
can anyone explain why the majority of abortion protesters seem to be old white men a little creepy
hero she is a hero
can i get a gate and a tall thick fence
most of those men protesting look like they shouldnt be left alone with children they look creep af
men need to stay awayuntil they give birthit is not their business
ah women murdering babies in the womb what a story
and where are you when they need real help
their right to choose life thats an odd way off putting prolife
"yeah id be telling them uh if you were really serious about helping youd be out in the world helping women who were pressured into having babies and then got stuck without the means necessary for bringing up those children you really want to make a difference were going to hook you up to volunteer your time actually helping those that need help here on the physical plane     
 oh you dont want to really hmmm  interesting"
some of us dont believe in your god you ignorant christofascist lunatic assholes
we keep them in our prayers you cannot pray for someone wellbeing and harass them at the same time
cnn reporting all the racism and man hating it can find oh btw cancel kulture doesnt exist
violence attracts violence abortion is an act of violenceis it not
elohim adonai hashem is my father and rabbi
maam as a nebraskan thank you for your work everyone should have the right to choose
may all the happiness in the universe fall on these types of people id be catching a charge everyday punching those selfrighteous bigoted pieces of garbage in their faces
when i meet my maker hes going to be in for a rude awakening
bless you shellyi am proud choice a womans womb is between god her doctor and family i had an abortion in my early 20s i had my son zechariah wolf orion at 37 i worked very hard in film editing his father died of als christmas eve 2005 at hospice where terry shiavo was finally unplugged brain dead
whats wrong with what they are saying we dont have the right to reason with people
knock that scumbag off that stupid ladder for a start
"anti abortion protestors need to keep a couple of things in mind

life is hard
life can be cruel
what happens to most unwanted babies if they grow up unloved
what do angry isolated antisocial people tend to do
and what people are willing to do if the population outgrows their resources

just some doubts"
11 people killed by pro life demonstrators
i dont want to just be a meme youre not shelly i promise youre a f hero
religion is and always will be poison
shes a hero
maybe dan should read more of the bible to discover that his maker has no qualms with abortion whatsoever and even allows for it to be carried out also said maker despises people like him who protest in such methods while talking about god as jesus reiterated regarding the log in ones own eye when people complain about the splinters in the eyes of others
can you imagine the health and beauti can make more youthful skin makeup all over your face 
its so easy to advocate for the unborn isnt it   they dont wake you up in the night   they dont cost you any money  you dont have to feed and clothe them  you can raise up your arms and proclaim your moral superiority   and the minute the child is born  it is no longer unborn and you can just discard it and the mother as sinners deserving of gods scorn because they dont share the same beliefs   antiabortion activists are the height of cowardly hypocrisy
he carries a lot of guilt that he feels he has to heap on the women he verbally abuses
what a hero she is and the dude who had a lot of guilt and more time to yell at women seeking abortion after retiring needs to forget about meeting his maker hes going to hell
what about the lives of the women who are denied the right to make their own choices  what about their lives  what about those who die because they were denied a necessary medical procedure
i wish we could redirect the passion these protesters have to foster care if you truly want to protect children thats the way to go this is not protecting children this is hurting desperate women an ounce of self awareness would allow them to ask themselves why would i pursue an abortion edited to add why isnt this protected by hipaa
are these people going to fund the children for a minimum of 18 years or adopt if not then you have no business telling a woman what to do with her pregnancy
im glad there are people like shelly and the number of volunteers at clinics keeps growing  you have my support and respect 
as a man im going to see if its possible to get a prescription for the plan b pill so i can pass them on for free
i get so pissed when clinics that provide womens services are called abortion clinics  i am sure that other services are provided
people should not be allowed to protest out side of clinic  and guys outside just pisses me off most women dont do this lightly
i love toothless 60yearolds calling young women mom
imagine being so prolife you literally murder people
shelly mann you are a godsend 
pro life people committing murder religion is the worst virus on this planet
thats just ironic on how pro lifers go to an abortion clinic and kill people
are these people going to help you take care of your child no they will not they need to keep their opinions to themselves they dont know why that person is having an abortion it could be from rape or the woman has a health issue either way people should keep their mouths shut
why dont you have patients get there really early in the morning
ben franklin designed some of americas earliest coins called continental currency that was minted in the massachusetts colony on them was the phrase nind your business ben franklin was one of americas true patriots he helped washington form the militia and not once was this true patriot ever armed
"is usa partially a taliban nation

cheers from switzerland "
there are so many cases of women that will die if they dont get an abortion or who wanted a baby and had a miscarriage and cant expel on their own and need to go to an abortion clinic bc they cant get it done at a hospital
why dont they build a drive up awning to keep the harassers out of sight they should start a gofundme
i dont understand why these antiabortion protestors arent in front of nra headquarters
most of the protesters are oldwhite men very telling they just want to control women they dont care about babies
ah religion is so lovely
pro life  smh they are not pro life they are pro theocratic fascist
yes ive seen her celebrated online before  wonderful woman
if this is a womans issue why do almost 50 not have an issue with it
"i remember when i escorted a friend to have an abortion and got a brick upside my head and the cops tried to charge me for trespassing lol
acab every time"
heres a way those protestors that have all that time on their hands can help go adopt a child and raise them in a home instead of the states foster system
shame on her  the god of abrahamisaac and jacobour great creatorawaits this womans death bedas she will stand before yeshua for sentencing for her crimes against humanity and yahwehs littlest ones  one can already hear the wailing and knashing of teethof those crying out in unison from the hub of hellin punishment for all eternities
interesting that the rainbow makes its appearance in umbrellas jackets ect
in my city there is always a line of people yell at the patients just like this the really sick part of this is that no more than six walking distance blocks from this clinic is a place called home of the innocence this place takes care of the children that people didnt want couldnt afford and or horribly abused it is a hold over spot until foster homes can be found for them unfortunately most of the kids have returned again and again many rarely find a foster parent because of behavior problems or handicap it angers me that the protesters are wasting time doing something useless instead of at least being an advocate for these kids that are already breathing
way to go joe abortion is wrong  you baby killers deserve the death penalty
choosing to end a life because theyre to be a burden why not just make responsible life choices so as to not have to make that choice 
absolutely creepy these old men
"everyone should meet a joelbless his heartdr recommend terminating 
catholic christian church thought otherwise
he as lived in a crib 33 years and countingmumbles wears  diapershe has never walked a step in his whole life
and no support from the church or state or the repukestotal misery thanks supreme court now ya all get ready for your slavery
at least the mother had a choice she choose life thank you jesus
my wife had two miss carriagesthen medical doctor recommended for her age not to try 
boom tubes tied it wasnt meant to be i can imagine now how big brother is now going to get in peoples lives  all because they never walked in other peoples shoes so send joel some money help him
but all you hear is the cricket chirp"
people should fix themselves before they do stuff  these people are lunatics  vanity is the real problem
like they said these lunatics sometimes shoot up clinics to kill people yet they claim they are for life such hypocrisy they stand there all day on their high moral horse yelling at people maybe if you want to actually save lives you can help the homeless or if you love kids so much like you claim become a foster parent or adopt but why do any of that when you can stand all day yelling at people going through an already difficult situation  these insane weirdos are trying to take over this country just remember that when it comes time to vote we can not be ruled by these religious creeps
mostly guys idiotic ones
people need to get a life and stop bothering in other peoples business
this woman is awesome  much respect to her dealings with and exposing these religious weirdos please be safe
these are the same people that complain about to have to pay taxes to take care of foster children feeding and clothing them but yet they dont tell men to go get a vasectomy
my sil had to terminate her pregnancy because they found out the baby had no heartbeat so in that case what is she supposed to do of course she and her husband was devastated but it was necessary btwthey named her moana and she wouldve been my bils first daughter  kudos shelley
how is it not illegal to harass patients outside of a medical facility sure you have the right to protest  if you obtain the proper permits if someone started screaming and yelling outside a local hospital the cops would apprehend them in minutes
jehovah god has given us free will we all choose to obey jehovahs rules on the sanctity of life or we choose to live by our own standards we all answer for our life decisions
maybe this moron should devote as much time to the needy children of america another republican who is opposed to abortion who wont tell government to support young families or give proper paid leave to mothers and parents only big business have lobbies to get them tax dollars
oh man i would start asking for cash asap 
how can you be pro life and kill those who are pro choice seems contradicting to me smh 
the constitution doesnt give us rights it only prohibits the government from violating them these rights are natural rights that you have from being a human no one can legally take them away since they arent given by law they are not a legal right but certain unalienable rights given by their creator
these hypocrites are so disgusting once born they couldnt care less if the baby starves to death or gets sexually molested its all about feeling self righteous its all about pure selfishness
when the men show up thats it  having some man tell me what to do with my body ie the supreme court is just looking for a fight and i mean a fight
god doesnt force us what business do you have then to try and force your opinion yes opinion
all these pro lifers are only interested in their feelings of ego driven righteousness until the babies are bornthen they can justify ignoring their existence because its the mothers problem then and they have zero responsibility after that point so much for their caring of life it stops once breath is drawn  men should have no voice in this no uterus no say
wow this is just insane
old men doing the screaming  i would bet just one labour pain would bring them to their knees but they want a raped pregnant 12 year old or younger to endure a pregnancy and  full labour terrified and screaming in pain  they could do their bit by promoting vasectomies or better yet castration of known rapists and pedophiles now that would be worth protesting and screaming about  abortion has been around since men figured out what was between their legs and women as always have to take care of the end results wanted or unwanted banning it will change nothing as history has shown just more women will die from unsafe methods to have control over their bodies
although i dont agree  i can see how females believe in  pro life  but the men who get involved is very creepy and disturbing 
how do they not see that deadly violence at abortion clinics doesnt make you pro life how can you be so blind
is that enough of feeling really self righteous this morning perfect
dan can go protest outside congress and let them change gun laws that kills 5 and 6 year olds at school
shelley you are a hero please take care of yourself 
religion preys on children not for them
those protesters are gonna burn in hell
good on her fuck those assholes
thou shall not judge you are only accountable for yourself
"this woman should have thought about what was going to happen with a trump presidency democrats deserve whats happening in this country by not supporting fully hillary clinton 
i hope you democrats feel the burn"
no uterus  no opinion on abortion period i had an abortion after a failed tubal ligation every womans story is different
sorry you didnt do enough here you should have dox every protester you had on camera
what about all the lives that already exist
why does the rainbow crowd think they have a dog in this fight
if these antiabortion protestors are so altruistic and thoughtful i wonder how many of them have actually adopted children
planned parenthood does so much more than just abortions
those ppl just wanna get creepy with those kids having frauditors  ppl like that getting the business to close whether its here or at the dmv or even the postoffice getting them to close is a win to them
there isnt a right to choose life if their is no choice
"my body my choice
so what about prostitution 
why is it illegal there is boundaries with your bodies you cant go around killing babies through out your life"
"those evilgelicals aint prolife 
     theyre proafterlife"
"my comment is to all who are unhappy with this decision
for over 49 yrs roe vs wade mocked god our creator as creator of all lifefinally 
some people came to their senses
thank you donald trump for appointing smart judges
the body of a woman and the unborn etc belongs to god not people just as premarital sex is a sin therefore abortion is usually a result because of premarital sex is most definitely a sin 
gay transgender lifestyles are also a sin against god those that practice such and not repent will not inherit eternal life insteadgod tells us in his word that those that practice such and not repent will be separated for all eternity the warning is real and not some game as many play with gods word as a game and are faithless"
the right to choose what  life wtf kinda life is this our actual real live already growing children aint even got the option to feel safe from guns when theyre at school in our country  they wanna add more mental health problems  deformities to the mix no thanx go home
"the bible mentions abortion once in the bible along with instructions on a drink that should be used cause one if a man thinks it might not be his
facts"
"the american taliban the people who want to tell you what you can learn in school who you can love and what control women have over their own bodies  there is unquestionably a large segment of the american population who want their nation to be governed based on their extremist and warped views of the bible just like in iran just like in afghanistan just like in any other backwards theocracy that exists in the world today

they arent loving  they arent caring  they arent interested in your wellbeing  they are monsters and they want to control you"
love this clinic escort shelly   be safe  keep up the good work
love the hypocrisy behind all that choose life talk when they want ro take away the choice
freaks lazy activism they choose the easiest lowest intellect fight on the planet where there is no voice in the matter from the unwanted child this cause and these people are cowardly they can choose a million other causes to truly save alreadyborn kids and they choose this lazy lazy lazy and fearful too chicken to show up to a true fight in their last days this realization will come back to them they are doing christianity all wrong
take away choice from everyone including people who dont want to give life to children by donating their blood or organs or marrow choice kills
shes great so many women and men like her have put their own lives in danger since the 80s to keep women safe from harassment by the antiabortion zealots in front of clinics the antiabortion movement terrorized women providers and clinic staff i remember the clinic bombings in the 80s and 90s and the hit lists of doctors wtargets over their photos and all private info published or doxxed in todays terms the assassinations of doctors nurses people who ran clinics the antiabortion movement was terrorized women they dont give a shit about life or anything but the fetus george carlin was 100 right in his bit about righttolifers the lives of women and children  once out of the woman  their lives are nothing these zealots
i wish someone had aborted them 
i wonder how many of these protesters have adopted children that were given up for adoption by mothers who can not take care of their babies
do they realize women go to these clinics who have already lost their baby  and what their yelling does to moms whove already lost their baby
"if you masturbate your preventing life  the tricky part about abortion is the line of when it is a baby  
i find it ironic that pro lifers will hump to no end and contribute to over populating the world but complain about abortion 

its terrible when someone is raped and there is a baby on the way abortion for those should be legal 
if you happen to be one of those who has say more than 3 to 4 kids you are killing lives just as much as those who have abortions the difference is your doing it slower you are contributing to over population starvation crime and disease 

those who have abortions just because they dont want to have a baby are just as responsible for deaths many people would love to adopt your baby 

rape young minors and risk of death to the mother all should qualify for abortions no exceptions"
love her why are there men trying to tell women about pregnancy theyve never even had a period
where are all these prolifers when the foster kids are abused where is their money to help these children who are unable to eat a decent meal where is all of their protests to help the kids that are living on the streets oh they dont care about them babies after they have been pushed out especially to those kids who may not look like them which one of them is helping who set up their homes to accomodate someone in foster care neither one of those fake christians i bet
also you idiots out there protesting if god wants a child to be born its going to be born i dont care whether she goes to a abortion clinic or not god has things planned out when youre circumventing or trying to circumvent what god does youre just as f up as they are you just you dont get it youre out there for religious purposes obviously well i grew up pentecostal i know that my god my savior christ everythings planned out already so you being there is not going to do a damn thing other than bring a child into the world thats not going to have a decent life so you should be taking care of that child
if youre out there protesting you should be willing to pay for the child because do you really want that person that wanted to abort that child to have that child if you do youre f up in the brain yes i said f up in the brain because no that kid is either going to be abused or beaten its not going to turn out good in any way shape or form i believe that the us supreme court should pay for the children in other words the congress should make each individual judge pay for each child out there that cannot be aborted by the mother before its born and anyone protesting they should have to pay for the ones theyre protesting against if a woman is walking into that abortion or clinic that provides abortions those outside should be held responsible for that child 100
imposing your beliefs often based on your personal religion onto another person land of the free my as
i spend my life harassing strangers seeking medical care because of my love for the unborn and fear of the sky wizard because they say whatever i want to believe they say and they will never contradict me like these evil women docause life though
where are the protesters outside gun sale shops
"410 and those people have the audacity to call themselves pro life

pro life my ass"
those men have such compassion towards unborn children i bet his children dont even love them
birth control and reproductive education is free for both men and women at taxpayer funded facilities such as unplanned parenthood yet apparently two people cannot figure out how to use it and decide to have unprotected sex anyway
"only third trimester service provider in the usa 
oh boy not good 

no reproductive health care privacy and providers will cause more problems while not solving any"
dont have this sort of shitfuqery in australia and nor do want any of it
"their right to choose life 

you have the right to choose what i want you to choose is basically what she meant"
this makes me want to work at a abortion clinic lol i would love that job i would make fun of those fucking protesters all day it would be amazing 
_movement_ is the right word specifically bowel movement
keep up the good work god bless the anti abortion people out there protesting
shelley you are the very dearie thank you so much for your work
"all actions have consequences to be clear people have the right to choose however if you choose to kill you will suffer the consequences of that action the question people need to consider is one moment of convenience worth that consequence furthermore if you act on your right to choose to do something others should have the right to act on their choice to prevent you from doing it or act on their right to choose to punish you for doing it 

this is why we have laws and why those laws should reflect the highest moral standards of the society they serve a law that simply protects a right to choose is not moral as morality is something that can be chosen we can choose to follow the laws we can choose to be moral these choices can be arbitrary but like all choices acting on them have consequences an arbitrary law will not be just and by default becomes immoral law and morality need to be absolute to promote order and deliver justice without absolute laws and morality we will have chaos and injustice

abortion is not moral because it is both an action and a choice to commit that action abortion is in fact immoral because morality will determine that an unborn baby has the right to live just as you or i have the right to live therefore if a law protects that choice then the law becomes unjust and ultimately immoral

this is a bit of logic wordplay and i hope it promotes some critical thought feel free to choose to listen to it or not but your choice will not change morality no matter how much you seek to justify your actions"
notice the vocal ones are old white men
"cnn why dont you link to the tiktok 
give the creator her credit
i bet she would like the bump in views"
wow a patient escort willing to put herself in harms way to protect women in crisis from cruel terrible vicious ignorant bullies props to her really  respect
notice how she said her right to choose life
as a rape baby myself i fully support a womans right to choose my mother was raped when she was 14 i was born when she turned 15 this was in the south in 1972 so she was basically blamed for the rape she she couldnt go to school she was harassed disowned by half the family because they were all southern baptists had she had and abortion i wouldnt have given a shit because i was just a zygote at the time and it wouldnt matter her life would have turned out better with the abortion anti abortionists think that everyone should have to born into this madness we call the human race they all seem to be ok with lies and murder and hate and war and on and on you really want to bring children into this rat race anti abortionists are sadistic fuckers to say the least knowing then what i know now i would never have brought children into this world
i bet not a one of them votes for policies that take care of the kids or their mothers liars all liars
i wish these prolifers but they really arent would just get out of other peoples lives the patient didnt just fall off the back of a truck in front of an abortion clinic and say well while im here i think ill have an abortion ignorant selfrighteous morons is what these people are did the female protester act like she was a little too medicated theres relaxed and then theres medically induced coma
hmmmm what about black and babies  oh  yeah those babies dont matter  its beyond insane white men pontificating on on womens healhcare which they know nothing they know about
anti abortion protesters once this child is born i need your financial and emotional assistance for the rest of your life is that being offered to these mothers and unborn children
these procedures should be done in hospitals like in most places in the world where the annonymouty of everyone involved is guaranteed its almost as if theyve created these clinics so that people can be targeted
these people are literally disgusting not only is what people do with their bodies none of their business they do not even try to understand the other side of the story instead they just cover their ears scream abortion bad try to make it look like they care by saying something vague about the bible and make it everybodys problem im not saying the first amendment should be rolled back but there is no excuse for there being this many people with views that are just factually inaccurate america needs to try harder to educate its people on human biology religion and most importantly the basic rights guaranteed by the constitution no more denying science no more backing up nonexistent claims with faith no more picking and choosing when someone does or does not have rights you cannot protest reality
this ladys screen name is the deathscorts thats disgusting
"i love how these so called pro life people like to talk about choice too like you can choose life not murder yet they are really just pro birth and dont care about the kid after the fact they just want the woman to have the baby period with no other choice we just want the body autonomy to be able to do whatever we want with our body no one is saying to do one or the other we just want the choice to be able to do whats right for us

those creepy people really referring to people they dont know by mom and saying those things like thats just really creepy and seems like they have mental problems"
everyone born of god overcomes the world this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith
religion is a cancer on society
i want to know how many of these protesters are also involved in our foster care system how many have adopted children how many would be willing to give money or even do volunteer babysitting for these women if not then they can stfu and let these women make their own decisions if she doesnt cant be a mom weather medical or by choice she shouldnt be made to thats why you have people who shouldnt have children have children then when children have horrible upbringings no one wants to help the mother with her blessings
the lady coming up to them is actually the one who feels self righteous she is a hypocrite just calling like i see it
i have no answer for these ignorant bastards
abortion is murder 1a
i volunteered at a clinic while pregnant with my daughter and an antiabortion protested threatened to follow me home and stab me to death i was visibly pregnant the catholic priest beside him did not intervene
"yes women are dying 
are they not people 
think"
"people get killed by those who unjustly accuse others 
not knowing what äonen go through"
if this clinic was in a ghetto would those people be protesting there
i want to know what antiabortion protestors thoughts are on rape and incestuos abuse oh and also fetuss that are already dead in the womb or mom who will die if they carry to term
you have no idea what women go through
from one shelley to another thank you
prolife but they are ok with weapons that slaughter our children it makes purrrrfect sense
the woman yelling that we are here to help notice she doesnt offer to adopt the baby
these women are real american heros saving real americans everyday
why is it youll never see these protesters outside a urologists office that performs vasectomies
"so simple the protestors are fearing god because of their own sins and now they want to get points on other sinners expense

the horror of religion"
these people need to mind their own business and stop brining god into their nonsense god gave mankind the right to choose these nuts are trying to take that away that behavior is not of god they need to look at their own sinful and flawed lives
they want help and they are going to place to seek it you dont need to yell at them and call them mom  which is not their name and yell we can help you    everyone mind your own business my brother died at age 21 of heart difficulties that were totally preventable but he couldnt afford the operation and wasnt eligible for medicare       tell me how you can help me   tell me how you can help me
it is not anyones responsibility to interfere themselves into others lives i always flip these people off at the clinic in my town  yell fuck off out the window theyre unsufferable
"the sanctimonious man at the beginning is most probably the type who would pay the monks to bury him in the monastery or the church floorboard to improve his chance of absolution  

there are homeless and sick to car for yelling his bias to intimidate pregnant women isnt going to tip the goodness scale its juvenile and desperate to consider that would work"
so much for prolife eh these religious nut jobs are violent and hateful mybodymychoice
"their right to choose life  the key words there are right and choose
they fundamentally do not believe in womens rights specifically they do not believe in their rights to choose to continue or to terminate the pregnancy 
this is not a war on abortion  its a war on women"
50 usd youre shtting me
the reason you cant claim an unborn child is because the government says its not a person read that again
i was told only rioters had no jobs and should get a life what about these people
the creepy old man calling a young lady mom 
i had an abortion at 19 i was 4 weeks and 2 days pregnant i took that walk i was screamed at and called horrible names i love that this is in place for girls and women who are making sometimes the hardest decision of their life this is what i consider gods work 
they should be wanting forced vasectomies for menoh wait you say they wouldnt want that
i just happened to walk by a womens center that i didnt even realize was there and all of a sudden like 5 people were all talking to me at once and it took a minute to figure out wtf was happening they were all like do you need help you dont have to do this whats your name  and i was just walking down the street i understand offering help and even trying to share your perspective but at a certain point it can feel like bullying ive gone to get free birth control regular std testing and even a pregnancy test and ultrasound at a womens center and its always assumed that youre there for an abortion and its just a baby killing factory 
well that makes perfect sense claim prolife but murder someone ffs
what a shame all of these peoples parents didnt believe in abortion we would not be having this discussion there is still time if you are so set on abortion go  for it   your not to old you can do it   no age  abortion 
these maniacs will soon be  running our country and the democrats are asleep at the wheel 
did you see the fbi finally found ashley biden diary she was being molested by joe biden was taking shower with her  look it up
it was never a constitutional right to kill  a child back in the day woman and children were sacred now shoot them every day  sick society for brains 
are those individuals that are protesting going to adopt the babies and supply money to those individuals that will need help
look up planned parenthood selling baby body parts hidden camera video youtube  thats why they want you to wait till 15 weeks when the child can live outside of the mother  or at birth   use a condom wtf sick mf s
only in america
where do you get a protest sign says im a baby killer  i guess she is for school shootings to  abortion at birth  ugly baby  make me sick not human 
if a women has problems during pregnancy does the doctor give her a bible or medical attention in the anti abortion slave states
"just dont have sex how hard is that
oh rape or incest abortion is legal for that in every state"
god bless these people taking time out of their lives to try to save a child and stop the psychological injury to the mother the hateful prodeath side will only understand once its too late for them
anyone notice how it mostly men protesting all of them especially the men need to mind their own business
at 047 the women said right to choose does she even hear herself
yet its the liberals that are attacking the pregnancy pro life centers after roe v wade was overturned
shes a wacko
someone needs to stand out there with listing the names of real babies who died at their mothers or loved ones hands antiabortion dont want to admit what happens to unwanted babies when our legal system is full of examples of them
hypocrite and fake
the compassion that the escorts show to the clients has me in tears right now its the same compassion that jesus would show them the entitlement and self righteousness of the protesters makes me feel ill
what a magnificent woman you are shelley
they not protesting in front of police stations to stop killing people
they dont care about people after theyre born
"somehow i cant imagine jesus standing outside the clinic shouting at people
as for the people shouting about abortions  why arent they expending that energy on protecting kids who are alive already  being abused"
we will help you just dont ask for any assistance guidance after your first breath you are on your own we have prison space for you or send you to war when you turn 18
as a canadian i cant understand that  all that because people beliieve in an imaginary friend in the sky
those people dont care about life do they visit the nearby orphanages or group homes for families without food or money no theyre too busy trying to take another persons rights away 
 i hope these people have mercy when some of the children their trying to save get abused the rest of their lives  yes some people dont deserve children i think suicide and child abuse statistics are going to go up if abortion is banned everywhere 
asolutely right to choose life  how aout their right to choose a aortio
those protesters are demented religious freaks
"this lady is employing a tactic that i think works these creeps hope you wont engage them one on one 
zebras use their stripes to confuse a predator these morons that love to protest as part of a crowd can be taken down by a smart predator that focuses on one target at a time "
good for her put these people on blast theyre human garbage for trying to deny women their bodily autonomy
abortion is bad why are people supporting baby killingsounds wrong
what a sick individual shelly is this is insane
041 keyword in that sentence being choose
do they ever protest in front of churches about the number of spontaneous abortions that are part of gods big scheme 
guess how many kids this activist never had
theyll regulate a uterus to stop babies from dying but wont regulate guns and they will happily send these children to their death in an overseas war for nonsense
i dare her to have a debate with lila rose or ben shapiro i bet she would lose that debate quickly
a little disingenuous about the assault part if you watch the actual full length video theyre both pushing and shoving each other he is charged because he escalates it hence why the charge was by mutual consent meaning he was able to prove both sides were combative he essentially the got the equivalent of a bad traffic ticket its a violation level offense
these crazy people are lonely and have no life or purpose of their own  so they find purpose encroaching on other peoples lives and decisions
they are terrorists thats not simple protest   spend your time volunteering in a daycare or something that is actually helpful
if they care for children why not become froster care parents do something nice not hatful and ugly
its always people no one would have sex with who advocate for abortion
i saw that before here in boston they were standing outside with signs saying that they would give money to women if they went through their pregnancy and gave their babies to them very awkward
the vast majority of women going there are like i just came here for a pap smear dumbass
take the l libs looool
prove any god exists or stfu
antiabortion people killing in the name of life what a contradiction
if you want to help children you volunteer at a family shelter if you want to harass women you stand outside a clinic and yell at them we know exactly what these creeps really care about
yall really acting like this is worse than the prochoicers rioting
"i love that woman  shelley
i really appreciate the gutless selfish crap she has to put up and i really would like to join her
i wish this to be a huge written hug and thank you for what she does
im proud of her
im sorry thats even a job
im disgusted with the selfish protesters who make it one 
and to the women who even have to make to make that choice in really sorry you have to endure those worthless selfish idiots on the street who obviously dont care about people and who really should get a new hobby
thank you shelley"
the sc overturning of roe v wade is a most cruel decision against women in america after trumps election this is the second dark day in current american history america is finally becoming a roman catholic jihadist state women are now controlled in their choices the roman catholic jihadist sc will next go after the lgbtqia community
these people are evil these people are scum abortion is a big decision and people making that decision dont need the experience to be any more traumatic than it already is it sickens me it makes me so sad and angry
the look on their face when i speed into the parking lot gets me everytime
it was awful to walk through the doors of  the clinic writhing in pain from an ectopic pregnancy the hospital would not preform my abortion and listen to those people yell at me about the embryo that was rupturing my insides while having no idea i had a breastfeeding 6mo at home these people have no idea what damage they are doing to the mental health of women that they do not know
people have a right to protest
all this just to keep kill these unborn babies
the 11 people killed can not be condoned heres a question how many women have died because of abortions and how many babies have been killed because of abortions
well if god sends you the gift of a child through a rapist or incest who are you to question it these religious types are truly mindless cult zombies gods quite the ahole
that doctors nerves are shot hope he can keep a steady hand while performing abortions
"and yet their f bible says its ok for abortion living being becomes at first breath god ok with taking fetuses etc
like their literally quotations

this is called religious zealotry where they think they know everything about bible and saying they obey it and still doing the opposite what the bible says or radicalsl talibanism"
i always keep them in my prayers while yelling and telling them theyre going to hell 
this first aired over the winter didnt it i seem to recall seeing this before and it got harder to watch
adopt and foster unwanted kids finance them send them to college
"protestors would bomb an abortion center and kill doctors bc they care about life makes perfect sense 
and they claim to be religiously prolife just not your life if you decide to have an abortion or support it hypocrites are the worst"
god bless these probaby advocates trying to save babies this woman is evil ignorant and despicable
the us are fucked up 
just the sight of those elderly white men and their dehydrated faces urging this thing on young women is enraging i wonder what those twerps have in their past as adolescent guys feeling their oats and if theyre so worried i wonder why they dont go to work on the young men of this country where they might have something useful to say  but to women theyve got nothing useful to say
nothing like prolifers taking a life for their cause
shes the grim reaper
i swear ive seen this story b4 similar footage must be a rebroadcast plz do new reporting on the ground pls cnn
its very sad what the supreme court has done we must vote i know it sounds like a broken record but its the only thing we can do we can protest we can write letters post on social media even get mad fight ect none of it will do any good remember in november
"the conversation about abortion has became so basic that it frustrates mepro life vs pro choosethe main conversation is how to deal with a consequence instead of discussing the cause or like debating what type of cast is best for a patient without knowing which bone in your body is broken or if there is actually an injury at all
how about we talk more about prevention about the equal responsibility that both members of a relationship have in terms of contraception because even in 2022 there are many men who still believe that the woman is the sole responsible for preventing a pregnancy and there is still many women who agree with that or simply comply 
we need to talk about how can we really help and support pregnant women who are going through financial difficulties family problems expectant mothers who dont have a proper support system and need a hand and better opportunities for her and her baby
we need to talk more about how an abortion is not a solution or a contraceptive we need to talk about the physical emotional and mental scars that an abortion leaves the chances of infertility the chances of having a miscarriage later on when you decide to have a kid the guilt that sometimes last a lifetime the pain you feel when you see your kids and realize that there was actually a person inside of you and how horrible you could feel for denying your baby the possibility to live 
the regret that could overwhelm you
we need to talk more about how to give a better care for the children who enter into the foster system
but beside talking we need action abortion is being sold as the perfect solution for an unexpected pregnancy but is simply a distraction that is preventing us the possibility to really look for the root of the issues that many pregnant women are facing today"
to be a christian is to wake up grumpy
its like all the crackheads who want to talk to you at the bus stop gathered in one place
shes way too kind with these waste of oxygen and their demented ideas
i wish some of these protesters offering to help these women were throwing themselves into helping mothers and babies after birth
pro life is an oxymoron nowadays
the us looked at taliban and decided that religion influencing lawmaking was awesome
"your book of ancient myths is proabortion fundies
numbers 51131 look it up"
the mother is the only one that can make the decision
how psihopats you need to be to be a lookout for a murdering entity and you do it with a straite face
i could tell that god give people free will with a reason and dont discriminate as long the person didnt commit sin i dont take anyone side but i will respect someone willing of having a child unless it a victim i dont get why people protesting to congress instead of blaming someone in the mississippi who started this situation to begin with
shelley mann in the clips is so condescending and passive aggressive she really seems like women which is annoying to be around she should seems like a jerk and dan the protester seems just like a good person with regrets and trying to do whats right in contrast to her and in general the protesters seem like nice people that she is trying to provoke to do things that look bad on tiktok for her own self image
and some americans often wonder why they arent able to keep up with the science and technology of the rest of the world
i am so so grateful that abortion laws were over turned lets save as many babies as we can god is good and smiling down on all the lives that will be saved and not torn apart and thrown away like trash
the leaf blower is a great idea drown out their rhetoric with loud lawn care equipment
i take paint ball guns twice a year a blast away its not much but its what i do
ar done these clowns
a bomb prolife  kill real humans and the parasite inside awesome
kick the ladder under him it be hilarious these people need to get a job and mind their own business you know these people have skeletons in the closet that shouldnt see the light of day
also i have to add that some of the pro choice people are arguing that abortion should be kept legal for mothers who might be hurt by complications this is the 21st century the  of people that will be hurt is so small also they argue about rape easy solution carry the baby for nine months then drop it off at a fire station and for all the other people who have an unwanted pregnancy youll have to listen close are you ready for the amazing secret dont have sex
okay ill give them this if they want to be  able to murder innocent babies in privacy they have a right to do so but then that means that i can murder someone in privacy and get away with it
i dont regret my abortion at all
people are so weird man why would they sit out there like this they have no life im sure an abortion is scary as is i wonder how many children dan has adopted
shes a hero
so prolife that they murder doctors and nurses what sick fucks sorry dude but im sure youre going straight to hell with those choices you have guilt over oh yea take away woman rights and judge her choices im sure god will let that slide buddy these prolife people are pathetic
looks like women have lost a lot of independence on the eve of their independence july 4th day
if i fell pregnant and couldnt get access to an abortion im going to harm myself if i fail to miscarry im jumping in front of a train i refuse to give birth im not a parent
"christofascists 
followers of the apostle paul and the old testament not jesus 

this inspires me to go to the local planned parenthood and get in some faces"
ask them if they are willing to pay for this childs upbringing
imagine a world in which people would mind their own business wouldnt it be great
praying for someone doesnt provide housing daycare groceries
so when they r born whos gonna take care of themthere should be better family planning laws for both men n womenstrict rules for fathers and mothersthis could prevent unwanted pregnancies n sometimes a cheating husband wants the side woman to abort n if she doesnt abort he murder herso much to say about this topic
they should have a sprinter van to pick up the patient somewhere nearby prep them for an anonymous arrival without  abuse and harassment  basically get them into a little covered wheelchair type thing with a vr headset and noise cancelling headphones then you can just roll them right by all those awful people
these male protesters are a special kind of delusional
how to become a patient scort like you  thats a way to help
"pro lifer  save the children and stop abortion life is sacred

also pro lifer  attempts to kill the pregnant women by bombing abortion clinics or shooting them"
thank you for helping women through a very difficult time in their lives 
meanwhile in new zealand we passed a bill voted in by the majority of liberals conservatives and libertarians that states an abortion clinic can set up a safe zone of up to 150 meters protestors that violate the safe zone can be fined up 1000
the 73 year old man is my hero i wanna be brave like him 
your maker murdered all but 8 peopleincluding pregnant women and babies
our security team was tasked to do this once it was myself a big jamaican dude and this small italian guy the italian guy was the voice of the group he loved yelling at people we had multiple police calls against us for bouncing people off the property eventually the cops got involved and told people to stay from the clinic otherwise theyd be arrested
cleaning up the trash lol
i love her
why dont they build a wall 
so sick of women with their selfish idea that somehow they have the right to murder babies the degenerate 1960s really screwed up the minds of many it should have never been permitted
these people need to stay in their own lane ffs  evil people butt of the private and hard time of a stranger life that has no concern of yours you interfering overbearing uninformed strangers
im confused they are trying to save the unborn child but they have no problem killing the caregivers or blowing up the building somehow that doesnt compute to me
us is a really weird place they seem to be pro life but in reality their guns kill more people and instead of regulating guns they put antiabortion laws if you want proof that some people dont understand logic well there you have it
and they are punk men
these morons need to do something useful like getting guns off the street
over a million children in foster and people are against abortion go adopt children if you want to help
mind your own business keep your religion off of my civil liberties
prayers nice gesture but youre seriously gonna try offering me b when i explicitly need a and then say im the problem for refusing your help children cant eat prayers they cant wear prayers or sleep on prayers tangible assistance people
overturned roe vs wade politicians beware married or not politicians can no longer force your mistresss into having a abortion yes i encourage all mistresss to run straight to fox 6 news name your unborn childs father you will need to do this to ensure your child will have financial support that most children are not afforded today thats the only choice the mistress will have the wife better not be mad accept her husbands untrustworthy ways with pride did i say pride lgbtq will be next so all the closet politicians can stay in the closet and thats not fair americans cant wait to see if the closet politicians will be yanked out of the closet and thats not fair either politicians voted to take away a persons choice to choose whats next
shelley your a symbol of freedom 
hahahaha they want to help great take the baby home with you and give that woman no responsibilities oh you dont want too then gtfo there christians stop judging people you go to hell for that too
"thats a real standup christian right there assaulting a woman at her place of business these antichoice protesters are the worst kind of human beings they want to be selfrighteous while telling other people when they should or shouldnt have a baby thats none of their damn business

how many of those protesters have adopted children already how many will vote for representatives that will provide for health care for all americans how many support medicaid wic maternal and paternal paid time off work after the babys born or financial assistance to those who need it during pregnancy and immediately after delivery my best guess is none of them"
anti abortionists should show they can take care of a child first before they have one governmentally speaking where are the support services for children in this country at the bottom of the pile globally
"those protesters are the same people that vote for republicans who support access to military grade weapons that murder school children 
they care more about their supposed gun rights then they do about human lives none of them are part of a wellregulated militia so the constitution does not protect their rights to have ar15s 
i am not against having guns for hunting or for home protection but nobody should have in military grade weapon of murder that scares police from actually responding to a school shooting"
hes not a baby killer like u are lrave him alone hes yelling at baby killers
why are all the protesters old asf
lol its so funny she has treat them like children because they are 
another baby killer no difference between abortion and shooting school children
well i think thats harassment making that decision is hard enough that man in the video really needs to think about what will he tell his maker about his behavior
feeble minded people pray to their invisible god every day enlightened people realize we are god grown outta the universe we are the universe observing itself an embryo is nothing more than a seed it doesnt know life or death we practice population control in all species right down to bugs and viruses go to any farm u quickly realize life is very messy and involves death we are no different feeble minded need a crutch cause they feel hostile toward the environment around them they are filled with guilt and shame cause they cant live up to jesus they are also filled with pride and judgement of others not like them they assume their view of the universe is correct wen in reality no1 knows the realy bad zealots tend to speak their gods will and use actions against others in an attempt to feel better about themselves while reaffirming their beliefs its the usa tho freedom of religion hence choice is the american way
bless this woman she is amazing thank you so much to this fabulous woman
well when these prolifersgod impersonators show up to their maker i think they will be surprised and not in a good way
let us help you how prolifers are contemptuous of the mother and the unborn
wow so these prolifers actually dont like people and decide its best to kill them
i think women are being violated and having their lives taken away from them by the prolife movement
it sounds like old men yelling at their momlol the leaf blower that would be me out there with a leaf blower
thanks for doing this critical work to support our freedom
"dan when i meet my maker i hope he has a lot of mercy
god are you aware that the bible that i provided you does not mention abortion my son also does not speak of such"
"no you dont need to walk out there and protest you are not helping anyone you are not prolife because you are not protecting that life for the entirety you are just trying to force your own conscience onto someone else without having any idea why they are there what they are doing what they are facing in short stay home and stop making something that is already difficult enough even harder 

also do you idiots not see the hypocrisy of carrying prolife signs while threatening people with murder and violence even your own faith tells you not to judge and yet here you are playing god and laying down judgements even your imaginary sky daddy is ashamed of you"
abortion is illegal in many european countries and they seem to do just fine
how many children have they adopted realize u wont get a baby states keep kids in the agency a kid spent life in foster care17 foster homes they r kicked out once they age out
"you americans confuse rights with responsibilities a lot and the world learns its views from you
 wake up and see that sex is not a right its a responsibility if you dont want a baby think of that before you do it if we all started realising this not only would we have less abortions all over this world wed have less rape and abuse too"
the truth isits not a single one of these peoples buisiness what decisions people make
reproductive healthcare these people arent going to planned parenthood for healthcare of their reproductive organs theyre killing babies but it sounds much nicer to say it the way leftist do
since 1977 an average of half a million babies lost their lives every single year the 11 who were killed as tragic as it is pales in comparison oh the irony
uhhg god and monster nutbags
we used to sing songs to drown out the protesters
its a womans choice  with hopefully a mans support and consent as well
look when people stood up and took their party back by electing an outsider you all endlessly criticized and attacked him and them  when people tried to stand up  to the government through protest you all cheered when the government deployed armed troops against them and when a cop shot and killed an unarmed protestor you did not demand justice for her but rather cheered your dear leaders    so why act so hurt now that its your turn
"it looks like these people just dont have a life 
they should be with their grandchildren or wife 
shame on those people for being weak for stalking a women at her hardest time in her life"
"it looks like these people just dont have a life 
they should be with their grandchildren or wife 
shame on those people for being weak for stalking a women at her hardest time in her life"
she a freakin hero
these clowns are so pro life that theyre using their time to foolishly shout at people rather than hell with the lives they say they want to protect they should adopt foster coach teach children if they love and appreciate them butttttt nooooo they shout at people that may just be picking up birth control or getting a pap smear
do they have money to give to people are they going to adopt or foster this child
a running generator would drown out a lot  i wish a billionaire would take interest and throw some money at this issue
dan is an idiot what has he done in his life that gives him the right to chose for a women hes an old man with to much time on his hands 
"reasons why abortion should be legal
abuse
incest 
poverty
rape
whether you agree or disagree with me as long as you are tolerant for those who are against abortion rights for females what if a female girl or woman was raped by some random violent teenage boy or man what if she has no way to support her children because of poverty what if she did not want to have children but her abusive boyfriend or her abusive husband forced her to give birth to a baby even if she is not ready to be a mother and what if she was raped by one of her male family members because it would be extremely disgraceful  disgusting to keep the baby of a rapist  a male relative which will traumatize the mother  especially the children that is why i am prochoice not proabortion and not antiabortion but prochoice period
abort babies when they are a zygote"
stop histrionic forced birthers
the unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for they never make demands of you they are morally uncomplicated unlike orphans they dont need money education or childcare they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships and when they are born you can forget about them because they cease to be unborn its almost as if by being born they have died to you you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth power or privilege without reimagining social structures apologizing or making reparations to anyone they are in short the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe
so only pro choicers who support abortion have the right to protest and destroy property at will
theyre actually trying to help guys
how about supporting child tax credit child care medicare for all universal healthcare   you know things that actually help children after they are born
thank you for what you do  you cant imagine what you are providing
they are not pro life they are pro birth  it is between you  whoever you believe in  nobody nobody had a right to tell me what to do with my body
so were singing her praises for killing babies
the only reason to stop abortions was the republicans are so afraid they will be replaced by black people  dont have a dam thing to do with life but the cowards
they should embrace the gops support of bs stand your ground laws and say they feared for their life whenever one of the crazies whacks them with a sign
bro chill those women need to do what they need to do none of our business thats giving them some of a choice there not even asking to help just to leave them alone
wheres the help for the tens of millions of children going hungry right here in the usa 
the christian taliban
provide headphones with music as they get out of the car           very brave young woman thank you for all that you do
those men should step up and have a voluntary vecectamy nip it at the bud
men control womens body is wrong are men having them no what if a decision to cut off your b is that right
bless her
this abortion issue has never been and never will be about the actual health of the baby or mother or whatever this is about religious people trying to control others as they have done for centuries
yeah prolife people killing isnt that a contradiction why cant people just mind their own freaking business  
damn its already hard enoughand how does damn know only py hes seen is mamas
the women who are forced to give birth should give the baby to these antiabortion people if the antiabortion folks are so selfrighteous they should help take care of these babies
fat and ugly women disagrees with pro life who would of thought
that doctor is a stand up guy
my wife and i had to go through this she was having an ectopic pregnancy terminated we were told there was no chance the fetus could survive and continuing the pregnancy was not an option for her safety at the time we had four children and she ran a daycare center we certainly had room for one more
creeps
not today larry 
pro lifers are hypocrites why are red states the worst out of 50 states for infant mortality or child hunger by the way they yammer youd think red states would be baby utopias but theyre not theyre absolutely terrible in every metric if they really cared theyd show it opposed to leaving terrible messages and protesting clinics laughable most are pro firearm and pro protecting property with deadly force also capital punishment yeah really pro life right there theyre hypocrites plain and simple
evil churches fund these demonstrators to cause trouble
"cnn this woman is standing up to antiabortion protestors by posting them on tiktok
also cnn libsoftiktok is dangerously doxxing liberals by sharing videos of them on tiktok"
they wont help anyone
wow it was incredibly dumb to post video of that woman saying that anything that looks like a bomb gets the clinic shut down for the day now there will be boxes on the doorstep daily  sometimes you shouldnt tell the whole story
this is why religious freaks are the most dangerous they are like cult they believe they are above everything everyone i can not name any other religion that tries this hard to dictate how everyone elses life actually dangerous to modern state governing
how ironic to try to kill or harm someone for doing a job which is protecting and supporting a womans difficult decision from harsh judgment shame or harm theres something really wrong with these protesters fr they could be helping at a homeless shelter or fostering children but instead they choose to shame and judge other humans the very thing the bible says not to do
"abortion is murder get over it
there are dozen of contraception methods so you simply have no excuse for being irresponsible"
"if you dont want a baby abstain from intercourse use 2 kinds of birth control or get sterilized  only 15 of all abortions are because of rape or incest  that means 985 are because of irresponsibility  grow up and be responsible for your actions
yes i got pregnant at 19 in 1974 and could have had an abortion but didnt"
anyone who works in a clinic will tell you the meanest harshest thing you can do to an antiabortion painintheass protester the thing which bugs them more than anything which makes them have to work hard to avoid displaying their frustration is to ignore them  there is nothing you can say nothing which you can do which will frustrate them as much as if you ignore them
you are so brave thank you for helping all women
how can you cite the being who commanded the murder of the first born of all egypt as being anti abortion
wow  what a job  escorting baby killers to the execution chamber how brave  noble
"shouting we will help you
how taking care of medical bills adopting children
they are so self righteous that its disgusting to watch they are so prolife that they are willing to kill
thanks to all escorts and workers that risk their lives every day in order to help those poor women"
how brave the staff are against the deranged religious cultists i remember working as a midwife in the us 30 years ago one wonderful back up physician had to have 24 hour security as he was the only obgyn who would humanely terminate a pregnancy when it was needed saving many womens lives and putting his own in jeopardy my colleagues birth centre was bombed by a christian psychiatric case  thankfully no one was in the building or in labour at the time the reason he destroyed her birth centre her back up obgyn was the brilliant dutch dr who supported a womans right to choose whether to have a child whether to give birth in a hospital with most us doctors sabotaging labour to make as much money as possible or a natural birth centre with trained midwives i lasted 2 years before returning to the uk the horrors i saw there made me realise the dangers facing normal intelligent compassionate people against dangerous religious fanatics my colleagues birth centre had volunteers help rebuild it but the expectant moms had to either have their babies at home or at another birthing centre in the interim the attack affected her livelihood as many women felt too frightened to then have their babies at her beautiful birth centre after that yet abortions never take place at a birthing centres pregnancies end because a baby is born so this crazy man could easily have killed a new mother and her baby as well as the professionals and other staff it was an eye opening experience to say the least returning to europe was like returning to heaven after 2 years in american fundamentalist hell
she is a very brave women   we need more like her those people  would make a way bigger difference if they put down their signs and volunteered  their time to children and families who are already here and need their help
shelley mann looks hideous she doesnt have to worry about needing an abortion lol
that escort is great  love when she says nobody asked you  lol
how about having an underground parking lot lol
thank you shelly for your strength
ask these same religious self righteous hypocrites about the lives of children coming across the border about wars killing dozens of children everyday or even underage mentally disabled people on death row they care only for the fetus and once born they are worthless to them
these types of religious people just never stop infiltrating not only peoples house doors but the most vulnerable and private body parts
go shelly
can ppl pls start bombing the pro lifers why is it always the other way around
"who the fuck are these old men foh america is a shit hole
 and i love this girl this is what we need"
i love this escort so much  with all my soul  she is a strong warrior who care so much for my sisters mothers aunts and friends  i thank her from the bottom of my heart  and those protesters  why arent they adopting one of the 150000 children who have been up for adoption in the usa  if they care so much about those children  why arent they adopting 5 or 6 of them and why arent they with them right now
you are a brave young women and dont know how many women youve helped by simply being there thank you on behalf of my grand daughters and great grand daughters
"my dad used to walk up to anti abortion protesters and ask their name then he pulled out a 5 and said im going to donate this to the clinic in your name
he was a warrior spirit"
the problem with the protesters are is that they believe they have a maker and that maker does not approve of a womans health how sad and stupid is that
312 she just called it a tiny rubber fetus
religion sucks  what a bunch of horrible people
"they dont care about the life thats already here
once the babythat they beg for is born they do nothing to help the mothers in any wayshape or form
doubt they would care if a ten year old girl was pregnant"
simple criminalize fornication castrate any man who violates that law
and not one of these protesters ever adopted a baby
isnt it wonderful that these old men are there harassing women and really its a boy or a girl well crap i thought it was a puppy
why dont they just spend their time in foster care taking care of those beautiful children instead do they know how many homeless children are there in america 
shes amazing
dont understand how certain people can so passionately support the murder of unborn babies thousands of lives saved by the supreme courts decision
make no mistake  you are a hero  women need to be in control of their bodies period
best stock options this week
years ago i worked in law enforcement and i remember getting a call that a group had barged into a clinic when i arrived there were several protesters with signs sitting on the steps of the clinic and a few on the edge of the property as well i tried to ask what was going on but was ignored until a staff member from the clinic stuck her head out the door and said theyre in the clinic by this time i was backed up by several other officers and we made our way past the ones on the step and into the clinic the protesters had entered an examination room where a young lady was still on the exam table they were sitting in a circle around the table singing  about 3 months later the clinic moved to a more secure location
"can you imagine if the pilgrims didnt bring all that religious crap with them
go on just imagine that"
wow so brave of her get a real job
i dont feel sorry for these demons stop killing babies
if you kill a baby you should also die
why are we killing babies just why why should a precious baby  get a death sentence
but pedophile priests are okay with your imaginary friend in the sky
america is not your church
the two most dangerous times for women in abusive relationships is when they are leaving or are pregnant  but these are the same people who would deny her an abortion but wont vote for gun control or the boyfriend claus which could possibly save her and her unborn life  i am so tired of these meddling white old fanatics
funny how women are doing what they need to do to stop unwanted suffering yet some men and women ignore all the real issue like the fentanyl epidemic to berate women who choose not to add to it
funny its always the people who dont have to deal with the consequences of their opinions that are protesting the mothers are going to have to take care of the babies that they cant financially support the foster care programs are going to have to find these children a better quality of life and women are going to forcefully die giving birth to babies that wouldnt have had a conscious understanding of their existence otherwise no one should be allowed to decide for these women its their choice
well that whale will never need an abortion
so funny how these loving caring ppl bravely usher these women past the protestors up the stairs to a dingy room where they lovingly kill babies its beautiful
antiabortion protesters make spectacles out of a desperate need to feel important otherwise they feel they lead insignificant meaningless lives 
i would love to see those people standing and praying in front of a coming tornado or hurricane to go away  lets see how god helps them there
how about handing each of them earplugs as they get out of the car or maybe earphones and music we  will  we  will  rock you
prolifers message is incongruent and irrational  they want supposedly to save the life of a fetus but in the same breathe theyre willing to kill another human being  i think they have mental health issues ocd being one of them  i wonder if they would be happy to have muslims jews and buddhists next to them  praying to their respective gods remember the constitution says we have freedom of religion and there arent only radical christians and evangelicals in this country
its none of your business why they are at the clinic just mind your own business
a fetus from rpe is not a blessing from god
what they forget is even god gives us the right to choose god says choose death and cursing or choose life and blessing each persons version of cursing and blessing maybe different than the next persons
if men were the ones having babies theyd want the right to choose
maybe dan should find time to adopt a few children
usa educations and religion are making people stupidignorant and selfish
you  retired my dude youll be gone in a few weeks  you should worry more about your life
if jesus were alive today his dms would be full of death threats for supporting a womans right to choose
love shelley keep it up
those people will be gone in a few weeks 
crazythey dont want abortion to happen but will kill someonehow is that ok
this is about people who have a small minded bias about a subject they cant understand  instead of minding their own business they push their magic man in the sky who according to the bible supports aborting unborn fetuses  but they interpret their entitled nature according to what they want to believe and support autocratic invasive theocracy and suppress the privacy and freedom of others  they are too stupid to realize their wrongs dont do anything but cause harm to others they dont have any business of knowing about or what they are doing  they are extremists and hide behind their rights to violate others rights  if there is a god i dont believe they are going to be happy if they get judgement
i  have one thing to say to the guy who said he believed abortion was wrong well dont have one and get your nose out of other peoples business
honestly i think abortions should be done in either a hospital or outpatient surgery clinic that does other procedures that way the woman who have abortions and all those involved in the procedure will be safe from violent protesters and judgmental people
did someone that doesnt want you to have a choice really say their right to choose life 
"all these capable good hearted people could be fostering or providing care for actual children thats their hypocrisy they only care about women paying for sin even if its a mans sin  i had a crisis in pregnancy and chose a therapeutic abortion  rather than wait for the baby to die on his own he was 22 weeks kicked until the last minute and i got to hold him have pictures and say goodbye my alternative was to wait for nature to take it course and have an unpredictable situation which was not going to change the outcome im assuming women in that situation will now have to wait for fetal demise and hope they can get through that without an emergency or having the dead baby removed surgically or maybe you start to hemorrhage in the grocery store thats the problem you dont know peoples stories or the why and things can go very wrong babies can be alive with non survivable defects we are now capable of knowing that and asking a women to walk around visibly pregnant waiting for the baby to die is cruel and barbaric we arent forcing anyone in any situation to terminate if you want to carry and give birth to an anecephalic brainless baby you can so dont have an abortion  but if your weeping over non viable fetuses but not engaging in feeding housing and caring for the unwanted abused neglected and homeless kids we haveyoure an asshole telling strangers whats best for them
yes i also adopted the child of a schizophrenic teen relative after she was rejected by 2 christian agencies my 2 cents"
"iamroe
iamroe1986
reproductiverights"
ask these protesters how many unwanted babies have you adopted or fostered im sure none they want to convince you to keep this unwanted baby but are they stepping up to do there part financially physically and emotionally for the mother or the unwanted baby
"my grandmother would have aborted my father he went to the childrens home at birth
my mother tried to get rid of me she tried everything to get rid of me when i was born she said she wanted me it never felt like she did
i would still rather be alive"
vote blue for woman rights to choose cause red want them dead
"most women have very good reasons for abortions and do not do or take it lightly whatever their reasons it is no ones business but theirs i knew when i was younger i didnt think i could do it but i never had to  i never had desperate medical or traumatic event around being pregnant i do believe woman have to decide for themselves 

the second part men birth control or vasectomy accept no means no including from your own wife we had hard days too take responsibility and be accountable for your part in this i know this may be preaching to the choir emotionally mature men of conscious do not rape or commit incest they do not bully women or demean them they support and love and care emotionally mature men"
slavery was to all europeans and other white came steal kill gods goin be white supremacy kkk cops god is yall enemy prove god say kill 20 trillon black mexican indan god isnt white supremacy look at real history man maid plegs god county is building every dad we
and now the chinese government has all her information lol
life is not ours to destroy
notice one of these is an unhealthy woman self focused on filming herself and getting clout from peoples pain the others are people who care and want to help at the core of their intentions  just saying
private security paid for by unrestricted donations would be useful at these clinics
i once biked to planned parenthood to be present for my friend  as i was locking up my bike a man came and kneeled beside me shoving his rosary at my face  he was violating my space and his presence was unwanted  he started lecturing me about life and i said i bet you ate meat this morning  he looked confused  i think i broke his brain
creeps
11 killed by antiabortionists these prolifers continuously contradict themselves idiots
so youre a prolifer but would kill a doctor
bible thumpers are a plague
much love to shelley  such an inspiration  i didnt know you could volunteer to escort women  maybe i will do this one day
we should now change our name to the divided states of fascismwe now have a supreme court who is rendering rulings based on partisanship and their religious views4 of them lied to get onto the court and it is now apparent in this country that as long as you have power and money then laws do not apply to youyou can be sure that the rich will have all of the medical access to abortion care they need and once again the women who will suffer the most have the least amount of resources and the least amount of influencei never thought i would see the day that this country would undertake an experiment that was so detrimental to what we claim we are as a nationthis court will continue to strip rights from people based on their own held beliefs and interpretation of the bible and if the court is not expanded and the filibuster removedwe will be back to 1940 by next year
these people dont care about health care or the quality of life for babies after theyre born  nor do they care about the women  they probably ate a big breakfast full of animals to boot  they dont care about life they care about sanctimony
life begins at the egg and at the sperm all male antichoice protesters produce sperm and all female antichoice protesters produce eggs but all protesting women and men abort those innocent lives so they will burn in the fires of hell forever no respite no relief in pain forever
isnt it odd that the only people who want abortions legal are the people who werent aborted themselves
this woman is so courageous and amazing
too bad christofascist god doesnt care about the animals he created who are suffering in factory farms zoos and slaughterhouses
shelley is great what a hero for womens rights
why dont they visit a factory farm or slaughterhouse if theyre so prolife
the fact abortion clinics even have escorts is bullshit this would mean that some people are so insane about this that its been decided it could be dangerous for the exmother which is retarded
could they just blast heavy metal  rap or something to drown these jerks out
so pro life but so strongly pro gun is life really sacred apparently not 
i dont understand how its allowable for these protests outside of clinics protest the decisions of your elected officials directly but harassing people who are exercising their right to get health care should not be permitted it would be like people who oppose income tax interfering with people entering the irs buildings or state tax  revenue offices
i remember these people i was going into planned parenthood for cervical cancer screening they yell at you without knowing much about your situation
kjv mathew 216  herod had all the children under 2 years of age killed but god only warned to save jesus god is in control of life and death we all pass at a young age or at an old age sad women have to make this choice
"these people dont care about children at all because if they did they wouldnt be encouraged people to adopt one of the 517000 children in the us  who currently need a forever home 117000 that need adopted and 400000 in forster care why is it more people are encouraged to rescue a dog from a shelter instead of a breeder 

see if i was her  i would find out where they live and organised a protest outside their homes  maybe po outside their chievhy"
i wonder if these prolifers realise that life on this plane is not the goal are they leaning on their morality or gods seems their eyes were taken off the summit
this guys gunna have a shock when theres no maker at the end
thank god these are old theyll soon die
why not go help actual kids that are alive and present on this earth the spend all this time harassing people and wasting their time if they actually cared about kids they would spend this time with all the kids in foster care
soon were taking the 19th seethe
just great
my life my choice your life your choice  mind your own life  stay out of mine
the worse thing a person can do is  is stick their nose in someones elses life my life my choice  your life your choice mind your own life not mine
many years of prayers and now an answer to it praise god  praying for all life  this video is sad and heartbreaking but they need a narrative to play have to pray for everyone with love even when the anger comes from stopping murder all murder is horrible not just for the ones who can or could defend themselves out of the womb
"the idea that you cant decide for yourself whether to keep or abort a pregnancy  not an actual human being  is just mind boggling 
also that it is not your own business "
what type of f ghoul kills an innocent human life because they had irresponsible sex what kind of f ghoul even believes they have the right to do this there is still hope for you we have a loving and forgiving god turn away from this lifestyle it is a lifestyle of mental illness and suicide
martyrs of abortion god has heard your cries god shall avenge your blood
men have no say as to what a woman does with her body hell no one has a say on what you choose to do with your own body men or women
they should go protest for better sex education for both man and woman so we avoid unplanned pregnancies also go pretest for a better forster care system there are children suffering atrocities because the system fails them everyday
"id like to say that you dont have to be pro abortion to support these womeni am pro life but i am also pro you doing what the hell you want with you body as long as it doesnt affect me or my family
and someone who is raising the christian church i dont understand christians they dont practice any of the s in the bible like i already stated its just a sad situation all around these women need a safe place to have this done if theyre going to do it cuz its their choice well i would never be okay with my wife doing it unless it would kill her to have the baby or the baby would die it needs to be done in the safeway so that like this doctor said women dont lose the ability to reproduce you should be able to have a baby on your own terms at your own time and unfortunately as a man i have experience with failed contraceptive my wife was on contraceptives when she got pregnant with our fourth child"
let me get this straight these so called  anti abortion terrorist are willing to kill 11 human beings all in the name of protecting a fetus that has nothing to do with them stupidity has no definition
be that compassionate about the word of god
why is it always people who are claiming they have a religious authority in a religious right to be there the most rude aggressive and violent of the bunch why dont you practice the f preachings that youll try to preach cuz i know being forced into church as a child the bible is all about forgiveness turning other cheek being peaceful and loving people like you love yourself so what the f is wrong with you christians
i was at planned parenthood to help me with excessive bleeding newport beach ca anti abortionist threw bibles at me hit friend n nose made her nose bleed cops did nothing
i just do not understand how there are so many independently wealthy people to literally make harassing people their unpaid job while so many of us are struggling to feed ourselves everyday  these people must have loads of cash
creepy af
its almost as if condom dont exist
and adoption doesnt work most adopted kids go in and they are either sexually abused and then they have children that they have to deal with that came from an abusive parent that fuck them and had sexual intercourse with them trust me ive seen several of my friends that have been put in the foster system get raped by their own foster parents disgusting you guys are and you know who im talking about too
abortion should be accessible to women i am a god loving man  woman and if something is inside our bodies that is toxifying us does it matter if its a living being it should be removed immediately if its causing harm to the body and if its causing harm to the mind is well god has said that in the bible that we hand the choice to do so and you christians calling yourself christians now what a shameful act of disrespect to gods creation god will punish the masses that follow the masses which you god following followers that follow churches are the masses which you will be punished for your own self pride shall be judged and if youre wondering if im 8 nonchristian now i went to a baptist you guys have no idea how hard it is im also integrated with more than 100 different types of religions so i know what god wants and i know what god doesnt want you guys that stop the abortion process causes us harm to our bodies i hope you know that if you guys continue this and down the road especially you republicans that are following q you guys will learn your lesson soon enough and donald trump you need to get out because your lawyers right were coming for you dont forget about what they said in the bible about the meeks we will return just because weve been watching you fools and you sadist calling us sadist which is nasty and itself because i will give my life freely to god unlike you guys wont lay your lives down for the real god you will lay your lives down for the petty the silverishly foolishness of a governmental party like the republicans this is a democratic republic it is both a republican and a democratic system it is both for the people by the people with the help of industry
and they should worry about the babies after they are born
dont these protestors have jobs i mean really  gosh are they that bored ffs
i would ask them ask them is they march for black life matter
i bet they are all child molesters or something vile
these fairly tale worshippers arent  making sure orphanages are empty though huhtelling
i had an abortion procedure at 17 years old i choose to terminate because my ex was abusive to me and the abuse only escalated when i was pregnant it was a very difficult decision especially for me who loved children and babies but i felt that was my only way to survive that abusive relationship and also a potential child my ex became addicted to drugs and he was physically and emotionally abusive whenever i tried to leave him he stalked me i was literally stuck with him until i broke free and terminated i wasnt old enough to have an abortion without my parents consent so i tried to poison myself first hoping id have a miscarriage which only caused me to become very sick i wouldve killed myself trying to terminate the baby from my abusive ex
"so sick of these fairy tale worshipping little children getting to rule others lives
these are terrorists and they should treated as such stand your ground and fear for your lifeend these anti choice terrorists threats"
theyre literally called the deathscorts
these people need to get a life
the doctor who still does third trimester abortion said he prays to whom maybe the devil  second trimester is clearly unimaginable horror not to mention third the whole thing is clearly evil
if you want to understand something about creation never listen to religions 
yea its crazy to think people feel this passionately about abortions but not about addressing the issues that would lead someone to make this decision like people literally cannot afford to have a child and the foster care system is an absolute mess
"i can kind of see the point of view of the anti abortion people 

they truly believe that the fetus is a precious baby and theyre right their heart seems to be in the right place 


problem is its too much to ask to force a mother to carry a baby"
"help reinstate roe v wade
impregnate a christian republican today"
lets get real here there is no justification for ending a babys life all i hear people saying to justify abortion is the foster care homes are horrible or  the babies should be aborted because theyll grow up in poverty the truth is it is usually young women having abortions because they think a baby will interfere with their dreams of going to college or becoming an actress and model young girls live in a fantasy at that age and have almost a zero chance of ever becoming famous as for the foster care thing being in foster care is alot better than being murdered growing up in poverty is also better than being murdered how would you feel if someone killed you because they said they wanted to prevent you from living in poverty  my grandmother grew up dirt poor in oklahoma during the great depression and dust bowl and said those were the happiest days of her life money is not everything and this is not ethiopia where babies will starve to death with flies swarming their mouths
most of the protesters cannot get pregnant they need to leave these women alone
048 im gone get me a ladder climb to the top and shout at people until they see the world exactly how i do
when a fetus has a heart   it becomes a child nobody has the right to kill a child listen to the science listen to the law
pro choice works both ways  they need to remember that  it means you can have a child or not
she is a heroi ve never thought or imagined that in the united states the situation of abortion clinics are those and that women doctors and people working in the clinics risk their lives everydayit is crazy i m shocked
republicans just want total government control over all our lives  and when that same government comes for their guns the right wingers will give them up without a fight because they trust anything big government tells them
being obsessed with what is inside a womans private body is sick theyre never going to stop women from wanting an abortion do these people take care of children or just waste time being a pest
"theyre fighting a losing battle
god aint gonna ask you about other peoples sins these people are meddlesome and obnoxious and are delusional by judging as if theyre god"
only in america does the religious nutcases and religious violent extremists stalk abortion clinics
"thank you sooo much thanks to dr bill baird who gave me my first iud he helped me through my first exams he gave me respect and fought for reproductive rights 
rip dr baird "
thank you to all the escorts nurses and doctors for being there for women your bravery and service is important work and appreciated  you are saving lives  we wont go back
i guess they think god cant fight his own battles  so impotent
these harassers should be filmed and heckled back
my god dan needs a better fucking hobby
were focused on the women and the children to choose life creepy smiling because they dont want any choices for women at all
this women is amazing i follow her on tiktok every clinic needs a person like her
" dan doesnt seem to understand what he says     these unborn children are being violated    
   dan you dont have the right to interfere with the rights of women in need of the specific type of health about which you know _nothing_"
 _shelly mann  i wish you good health and clear horizons  thank you for your courage to assist those who require help_
prolifers who love freedom do not want people to have choice and threaten to kill people who are alivebecause they are for life  yup sounds very american 
"a bunch of old religious white people with nothing better to do
these people need a hobby and some friends"
"its all about their freaking fanatical religious beliefs that theyre shoving into the throats of those who dont share their freaking religious fanaticism  thats the main reason why roe vs wade was trashed by those hypocritical lying justices  

america is tilting to its downfall because of these stupid gullible delusional in denial hypocritical religious fantatics pathetic cultist conspiracy theorist deplorable trumpturds  "
i have spent many years working with those who are unloved and unwanted children and teens i can tell you that none of these folks ever show up to help  once the unborn are born they want nothing to do with them
yall going to hell for killing babies
it breaks my heart that women have to deal w assholes like this at an already stressful time in their lives these people are sick
great people
so much effort into the results instead of focusing on the cause 
"old creepy white dudes why is it always old lecherous american christofacist white dudes

news flash bob when you die the lights just go out and thats freaking it theres no heaven or any ancient mythical deity white dude with a long beard pulling everyones strings its a freaking myth"
im so sorry to any woman who has been harassed by these protesters sending my love to anyone who has gone through this process you are so strong  love from sydney australia
so you are proud of murder wow
you need a former marine my name is david paul in wayne county ohio semper fi
go shelley  legend
when dan meets his maker hes going to  ask him why he harassed so many people when he lets so many conceptions go in in menstrual tissue
the anti abortion people are nazis
a brave lady  bless her for the work she does
laws in australia ban these types from harrassing women  outside clinics
these loons are probirth not prolife just think if they took all this time and energy to help all the kids in foster careetc
both sides have mentally deranged individuals look at the jan 6 committee if you dont believe me cheers
theyve been groomed for decades to act this way theyre useful idiots
all this can be avoided by using a rubber
when you have women dying from unhealthy fetuses its a f problem okay  when the womans life is at risk and the fetus probably will not grow properly or live to be discharged from the hospital after labor and delivery an abortion is very much necessary people dont think of these things all they know is  irresponsible women get pregnant and want to terminate the pregnancy but that is not the case all the time this is a very sad world we live in no consideration at all im with abortion if its going to risk a  life
take them up on their help  get them to pay for all the expenses of the pregnancies and then they can adopts the babies and do all the work of being the parent  theyll each have 28 kids in a month and theyll be way too busy to protest anywhere
you go shelly keep doing it sister
more proof that this issue is far from over
i wish i could thank that doctor for saving womens lives
democrats and liberals never disappointhere are your true insurrectionists
anyone who doesnt know the pain and hardship of being an unwanted child should really not wish that on anyone the people who are crowing over this win are getting a hardon for human suffering if they really cared there wouldnt be children languishing in foster care who will never be able to call someone mom or dad there wouldnt be street kids with no place to lay their heads we can look around and see how much they care hippocrits
what is it ameroca is a free country is the same that prochoice people do every where hey cnn please be a true journalists not fanatics
all i really care about is the women and the children and their right to choose life    
jesus went to modern churches and preached hell fire to church leaders like false prophets not this
that doctor looks good for 80 its too bad he cant retire cuz his job is so risky
save a life then murder 10 all in the name of god
god killed lots of  look it up
ever notice its almost mostly men who are outside what the fck do they know about womens reproductive organs  they those creepy men tend to look like pervs
i saw one protester covered in tattoos with a sign mentioning god calling out to save the lives of babies i wondered whether hed ever read the bible especially the parts that says that one should not decorate their bodies or the part that states that life begins with the first breath
creepy ass old white men
well help you they say as they continue to vote for the same gop politicians that refuse to pass bills for assistances including food stamps day care  minimum wage increases affordable health care affordable housing etc yes they want women to stay pregnant have the baby and bring it up in utter poverty g d hypocrites it makes my blood boil
"shes actually interfering with those peoples right to protest 

people always claim they believe in freedom of speechuntil someone says something they dont agree with left or right conservative or liberal its always the same"
since 1977 11 people have been killed in anti abortion attackshow is that pro life
an invisible man in the sky told me to come harrass women okaaaay crazypants
i find it cruel that these pro lifers say they want life but when the mother is endanger of dying from carrying or giving birth there is no sympathy how is that pro life
third trimesterthats 29 to 40 weeks did anyone hear what he said
shelly mann is a true hero she is ensuring that womens rights arent stomped on by those protesters funny how their rights seem to outweigh the rights of everybody else  those protesters who claim it is their right to stand out and yell at women trying to access healthcare are doing nothing but trying to suppress the rights of others  a 50 fine and unsupervised probation is a ridiculous punishment for someone who is trying to take away or suppress the rights of another individual
why are old men putting themselves in other peoples business
funny how all these people who act like they care so much for fetuses actually care so little for the rights or feelings of anyone else these guys defend their right to stand out and yell at people but they have not one peep about the right of those women to access healthcare it is awful to have to walk through a bunch of yelling people to get into a clinic i had to do it to get my birth control pills the people yelling didnt know or care why i was there they yelled ugly things at me and shoved gory pictures in front of my face as i walked into the clinic they literally tried to terrorize me into not going into the clinic all it did was make me mad and more determined to go in and get my pills they were 10 at the clinic pharmacy 28 at a retail pharmacy those people yelling could care less that i was there to try to save 18 on a month of pills they were there to yell at and upset women somehow that is their right sick puppies one and all
dan needs to go back to work and then return to pass out his paychecks  money  cold hard cash to the women hes yelling at dan you did it backwards dude go back to work
there not one state that prohibits abortion if   mother in danger of deathinjury  rape or incest or miscarry killing a innocent makes no logical sense i dont get it and if were going to practice that ideology then we need to have a serious discussion of getting rid of child support 5050 marriage and paying alimony because cutting ties with a baby momma and children will save and improve male lives physically and emotionally
when you meet your maker joe god better have mercy on what you did with your life your dick your mouth ect mind the speck in your own eye
i love it notice most protestors are men  once they become pregnant handle the 9 months give birth and then they can say something i still will never understand why these people are violent but prolife protesters rarely become violent actually i cant remember when one has happened
what the hell is he talking about nobody is telling him what to do with his body
again they are not prolife they are pro birth and also pro death but they tend to be to stupid to see that
why are these idiots not arrested it is illegal to protest a medical facility arrest these idiots a fetus is not a living being
freedom of religion means freedom from religion  if you dont like abortion  dont get one such moronic people 
the amount of demon possessed people who love killing babies in these comments is staggering
want to help take the little bastard
"why are the protestors trying to force women to carry to term are so old that they wouldnt be able to take care of a child whats is this grandparent fever
also stop pushing your religion on others"
it  amazing when you see the size of their protesters compared to the size of the prochoice protesters but yet somehow the few get to run this country on the many do not
why protesters have to be so rude yelling at women like that shame on them freedom of religion should be reinforce but we have to remember that country is not the land of the free
go back to your fing church and leave people out of your crazy no floating man in the sky decided that your here to harass people in a bad place nuts
these so called pro life protesters are ignorant misguided judgemental who have no right to try and impose their will on others individuals who for whatever reason but especially the victims of rape incest or child abuse have the inalienable right to reproductive healthcare its especially egregious in my mind when individuals and groups think their religious beliefs take precedence over another persons life i feel thats the definition of religious extremism bigotry and hypocrisy especially when they put their own narrow interpretations on scriptures that seldom if at all make references to birth control
these old fart men n women have no right telling any women what to do with their body
this woman is a hero these sanctimonious prolifers are nauseating
im starting my own cult its so easy to con the galactically ignorant among us
religion is the scourge on this earth
all of you people protesting should be asking why the democrat party hasnt turned row into law for over 50 years answer they dont care
233 your good lord has no mercy have you not read the bible
why is it everybody who is against abortion is somebody who should of been aborted i dare any anti abortionist to prove me wrong
they arent there to help they just want to spew religious nonsense
we need to start counterprotesting these protesters escorts have to stay professional the rest of us dont
i hope he has a lot of mercy yeah youre gonna need it bro
thank you for your work
so abortion is killing but the antiabortionists shoot up the place and kill people and take lives  ironic
the most unfuckable women are protesting from both sides
a pro lifer commits murder if thats not hypocritical i dont know what is these people are so small minded and arrogant to their own personal views
not all heros wear capes
not all heros wear capes
those protestors need to get a life  go mind your own business
they keep preaching god but god also stated it is a sin to judge but they dont comprehend that 
hey idiots you dont have to be a crazy christian to disagree with you abortion isnt ok at best its the only option that makes sense and that aint how it is usually
"prolife side also seems proshooting and profire bombing when they dont get their way

wish the media would stop portraying this issue as if both sides had equally valid rationale"
not one of those antis own a uterus
"bless youshelly
brave american hero"
the scariest thing is that those imbeciles  so truly believe that they have the right to tell others how to live their lives i wonder how theyd feel if we followed them to their doctors and and objected and screamed abuse at them for whatever procedure they were having believing in the invisible magical guy who lives in the sky is more important than living humans is being just bizarre ignorant taliban america
the street protesters are no different then the scotus on the bench with their twisted ideologies
horrible people who care nothing and know nothing about these women  they are not pro life they are pro foetus at the cost of the life and well being of women  these pests have no right to torment medical people or the people having a procedure
"america is totally messed up 
the ones who want gun control wants to kill babies the ones who say life is sacred are also saying guns are good 
no wonder russia is not afraid of america and china will soon lead the world"
these pro lifers are sick
"america is totally messed up 
the ones who want gun control wants to kill babies the ones who say life is sacred are also saying guns are good 
no wonder russia is not afraid of america and china will soon lead the world"
"america is totally messed up

"america is totally messed up

no wonder russia is not afraid of america and china will soon lead the world"
its easy for men to sit there and say whats wrong or right they dont have to go through any of the sickness pain or they dont care for any of those kids where are they when these kids by that mother that shouldnt had kids from the startwhere where they when a 3 yr old was found dead in the freezer didnt see them speaking out  my body and fck your thoughts opinions and im gonna do what i want for me and my body period 
literally old white men and karens
"i have a very difficult time with antiabortionists faulty logic what makes anyone think they have a right to tell anyone what they can and cant do with their bodies yet the same individuals that  protest against abortion also  
protest against public assistance
when someone doesnt want to have a baby thats their choice whether you like it or not or anyone else likes it or not i have five kids i wouldnt have an abortion myself but at the same time im not comfortable telling another woman that she cant do you know why because its none of my fucking business too many people make other peoples business their own and thats the problem with morality"
those people are the taliban in america it  was created by the gop and extremist religious and it has the support ofthe supreme court
the right to choose life woman that is what they are doing they are choosing their life no one goes to an abortion clinic just because
we know theyre all hypocrites because theyre not protesting outside of gun manufacturers and nra offices especially now that guns are the number one killer of children from birth to 18 in america  not to mention the fact that nearly all of the states that are the most antichoice are also ranked at the bottom for healthy outcomes for children and families  its not about abortion its about control  its not about children its about limiting agency for women  its not about children its about imposing their religion on others
infant mortality rate is a joke in the usa maybe fix that is they are so pro life
great job shelly dealing with these right wing religious nut cases these people are right wing hippocrates who whine about a womans choice for her own body but they wont support childcare healthcare funding for schools time off for parents or gun control which kills living children every day they are disgusting brainwashed bullies
may baphomet protect those seeking passage for satan is responsible for the responsible
why this men name dan or all those protesters against abortion that are so worry about live of kids go feed and provide for kids without parents if they are so worried about 
someone needs to take sign up vouchers to these places and see how many of the pro choicers are willing to help financially with the upbringing of the children they say they are saving
they got nothing better to do but go out and harass people  they dont care about babies  theyre just trying to make their own miserable pathetic existence mean something  but all jokes aside these people may seem harmless but they demonstrate the underlying threat organized religion presents to liberty  these people think they have a right to dictate how other people live and historically this belief system is what led to religious institutions literally murdering people in the most horrific ways imaginable  that is precisely why the founders of the us drafted the us constitution with a separation of church and state
you get messages but your broadcasting yourself to the masses
its crazy how shes taking her 15 bucks a hour job shes literally trying make money off tik tok off all this
"u lost me at the 3rd trimester abortion
i will never agree with that"
kudos to shelley
great work shelly
the irony runs deep here
there majority of people against abortion are good people and good critical thinkers but there are some prolifers that take it to far the world is not a perfect place and it will never will be that does not mean we should sit with our arms crossed and not try to help these women every life is important
someone should ask dan and the rest of the protesters how many children they have taken in or adopted also ask him if he has taken in any single moms and supported them and their children
why dont these protesters protest outside of prison for against the death penalty
thank you for your work  please stay safe
those crazy people needs a job  glad i am living in the netherlands
when he meet his maker he is going to ask him why did he waisted his life protesting instead of actually helping others
how about telling all the women and girls to stop opening their hairy legs and having sex without protection there are consequences of your actions
pro life people  let me save that fetus or i threaten your life with violence and death very pro life you can really feel they care for every living being on this earth very deep christian values
to be proliferated and threaten people with violence and death is nonsensical
women need real sex education again we can only get pregnant during ovulation and thats when we in intense sexual heat also we ovulate only a few days per month or prior to menses women need to get their reproductive system examinedtested to know if they have healthy functioning uterusesoveries thats functioning properly white women does it when they want to have kids its more to it than a pap smear when u know your ovulation cycle u know when u can get pregnant and when u dont want to get pregnant and teach our men partners of how we operate in nature beyond their ego needs   time to go back to  nature natural order and law for righteousness not government abortion programs lawless disorder for wicked agendas its time for women to say no im not having sex now becus im ovulating instead of saying im getting an abortion and accept responsibility and be a grown woman about their decision when they change their mind too latenow rape and incest is indifferent and a personal spiritual choice bcus great things also birth through chaos point isstop depending on government to enforce your divine right and know thyself to be your own government in natural order in you power is within like ovulation monitoring
how many of the prolife people have adopted a child from foster care or even been a foster parent  how many have fought for m4a  how many have tried to educate others on contraceptive and abstinence now how many just go out and push their own ideas and beliefs on others when in reality it does not affect their lives any which way if a woman unknown to them has an abortion  its about power and control anynway you slice it  i am an atheist and never have i had the desire to protest at a church or temple it does not affect my life when someone i do not know goes to a church to pray or have service  you say its murder  well what about the wars waged in the name of a god both sides usually think god is on their side   words and empathy will get you farther than violence in most cases
thank god for the people who escort those women those protesters are violent criminals
the good lord is ashamed of the way you treat women
"this is a baby trafficking money making scheme for the christian right amy comey barrett says she wants a supply chain of babies for religious organizations
betsy devos charges 50k per immigrant baby i wonder how much a white baby will fetch christian church makes money and fills declining churches"
we are going to turn into a 3rd world country fast look at red states they take the highest amount from the government and give the least
libs of tiktok is so much betterlol
such holy people  as if they care for  somebody else baby
"white neighborhood  fertility clinic
black neighborhood  abortion clinic"
"the majority of people that get abortions are rich white women they even have their own office hours

idc about the abortion thing thats clearly about the fact white people are going extinct 

white womens pathology makes them do this it stems from having so many rights and having being a protected class for so long now they want to pretend they are upset about being oppressed when in reality its the fact they are learning about their actual minority status globally a resentment of their cut for their participation in white supremacy"
"i have issue with 3rd trimester abortion 
these are babies who can survive  outside the mother
if youre getting a 3rd trimester abortion youve waited way too long"
these people have escaped from a mental institution called church
so hes protesting for his own future salvation wowthese people are nuts
these are the same people that tell colored children at the border america is full we cant help you
guilt the guy is rightyou have to feel guilty forwell just about everythingthats what give them the control over you the world is crapits your fault so get down on your knees and do whatever we want you to doits gods will and only we know what that is
"it is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live as you wish

saint mother theresa"
all these cultists with their imaginary friend as an excuse christian taliban
i guess this is way most people need to have a jobjust so they dont harass others
the is a difference between peaceful protest and verbal  harassment 
dan youre a hero keep it up
how ironic that dan mentioned gods mercy
i thought it was just rich white men that wanted theyre hands in americas wombs
isnt it funny how its so easy to threaten an adults life like they werent children at one point too
protesting is one thing but this is just harassment
there should be an exclusion zone of 500ft for voicing or holding protest and laws to criminalise serial harassment by individuals or groups against people seeking medical care whatever it is personal medical care is private personal and confidential unwanted unsolicited intervention by third parties is not a right its an assault and should be treated as such pure and simple
has anyone changed their minds because of these people
"religionists make me sick  republicansconservatives and the like must be voted out of all levels of government and society immediately  every state everywhere  the garbageobsoleteparty policy positions are irrelevant and useless to humanity in the 21st century  there will be no rs checked off on my ballot  you do the same  there is no right on the right it is antiscience antieducation antireality and on the wrong side of history  in evidentreality religion is psychologicallyculturally toxic fiction that needs to go away immediately  particularly the tribal wargod of abraham  religion is bs  no more tail wagging the dog
lastly if you dont menstruate you dont get to oppose a womans right to an abortion you get to shutpiehole and get out of the way  keep your misogynisticreligious hatefulness to yourselves  life begins when a female decides to allow the fetus to proceed if at any time during the process she decides she no longer wants it for any reason it doesnt begin  period  a woman will not be forced to host an organism against her will  
religion is no solution for the requirements of humanity in the 21st century"
repeats 
america i just dont get it why do you care so much about things that doesnt involve you and isnt any of your business
"i was one of these women accosted in 1998 in madison wi while walking into meriter hospital on west washington ave  see story link below i was 17 nearly 18 and i wont get into specifics of my circumstance as it is a very private matter and now that i am nearly 41 now the way i was treated by these prolife jerks still haunts me to this day

i am furthermore retraumatized now with roe v wade being overturned and is now illegal to obtain an abortion for any reason including rape  incest because the pos scotus chose for me and all women based on a law from 1849  yes 1849  i want to throw up 

 i  am now a  mother of 3 i first became mother in 2003 because i chose to be a mother and the act of her and her siblings conception was consentual  it sickens me that my girls if they become impregnated whether by force or not or simply because they are not ready to have a baby for whatever reason cannot legally have an abortion they in turn will have to travel to mn or il to obtain one

mind your own fucking business because you dont know what these womens stories are and believe you me it is an excruciating decision to make it is heart breaking and for these assholes to try and make women feel guilty is abhorrent
 
this woman a crusader and a protector of women seeking abortion is a super hero
"
what a screwed up country
why the pilgrims came to america in the first place the church was telling them what to do the only way to be a republican is to not understand history also the church loved abortion and referred to it a lot in america in around the birth of our nation they loved them to fight against no joke demonic spawns and their trained midwives did them all the time it wasnt until a man named horatio storer convinced the nation after noticing white protestant birth rates were committing race suicide in the 1850s so he fought to make abortion illegal on the grounds of eugenics and saving the white race then you had the life long racist democrats from the south who voted dem because they thought they fought for the little guy ronald regan saw that and noticed the relation of abortion issues and the south wanting to preserve white nationalism he pushed the gop to appeal to that the moral majority at the same time was making a lot of noise so he thought it appropriate to grab their votes with the abortion stance not the constitution not the founding fathers who loved abortions not doctors the gop and white supremacist
in the now immortal words of the late george carlin rights arent rights if someone can take them away theyre temporary privileges
thank you shelly
why is it the asshole that want abortion rights is always that typical idiot or some bearded trans smh
as creepy as these antiabortion people appear to be its even more creepy for people to support murdering babies
now that guns are legal and abortions are illegal right wingers have to find new causes to continue their grifting
there should be no abortion unless its due to rape or health reasons
people who invoke the name of jesus or allah or whatever far more often than not are up to doing some pretty disgusting things
i can not understand these anti abortion protesters who have so much time and money to travel all over why arent they home taking care of the unwanted children theyve adopted their time could be better spent protesting the horrible foster care systems or doing something for all of the homeless children better healthcare for the children that are already here instead of wasting their time on wanting more kids i just dont get it 
some people have 2 much time on their hands
these people are sick let women make decisions for themselves
they are beter than godnow the think they are god on earth 
joe lets babysit all these others let babysit for the children you save lets do this
i wish i lived there i would counter protest and support the woman walking in
this woman is doing gods work
"people stop trying to convince these antiabortion folks that theyre wrong you are wasting your breath energy time and sanity i doubt even 001 change their minds no matter how many wellarticulated logical arguments are presented to them 

do you know why the guy in this video tells you clearly fear of god these people believe if they dont advocate for right to life and to end the murder then they will literally burn in hell for eternity i mean think about this if you genuinely held those beliefs  and they do  wouldnt you do anything and everything to stop that from happening do you see how pointless it is to continue arguing with these people 

save your energy and breath for a very real path towards legalizing abortion and no thats not to try to change scotus those judges are exactly what i just described but on steroids because they will be praised every day for the rest of their lives for saving the babies and those narcissistic sycophants are eating this up 

so where is your energy most likely to yield actual results the november 2020 elections coming up remember the push in november 2020 well we need that but tenfold we must take over every state every house every office that we can and by a wide margin because you know manchin and sinema  

lets do this when we win we can just ignore the far right for a little while and heal from the madness but only for a little while because you know trump "
i love her so much they should give these women headphones
"shelley mann is alivedoes she know that she is alive and doing this because her mother allowed her to live
and cnn is helping her vileness
i pray no doctor is found as replacement and the clinic closes"
judge not that ye be not judged is way beyond these psychos i wish i could be there when they meet their maker
bless you shelly and everyone who does the work like you these protesters have absolutely no compassion or empathy you have no idea what situation is women are in when they are going into this clinic many of them have babies who are not viable and they need to have the procedure in order to save their life and protect their health its beyond shameful watching people who claim to do the work of god behaving this way
something tells me that most pro choice activists will never have the opportunity to have an abortion
its never been anti abortion always known as pro life
"i am finding it very interesting that all these protesters are so passionate about saving a fetus then they go home and literally eat another females children and drink milk intended for baby calves  dairy cows are repeatedly forcibly impregnated and their babies taken away from them almost immediately  i have seen videos of mother cows who are still cleaning their baby  that they carried for 9 months  get their baby taken from them and thrown into a truck or other vehicle  the cows with udders heavy and dripping milk for their baby will run after their baby but will never see them again because humans want their milk for themselves for cheese and ice cream  male calves are useless to the dairy industry so they are either shot or bludgeoned to death or raised for 4 months and sold as veal  female calves will end up enduring the same fate as their moms  it is truly heartbreaking
  so these protesters are absolute hypocrites unless they are vegan"
religious nuts encouraging and enraging maniacs surely should be against the law
yeah dan lets increase the consanguinity of the gene pool after all deuteronomy 2511 and 2512 right  or was it deuteronomy 255 i cant recall please do enlighten me
religious nut jobs zygotes are not unborn children these people have no idea what the sanctity of life actually mean i wonder what percentage of them have had the courage to adopt a child
"they could open up a lowcost daycare centre if they love children so much
they could run a free breakfast program if they love children so much
they could offer lowcost housing to families if they love children so much
they could fundraise to provide regular nutritious food baskets if they love children so much
but they dont do anything that would actually help children because they dont give a single shit about anyone but themselves"
bless this woman great work
those protesters are such awful humans these escorts are heroes
it should be legal to punch these cowards in the face until they forever sleep
"the unborn are an easy group of people to advocate for they never make demands of you they are morally uncomplicated
unlike the incarcerated addicted or the chronically poor
they dont resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct 
unlike widows they dont ask you to question the patriarchy 
unlike orphans they dont need money education or childcare 
unlike aliens they dont bring all that racial cultural and religious baggage that you dislike 
they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships 
and when they are born you can forget about them because they cease to be unborn 

you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth power 
or privilege without reimagining social structures apologizing or making reparations to anyone

they are in short the perfect people to love if you want to claim to love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe 
prisoners immigrants the sick the poor widows orphans all the groups that are specifically mentioned in the bible they all get thrown under the bus for the unborn 

methodist pastor david barnhart"
as a democratic indian we support women rights and right to abortion laws
imo these religious nuts should be trespassed and pepper sprayed and arrested if they refuse to leave  im not a legal expert but im sure that harassing people who need a medical procedure done violates some law and shouldnt be tolerated like this
all of those christian evangelists are as extreme religious fanatics as isis or alqueda their pastors have contaminated their soulthey create violence and even kill in the name of god god must be ashamed of all of them
whats really crazy is those who feel they have a right to tell you how to live your life according to their belief systemthats a true sickness but is the world of religious fanaticism
i thought third trimester abortions were illegal
women have the right to choose believe me they can do it
well you wont have to creep out on front of these centers anymore cause now they closed 
using their logicif they believe life starts at conceptiongod is the biggest mass murderer in history 1015  of pregnancies end up in miscarriage
"since 1977 at least eleven people have been killed in anti abortion attacks

lets do some math 6070 million people killed by abortion since 1973 minus 11 equals about 6070 million more killings by abortion supporters

lol abortion supporters are so stupid do they even listen to themselves"
shes an angel
these antiabortion people are just frustrated with themselves and want to get rid of their guilt by passing out their selfrighteousness to others
people should never judge women i mean i had three and these people are sick asf i mean get a fucking life
"nikkalynnope no one needs  an abortion overwhelming  majority are selfish lazy irresponsible  immoral childish entitled  twisted deadbeats

if you are ready to have sex and proceed with itthen handle the possible  outcomes of it
alternatives to murdering innocent babies
abstinence 
condoms and or many contraceptives
morning after pill
adoption 
"
i asked a man that was yelling terrible things outside of an abortion clinic why he thought that would help he said how would you feel if i killed your child my child was 4 years old
okay im just going to say it lets just address the elephant in the room the only reason why prolife is such a big thing its because the white population is dwindling thats why these antiabortions are mainly happening in predominantly white states this is a lastditch attempt to up the white population in the united states
11 staff and 63000000 precious little babies were murdered this is hellish
why dont these old white guys get outraged at weapons manufacturers  they clearly dont care what their products do
how many babies have been killed since 1977 millions compared to 11
this physician is a rare breed that kills babies in the third trimester truly a sicko yet cnn portrays him as a hero in this video absolutely disgusting
god endorses abortion and gives instructions on how to preform it in numbers the bible also states that life begins after the fist breath is taken and that happens after birth and the bible also gives less worth to a fetus than a person no where does the bible prohibit denounce or condemn abortion read your bible and stop adding things that dont exist
how do ppl go from mom keep your babywell help you really with nothing more than prayers because lets be honest those ppl aint out here helping these women with longterm resources  to lets just kill the women the physicians and possibly someone near the building that was just wrong placewrong time
so sickening people have serious mental issues stop killing babies
to quote former catholic george carlin they are not prolife they are ant women
if men could become pregnant abortion would be a sacrament
id love to see these people give up their time to support abandoned unwanted children honestlyits so easy to object to something you have no idea what these women are going through dan the clinic protester go and adopt children left behind howard stern said if men could give birth youd find abortion clinics on every street women will suffer big time and thats b4 we even mention the children feeling unwanted because of this dumb stupid law
odd that people who worship god cant handle victims of incest and rape getting an abortion of they want didnt god kill all the first born sons of egypt send a big flood issue the mediterranean apolocypse they be cray in the hypocrisy  mind your own business is right beautiful refreshing that people like you are out there thank you  
"the man that said he hopes when he gets to the pearly gateswhat god will what say well done my good and faithful servant  noooo my bible says judge not it also says he who is without sin cast the first stone and love thy neighbor it also says were all sinners filthy rags so where these people get the idea that there doing gods will from is beyond me  my jesus already died on the cross for my sins and i belive that  he also  gave us 10 commandments to follow and between the  old and new testaments he only asked one 1 thing from all of us and that was to
remember the sabbath day and keep it holy  thats it everything is our choice bc he gave us  free will   he didnt tell us there was a sliding scale on sin  he said we were all born into sin and i believe my god is all knowing  the alpha and omega these self righteous hypocrites gone bust hell wide open   jesus didnt have a problem with mary magdelon and he was the son of god jesus died on the cross for all our sins so when the man in this video gets to the pearly gates  he might hear him say i said it on the cross they know what they do  this guy will be beyond the forgive them father  part
sad  smgdh these self righteous folks are something else"
shelly needs something else to do someone help her
those nuts are always smiling but boy do they turn on a dime and they get very belligerent very quickly
heres an idea  have a family law attorney draw up a template form prenatal adoption contract that women who want an abortion can download and print out before the go to the clinic  the contract should specify that the protestor who offers to adopt the womans baby if she will carry it to term must adopt and care for the child and pay for all future and unknown medical expenses of the child pay for all the womans prenatal care including any and all extraordinary andor lifesaving interventions should the mother experience complications at any time during pregnancy childbirth or in the ninety days postpartum guarantee the womans income if she is unable to work or chooses not to work or is put on bed rest by her doctor during pregnancy pay for all care maintenance and education of the child including college and legally adopt the child with no possibility of return of the child should the burden of raising a child with severe health conditions or disabilities prove too overwhelming for the adoptive parents that they will never interfere with the woman after they take custody of the baby or make financial demands upon her or publish the fact that she is the mother of their legally adopted child and that if the child should die for any reason after the contract is signed including at any time during the pregnancy they will bear the total cost of last illness funereal and burial costs  the prolife protesters who are so eager to adopt the babies of these women seeking abortions can just sign on the dotted line right then and there et voila  they get what they want  the woman will not have the abortion and the protesters will bear the entire personal and financial and social cost of raising said child  the mother will have all of her prenatal care taken care of and be compensated if she needs to quit her job in order to sustain the pregnancy  she will be given any necessary lifesaving medical interventions required if she experiences complications and the adoptive parents will bear the entire financial social and personal cost of the pregnancy and the cost that the woman would ordinarily endure as a result of not having an abortion  then if said prolife protesters suddenly get cold feet when confronted with the very real opportunity of adopting a baby about to be aborted and when confronted with the reality of just how much it will cost them financially and back away from their offer to adopt said baby well the woman can simply say in a very matteroffact manner then shut the f up  and march head held high into the clinic and do what she needs to do to protect her own life health and financial future  also of these la di dah prolife protesters have a very fluffy romanticized donna reed vision of what having a child means  for a woman who already knows that the child she is carrying has anomalies incompatible with life or who cannot take care of the children she already has and whose husband is too much of an oaf to use a condom or have a vasectomy she is the one who knows exactly how much that child will cost her and whether or not she can absorb that cost
you dont have children or are a pedophile probably look them up cause its nobodies busniness
you have a right to your choice and i have a right to mine
jesus f christ  those asswipes need to get off welfare  get themselves a job
the women and the children and their option to choose life do they hear themselves
that walk is the loneliest walk theyre already traumatized by the time they get here i dont think anyone is doing this frivolously
the united states of america so glad im an expat living in europe much better safer place
she is literally doing gods work
this is classic cnn tactics use all the eccentric small town people  to push your agenda by painting a vulgar picture of prolife people
theses guys should protest against guns like m15 killing real alive people instead of wasting their time bothering people who needs help for abortion
pregnancy is 100 preventable
christianity has killed more people than all of the abortions ever performed we should go protest church services
let us help you so aggressive violent and heartless
yeah how does he explain necessary medical abortions 
dan needs to go save some on the living children ones on the street starving ones abuse homeless
"they said this doctor performs abortions during the third trimester how despicable i understand there are times when a baby dies to save a womans life but this isnt considered abortion the baby is already dead
 killing a baby that is that developed because you change your mind murder
that is why when you kill a pregnant mother you are charged with double murder it is a life and they have a right to live you dont want a babyclose your legs you have that choice"
yet not justifying taking a life but then for what are you saving if theres a person who has a baby and give it up to a foster home
not sure it was such a good idea to interview this doctor and put his face in this video
you can at least attempt to loose weight 
they talk about god but if you believe in god then you should know that he can do his job and dont need you people doing it he is god you are a human leave people alone
the old man who hopes his maker will be there for him will have a rude awakening live your own life and let others live theirs as they see fit
hope dans maker holds him responsible for every woman who is murdered by anti abortion bans
cant stand listening to men talk about having abortions they have no business even talking about it i cant stop them from thinking about it but i can say they shouldnt be talking about it no uterus means no valid opinion
i hope they are all certified foster parents who prove how much they love kids that need care oh wait nope huge crisis there these people care about cell sacks not children
run over the protesters like they run over us when we protest easy peasy
of course most of it is men but all are crazy
now that roe v wade has been overturned it should become illegal for men to leave pregnant women  if women cant back out of becoming a parent men shouldnt be able to either
their right to choose life whos forcing anyone not to
its none of these people business women have the right to make their own decisions about their bodies
only 50 bucks for an assault wow i paid more for a parking ticket what a system we have
idiots is nobodys business if you so against it are willing support them financially
protesters take abortion is a violation yet they have no problem violating other peoples rights
his penis   no longer works  why is he there and did he take care of his kids does he have kids
when my kids were little they were horrified by those signs that f ass men and pud stew kneelers sickening and disgusting hope youre all sent to hell
i wonder when we will stop letting rural americans ruin everything  i say now
ask these people how many unwanted children they have adopted
lol tell me what ill remember i remember the love safety and appreciation i felt for my dad when he took me to get an abortion as a teen he saved my future and i wouldnt have ever been able to have my beautiful daughter that i chose as an adult to have so i dont remember the abortion very well never met any fetus i remember the relief
i saw this video many years ago she is great god bless her strength
how are you gonna be pro life and go out and kill others
judgemental power tripping white men
i love this queen power to her and the women of our country   down with power tripping entitled creeps 
what is happening in the supreme court is really scary why do they think its okay to take away the rights of women over their life and body and i personally dont like adoration but i have no rights over another humans life choices period and to protest this with violence is utterly stupid
whats going on in the states is really scary they are going backwards the supreme court is a joke now reverse a lot more then just abortion
do these same people protest the nra  to save actual live kids
"how long will the protests help for 18 years will they support them financially will they babysit or pay for their child support will they provide medical assistance etc etc etc

getting them to keep the baby is the easy step the next many many years are the toughest steps"
these protesters violate a persons right to privacy gross
they claim to want to protect life but she had to look for bombs or anything that might kill or hurt the patients or the staff wtf
this doesnt make me side with abortionist if anything it make me see how many people feel the way i do these people are not evil
was that doctor really murdered though or was it just considered a late term abortion
i like how this lady is trying to lighten up the situation  like just relax people this is a comedy bits and pieces psh the lady is living her life in a vaccuml
i like how this lady is trying to lighten up the situation  like just relax people this is a comedy bits and pieces psh the lady is living her life in a vaccum
i like how this lady is trying to lighten up the situation  like just relax people this is a comedy bits and pieces psh the lady is living her life in a vacuum 
there is no maker sorry
make ourselves usefull go feed the hungry or something like that stop harassing people
like for real the usa is honestly a 3rd world country at this point
truly lifethreatening work    this ladies the next margaret sanger eugenics am i right whoops thats not the word i meant i meant to say inspiring
the land of the free  and the indoctrinated ignorants on the evangelical evil cult
what are these antiabortion protesters doing for children that have already been born  its easy to stand there pray and tell someone they are doing something wrong in their opinion  do they volunteer at orphanages or something
bet not a one of these people have helped or adopted a needy child
loser media and losers follow it
"bombs and deadly violence  because life is precious 
you know that nobody can take religious nutheads serious because of doublestandards like that"
these same fools are all claiming unemployment or living off the state because they dedicate their lives to harassing women
these people really have nothing better to do  i know an old grandpa is not there telling us women what to do which our bodies remember you dont know everybodys stories
i think people should mind their own business and care about others a bit more but in a kind compassionate way not like yelling heads
somebody should ask the anti abortion protesters to write a check for a 100000 dollars for each child they want to save  sign papers that they will support the child until 21  include college education
some people need to be admired
this makes me wanna have an abortion immediately
the catholic woman doesnt realize it but said it best she wants the women to have the right to choose life well that means that they have a choice to choose the other path as well the path of righteousness is not righteous if forced without the consequence of choice theres only bitterness in obligation religious people are absolutely backwards
"standing outside of an abortion clinic  
dude you are weeks too late 
if you want to make a difference walk into bars at night patrol campuses and spread the message of 
 males please act like men
 guys treat every woman with respect
 take responsibility for each and every action
 get a vasectomy
 there is no honour in creating a fatherless child
 do want the title of that bastards daddy 

if you have testicles please try to grow some balls "
nothing says pro life like harassing living people and threatening them 
they need to post a guard at all 4 corners armed with ak 47s and a fence let them drive in the gate and close it and leave those entitled busybodies on the outside of it the nerve of these people to think they have the right to  interject themselves into a strangers family planning decisions these are the same people who then turn around and talk about and penalize mothers who cant take care of the children and have to go on welfare they dont want their tax dollars to go to them when the pro life crowd clear out all the orphanages and unwanted neglected kids in foster care then come talk to me until then they need to stfu and mind their business
prayer doesnt work ask them if you can adopt the babies
if these portestors cared about children why arent they adopting them from foster care the system is full of them why not donate half of their check to the poor to help children those hypocrites would never do that i commend shelly for helping poor women
men need to stfu women beyond bearing age thats another issue but men have no skin in the game and its just ridiculous
the we will by you a bag of diapers and a can of formal crowd is no better than the we want your unborn baby but not the ones currently waiting for adoption bunch a few meager hand out then youre on your own  medical bills  food clothing  daycare well you dregs of society need to pull yourself up by your boot straps
all these well adopt your baby folk are shallow we dont want used kids hypocrites there are tens of thousands of kids waiting for adoption in america alone not to mention hundreds of thousands to millions worldwide but they want the new puppy not those at the pound
you need sports moms out there yelling over the protester azzholes
"the issue is that these antiabortion people believe with all their hearts they are in the right and they are defending babies  with that in mind you can see how it can escalate to violence especially if they already have some other stresses or mental imbalance
i honestly wish they had something better to do with their lives than harassing strangers and offering prayers"
cnn ladies and gentlemen what great example of framing
and might i add how brave those women are especially in todays hate driven climate they are literally risking their lives to protect their fellow woman i applaud you all truly
people with nothing better to do harassing people that is terrible 
you need protection
the part where they have to escort the women to the stairs made me cry the fear and shame they must feel that never should be republicans are one step closer to getting the theocracy theyve always longed for if we dont get off our butts and put these traitors in their place like this woman then we can kiss our democracy goodbye
jesus would be ashamed of these folks blessed are the meek they hall inherit the earth
"why do some people feel they have the right  power  duty  whatever madness drives them to impose their will  way of life onto other people who are just passing by
they would hate it if i stood outside their house and tried to do the same to them
also its not the way of christianity at all if thats the mode of living they are suggesting that they follow and that we all should  disingenuous dangerous fanatics 
the escorts are wonderful people do superb work and will become more and more important

me what about helping with caring for a child who was forcefully born wuth health issues that remove any chance at quality of life after a female child is raped and impregnated how is it helping her by making her have the child"
dang what a hero for freedom and the rights of wemon to control their own bodies
where was god for the raped and abuse woman and children
we will provide everything to child murderers
were here to help   except after the baby is born then we just dont give a fuck  if only these people cared about kids from 018 helped moms with child care help assure that the born kids have access to healthcare so hypocritical
ill keep my laws off your body when you keep your hands off my paycheck  make killing infants legal cool i dont care less toxic in the world without your narcissistic entitled kids growing up however make getting everything free from my hard work illegal
hey all old men and a few deranged old women
killing people to prove how pro life they are is insane
creepy guys harassing females
shes like a putupon school yard monitor tired of kids antics she knows their names calling them out every day
these folks are past baby age abortion is not their problem when our system addresses poverty mental health and a plethora of issues that most trumplicansrepublicans and lets not forget the nationalist wont support social programs to address these issues its too expensive and they made their bed ah self righteous conservative geezus believers gotta love em idiots that they are
white people are strange on so many levels
these people are so many levels of disgusting
how these people think they have the right to enforce their morals on anybody is beyond me then theyll blow up a clinic whilst screaming murders
"these men who have the nerve to stand there and judge these women

if you cant give birth to children you should keep your mouth shut "
i wonder how much money they donate to orphans if they really care about babies i hope they are donate their entire social security
yep engaging in population control is murder protesting population control is justified murder we should ask these selfrighteous god fearing people how many guns they have
what about the victims of gun violence
these people remind so mich of gilead its scary
"these religious extremists need to myob  if youre antiabortiondont get one but stop imposing your self righteous views on everyone else 
they treat adult human beings  abusively  then talk about the sanctity of lifebut only if youre a zygote or an embryo 
theyre 100 hypocrites"
and i am sure they fed up with you
the self entitlement of these protestors over another womans body is what sickens me the most its how many of these demented people there are is what disturbs me entirely they all think theyre out there doing gods will but simultaneously dehumanizing women for their right to choose fucking paradoxical oxymoron politicized bull shit youtube please  forgive my language
crazy to think that in 2022 america this is what were faced with cant wait until time machines are invented and all those people can go back to 1900 where they belong
these people should actually go talk to rape victims and ask them how they feel when they got pregnant and had to go get an abortion or ones that didnt have a choice and they have to have a rapist baby
go home old man
"these people are mentally unstable  its not helping its not moral its pathetic its harassment theyre grossly confused about life and who needs their help
losers they protest while real kids could use a mentor  but maybe its good these prolife nutcases arent around kids
when i meet my maker  hes going to hell"
screaming at women who exercise their health choices but too cowardly to have her name broadcast  prolifer hypocrisy in a nutshell
dont these fools have jobs these people are sick
protesting to be able to murder babies its insane they chant  my body my choice_ its simple ladies keep your legs together and you wont get pregnant
the best part is if you go to the local strip club on wednesday night i bet you see all these guys hitting on a 19yearold girl the irony
1 of abortions child murder is due to rape or childbirth problems abortion is genocide of infants and everyone that supports it will be rememberd as evil and bizarre
cnn is fake news and abortion should be illegal
"ironic that republicans apparently care for an unborn foetus but dont give a shit once it is born

said child can be shot and killed whilst at school

but nra donations matter more"
i do not agree with abortion of babies but i dont necessarily disagree and special cases like rpeor babies being born with hv or any stuffing of any kind for the babys because its not fair to them at allbut its just my opinion but its not for me to judge the most high god will do thatsooo vary sad if you feel like this is your only option 
no more using abortions for birth control  have to start practicing safe sex
" this was the comedic relief i needed after watching the hearings absolutely not nobody asked you get em
shelly lol"
she is a badass
why are some people all ways in other people business they should worry about there ownbody not die one else body they got the nerve to be talking about god well guess what god give us free will only he can judge so some people just need to stay out of people business 
its probirth not prolife once the fetus takes its first breath their concern for its health and welfare  disappears almost immediately
people do know why woman abort theyve been fed with the lie that their babies are not human they are just an inconvenience to 78 of woman who abort if youre going to support abortion do it bravery dont lie and tell it like it is for these women and inconvenience if youre willing to have unprotected sex be responsible enough to face the consequences and dont run like the coward who kill a child that cant defend himself
hipocracy is amazing complaints about killing of 11 people since 1977 when during the same time about 50 million babies has also been killed no theyre not rubbery fetus rubber fetus dont move their heart doesnt beat dont growdont move to love to millions of women who develop the deepest love for their babies
trolling used to perfection well done
when my girlfriend decided to get an abortion i remember coming out of the clinic with her afterwards and some a hole was holding a sign up of a baby in pieces  she didnt need to see that these people are voicing their opinions according to what they believe doesnt seem on the same level at all pro choice protesters can be pretty brutal as well  just saying to be fair and not hypocritical why would cnn even air this 
you are amazing thank you thank you thank you for being there in the hardest moments in a pregnant womans life thank you for standing in the line of fire making those distractions and being that strength of reassurance so she can make it inside safely giving some honor to her after shes made the hardest decision of her life thank you isnt even close to the praise you deserve for all you do for these women already in such incredible pain
what a beautiful person she is very very well done
someone get that lady a bullhorn
were not animals nor your slaves you can not control us woman
thank you for what you do
bless you
what about the children thats already born being killed in a place of learning they dont give a damn  about that i believe a person should have a  right to do what they want with their bodies i dont see these them a protest at the nra headquarters about the mass gun violence in america one born they are just an image and is not protected there are a lot of children in the united states  that are hungry and malnourished they have did everything to cut funds to help with  that part land of the free for who that is my question
must be so hard to deal with so many nut jobs every day good karma for this woman
"testimony of an abortion doctor 
"
wait theyre pro life but want to kill people that literally makes no sense
politically incorrect private investigator
idgaf wat nobody say abortion wrong just like legalize gay marriage is wrong bt     i dnt believe protesting that shit dnt wrk look wat malcolm x dr king an so many did that protest bs dnt  work
its men omg of course
"there are over 400000 children in foster care  go take care of them
there are children being massacred by gun toting 2nd amendment freaks
once you take care of that situation then maybe yes maybe you will be considered prolife"
i would like to know how many of those anti abortion protestors are adopting children
what a great woman you are my hero
the guy that said hes been in this movement since 73 is almost absolutely an outright liar  the prolife movement wasnt formed until the late 70s  early 80s with frank schaeffers propaganda films
they help till the fetus develops into a baby then is born then theyre no where to be found
dont think shes gonna have to worry about having an abortion any time soon lol
abortion needs to be between a woman and her doctor safely and needs to be protected by hipaa laws its sucks we have  these clinics where these women get harassed instead of going to their own doctors office
lol bombs planted by prolife people lmao
is this a repost
i wish someone wouldve been more vocal to me to change my mind so many years ago
somebody please tell these men this issue doesnt concern them i can not believe a man would go to a womens health clinic and yell at the patients can women have one area where men dont get to yell at us i dont care what these guys do with their penises
third trimester abortion unbelievable
telling someone else that she is beautiful and will miss her baby is wrong  the only person who is derogatory is her  the only one being aggressive is her  those people are trying to save a life  this woman wants to ensure that multiple ones are taken and shes not funny  its really gross that she is that arrogant and indifferent and acting like shes above it all  no bombings attacks and murder should not happen to anyone protesting or working there but the people being shown are innocently trying to sway someone in to making a different decision  they have every right to do so  she could potentially bring negative reactions upon herself by trying to provoke people like she has in these videos  she is on the offensive not defensive in this video
"i hate the contrast that its eitheror like black and white and pretending that there are no better solutions to these issues 
how about better care for our children how about explaining to them not just about condoms but about the consequences of unprotected sex 
how about providing free contraceptives specifically iuds and vasectomies 
how about advocating against hookup onenight stand culture 
there is a lot we can do to reduce abortions if society would care collectively not some biblical nonsense and not some feminist my body my choice crackhead both of you are wrong on how you approach this subject"
they say they are prolife but you have to check for bombs
3rd trimester abortion is disgusting what made her wait that long to do abortion in third trimester can abortion clinics provide free iuds especially to repeated clients
looks like shes out of a job now probably didnt see that coming
"shelly is fantastic as are the others who are there to help these women 
the world needs more of them"
notice these zeolites are all from  trump based poorly educated  red states
isnt this a vice story lol cnn just copy and pasted the video and slapped their logo on it
interesting how yall dont give this much attention and sensationalism to all the prolife clinics and government buildings that are under attack by prochoice mobs its almost like yall are trying to push a certain narrative while suppressing literal terrorism in the name of tolerance of course  
radical evangelical christian nut jobs
what about the half million kids in shitty residential treatment centers how are u helping them
i dont believe that 90 percent of abortions performed are due to rape and incest its done because the women dont want to be inconvenienced with having to raise a kid
this woman is really disgusting and just a little fyi millions of babies have been murdered because of abortion
whats even better being broadcasted on tik tok are all the videos i see of liberals trashing capitol buildings all over country spraying spray paint attacking civilians u are such sweet innocent ppl arent you lmao
time to tax all churches
why are the penis put there its none of their business
im just curious and i may be wrong but how many children has dan adopted and raised and supported by himself without any state or government assistance has anybody asked dan this question yet if not someone needs to tell danny he aint got a dog in the fight he needs to take some of them babies home and take care of them that he loves so much and that are so beautiful and it are so wanted by everybody tell dan to take him home take care of them
whats with the rainbow umbrella
big fucking dealthese people need to be dealt with better than that
11 people have murder what about the 63 million preborn people that have been murder in these places what doesnt cnn do a special on that
i just dont recall seeing this when trump was messing up our country but all of a sudden they care now but didnt care enough to wear a mask to protect children gtfoh trump supporters u are clowns
putting their faces on tik tok without their consent is illegal but you are actually advertising them so this is a benefit for them
tic toc steals your info for china they own it
creepy ignorant busy bodies that feel that need to push their uneducated beliefs on the rest of the world
god will send him straight to hell
my favorite part about tik tok is how cool it is
you are so shameful shelly advocating for murder may god have mercy on you one day you will have to answer for it we all will be judged
supreme court  we own your hoohoos
much respect to her those christofascists need to piss off
one brave and just woman  proud of you
enough peace and patience already its been done and look where we are we need the goons with the blammers we gotta exercise our 2nd amendment bird call  
where are these protesters when the children need food on their table  when the mothers cant afford child care  a b s e n t
these women who can do this job to help kill unborn babies are evil and its worst than vettechs putting 100200 animals down each day  in michigan 78  african american women population are responsible for over 50 of the abortions made yearly  nation wide over 1 million babies being killed each year and having my tax money go to this evil dead is wrong if women want to abort a pregnancy there are herbs and such things that they would use 2k years ago  why have a doctor rip it out  of you piece by piece and use your fetal tissue cells to make vaccines
a true angel keep up the great work
"such a vast contrast between the antiabortion protestors demeanor and the proabortion 

antiwar so much nicer calmer  nonthreatening reasonablehoping to give someone a bit of realization and see their true value  and the pro wow screaming hateful threatening cussing attacking people 

and the clinic attacks that occurred decades ago are not the norm and do not occur like the pro are all over the country"
i want to know the psychological reasons these people are so against someone else who is making choices for themselves and their bodies its a fascist ideology to want to control over others their bodies and thier life decisions
i cant imagine how creepy it must be to hear some random middleaged dude calling you mom or mommy my heart goes out to those patients and their escorts
the young lady who escorts patients  is very brave
"seem to be a lot of weird people with nothing better to do
wonder if theyd be so excited about black or mexican women my guess is no"
classic poster of a democrat loser overweight and a human being killer
were here to help you but wont disclose her name
i find it funny that all of these proforcedbirth people automatically assume that the fetus wants to be born regardless of any circumstances  the fetus could be deaf blind and limbless and these idiots would say it wants to be born  i honestly question why anyone would want to be born right now  we have hyperpolarization of politics worst in the us but to a lesser extent worldwide that is getting worse not better steady removal of rights in the us wealth disparity in the us resulting in increased homelessness and inability to afford food notinfrequent school shootings in the us russias war against ukraine which is impacting the entire world russias threats of nuclear war against the entire world climate change that is literally making the world unlivable and this little thing called sarscov2 that people pretend has gone away but hasnt  only a masochist or a sadist would actually want to be born into this wold right now
woe is them what will they do with their time now that roe v wade is overturned
religion cannot dictate human rights
the only people being rude are the abortion clinic workers lol
it doesnt seem like the people are being mean or even rude theyre telling them that theres another option whats wrong with choosing life
i went there for birth control once and was swarmed by crazy women who wanted to adopt my baby i didnt have yet they wouldnt listen to me or let me leave just kept ranting on and on about how much they love babies was is creepy
many more babies are going to die without this rulingisnt that the point isnt it ironic that the very topic of death as it relates to the life bearer when life receiver are intertwined and at one point the life bearer was the life receiver you see the communist democratic part of the us cant see the santity of human life so they desensitize and segregate the life that is inside this is all part of secular humanism which is satanism
the prolife movement is not really a prolife movement the are just probirth because once the baby is born they could not give a shit about the child they are not pro expanding welfare benefits for poor people or single moms they are not pro public education and free college education they are not pro universal healthcare once the baby is born youre own your own and dont be a moocher they are even for raped little girls the product of incest having the baby they are disgusting really
she is great but whats with those creepy old men telling women what to do
christian facist
shelly needs to be careful there is crazy people out there
what a evil woman
love this woman
abortion facilitators were one children its wrong to commit violence against them vid since 1977 11 people were killed in abortion attacks   also since 1977 over  59603131  babies have been aborted in the us  according to guttmacher institute
so ending the lives of babies is more important than lets say correcting the wrongs of the past like reparations
"funny not one of the protesters were berating or violent or broke windows or spray painted threats there was no profanity or shaming going on yet the clinic workers acted like they were threatened by a 70 year old man who never raised his voice 

moral of this story is that if you support abortion you are free to destroy private property threaten supreme court justices and even attempt to end their lives but if you dont support abortion you cant calmly stand outside a clinic and say anything without being treated as a threat 

for liberals you can only have free speech if you agree with the liberal opinion all others must be silenced in the name of free speech freedom of speech is freedom to speak

for liberals you can only have democracy when every votes liberal if you dont your vote shouldnt count or you should be silenced this is liberal democracy its like racism for politics people that arent like you arent real people theyre more like 35 of a person sound familiar 

read your history books the democratic party supported slavery the republican party was created to fight slavery republicans voted a black man to congress decades before democrats did its right there for you to read now theyre calling republicans the racists 

oh and did you get the part where this doctor performed third trimester abortions thats when the baby kicks and moves around thats when they can be born and still survive outside the womb 

does that mean that all of these late term abortions were life threatening to the mother if that were the case shouldnt we find out why thats happening how many of these late term abortions are because of a change of heart 

so murder is when you take a clump of cells that made its way out of the womb born and cut it into pieces  even if it were just out of the womb a few seconds 

cut up that same clump of cells   a few minutes  prior and you are praised for performing an abortion this is the position of the liberals"
what is this escort acting like a victim as she victimized women and babies
people complain about why kill a beautiful life if it can become the next world changer or life is gods gift but they are in denial of the bigger picture the fetus is aborted for a reason if it is horned into the world without decent care wouldnt they actually hurting the world and the baby more like it he irony of it prolife but support weapons that easily kill life like
nobody asked any of these busybodies their opinion  the woman yelling we will help you  name the list of the children this woman has raised and helped  how many is she up to
"i am pro choice 4 choices specifically
1 abstinence
2 contraception
3 motherhood
4 adoption
i just cant support the 5th murder"
she shouldnt have a problem im mean who would want to shag that anyway
just hire a sniper to kneecap each protester enough bs that one guy said he was doing this since 1973  since when is it even legal to harass people for 50 years 
so an anti abortionist who believes in human life is willing to take life
"just watch the day im republicans will do nothing to create programs to support these poor women going through hell i cant stand liars and hypocrites more than any other kind of people in this world so no i dont like very many politicians if any  i dont agree with the policies of someone like liz cheney but i would vote for her over many others just because of her integrity 
the pendulum always swings to the extremes the backlash that will happen from all this alt rightwing bullshit will completely change the country thank god
imagine if lincoln had lived its highly likely we would not be facing civil war part 2 what i dont understand is i thought everybody watched star wars and star trek if they did they would have recognized the orange headed orangutan is emperor palpatine"
when youre a judgemental bigot who delusionalally believes you are doing gods will you dont have to try and put yourself in the other persons shoes  its literally one o the easiest things for the inhumane to do
abortion is murderby definition it is killing an infant human being inside the womb
"its truly a sad day in our country im a disabled dude im here because of women women were the trailblazers from the women right to votecivil rights actwomens reproductive rightsdisabilities rights act  lbgqti rights 
im hoping to wake up and say oh thank goodness it was just a horrible nightmare 

from human rights  corporations attacking movies we lovethis is a sad day hopin its all one horrible nightmare"
not to mention the consequences like mental illnessthat can imply having a child you dont want bcuz of whatever reason the child can be given to the grandparents or pass on to whoever the mother thinks is suitable to take care of the child except for her the child will grow with so much anger resentment or grow up to be successful who knows is all correlated
also these protesters have been brainwashed by a bible that is not accurate they are reading scriptures and twisting them to fit their narrative  and interpreting what they want its so sad because they dont even know they are and therefore are not interested in learning if you do not listen you will never learn a lot of these people think they know everything about it
these anti abortion lunatics are incredibly hypocritical they claim to care so much about life that they get up early every morning to harass women for their choices instead of getting up every morning to actually help people in need like the homeless women and children all over america why dont they expend their energy helping humans who actually need help instead of attempting to force their fake religious beliefs down the throats of women who dont believe in their ideologies
so why dont clinics have a pickupdrop off spot near the clinic maybe a block or two away change the pickupdropoff spot regularly  have a vehicle waiting offer the ladies ear plugs drive each lady right up to the front door of the clinic then do the same afterwards why are these women forced to walk in front of the protesters
children without healthcare or good schools or food are more of a concern than abortion
ha ha abortion clinic escort hasnt an abortion clinic to escort anyone to anymore 
prayers do not cover rent prayers dont buy food prayers dont provide transportation for a child prayers do not raise a child the choice should always be up to a woman to decide whats best and that may include prayers however the prayer cult harassment needs to stop
if you are performing abortions in the third trimester you arent a champion for womens rights you are a killer of a viable baby  you want an abortion get it in the first trimester
cnn reposting old contact 
thank you shelly
i have one question for all of them are you willing to become a foster parent to take care of these children when the parent dont want them the answer is nooooo  this is something that is between them in the man above or who ever you believe in not your business
by day carrying a anti abortion signnow is is giggling with anticipation as he tries to be a rapist by night
so all these people think they are better than the god they claim to worshipgod is pro abortion he told his priests how to perform abortions on the wives of jealous husbands
abortion is a big deal these days as the world turns but what i cannot yet figure out is why the women dont just practice birthcontrol with medical pills and procedures instead of using abortions as the only way one is wisely preventative and the other is foolishly applied cruelty to the babies and the baby lovers who have to hear see and know of the horrors not to forget that the godbelieving loving people are horrified at this unnecessary belated solution of an unwanted human pregnancy some of the animal rights people are more humane then these abortionthumpers there are many parents that are begging for the opportunity to adopt a baby all the while they are being flushed down the proverbial toilet and what a shame to lose them to the abortioncults how many times have we hoped for beneficial help for the planet only to have that talent aborted before it came to exist mature and do its planned repairaid maybe einstein nicola tesla or george washington should have been aborted
love how the anti abortion people are old or people who arent having sex anyway
well if they care so much wont they offer to adopt
and its so funny to me  that all those men protesting
whats the big deal about abortion who wants to have sex with this man haters look fat and look like a guy my question is what guy wants this females
this is the reason that christians suck they get 1 trillion worth of tax breaks every 12 years thats fucked up its time to end tax exempt status for fake christian churches separation of church and state my ass christians are authoritarian fascists they are complicit in violence against women
"are the same people who fought tireless to ban abortions going to fight tirelessly for food stamps school breakfast programs  after school activities and stricter child support laws

or are they going to say  move on to banning birth control then gay rights and revert back to the 50s where black people cant vote  woman have little say and maybe kids can work in sweat shops for pennies"
walking you to the clinic is not help if youre gonna end up killing children its funny how the  same rainbow colors that cant make babies due to choice wanna kill our children truly misery loves company just terrible
yeah because killing babies is a great thing to do  you people are sick  i use to be prochoice until they went to far  no one should be able to get an abortion after 12 weeks  keep it sane people
we shouldnt be pandering to those that believe in the supernatural
"looking at america from the outside i dont understand two things
why are some constitutional rights ok to overturn such as the 14th  regarding abortions
while others will get your death threats if you even casually mention it  2nd  guns 

the next question is  when will the united states stop pretending it doesnt mix church with state when there are very clear undeniable examples of it  such as the overturning of roe v wade"
story as told by women who were not aborted
i usually just flip them off
lets be real you have a lot of nasty people out there that have unprotected sex everyday and basically gets abortions every 2 weeks those are the ones that are upset 
all you bible thumpers out there demanding people live your way remember this god made humans with the ability to choose god wants humans to choose to live hisher way not force people to live that way if that is what heshe wanted to force humans to live hisher way god would have made it that way and it would have been written in the bible you are supposed to share the word of god not forcibly make people listen and follow the word of god you can choose to live gods way or choose to live the way as god put it of the world 
i have never seen these people standing outside of the wic office or medicaid for all this help they claim they provide such bs
god guive the life from every  pearson in this planet and he guive one the most inportant horders to the hiuman  people from this world and say on god 10 commandaments you shall not kill you shall not murder never kill no one not even to the ones are ready to come to this world y pray god for some idea to help whit this and it come to my mine by the word of the holy spirit the we have to build abortion clinics but no to kill a bebe its going to be a clinic to adop to recive those babes the ones their mothers not want them dont kill no babies they  creatures of god and wamen from the whole world god say you shall not kill and killing baby by ovortion its the dor for hell built avortion clinics to have those babys growing up lee them anjoy the life if dont want them le this babys to be the nex science the nex teacher the next doctor the nex inportant person in this planet whit auth his parents but whit the most presios gift from god to whole man and woman in the whle planet eart the gift to be a live amen
obnoxious people being bolstered by an obnoxious corrupt media company
at least they arent burning clinics down 
14mil subscribers haha yea right maybe at best 125k with about 10k actually watching videos or news cnn youre garbage for keeping this left vs right crap going while your suckers get priced out of survival
what a hero she escorts women to a place where babies are killed  yes
and how much money have all of these people given to the health n care of the born children n moms    put your money were your mouth is this is a heart breaking act for any woman  im
im glad to see what real americans look like
"abortion protesters are out of their minds
whay arent you protesting the right to life outside gunshops"
im with her
stupid churchies how many adopt or assist raising the unwanted embryos
she can only do her work because she  was not killed by abortion  how about some selfrealization  sweetheart  do you escort the dead babies out the door after the abortions
these prolifers aka nazis are out of there effin minds 
"since 1977 at least 11 people have been killed 
how about the millions of children that has been murdered"
im pro choice but i respect the protesters god bless them for fighting for what they believe in it is powerful to hear them call out hey mom good and honorable work by the escorts too zulu
do it youre awesome
these are sad depressing times   
thank you for protecting women making their own decisions
i would ask how many children these ppl have adopted how much child support they pay to the women they have kept away from clinics   funny how they use god and the bible   the bible advocates to abort a pregnancy just for the suspicion of adultery
where they are known dont withhold names  video of the selfrighteous is not enough name names
old white guy telling women what to do great
"so women of compromised pregnancies 
heres another angle women if you
are compromised think of all the dna
lawsuits to claim support payments
and more so claims to property
inheritances etc perhaps this
invasion of your property and rights
can be turned into lemonade more
so hold those forceful lords
accountable and expose them this could go so far"
white old men who couldnt even purchase a sandwich let alone foster one of these babies
this is all religions fault these people are so blinded by it they feel they have the obligation fuck that will they finance the newborn will they care after afterward doubt it
hand them adoption applications or ask them to donate to help women who cant afford to take care of their children put your money where your mouth is people if you dont want abortion as a choice then you need to provide an appropriate alternative that solves the issues that may lead to that choice rather than deny a womans basic human right to sovereignty over her own body
they should open a mental health clinic next to every abortion clinic so they can help antiabortionists with their neuroses
first of all it baffling how we allowed the antichoice movement to seemingly create the abortion narrative  the vast majority of these people are probirth not prolife additionally they have proven time and time that they couldnt get less about the women who are pregnant they only care about the fetus the majority of those who are probirth arent that concerned with what happens to the child after it has been  delivered
instead men  who dont have any part in the carrying of babies to go through that ordeal n most of the times its their male partner insist to dem having the abortion women are secondary citizens to men they are our life companion the side of the coin antiabortionist dont really care about children if they did they would supporting the childrens at orphanage that really need their love n support
until people start confronting these rightwing bullies in mass this move to the ultraright will continue they dont want a functioning democracy
"for those people using their bibles as an excuse for this monstrous decision to take away womens 14th amendment rights how about you actually read the damn things

life begins at birth with the first breath  genisis 27

fetuses are not persons  exodus 21 2225

fetuses should be aborted as proof of adultery  numbers  5  11  31

life is not sacred the soul is  deuteronomy 28 18  24"
lol these old men that cant have children tell other people what to do i just cant lmfao
so dis man thinks he has the right to tell women wat they can with their bodies wat kind of misogyny crap is dis no 1 stops a from getting vasectomy but here they telling women not to we men of no place in women issues period y dont they invest their time n money  at orphanage if they care so much about children show women dat if they ave d babies dat they will have a support system
if i was a dr id take that target off his back
unless youre going to adopt every child in foster care shut up my family does foster care and they system is overburdened and flawed its necessary but not optimal none of these potential children are alive if you consider that its not considered a live birth until the air sacs in the lungs expand how long until im sentenced for discarding tampons
even worse than what happens outside the abortion clinics is what happens inside all you woman need to watch an abortion its absolutely disgusting  cnn loves to race bait but they wont tell you when eugenicist william gates sr bill gates pops financed and helped start planned parenthood he located 90  of them within walking distance of a minority community mostly black neighborhoods and this was done strategically out of every 1000 black babies are born  450 are aborted blacks make up 13 of the population and account for 40 of the abortions cnn always has an agenda  propaganda all day every day divide and conquer and order out of chaos are there motos
some of those anti abortion people really make a case for abortion
if you dont like abortion dont have one
their focus is self righteousness and telling other people what to do according to their beliefs  dan is a twerp  and how many of these people contribute financially every month for years to these unborn children  this is basically an attempt to punish women for having sex particularly if thomas has his way and eliminates birth control
"in the same time the court rule in two cases 
first case you do not have control over my gun
second case i have control over your body you do not have control over your body
this is why the christian democrats dont want christian hypocrite to rule this country so we do not go to the stone age like iran afghanistanetc

the history of abortion laws in america

the power to make a decision about the women right in the usa is held in the hand of only 6 christian hypocrite maybe we need to correct our system by learning from europe because they are ahead of us 
 
religious community members talk god and abortion

warren buffett on tribal behavior

"the dominionist court imposing dominionist christianity upon us all against our will the great raping of america 

because to the right wing authoritarians dead women are always acceptable collateral damage to their theocratic ends"
their right to choose  right out of the anti abortion protestors mouth  you prefer they choose lifegreat but its their choice  the theocratic scotus is making that much more difficult  enforcing church rule in the us will lead to violence  the us is suppose to be a country where youre free to choose  removing that freedom is removing the soul of this country  you can hate it but its not your choice what others do  you choose to stand outside and harrass peoplegreat  leave the rest of the world alone
keep it up girl its our right
these people could give a damn for live children
what about protesting against fire arms to protect children
the lady actually said their focus is for the women and the children and right to choose life i want an abortion so they will do everything they can to prevent me from getting an abortion got it thanks
cristofascist are making our democracy disappear
republicans are true hypocrites of the century prolife while as well antiguns control they are more eager to protect unborn so that they can kill them with guns when they go to school or shopping mall so the foetus are more worth to die when they are grown instead or what are their conscience in all this nonsense can they be so uproaring against guns as they are about abortion rights theyre really blood thirsty to see more adults death than foetus bloodsuckers republicans calling themselves christians
good for this brave young woman these people have no right to impose  their limited belief system they are not even aware they are pawns in the struggle of greed and control by the extremist facist fake christian taliban
how many babies have these old men who feel they have to guilt trip women who they dont know or care about
no man had a right to question a womans right to her body men need to just shut up and leave the female issues to a female
ask them for child support
"talk about a life with meaning and meaningful work i would walk with you if i could and if i lived there i would do everything i could to be hired so that i could work alongside you bless you because we all know that these people couldnt care less about these zygotes referring to first trimester procedures the arrogance of these old white men shown here thinking that they should have any say whatsoever in what happens to the bodies of women they dont even know and dont care about and would rather see die they dont know if they were raped the women they address who are walking in they dont know if they have some health condition which would result in pregnancy making their life a risk look i was on the pill at 19 took it 100 perfectly and still got pregnant yes im one of those whom my doctor calls the superfertile and i i just been dumped by the babys father because i was pregnant and he wasnt done having fun we were both in college full time living in the dorms and i was also working 30 hours a week in addition to maintaining a 40 average i did a lot of thinking after getting over my initial shock wondering how this happened when i was absolutely on point with my daily pill taking if i hadnt been able to get an abortionwhich still took me several years to emotionally heal from because ive always wanted to be a mother and of course im a mother now but back then i was just not in a position to be able to be a fulltime mom and theres no other kind of mom i would ever want to be wh atim trying to say is if a woman chooses abortionand im even disgusted that i have to defend this in the first place there should be no discussionabout this in the first place this is a medical and health decision that can be made by one person and one person only because only one person would have to carry a pregnancy and give birth and go through all of that and only one person is going to be caring for and raising that child forever dont even for a minute think its just 18 years cuz thats a laugh and anybody whos the parent of a child older than that knows it

i would tell those old white guys if they would be 100 on board with me decidinga woman they dont know and will never knowif they should have a vasectomy or not or whether if theyve had one it should be reversed or not 

so what i want to know ison  a scale of 10 lol how would they like me making those decisions for them"
hey anti abortion protesters god hates hags have fun in hell
are they not protesting without a permitwhy are they not arrested
"theyre just trolls who get off on their self righteousness 
hey religious people your religion is like a penis you can be proud of having one but unless someone asks about it keep it to yourself"
i bet youre not reporting on the proabortionist rioters who attacked state capitols in vt and az the pregnancy centers fire bombed vandalized and burned crickets
these morons are disturbing customers lock their asses up fi e them charge them throw them off the property they are nuts
i love her is that enough have you had enough of feeling righteous today 
lets assume for the sake of this conversation that god and jesus is real a lot of these conservatives and pro life people are going to be mighty damn surprised to find that theyre not getting into heaven because none of these people actually follow the teachings of jesus
thank god  for the supreme court   what could be more violent than abortion 
these jerks are publicly harassing people why are the cops not doing their jobs it is a crime to threaten harass or in anyway to imped the rights of another  if i walked up to people going in or coming out of a church and said  you people are crazy you people are totally insane morons to believe that nonsense does anyone really believe i would nit be arrestedin minutes whats the difference
"jesus started a ministry that caters to the free will of the unbelievers 
read the 10th chapter of matthew christians were commanded to shake off the dust off of their feet when they were not welcomed but never to interfere in the rights of others read it yourselves
no where in the bible does it say we must interfere with what others are doing that comes from satan"
its fine with me for anyone to have their religious beliefs but confronting anyone that does not share that conviction is just wrong if you do not know that person and their situation you cannot judge leave them alone this conduct is exactly why people are leaving churches in droves there is no human connection you are just condemned if you do not fall in line with the brainwashing program do not dare to question or your left wing trash
"christians were comanded to mind their own business and these are fake christians and busibobies in others affairs
the bible condenms both of these actions
christians are suposed to obey gods commandments
revelation 2211"
yes im pro choice as a man i have no right telling a woman what she can do with her body i just wanna ask the anti choice people what have you done for unfortunate children you only seem to care while the the woman goes thru the pregnancy process once that child is out the womb you give no fucks what happens this is also another reason i do not follow no religion the best and worst people in world history have followed the same book or books and came to separate conclusions i dont have time for some ancient writing that when people saw thunder and lightning believed some god was raining hell on them i simply treat people how i would like to be treated
you know these anti abortion people could better spend their time volunteering helping poor children by reading to them playing with them telling them stories this way their own lives will be remembered instead of being remembered for screaming at another person which is better
need some girl going in with a few very overly protective italian brothers im sure they would escort those protesters off the lot
"i just have to wonder what women are thinking that need an abortion do they not know they had unprotected sex and thats how babies are made
 with the morning after pill why is there even a need for abortions
get caught up in the moment stop in at the pharmacy and dont wait and seejust seems to not be very responsible to wait and have to go through this terrible procedure"
love that clinic escort lady bet none of those pro life people donate a dime to fund those unwanted babies pro life hypocrites
i wish these protesters would put all their energy and time into things that would lower the demand for abortion instead of harassing people who already need one  they could work to promote sex education that includes education about contraception and consent  they could work to make contraception more available  they could lobby for better health care childcare and an increase in welfare and disability to make it easier for women who want to have children to do so  if these people sincerely believe abortion is murder why wouldnt they work on lowering the demand for abortions so that less women need them in the first place  this seriously lowers their credibility
jesus would absolutely hate dan
just dont call them prolifers
dear shelley i admire you so much and have your back i live in amsterdam so cannot help you in person but i send love and want you to be safe take care
it seems ironic that those folks that dont bat an eye at an unborn child being killed is ok but dont want to face the same fate if you chose death for someone helpless should you not be treated like a slug also 
they dont have to actually do anything or spend anything they just judge and feel self righteous they are whats wrong with our country
this is so dumb if abortion is that important to them why dont the democrats propose an amendment to add to the constitution protecting abortion rights they have had 50 years to do it if it matters so much but they didnt make it constitutional if you want the supreme court to deem it constitutional all this wahala you guys are giving the wrong people why arent you giving this hell to the democrats for not coming up with legislation to defend this socalled right scotus did their job simple so ask your democratic representatives to finish the job they have been stalling on for 50 years
praying for this woman these people who are out spreading gods truth and love are needed more of us need to speak out against the truth of abortion we are all image bearers of god and life in the womb is exactly thatlife
how many of these protesters adopt kids take in foster kids be a big brother sister take in kids who age out of the system i bet none
if all the women who arewill be pregnant carry to term and put that child up for adoption will all these protestors adopt all these extra children currently there are estimated 117000 children waiting to be adopted those children are already here weve all heardread the horror stories of foster care lets take care of the kids who need us before adding to the population of abandoned children
ironic the the death count is higher from the prolife side
they are shells of human beings useful idiots being used as political pawns in the lust for power
privileged pos the protesters that is
suprise suprise they are all religious fanatics trying to push the christian  version of sharia law  these people should be locked up
"i request zelensky  or president  putin or any christian in the world  to always think  these abcde and fs in your life  for a great future 
god bless you
logic of  joy or peace in life is very lies in a very moral knowledge of  life style
thats as below
everytime or every moment  or always when you do not love   careful that someone watches you  the world  eyes flesh lusts and pride 
you have lot of 
peace 
courage
a gods children have no fear of death  
but we will not die unless it is gods willgreat peace  in times of diseases or fearful journnies in life battle 
b we shouldnt be worrying about anything a lot because everything works together for good for those who love god  marriage or death  or any good or humiliation or a great permanent honour
c we must sacrifice our life at least for our children
the world is not  life  to us 
imagine will a father be happy if he gets some privileges but not his children  
never 
so something if you dont get 
or something dangerous happens to you deliberately is for good 
because we live for a fellow christians or a christian family and children and overall for the  kingdom of god in earth  government
d we must know that
our heart  is filled with fear and guilty conscience for many reasons
1 for not following according to 1 john 216
2 our unbelief  jesus could not do many miracles because of their harden heart and unbelief
3 our blind eye  we dont avoid or cut our relationship with a bad christian towards a bad companionship
e if fod doesnt comfort tou with a bible verse we can not keep it as our possession
invite shames to you  before you  expecting a miracle we forget brotherhood and prayers  god will be glorified amongst brothers and church 
so tell your problems to the congregations medias people or governments but miracle is gods  in any situation what we can do we must should do it  never expect god to do what you should do honour god respect god 
but life is god 
for example 
lazarus death 
the news reached jesus  this means to prayer  and brotherhood 
rolling down of the stone take away the stone  take off the grave clothes john gospel chapter 1139 and 45 
untie the bandages
for example
we got some shops in the middle of a city here 
but managing to keep it with respect as a owner is very difficult
but god comforted me with a verse 1 corinthians 131
this shops to us are from our hindu ancestors so though god is helping us to keep it but we get lot of insults 
every time when i get a problem i pray god and go according to his counsel
29 so that no one may boast before himbg 30 it is because of him that you are in christ jesusbh who has become for us wisdom from godthat is our righteousnessbi holinessbj and redemptionbk 31 therefore as it is written let the one who boasts boast in the lorddbl
so what 1 john 216 
says about not to love 
lusts of the eyes  because people or enemies watch it make it a issue as sin this we must be careful everytime at home and outside holy it means do not love sights do not turn back and see do not listen to what they speak even
lusts of flesh 
pride of life  insults
you must know that there are temptations common to all men  paul to corinthians about sins of israelites in wilderness
f 
never forget alk are sinners
ecclesiastes 7
g always know ba face our life is eternal
not in this earth
but here too god can raise honour your head

finally brothers whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirableif anything is excellent or praiseworthythink about such things
"
amazing that adults have nothing better to do with their time than work towards enslavement of women
you are a blessing  shelly  thank you for what you do
"us americans see abortion like abraham in the bible killing his child
in reality it is a tough and emotional decision by a woman to terminate a pregnancy which at this stage is just a tiny lump of cells
they forget that nature what they call god is the 1 pregnancy terminator"
that doctor is one sick puppy anyone who does this is one evil bastard 3rd trimester abortions are straight up murder why cant you acknowledge this this is what really gets people upset unbelievable
that doctor seems like he is having difficulty focusing at age 80 it should be illegal for doctors at age 80 to do life threatening procedures
nice of her to show how out of touch these people are and how to confront them without being aggressive especially when its old white men telling others what to do
please tell me how it is a good thing to kill your offspring twisted
why is it ok for pro abortion people to say what they want but not pro life
biden and his administration do nothing to fix this  remember that when voting  we have been bamboozled
"jesus  im watching from australia    
 i admire this ladys work so much she is amazing      
but those crazed religious meth zombies hanging around need to be repelled    

civil war in usa is closer than ever"
prayer doesnt pay for childraising do these holy rollers walk the walk or do they just talk the talk i wonder how many of these protesters have adopted any children
now more unwanted children will be placed in the foster care system
"psalm 1391317
13 you made all the delicate inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mothers womb
14 thank you for making me so wonderfully complex
your workmanship is marveloushow well i know it
15 you watched me as i was being formed in utter seclusion as i was woven together in the dark of the womb
16 you saw me before i was born
every day of my life was recorded in your book every moment was laid out
before a single day had passed
17 how precious are your thoughts about me o god"
seriously jackoffs for jesus
you ever notice the people against abortion should have been aborted
you know those hospitals and fire stations where you can drop off unwanted babies they are going to be swamped i hope they can handle it
imagine being forced to have a child you didnt want and that child end up being owned by the government and raised in  a foster prison
it cost what i read at minimum 10k to just deliver a baby in the us  correct me if im wrong i mean if you want to deliver here a baby in the hospital without medical urgently you pay 350 euro so maybe there it should already start there is no reason why a normal delivery without any issues have to cost 10k
how far the moral compass have shifted when aidding murder is celebrated and discouraging one is jeered and mocked
much love and support for this brave woman
heroes come in all shapes  colors god is the only judge of us and even he is forgiving  compassionate leave that final word to the almighty free will is for each  all of us these women that help other women  men facilitate such a very hard  painful decision are heroes
shelley and dr carhart are treasures they must be protected from these nutjobs at all costs
is like a cult i have never seen anything like this is so backwards and uncivilized seriously how many developed countries in the western world still bans abortion you wonder why the us got completely slammed by even their allies such as uk spain canada and so forth this is year 2022 not the 1950s and certainly not the 1850s and do you know what countries does the us sit right along side with now when it comes to abortion lets see abkhazia afghanistan andorra bangladesh dominican republic el salvador honduras nicaragua just to name a few a pretty esteemed list huh it would be a complete joke only if it was funny but it isnt people have no idea how far this has set the united states back wait until those 5 farright extremist justices ban samesex marriage and contraceptive then they are really going all the way back to the dark ages
someone should start a website exposing republicans who pay for their girlfriends and mistresses to get abortions
religion the great con of man
i did not see any beautiful gifts amongst any of those people she captured on video
lol are they all old crusty white dudes
i actually die laughing when i happen to drive by that stuff
is cnn still broadcasting  they must be trying to keep thier 500 viewers great work cnn by the way have you heard about hunter biden and his money connections to the pathetic president   thats not news to you  but you  could tell us what color shirt trump is wearing today  like most americans we cant understand why you are even still on cable  you suck
por lifers who want you dead that almost as hypocritical as the catholic church itself
antiquated thinking usa one of the most dangerous places to live
"jesus is the way the truth and the life yes to gun control end abortion

human rights and climate change
end corruption crimes drug cartel and terrorism

god bless evangelicals god bless conservative party"
why cant people respect that god gave us all free will
abortion is wrong killing babies is wrong women celebrating abortions are crazy
abortion is the only medical surgery that insurers at least one patient will die
yall ought to ask dan how many kids hes adopted just emotionally abusing women trying to do the toughest thing theyll ever do is performance art god sees their horseshit
thats makes sense  anti abortion protestors use violence and guns and bonds to kill others  these people are two faced
yep id rather listen to a doctor that went through these procedures and how it actually is killing babies and went to congress explaining what they do why he  quit and how horrendous it is then hearing some typical fat sjw give a opinion
must be nice to not have to work and pay bills
people think they own gods word they do not know what god would do if on earth buy using their own interpretation is wrong for all judgement day is each individual day of facing our savior not protesters
no one has a right to choose life except for god nobody
"human cant protect their children in their wormso the govt help them
why dont we abort these people who support abortion"
how about you go and stop the bombing of crisis pregnancy centers no you dont care about that you only care about the ones who interfere with your belief who are actually just being friendly and speaking instead of bombing
god bless these people who are trying their best to save the lives of babies i obviously dont agree with the violence against the the babykilling clinics but changing giving the act of babykilling the name of reproductive healthcare is extremely deceptive and evil the innocent person who is being killed isnt given the choice to live also im not religious in the least bit i actually kinda despise religion i just believe in god and i hate the murdering of babies i wish abortions were completely overturned and made illegal nationwide
yet they see no problem with 19 uvalde kids having no freedoms anymore
those disgusting orange clown cult members are terrorizing all those woman
get in my way protesters   and its you who wont be a le to bear kids
"vote blue if you stand 
for woman rights 
to save our kids from getting kill by gunshots 
to save our constitution 
to save our democracy 
to save unions 
to save social security 
to save medicare 
against greedy corporationsthe need to pay taxes
again racists republican billionairesthey need to pay taxes
vote blue millennials"
i love how people who are prolife are planting bombs shooting these workers and assaulting these women shows how this has nothing to do with life and everything to do with controlling women i commend the abortion workers for standing up to these zealots
why does this protesters not think about all the children who will not be born becouse of lack of unplanned babys no mother will let their doughters out of the house without having the pill and older women will also make sure not to get pregnant if they dont really  want a child
life does not begin with conception nor does it end with dearh by abortion or death after living life to age 70 years or more i feel empathy for ignorant christians who are thoroughly confused between lifesoul and lifeless body which is nothing more than dust to dust and ahses to ashes all you have to do is read bhagvad gita a so called hindu religion text but really is a vedic religioneternal religion text titled as the song of god would i support abortion no but i would definitely not judge ye shall not judge others as theirchristians book says others who are compelled to make tha choice for whatever reason i would rather spend life time workiong on issues like poverty rape and incest etc so that nobody have to make the choice of aborting a baby from the womb pl join in liberating women
maybe get a nice tall fence 
mind your own effing business old man
"if i had the money i would provide tall walls around the clinics 
and provide large opaque shields
ans sink money into research on artificial wombs that would take so much pressure off women who cant take care of a child 
i know it wouldnt do much for those whose fetus had passed "
the word says that god has mercy on those of us who have mercy for others
"unfortunately every child is not wanted are these antiabortion republicans willing to adopt all the babies some with severe deformities or pay for the funerals of women whose pregnancy killed them that women are forced to carry now that the supreme court thinks they can rule womens bodies with their overturn of roe vs wade yeah didnt think so if republicans were so concerned with childrenwhy were they ripping children from their parents at the border when incompetent trump was president i look forward to your answer republican bible thumpers thank you
ps not everyone believes in your religion i thought we were supposed to have the right to our own beliefsreligious or nonreligious quit trying to shove your beliefs down peoples throats"
"margaret sanger was the founder of plan parenthood 
margaret sanger and i quote said 
we do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members
personally i dont support eugenics of certain ethnic groups let alone someone who had ties with the kkk
do your research and learn there true colors and agendas"
im in boston where we had the shootings at two clinics in 1994 that left two people dead and so many traumatized i worked at planned parenthood years later where the protesters included a man dressed like a priest whod throw himself on the ground and scream momeeeeeeeeee all day long we could hear him clearly through the thick bulletproof glass and his screaming was joined by many others whod be outside all day as well the escorts were tireless and endured terrible insults and face to face confrontations my job was public health researchrelated and i didnt work in the clinic level but experienced the same harassment whenever i left the building it always left me jarred and worried that maybe one day someone would show up armed and dangerous i cant imagine what it was like for clinic patients to come in on those days they included people terminating pregnancies but also those getting medical care and sometimes those patients getting abortions were protesters who happened to have unplanned pregnancies the hypocrisy of proforced pregnancy supporters is revolting are they really going to save babies are they truly going to take care of them their entire lives do they support social services for women who are too poor to raise a child or who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest fuck that shit overturning roe has darkened this already damaged country and is leading the way for other human rights to be taken away for those who are prochoice keep fighting the good fight and for those who arent please consider the complexities of unplanned pregnancies with their rippling effects as well as the rights that are now very much at risk
what is going to be the consequence of an unwanted pregnancy on the mans part it does take a man to make a woman pregnant so he should be paying the same price to walk away from the woman and not want the baby or the responsibility and shes forced to keep it
cant these women give up their baby for adoption
touche  thank you for being there  
trump cult are pro birth for a vote but are not pro life after kids get killed in school them and the nra go out and celebrate how much money they made up the bullets and the gun
abortion is wrong because it has no happy ending
she doing
the anti abortionists are not pro life  they are pro violence and hatefulness  forcing every fetus to term is just mean spirited cruelty to women their families and society in general  they will have to answer to god for their unwarranted malice
my mom had an abortion it saved her life and five years later she was able to have me if that abortion hadnt happened if she hadnt been able to get professional help neither she or i would be here
i agree that abortion is wrong but why doesnt people protest against guns
if their is a chosen one up their in space somewhere i doubt think he or she cares a hoot about all u religious nutcases plus i dont think he or she or whatever that so called god of yours would approve of all u idiots thinking you should control a womens decision on her own body so you people need to mind your own damn business and basically piss off
"well help you

really will you help financially will you help pay for their hospital bills will you help them raise their child 

why is it so easy for christians to demonize women is that what your bible tells you to do"
america is no to abortion 
true american heroes both the doctor and the the young woman escort
"its a 5050 scernio 
50 of women want abortions and 50 dont believe in it and otherwise u wouldnt be here today on cnns youtube channel "
try using a ball bat next time
this woman needs to get a life
how many unwanted children have dan or any of those clowns adopted antiabortion protesters clearly get off on live trolling vulnerable women
this lady is awesome
absolutely stupid people saying they are protecting life when they go in and shoot them omg how effing ridiculous
"does this woman need any money and where do i send it and how does she recruit
if your religion needs a police force laws and a prison system then maybe theres something wrong with your ignorant and disgusting religion"
between you too the one mocking is at lost
how many children did dan adopt if none than he can shut up
my 80 year old mother who voted for biden and absolutely hates trump cried when i told her that roe was overturned she said she thought shed never see the day she said she thought that roe was the biggest mistake ever made
these whacko protesters should mind their own business
abortion opponents you really have a special mentality  over there
seeing that guy break out the ladder cracked me up a little bit
pro life doesnt means antiabortionit means we all have the right to live
all those old men should be followed home
the consequences are a joke
i mean why do these people only think about themselves their rights and freedoms and stop caring about life after a baby is born what happened to the mass hysteria around wearing a simple mask on their face to protect others or getting vaccinated or or or reasonable gun control
this escort  is a degenerate   buffalo
infanticide insurrectionists are attacking our democracy theyre bombing pregnancy centers rioting at the vermont statehouse and threatening supreme court justices one was arrested trying to murder justice bret kavanaugh will you hold these violent insurrectionist thugs  to the same standard as the january 6th protesters if not youre hypocritical anti democracy domestic terrorists
both sides are losers
she needs federal protection  a true humanistworking against the threat of death every day  she is so much stronger than any uvalde police officer
11 physicians and escorts killed and what happens outside these clinics how diabolical there have been literally millions of babies murdered in those butcheries hardly a comparison
"somehow cnn missed the violent pro abortion riots going on in major cities 
almost like they have an agenda to keep you childless and earning money for thier corporate overlords"
abortion is not something to be used as birth control keep your legs closed or get fixed if you dont want to have children wonder how these people who are for abortions would feel if they were asked  if their mothers had a late term abortion with them  and they were survivors of that abortion  ended up having mental or physical repercussions of that decision their mothers made would feel dont think theyd like it too much if they did have the mental or physical abnormalities to live with for the rest of their lives
abortion is murderwonder how these people who are for abortions would feel if they were asked  if their mothers had a late term abortion with them  and they were survivors of that abortion  ended up having mental or physical repercussions of that decision their mothers made would feel dont think theyd like it too much if they did have the mental or physical abnormalities to live with for the rest of their lives
wow theyre going to be protesting about this for a while
they had 50 years to kill innocent babies because of irresponsibly opening their legs now its time to save future presidents doctors engineers etc
okay these republican protesters are starting to give violent and crazy thats why they want the gun laws to be the way they are so they can just go out there and choose who they want to kill based on who they like or who they agree with and thats crazy so im ready for you im going to stand my ground its like you do but you walk up on me you come in my property im going to blow your f head off you guys got to understand you need to turn it down go see a doctor because youre mentally ill all of you stop protesting like this its not doing any good because youre basically you say you care about life but you want to kill somebody and punish somebody for based on what they do with their lives that makes no sense youre just as guilty as them and honestly theyre not guilty what they do with their body is theyre right you need to go home and do what you need to do stop inflicting pain on the world because you wake up with an epiphany and want to change the world how you see fit based on some republicans protest like i give the f about what you feel about how you think religion should be it has nothing to do with me and killing people because they dont agree with you is called psycho thats what you are
had she been aborted as a baby she wouldnt have been an escort of baby murderers
they will insist that religion is harmless millions of scramble brained morons who do whatever they are told and attack in any direction they are pointed that is the point of religion
"its funny 
why are there men protesting abortion
i have never heard of any man giving birth to a child
america is strange"
so were not going to talk about all these white women calling the black supreme court justice a monkey and all type of names now white women know how it feels to be oppressed im the words of dave chappell come on white woman you were in on the heist you just dont want to get burnt while your white man want to stick seeds in you the black community will be fixing our homes and wealth and no longer voting blue till reparations are received
funny yall keep reuploading this slow news day cnn
imagine america being a first world country is still sitting on its women talk about freedom and democracy  what about gun control laws
shelly mann is a bad ass nothing but peace  understanding to her  all woman who want their right to choose fuk scotus  impeach the 6 catholics 
you know why i love australia because these blokes get arrested for harassment the police come and take them firmly away protecting the rights of women to choose
the liberal left can loot and riot all they want and someone tries to save babies and somehow thats wrong
not today larry
the next generation will be wondering if their parents really wanted them or if they were a forced birth
dan told us the truth his truth anyways these people think theyre scoring brownie points with their god really sick they think harassing woman who are already making hard choices regarding their lives and their futures is going to impress their imaginary friend
im 80 i dont need to do abortions anymore thats right your days of profiting from killing innocent babies is almost over then when you draw your last breath time to pay the piper you people call it karma christians call it sowing and reaping and deal you will
all i hear is a message of love from the protesters
if you support abortion you will have a special escort when you reach the other side maybe the soul of a baby you helped to kill
antiwomen nutcases are some of the most distasteful people in america theyre not christian theyre hate mongers
women who support women in this way are heroes thank you to all the countless clinic escorts
why didnt she broadcast the nuts who scream at prolifers
"woah shes really nice to the women going in to end the life or potential of their unborn baby but super passive aggressive against the protesters

also why is she checking for bombs its the opposite side thats usually using destruction and violence against womens health clinics"
the maga supremacist court is out to get you we have been threatened by the rabid blackandwhite supremacist clarence aka ginni who gloatingly informed us that abortion rights were just its first target the maga supreme court shall strip away other civil rights asap by abusing the constitution possibly inciting a civil war
if abortion is so great why would they need support walking to have it done so its horrible if the woman dies but not horrible if her baby dies
"planned parenthood is so much more than just abortions  they help with regular preventative carethey caught my cancer thanks to a routine pap smear they also do hormones for pre and menapausal women   too bad so many people are ignorant about their services radical violent people need mental health care
let us hope the rest of the world continues to value womens healthcare and rights and does not listen to what is happening in the usa  all my european and aussie friends think the usa has lost it  thank god their countries are not going back to the 1950s like the usa"
abortion is murder but dont harass these poor delusional women
abortion are painful to babies during the process it is a mercy less feeling for the victim they really feel the pain before they die like some discarded trash but they can try again but not with the person who aborted them any members of that persons family ether
when you see a demon in the flesh you never know its a demon this white woman is demon who comes in the name of rights
the fact that a majority of them are men 
and the brains of the americans after smoking marijuana apparently did not remain at all the ban on abortions will lead to an increase in the death rate of women and to the birth of disabled children with down syndrome аligaphrenics and simply children with physical disabilities and this is the degeneration of the nation the down syndrome test one blood test is done at 1013 weeks the analysis reveals over 80 of fetuses with down syndrome the name of the test is based on three proteins that are tested in the mothers blood free estriol alphafetoprotein and bhcg it is advisable to do such an analysis at the end of the 16th week of pregnancy
the deciding justices have ignored fundamental civil rights guaranteed by our constitution and years of judicial precedent to advance a politically partisan agenda there is no denying the fact that this is a direct attack on all women and black women stand to be disproportionately impacted by the courts egregious assault on basic human rights we must all stand up to have our voices heard in order to protect our nation from the further degradation of civil rights protections we have worked so hard to secure we the people who cares about abortion and gay rights need to register and mobilize voters in what will be the most critical midterm election america has ever faced if youre not registered to vote or know someone who isnt now is the moment this is no time for anyone to sit on the sidelines now is the time for all current and former dems politicians celebrity allies business owners and organizations to hold rallies and townhall meetings every weekends in poor white latino black and asians rural counties to educate voters on how dems policies are improving their livelihood this will help get dems voters motivate to vote in 2022 so dems can keep control of the us house and win a super majority in the us senate with 61 dems senators this is the only way for dems to pass meaningful police and criminal justice reforms voting rights comprehensive immigration economy abortion gay rights and gun control
why is it that the women in the pro life group are way more attractive than the unhappy toxic screeching sjws who dont need to worry about pregnancy anyway
so lets firebomb churches and terrorize the rest of society because you didnt get your way
"give religious zealots an inch and they inevitably take societies back into bronze age ignorance look at iran at saudi arabia at america

tax the churches"
today christian rights are like sharia rights
"46 focus is women  children  
what about the women  children after birth do these supporters follow them for the next 18 years 
to be sure they are safe from dv children in foster care that are being abused raped assaulted"
delusional religious selfrighteous mentally ill beliefs 
religion poisons everything
that shelly is so courageous  i would stand by you if i were close to that area and try to convince those brainwashed idiots why they are wrong
look like a bunch of creepy pedophiles lamenting over lost opportunity
amazes me people want to enforce there beliefs on others
fake news another example of jessie smollet level false flag acting cnn is notorious for this especially during hurricanes where anderson cooper pretends to be blown around in waist deep flood water actually on his knees while passers by walk normally past in ankle deep puddles
none of the people standing outside of that clinic screaming their religious doctrine at women trying to get access to medical services actually help any of the women who go to that clinic theyre just there to yell at you and make you feel morally inferior theyre wasting away their retirement on yelling at strangers thinking its going to get them into heaven so weird and so pathetic
i wonder how many of these protesters have adopted a child offered to be of any help  service or support to the women or single moms instead of threatening judging  condemning i mean
who else feels like this was reposted
shes a horrible human being for bullying prolifers
this woman is crazy confused girl
just keep your legs together if you dont want a child because thats the first step in creating one everyone knows this but so many ignore it and take it out on the childi had my child at 30 years old when i was financially ready so i know its not difficult
why do people care soo much about people killing their unborn babies  no one is going to loss anything the only person whos is going to face the results of the abortion is the one who choose to do it   people should do whatever they want 
i dont think men should have a say in any of this unless so the woman wont have to get an abortion they should claim the baby as their own  raise the baby clothes the baby feed the baby send the baby to school  you men just shut up  you have no say in any of this
way to go shelley i follow you on tiktok you are amazing
as a pregnant man i find this attack on mens rights very distressful
everyone is rightwe love the kids born and unbornbut that woman has a choice with her bodyi lost a child to abortion  was marriedgot her pregnant and had a son afterwards soi had no choice in the matterwas told she miscarriedshe lied im missing a kid that was spawned in my lefttesti cal wheres my right just like fathers day dad gets a stiffy
stay strong shelley
yet she needs to watch the liberal abortion lovers attack the arizona capital building she had one small group that she met and they were very peaceful to the ugliness put out by those in arizona
why get pregnant  in the first place when you have many choices of contraceptives to use and not be pregnant so that abortion wont become a choice
yep my husband and his buddy had to escort me into planned parenthood to get my monthly order of the pill  they noted that there were always old freakin men blocking the way  so these two big dudes one lookin like the viking king the other the shorter spanish musketeerfacing off with a crazy old man
what kind of mental gymnastics must one master to arrive at the conclusion that the best way to be prolife is to kll someone
makes u wonder if these scumbags hve ever protested over gun violence police brutality unfair health care high medication prices domestic abuse closures of schools church abuse ect my moneys on no 
why would they put a bomb out lmao their trying to save innocent babies lives
they are doing the lords work praise god for overturning the murder of babies
"well help you  so youll help the mother with the costs of raising the child or provide the legal fees for the mother to hire a lawyer to get away from an abusive so who raped her 2 months prior and caused conception  or provide a home and food for a mother who will lose her job because shes pregnant a job she desperately needs to look after herself and other children

for a movement that prides itself on being driven by xtian principles it sure doesnt act like what the jesusmyth taught"
be diligent and constant to the work of the lord knowing that what we do in the lord is not in vain  1 corinthians 1558
will you take my baby after its born and pay for its health care home care and special needs
shelly is a horrible person  to be proud of killing babies is absolutely sick
"since you got rid of roe v wade we need a few things
"
feeling immense gratitude for these dedicated people willing to risk their own lives for their patients this brought me to tears you are brave beyond words thank you for telling your story
what a joke its the pro choice that are clueless nut jobs nice propaganda cnn keep to what your good at i guess
prolifers bomb and kill already living people the irony is beyond belief
is it really that hard to use a condom take a birth control pill or tell the guy your spreading your legs for to just pull out there are a plethora of ways to prevent pregnancys if you are to stupid to take basic precautions then you should deal with the consequences of slutting it up instead you want to murder unborn children because you wont take any personal responsibility
im confused  if prochoice protestors can scream and harass people and threaten their lives these people also are able to peacefully protest  i wouldnt do it but they have the right  and they are not threatening to kill people like others are currently who dont agree with them
i can care less if woman die from trying to kill their baby if your willing to go that far to murder your own little person you created by choice then you deserve the consequences keep drinking that koolaid its clearly a satanic ritual and satan loves nothing more then to prevent life
you dont know their stories either you just know they came and you hope theyll appreciate your agreement that their babies should die pure feels
have fun women now you know what its like to be a man in court powerless
i have always wanted to do this ironically i live in omaha
if liberalscommunists and demoncrats are so interested in democracy and as they always say they are the majority why are they afraid to let democracy work ie let the people vote on it state by state
these pro choice people will pay a heavy price one day
prolifers killing people smh
didnt god like rape a minor and then lateterm abort him
glad they banned it
"looser escort youre abating murdering babies  
how sad "
with guns being the 1 cause of death for children youd think all these prolifers would be at schools when in session barricading entry points
she is such a brave and caring person  these people can be so vicious  i tried doing this for awhile but couldnt take the hate and nastiness that these socalled christians spew  i was a teenager before roe was passed which was hell on all women  after roe passed these people repeatedly and violently attacked the medical personnel with bombs and guns  injured or killed many  some christians
six corrupt supreme court judges trampling on our rights remove clarence thomas kavanaugh gorsuch coneybarrett alito robertsall liars perjurors all corrupt  forcing their popey churchy hypocritical beliefs on us   churches must pay taxes
this woman is a prime example of adopting a pseudo moralistic stance on an issue in order to look good to her friends while hiding the problems in her own life
"new idea for tshirts can capitalize on both sides of the fence on the abortion protest 

on the front of the tshirt put
its my body leave it alone on the backside of the tshirt have a picture of an ultrasound of a babies fetus saying yes its my body leave it alone"
the constitution does not protect abortion
why doesnt this socalled report mention the morethan60 million american babies lost to abortion since 1973
she is so strong
how is abortion essential when taking responsibility for your sexual behavior would take it unnecessaryand if not then live with the consequences of your _choices_ like millions of men have to do every day
we just want the right to rip our babies out of our wombs at 9 months what is wrong with you people
men have every right to ensure that women behave responsibly men have every right to control female behavior i feel like this point is completely lost on the prochoice crowd its weird
imagine being a baby murderer always using the straw man of womens health saying this when over 92 of abortions are because of inconvenience
a bomb why would an anti abortionist want to bomb a client full of people about to kill there babies if thats what they are protesting pro life means love for life
repost imagine trying to defend the murder of an unborn child disgusting
this woman is assisting in torture and murder of innocent babies and passing it off as helping god sees everything and he will have justice
why doesnt somebody explain to these godspouting antiabortionists that actually and logically god himself obviously approves of abortion doesnt he himself bring about the death of one in every four fetuses in the womb in whats called a miscarriage andor stillbirth
"039 i think abortion is so terribly wrong i have a responsibility to be here
apparently his responsibility ends after birth then the responsibility is on someone else anyone else but him
seems to me that a lot of these antiabortion protesters are doing it to make themselves feel good  in the hopes of getting into gods good graces"
were so prolife were willing to kill people were so prolife we dont care if the mom dies as long as she carries her shame baby there is that sanity
if these protesters really want to help all these pregnant woman then perhaps they should be contacting their representatives in government to reduce the cost of reproductive health care because its doing most pregnant women no help by forcing them to give birth and then having to spend 10000 plus just to give birth if childbirth was free or much more affordable then so many pregnant women wouldnt get an abortion
wow crazy god loving evil people killing doctors and nurses became a woman decides what to do with her own body
american need to stop protesting for abortion rights  the united states needs more unwanted desperate people being born and joining their militarystopping abortions is the best recruiting tool
are these children being validated when its the 13 years old dads father when fathers are sleeping with their children  where is the 13 years old rights whos protecting her
if trump was still president they would start impeachment for this
i love this lady you know they might of overturned roe vs wade but you cannot stop  women having abortions
she treats that man like a toddler lol because he is
pathetic bottom feeders
they dont care about the babies the babies could be born into bad situations if they truly care about babies they should give each 1 2million to raise that child for the next 18 years
his guiltis being white 
thank you god bless you and protect you
communism is healthcare soviet psychiatry biden budget proposal darpa tax the richcorporations
thank you
are these protesters going to take care of the babies that cannot be financially or emotionally supported maybe they should be trying to protect women from rape and incest by strengthening the laws and holding men responsible and also making sure that women receive adequate child support for the children that are already born
hopefully someone hits that target on his back
she is a special person for sure
nobody asked you i love it go home guy and manage your own life
the only place she could be an escort lol no chance of her getting pregnant show how abortions are done large needle stuck into the brain baby turned around and yanked out by its feet might make you think twice its painful and barbaric
"thanks for your help you are appreciated
im glad you are unable to remain silent we are being pushed around by a vocal minority who have no respect for anyones rights instead trying to shove their ideas down the throats of the majority 
religious organizations indoctrinate their members to believe they are right and everyone should believe as they do without question personally i believe all churches are cults and should be banned or at the very least lose their tax exempt status  throughout history more people have been killed in the name of god than in all of the wars put together"
a zygote isnt a child its a single celled organism a fertilized egg isnt an unborn baby and terminating a pregnancy isnt murder why are we being subjected to the whims and imagined moral authority of religious zealots
"1who cares if she is fed  up they are trying to stop an unborn baby from being brutishly killed
2 they are presenting women with an alternate choice
3 the antiabortion protesters are not a danger to anyone
4 since 1977 millions of unborn babies have been killed why does she think adding a bit of humor to killing an unborn baby is appropriate"
you wont know that babys heart nor will you ever hear their story
i have never had an abortion and i probably never would although im too old to have children anymore i was raised catholic in a conservative family that said it is not my choice with another woman does with her body i dont like abortion but i 100 support another womans right to access one for her own body without judgement
go do something about all the unwanted children already born and living in this country all the kids with mental and physical disabilities born alcohol and drug addicted  use your energy and time to adopt or foster an unwanted child who has been mentally physically or sexually abused there are hundreds of thousands of them in this country and will be thousands more when abortion is banned and womens bodys and choices are dictated by others beliefs and religion  if you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem  step up or shut up your selfrighteous rants and quit trying to dictate what i do with my body  my body my choice not yours
lets start protesting outside their churches harassing the people as they go in not everyone agrees with their religious choice if they dont respect the rights of others to choose for themselves they should expect no respect for their choice
why dont these people get upset about all the fertilized embryos that are frozen
men with little ones
love this article thank you for all you do and may you be safe
as you can see these people are mentally challenged  the republicon party is full of mentally ill mass shooters but what about these rightwing nut jobs protesting abortion clinics   seriously get a life  the mentally ill are a serious problem in the conservative movement  bigly
rape babies are an abomination
im sure dan always used protection when he had sex so their would be no  unwanted fetuses
all mental cases huge ignorance mixed with religious fanatism since they dont have a life they have spare time to meddle in other peoples lives the problem is that stupid people is very dangerous she is very courageous for doing what she does
yes abortion is awful but so is mandating the course of another persons life that is playing god dearie so being morally lazy i leave it to the pregnant woman to decide
"i bet you those antiabortion men are wife beaters
and during the beating  they dont care where the blows end up andor the woman receiving the blows"
people that are antiabortionists are completely selfish they have no right to force their decisions onto other womengirls they dont know the circumstances why someone would seek an abortion nor are they entitled to the people in this video absolutely disgusts me well help you the lord will help you if they cared so much about the well being of all children we wouldnt have starving kids we wouldnt have a shortage on diapers and formula for our infants we wouldnt have so many kids in the system
those grown ass men have nothing better to do
life does not begin at conception nor is it sacred not even in their little book how many people did god kill just because he didnt like them
women like her are not lost but are finding their voices and standing up for those who cannot speak
everyone of those men dont have any right to say one fornicating thing about a woman rights i know they dont have any right because im a man a real one
thank you shelly and dr c we will not give up and we will not back down i plan to do my part and help women in need still as well
any man who doesnt believe in abortion should believe in s vesectomy and go get one
wow 11 people killed how many babies killed during the same time babies are people too their not puppies you dont have a constitutional right to an abortion you dont have a right to kill anyone no one does now that you have watched this video i challenge you to watch 3 abortion videos one of each trimester wont be hard you should be able to find them here take a look
what most of these people dont realise is that some form of abortion has existed in almost all societies for many centuries  whether they worked or not  women have always sought to not have children they dont feel they can look after or from rape or incest  our body our choice
what gives those people the right over a womens body the supreme court fked up the republicans are gonna lose the midterms nothing like a woman scorned people vote for democracy republican dicktators deserve to lose
"religious fanaticism   a lack of education  murrica at its best 

if you have a schlong  bag between your legs you should have no say whatsoever in what a women does with her body"
great work shelly i love the protesters comments were here to help you like theyre offering to pay the 275k it takes to raise a child or erase the potential horrible situation the woman might be in
no egg must go unfertilized otherwise it is murder
ahhhh i like this tactic yes my minons our lord will get his sacrifices one way or another
i stopped by the local planed parenthood and asked the men if they had ever cracked open an egg and found blood when they answer affirmatively i asked if they understand that it was because the egg had been fertilized they said they understood so i asked if they were speaking to young men about not exploring their sexuality where they had no intention of staying they wanted to explain what they were doing there and refused to answer my question they all appeared to be pedophiles to me
more than 1m democrat voters have switched to the republican party since biden entered office  red typhoon coming in november

"shelley says its a tiny rubber fetous 
no rubber in any human body
and the walk way is spotless yet she is looking for bombs
headcase"
no better way to be pro life than to kill people huh these protesters are nuts and should go mind their own effing business
by your own creed babies go to heaven while adults only rarely do how about you do the math on that
my mom wanted me aborted and i wish i had been  my prolife dad wouldnt allow my mom to get an abortion  i was born into a family who didnt want me  i was abandoned by my mom then beaten and raped by my dad  i was already suicidal by the age of 8  i spent a childhood being abused neglected and without love  abortion would have been more merciful
libs of tiktok is great
why do people think its any of their business  noyb nomb
i love her
"abortion is not healthcare because it is not caring for the health of human life that is not a part of the womans body and has their own dna im an unplanned mom i know how scary it is but killing is killing murdering a proabortion person is hypocrisy but saying you do not harm while engaging in abortion is hypocrisy as well both unplanned mom and child matter  
anger and jealousy can create sinful motives like wishing death upon people and i am sorry that proabortion and antiabortion people have faced that abortion is violence"
i love how its always old men  why dont they go volunteer in foster care  hypocrites
its hilarious that liberals all of the sudden know what a woman is  what a bunch of bozos  truly amazing
i dont get these people no one should be so invested in how others live their life mind your own business you go live your life the way you want and i will live however the f i want the only one who has anything to say about your body is you
wow look how violent and out of line they are  what a contrast to the benevolent calm mature baby killer rioters 
"this video is packed with listings of transgressions performed by the left  its a reminder for the future

"if you think abortion is a constitutionally protected right give me the citation  abortion was federally protected but never constitutionally

proabortionists talk about the womans body and the womans life

the fact is there are two lives involved but proabortionists rarely say anything about the babys life 

i am not a lawyer  as a layman my reading of the constitutions article 1 section 8 and the ninth and tenth amendments leads me to believe the issue belongs at the state level not at the federal level

overturning roe does not stop abortions  it returns abortion to the state and local levels

some have said abortion is healthcare  sometimes it can be but most times its not

the state of florida requires women getting abortions to complete a questionnaire disclosing why they are getting one  

14 were for incest rape fetal abnormality or for the mothers life or health
63 were for social or economic
923 was no reason elective

the following is from us abortion statistics  

percentage of 2019 reported abortions by weeks of gestation cdc
6 wks	79 wks	1013 wks	1415 wks	1617 wks	1820 wks	21 wks
4290	3640	1340	290	170	160	100

so my points are these
	927 of abortions occur within the first 13 weeks
	986 of abortions are for social economic and elective reasons
	life begins at conception conception occurs when the sperm enters the egg the zygote is the only cell in a womans body that has different dna
	women got illegal dangerous abortions before roe  the reason for legalizing abortion is so they can get one legally and safely for a short period of time"
america the laughing stock of the world
i just witnessed the birth of fascism in the us i remember when the states criticized iran for combining fundamentalist religion and politics full circle but its always different when you guys do it isnt it
religion is the cause of so most misery and hate judge not less ye be judged seems to have gone over their heads
nothing says how pro life you are like murder and hate
nuts why dont these people fight gun laws then they would really be saving lives
it has no life until it can breathe on its own adam and eve were not human until they were able to breathe on their own
i hate those people who are full with religious beliefs in their brains and they judge someone else life now we are living the modern world and this is america the land of free lets she do whatever she want its her blood not yours stop using your own religious beliefs to judge people please i need you to read more books not listening to those churches pastor too much
did you ask the protesters if they are willing to financially support the babies are they prepared to buy food and diapers and are they willing to pay for the childrens healthcare are they willing to pay for their education asking for a friend
"hire this woman as a abortion pr specialist immediately we need fighters and trash talkers 
the opposition thinks we kill babies and drink their blood because we refuse bodily tyranny
you can not reason or compromise with those politics and the person who holds them you must beat them to a political pulp call them out as the fascist monsters they are and make it stick
let your sword be liberty and the tongue that demands it"
"start protesting at churches its those extremists who started this  these people are spiritually challenged  
                                                                 all filled with the hypocrisy of believing they know the will of god   that is sin by definition
                                          this is exactly why the separation of church and state is written into our laws    this is what its meant to prevent"
"millions switch to gop as dems losing everythingnever let the democrats live down all of their failures                                                                                           the overturning of roe v wade demonstrates that donald trump actually can make america great again



 americans excel under great leaders this impossible task is proving that this country is soon to have great leaders again and with a motivated people ready to drive onward to moral highground where we belong im so glad that the liberals dont get it the democrats piloted the ship directly into the iceberg and are now lecturing passengers on the health benefits of ice baths"
"the antiabortion people arent a bunch of rioters showing their faces doesnt matter to them
   they truly believe theyre saving babys   he wants to show anything she should be doing tic tok videos on how not to get pregnant
    that could cut into her pay"
this has sent us back decades 
im so dumb when they started saying mom im like damn they already hot as hell their mom is still alive

no wonder no one watches cnn any more lol
a nurse confided in me that at the womens health clinic where she worked  there was a male protester there every day in front  that he had 5 children at home  and that he had not worked in all the years that she had seen him in front of her office  and that his wife did not work either  and that these two parents and their children lived in poverty
cnn is dirty baby killers 
people should show the baby killers on tiktok
"do u work for the gop im asking since america is in total collapse  u guys r covering the idiots on the right rather than getting into the truth  america is ranked 44 on freedom of press no wonder our society is so mentally ill we have e nobody telling the truth

why are people protesting is there a lot of bebys needed to be killed
as a brit america really blows my mind sometimes  and no probirthers not in a good way much solidarity and love for these escorts from here in the uk
as the great g carlin said most who oppose abortion  could  get sex in the first place  paraphrased of course
dudes got more issues than the national geographic
why do men protest do they have a baby to kill  and abortions isnt health care or birth control its for women raped and incest and going to die if they have a child thats it if women want abortions as a birth control keep there legs closed
religious zealots really ridiculous people so dan is doing this to secure a place in heaven
im prolife but i respect there decisions its there bodys
what happens now
shero 
my thoughts and prayers for the under educated humans that believe taking away humanrights saves lives well bless your heart it is simply human trafficking
why doesnt the global monopoly just make another virus but one that attacks people who bring their babies to term
state run propaganda at the cnn
we know they are good at making viruses to manipulate elections but are they any good at making viruses that attack unborn babies
abortionist are the insane ones
youtube is nothing more than a state run entity that antagonizes the people to see which ones will stand to be persecuted or prosecuted for what they say king obiden wants his opposition in small cages
well bad things happen when plutocrats manipulate presidential elections with weaponized viruses
what is it with all that god crap in the states demo should be in front of the church to ban that mind poison and it should be a crime to teach children that crap
look at her speak in slow motion she is a devil in human form
the devil dresses very nicely when given a platform to speak at cnn
thank you shelley were grateful to have people like you in this country
these abusers need to get a life a friend of mine is still pissed after 38 years for a 6 week procedure her escort took his own life
that lady that said we will help will be the same person complaining about her tax dollars is paying for welfare
thanks cnn for showing us how crazy the baby killers are
im going to work at the clinics as an escort asap
she is baffled as to why so many people want to save the unborn hell on earth we are in
she is cuckoo for cocoa puffs and dead fetuses
somebody get this woman a life she can take before she goes postal on the antiabortionists
its obamas fault he didnt codify roe he had the majority and said it wasnt a priority
this good and brave woman gives me such hope in these dark times
she hates antiabortionists because nobody would ever get her pregnant she would have aborted it anyway
are these the thoughts and prayers people protesting outside these clinics  hummmm where else have i encountered that and observed how utterly absurdly ineffective that approach is
help  bullshit
crazy how the world has become ok with these acts against the unborn these acts will go down in history as being barbaric and inhumane
go home and clean your filthy homespay your billsbalance your check booksmind your own business
loved that old man so much wisdom
abortion is not the answer water causes miscarriage look it up
the man protesting a womans right to choosewhen he meets his makeri hope he likes eternal fire
dan should feel guilty for judge others and not doing the actual help to them but instead of passing his own judgement when they prolife starts actually financially help from the before birth to the actual adulthood of age 21 they have no say on the women who makes this difficulty choice and ironically they are the one that is more violent how interesting and all history of men kind have proven when a men start doing things in the name of god is nothing but an excuse to start a war
an anti abortion shooting is the biggest oxymoron there is we preserve life if you dont like that we will kill you 
"irony
democratic cities will be burned down by democrats in democrat states where abortion will still be legal"
i know all those people protesting against abortion clinics are singles with cats and dogs with no adopted kids at home
thank you shelly  you are the most wonderful beautiful person ever thank you so much

killer a  baby no one bat on eyebrow no one gives a shit no thoughts and prayers  you kill a sixyearold everybody shits their pants theyre prayers and thoughts all over there are no difference they are both are children  they both had names
we know what happens inside the clinics babies being murdered
bunch of bible thumpers organized religion has been the scourge of humanity
"didnt kentucky pass a law mandating ultrasounds before abortions and from what i read ultrasound techs put notes like hi mom and please dont kill me on the screen

but yeah lets talk about how both sides are the same congrats white women you voted for this own it"
"they aint seen nothing yet women are going to control their bodies no matter how they try to stop them

its ironic that women who seek to control their bodies manage to have unwanted pregnancies"
so sad so many women dont even feel that life inside them is real my daughter thinks its not even real until its a fetus these are unborn children
she has more balls than texas police 
standing up to these antiwoman loons is a very dangerous job
i hope this guy isnt depending on this getting him into heaven
notice it is men mostly what do they know
"the hypocrisy of the antiabortionists is clearly evident in that women who said about the right to choose life exactly  a choice not an imposition by others as to what happens to your body if you dont like the idea of abortins fine  dont have one thats your choice but if you want to have an abortion far better to have one at a legally licensed clinic than to go to  back street abortionists 

also all the deaththreats against clinic staff  how do the antiabortionists not see how hyprocritical they are are they really all that stupid"
clearly the us government does not acknowledge the fetus as a person or it would be a tax deduction
this makes me cry
ive never seen anti abortionsist in a black or brown community hmm we know why they dont care about infants of color
is it better than liberals of tik tok
tiktok is poison and china is stealing your information off that app
also assault by mutual consent means that two people are voluntarily fighting each other so she was likely just as guilty in that matter
"if these anti abortion protesters really want to make a difference in the lives of women that dont want to have an abortion take the female in and support her 100 and then adopt her child if theyyou cant do that stfu and stay away 
or
mandatory vasectomy for all males at age 15 that wont happen because its all about dk when it comes to men they these old azz men would rather harass   women outside of a abortion center 
until these anti abortion protestors are adopting children they have no say so
its too easy to stand outside a clinic and harrass
man up woman up and  financially  support the women you are harrassing and give them another option 
if not
back the fk off"
weve gotta clean up these leaves and trash  proceeds to blow the leaves and trash on to the street here we are witness to the wonderfully evolved liberal mind 
she was fed up with antiabortion protesters so she broadcast them on tiktok thereby reminding us that abortions are the terrible consequence of terriblyhungry people misbehaving terribly like jan621 insurrectionist hangrydjt and motivates us to redouble our efforts to convinceitforward to stop being hangry in hopes of stopping the mourninginamerica
really guys really  the gender of the species that cant seem to keep it in their pants is anti abortion   really maybe you should get a life
where is the separation of church and state the churches should start paying taxes on their greed sanctimonious hypocrites
as a pregnant man i am so glad that i live in california where i have the right to terminate my child when it comes to my child its my body my choice except for vaccine mandates i need the government to control me in that aspect
shelly good for you thank you for helping those poor women how dare those people impose themselves on others
these people have no right to stand outside the clinics and protest if people were stood right outside some church entryway doing this itd be different
now show what goes on inside abortion clinics
you are trying to protest murder and then murder the dr and nurses doesnt even make sense
a note to the woman i think christina its not a right to choose life if theres no choice
i love that pin not today larry with the ladder lmfao 
they want to save kids from being aborted but cant save them from being killed in a mass shooting in schools 
why not just put a 12 foot fence around the property
cnn were ideologically leftleaning and it shows in all we do
nonsensical news
mad respect for this woman yes shelly 
i can guarantee none of those antichoice idiots is a foster or adoption parent useless creeps
its  so easy to sit in an ivory tower and pass judgement on others   it should be mandatory that politicians contemplating withdrawing funding or passing laws go and live in the trenches with the very people their decisions are about to impact  you can pass all the laws you want but it wont stop abortion  it just puts it back into the alleyways   laws should be based on the way the world is not on an ideology of what we would like the world to be
it should be the police that protects the patients from that kind of harassment 
"this is the best day in american history 
i was hoping they ban abortion in california and all states as well
babies are precious lets save the babies and our future generations
btw these women are not patients they are just shameless and promiscuous babykillers"
those pro lifers killing people again  i guess that is ok because they believe in the bible  wtf
god gave us free will he gave us free will to choose abortion or to naught choose abortion about to have a government to rule that you cannot have an abortion even if its all right baby goes beyond the pale united states says its the land of the free but is it really
cnn already posted this abortion karen video
"its unusual to be this obsessed with any topic but all of these protestors arent christians im not a psychologist but there has to be something else going on here

if abortion was supposed to be one of the biggest evils in the world since the liberation of the concentration camps they should be happy that _roe_ was overturned

now that its outlawed and the clinics are shut down will they have to go protest nightclubs hookup apps condoms and pharmacies that dispense contraceptives"
"so these people hear otherworldly voices telling them to attack women seeking health care services and thats not a reason to have them committed and medicated until their hallucinations and delusions stop
  even if they think her choices are sinful can they not by definition be forgiven by the same prayer we are all supposed to be forgiven by why is this one area so unforgivable in these peoples opinions"
safe to say she wont be having an abortion
"a dreadful example of how americas obsession with free speech results in harassment and worse of vulnerable women and staff at the clinics  

in london where i live there is a marie stopes clinic near to where i live  the idea that women using the service would attract any unwanted attention from members of the public is absolutely unthinkable

those people who are picketing the  clinic in mississippi represent the worst of religiously motivated meddling in other peoples lives  they never change the choices that individual women make and they spend all of that time virtuesignalling to their god when the could be doing something useful  to contribute towards their communities  pious narcissists  yeuch"
these antiabortionists want nothing to do with universal healthcare which would provide protections for children  these are the people that are fry em when any black man is convicted of murder  the straightline pedigree of these people go back to holding black people as property  the hypocrisy of these cretins is astounding
republicans protest against abortion but they dont protest against the guns killing all these children and they dont protest against the abusers rapist and killers of the now living unwanted children republicans walk away from these childrenthey dont care about them once these children need help christians pretend they care when they dont
this woman is a hero
all sad little people with no lives and head full of evangelical showbiz preacher psychobabble  all of them should be dragged off and put in a mental institution
they killed a doctor in the name of life makes total sense i guess as much as being pro life and defending the use of ar15 and the death penalty 
shelly is a super hero
i dont think id last a day out there joe would trip and fall tom would notice his tires mysteriously slashed  ya know the paperwork alone would make it a pain
"lets talk about hypocritical what about the unborn victims of violence act of 2004 also known as the laci and conner act is a united states law that recognizes an embryo or fetus in utero as a legal victim if they are injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed federal crimes of violence

so a mother can terminate her pregnancy but if a man murders a pregnant women hes charged with double murder lets start holding these doctors  mothers that go forward with abortions 

usa is heading in the right direction you dont like it leave please"
the fat gate keeper will get what she protected
i do not feel bad these killers were killed  they got what they give  seams about right
" perhaps  start a mother and baby life program  mabl create a sign up list offer it to folks that care standing outside clinics or at protests this will offer a more positive outlet that can really help  that way we can sign up to personally help with all medical costs therapy travel diapers foods education etc until the baby can find a job around 18 yrs old this list would agree to help with all costs including if the baby grew up as an invalid then their pledge would automatically extend to cover further than 18 yrs of age  this would give an opportunity in truth for folks to prove how much one really cares  and or  give folks a chance to think a little deeper before commiting their whole spirit              remember as humans being the best humans we can be   we must deserve the right to change our minds in a moments notice upon new and valid information add this  to the top of the mabl financial sign up list must also consider in the future we will lose much land mass as oceans rise and environmentle changes  will be forcing all these then adult  babies to crowd together in smaller useable lands also creating less food and drinkable water  remembering the horrific results of having too many rats in a cage social experiment           so this may be one of those questions that has no real answers and perhaps designed to create separation and chaos
a  divide and conquer type question  build the list and as folks politicians and judges sign up to this baby and mother life financial help program  others may follow  or not 
but either way it will give folks a chance to ponder a little further "
she needs to be expired  wait that would be murder  same thing they are doing
mrs shelley you are hero
"i thought god gave people free will  
yep the sinful internet says he did

how hypocritical are those sickos who killed those people at those clinics 

she should find out where they go to church and protest there with a ton of people every sunday with signs and banners saying things like god does not exist   do you still believe in fairy tales 
see how they like that kind of harassment on their door step"
ignorance is what religion is about keep people ignorant to control them and take their money
anti abortion protestors the epitome of why we need abortion
group idiots
"unwanted pregnancies are going to cause trillion of dollars in food stamps medicaid each year starvation neglect hatred abuse and death unwanted babies will be abandoned in hospitals children are precious in the sight of god what will happen when these babies are born and they have to suffer

let face reality the woman who murdered her 4 children in georgia by stabbing and injured one then set house on fire"
"the dumb supreme court just gave the democratic party super majority in november and i love it



 any fool who disagree with my comments and feel the need to show your ignorance to the world by posting against my comment have at it you will have a conversation with yourself due me not receiving any notifications of any comments my settings wont allow me to see your ignorant comments you will have an uneducated conversation with yourself like the delusional fool you are"
lets just stop having sex with men thats it thats the post
get yourself an open carry protect yourself so you can continue to help these other women who need you 5000 fine for assaulting you is a slap in the face and id be dam good and sure to protect myself
that man spewing the love of god is probably one of the most godly people you will know he loves everyone but he is also very specific about who and what he hates
okay an abortion before the 12 weeks ok but the third trimester now i understand why yall got some serious problemsyour killing full blown babies yalland you pray this wakes people up are you fucking mad
the minute an unwanted child is born these people want nothing to do with paying for the support of the child so i think they all need to stfu and mind their own business go home you hypocrites
are you going to support this children that for some reason or another have to be aborted its not your business stay out of it unless youre going to raise it and if you hurt anyone working there or going there for help your committing a worse crime you should go to jail
why do we focus on the symptoms rather than the root of the problem the constitution lacks the power to motivate citizens to collaborate rather than be antagonistic towards each other issues of abortion civil rights  question of guns  mass shootings are symptoms of the disease of disunity
how come daddy in the sky just doesnt come down and stop it
omg these people are ridiculous had no idea women had to put up with these freaks abortion is a womans right a women decision make dan go down and look after some street kids junkies kids alcoholics foster care kids now adults and on the streets ho look after them pay all thrre costs feed them look after there medical needs schooling jobs cloths etc then see how you feel about taking a womans right away a families right husband and wife right and the rights of raped children some as young as 9yr old
holy shit these people are out of there collective minds religion has fucked up more people than any war
do these people ever ask themselves what is it about our society that makes abortion necessary   why not invest their time giving support within their communities to lower the need for abortion
i think that we should be able to make our own choices  if women cant make a choice then man should lose a right too  thats life  if you kill someone who is pro choice that makes you a killer too
something that baffles me is this if the constitution didnt give me the right to an abortion how can it take it away ps i am way past reproductive age but i am not way past caring for the health of young women
cnn posting old sht zombies will eat up this woman or bleeding person is harassing protesters for exercising their 1st amendment rights theres protesting and then theres reactionary harassment and infringing on peoples right to protest if she wants to counter protest no one objects unless shes harassing and intimidation by getting in peoples faces personal space and trying to dox or threaten with recording them for political intimidation
thank you for caring
they should be trespassed and not be aloud in a certain mile radius where are these protesters when men rape children or woman
abortion is only keeps woman promiscuous
"lgbtq dont get pregnant
why they protesting
its like a vegan protesting mcdonalds is not serving hamburger"
men need to shut up  they know nothing of what its  like
good job shelly we need more genocidal activists protesting against people who value life you must feel so proud keep getting in ppls personal space remember the best way to express your view is to antagonize and promote violent confrontation
"sooo many old men and whats wrong with that picture two things firstly men dont have wombs and wont get pregnant hence they will never have to decide on having an abortion or not secondly theyre old and had they indeed had wombs theyd be barren at their overripe old age

guys give it up k

women gets pregnant have to bear the fetus to term deliver it and take the lion share in nursing and raising the kid yes men are part of the process 100 percent in conception and of varying degree thereafter

sooo its basically just the woman who can make a decision here if she chooses to consult with the man whose genes contributed the other fifty percent of the fetus it is her choice

no man has a right to decide in this matter men dont even have the right to demand a right"
i think these people should lawfully be responsible for adopting every baby they save bet they would sit down reevaluate
shelly wants to make the choices for her own body looks like she could use some help with that
why are these abortion escorts wearing rainbow vests this is a cult
why do all these women advocates look the same
wtf assault with mutual consent i dont think anyone consents to assault normally crazy report
old white man looking like fools screaming at women
old white guys protesting abortioninteresting 
how do you sleep at night you escort a woman to murder her own child you have no idea the pain women suffer life long with guilt and regret from abortion it ruins their life also stop playing god you say its the longest walk into the clinic maybe the woman needs to rethink what she is doing abortion or escort we all stand before god in his judgement you can explain to him why you escorted a mom to how many deaths of babies he will judge you hell is for eternity
remember who voted to take away your individual rights women of america and vote those people out of office  america needs progress not regress you outnumber pro life loud mouth holy rollers now prove it on voting day
abortion is a woman right your body your choice period
their real focus is on demanding other people have the same belief they do that goes against everything our constitution stands for prolife is just republican rhetoric bs if they actually cared about life theyd make major changes in our gun laws theyd make sure ars are not available to the public theyd have a minimum age of 21 for buying a gun theyd have instruction licensing and safety standards for gun owners but no they just want to control women and tell them how they can live their lives
religious zealots are the most dangerous people on earth history proves that over and over ask any psychiatrist or experience cop and theyll tell you the same thing like my lieutenant told me they can justify anything in the name of their god murder suicide giving up their kids for sex letting their children die anything a religious nut stabbed a psychiatrist i worked with in the neck
little do they know they are setting a great example of why abortion should be legal
people are bold these days
why no teporting on what left groups have recently been doing at different facilities i get it cant drop the agenda in reality both things should be reported but wont be on cnn or fox because they each have their audience local news is more likely to have both types of stories
well look at it this way if these clowns believe that embryos have a soul then an abortion is helping them get back into heaven as fast as possible isnt heaven better than earth
religious christian nuts just like those islamic crazies get a real job and go fix your family feed the poor and hungry who are already out there if you want to help your jesus wont forgive you for your sins in life if you impose yourself on others you make it worse for yourself
"take baby clothes 
abortion is not a type of birth control

three people died but millions of baby were killed but who cares"
i cant imagine this morbidly obese and terribly homely women ever needing an abortion so why does she want to kill other peoples babies jealousy
"a fetus is not viable outside of the mothers body
most fetuses become viable between 24 to 28 weeks 
to think that a lump of cells can live on it own in an incubator is delusional

these people are the minority of the american society they live on the fringes of society
they do not have the right to  shame and blame women seeking an abortion 
especially men who dont know what its like to be pregnant or go through the pain associated with giving birth 
nor do they have a clue about the huge hormonal changes a woman goes through during a pregnancy and after giving birth
hormones that can cause postnatal depression and worse postnatal psychosis were either the mother kills the baby kills herself or both it never ends well 
after giving birth it takes  time normally it may take 6 months to a year or even longer depending on your health and whether there were any complications during delivery
during this time a womans libido is usually very low
not all husbands or boyfriends are thoughtful enough to wait before demanding sexual intercourse something that is the last thing on a womans mind 
you can take progesterone only birth control although it can affect your milk production and  needs time to start working 
men can use a condom but most men dont like using them
it should be at least 6 weeks before you resume sexual intercourse"
"omfg just let people be 

if you dont agree with their decision that suits you"
vote democrats into extinction in the midterm elections period
and yet these men and women who protest do nothing for the born ignorance is not an excuse for hate and violence
these anti abortion fanatics dont appear to be to clever
and their right to choose life thats not a choice the right to choose is choosing not to carry the fetus to term
and they claim is the other way around i have no doubts the attacks to the prolife clinics were made by themselves to look like victims
baby lives matter
im not an expert on the topic but it should be the womens choice plain and simple
why dont these pro life people petition their politicians to increase food stamps for families with children if they care about kids so much so many children in this country go to bed hungry because their parents wages are low and food stamps are too low to feed kids enough and nutritious foods
"they will murder people someones family member in the name of pro life
i  am  pro life but women should have that right to choose their body there choice  that was also the chant of the same folk who did not want to wear masks to save lives or get vacancies again to save lives"
they have the right to protest be safe arrest those who violate the law lets go brandon
the religious are the worst
even god gave us a choice  personally i do not believe in abortion  but my beliefs have nothing to d with another womans right to make this personal decision for herself
what a god sent protector blessing to you always
idc how much they say theyre are passionate about religion or thier skewed beliefs i truly believe imo these anti abortion protesters enjoy being antagonist pathetic
these people confuse me what do they think happens to these so called babies  do they just disappear since they believe it is a child from fertilization that means if the child has been aborted it returns to the arms of jesus the childs soul returns to god in heaven the home and place  we are all wanting to be   they make no sense life begins and ends with breath
gun shops need to be protested with as much vigor  the irony is off the charts
"good for this lady 
of course these women have already made their decision it is ridiculous that these pro fetus people yell at them"
"dear  president putin
adultery is a sin 
but fornications are deadly sins 
adultery is sin with a person whose husband is not informed about his wifes wilful sin 
fornications are very common in relationships
fornications brings diseases in body 
sometimes fornication is also dangerous says hebrew 
adultery may create bitterness and lead to murder 
so relationships are safe 
your war with zelensky is not a great  sin according to the bible
because ukraine  people are our christians relationships
but i request you to stop the war with zelensky with a condition stop joining zelensky in nato
1 john tells a safer life style 
1 john tells  us to live in this world according to 1 john 216
lusts of eyes 
lusts of flesh 
pride of life 
because there is fear death and loss of fathers gods  love 
so not only we shouldnt love  it but we mustnt  even pray for those christians who do these mistakes in their life
but how to make our relationship while in body
it is only with christian families
take example jude boaz and king david 
the great sinner  from our point of view david the great king  sin was only with a jewish woman but her husband was a gentile
as a king  and jewish leader he might be pitied for her because her husband failed to love his wife 
but christian family is safe 
god bless you 

note king david managed the situation because he was a king  
but we would be killed or facing troubles in such a deadly sins 
kings of david times grabbed any woman they wanted 
amongst all gentile kings david was a gentleman
but god didnt spare him too 
my question did god kill those gentile kings 
yea all of them died in the battle

i request putin to take a fruitful discion very quickly because as antony blinken says already lot of companies left russia it might affect russian future 
so president putin must stop his invasion of ukrain and i assure everything becomes normal to russia and russian business this i assure president putin on behalf of usa and president joe biden
god bless you sir 
thank you jesus 
amen  "
i wonder how many of these people realize that babies are killed in the bible often mandated by god himself
they dont need prayers they need better wages for a start
i believe women with ectopic pregnancies should be monitored closely if there is a obvious and valid danger it may be able to occur except it is wrong for women without health issues to be given the option of abortion at all its murder  these people are doctors to heal the suck  not your hitman
doctors and nurses who perform abortions are our hero and heroines love you all for saving womens lives thank you to this beautiful women for protecting womens rights  
what gets me is why does god not stop abortion if it is wrong why do people have to why do they think they are god and have to play being so for god god is about freedom of choice you are taking gods given right away from people you are forcing your beliefs on someone and that is wrong that is against god
why do all antichoice crazies look like in the privacy of their own homes they molest kids
"i am pro choice but unless the womans life is in danger  i cant support late term abortion   as with everything  there must have limitations or else we become the monsters the right  wingers say we are  
we cant claim the high road and do what they accuse of doing which in most late term abortions is actually killing a baby 
i support your right to choose  just do it before the fetus becomes a baby"
the shootings are just post birth abortions other than that the clinic and the shooting kill people at many stages of life its mostly just irony
these people demonstrate how uninformed they are  or nuts depending on how violent they act
they want those white women going for an abortion to carry those babies to term for the sake of the white race
are these protesters going to adopt these children
sure wish there had been an insurrection at this point papaw is the absolute worst get him the hell out of there while theres still anything to salvage the next president is screwed  i dont know why anyone would want to follow obiden
fake news as always
"that makes perfect sense how can they kill people when they are against killing people  they are so delusional 

men in general like dan should have no say in the matter whatsoever"
when i meet my maker i hope the lord has mercy instead of having mercy on the woman that has to bear an unwanted child and care for them until their 18 really sir
these religous fanatics have no right to try and force their beliefs on me my life my body i dont want these extremist trump thumpers telling me what to do or how to live my life they are all so stupid they cant think for themselves so they look to their god trump to tell them what  to think they are the bottom of our society and i thought snakes were the lowest form of life not so anymore these are so sub human no abortions but allow our children be killed by guns in their classroom so two faced everyone of them
this is so much bigger than abortion its about minority rule this is just the beginning if we do not go out and vote in november 
how many children has dan delivered he has guilt but it is not about abortion maybe he has never done anything good in life but he has no uterus no opinion men should be forced to have vasectomies at 12yrs of age so he know what it is like to have their reproductive rights taken away that would finally be real justice
this is all about a bunch of religious nonsense  merchants of myth forcing their views on everyone  once these yahoos take total control of our government they will be a dangerous cancer difficult to remove and deadly like the dark ages of their beginnings
the funny thing is when we die we are shown and experience all the hurt we caused other souls so that man thinks god is going to show him mercy for doing what hes doing when in reality hes causing those women anguish and thats what god will show him
you are obviously an introspective thinker people say its a complicated issue often if theyre pro choice but too often they only see the complications which support their belief i personally believe that rape incest and circumstances in which the life of the mother is in danger are valid reasons for an abortion i am definitely repulsed by the fact that in the state of new york babies are killed after theyve been delivered and therefore a us citizens under the constitution in other words babies are actually being murdered in new york
old people are screwed up in america
its terrible to kill babies
anyone who kills an already living breathing people is not a pro life advocate  if you cant figure that out for yourself  nothing i write will help
if churches are going to get involved with making laws they can pay their taxes as an admittance fee just like everybody else
no you definitely do not have a responsibility to harass patients at the clinic your function is to mind your own fn business not your business these womens bodies are their own
absolute madness delusions we are here to protest the right for the woman to choose life is she listening to herself 
"the irony of violent corrupt racist sexist hatefilled and criminal activities by people espousing religion is not lost the only real of religion is the opportunity to control others through misinformation and continuum of ignorance i know it sounds like we are talking about trump and his radicalised followerssame same

these yelling crazies look to be the same neighbours that yells get off my lawn to little kids walking by"
is it too late to abort these protesters
abortion clinic escorts are american heroes
ok ill have the baby but you raise it  that will shut these idiots up
eleven murders of clinic workers how prolife is that
america is seriously in very bad shape everything is sooooo messed up nothing make sense anymore
a key phrase i think  so they are trying to impose their on feelings about abortion no one has the right to make decisions for someone else if you dont like something then dont participate
this woman sounds so pretentious
anti abortion people who bomb and kill people at clinics are pro life really think about how fucking stupid that is for a minute
the old guy is funny  he thinks when he dies hes going to meet his maker    like of all the millions that die everyday the maker has time for him
"no no you dont best way is if you abortion girls put a ribbon  on so we no its my freedom to no who kills the seed 
cause the best way to avoid this problem  is not to stick it in give you the seed  best abortion  plane find the pro life girls only 
not saying there not free they are but understand  the price involved 
taking life away is man take responsibility  of that action  of creation  of life 
and women you chose the path that says life
so if you dont get the seed you cant kill life 
i respect  all mothers 
who take responsibility  and still get it done 
men should take responsibility  of who you released  
adultery is adultery 
fight temptation  
but what pro life has they took responsibility  
not greed that says i deserve  it no i want freedom you have it when you ignore the temptation  of adultery 
until you become 1 in flesh 
which passes dna information  from he and you making a hole new dna information  creation  life"
"facts first
even the pope agrees if youre prolife then you should also
1  ask for more gun control laws
2  provide more support financial emotional and physical to mothers
3  support the underprivileged"
she literally uses death in her channel name this woman is straight out of a horror movie and did you catch that this clinic does lateterm abortions which is basically straightup infanticide
if these lost souls who feel guilty about their own lives or are 100 cultists actually believed in the sanctity of life they wouldnt be protesting outside of the clinicthey would be demanding children be provided education about reproduction sexual diseases cancer womens health mental health and demanding universal healthcare for all americans
why isnt the private property much larger with a long driveway
these are off course sick sick people
"the prolifers think they are so just 
but pressuring people into your way of thinking is being a nazi
and we live in a free country"
these are like minded people who clinically walk talk and think exactly like donnie trump they are all mentally deranged and unstable donnie your clones were let loose from the asylum tre45on
have dan and joe do a though experiment as an abortion protester you are now eligible to be randomly selected to raise an adopted child they can think of it as unwanted pregnancy they wouldnt refuse or abort this child right
shelly big thank you  womens rights
i love how these people think that posting antiabortion makes them bad people when all theyre doing is ensuring that you dont kill your baby what monsters
i could care less how you feel about it but if you use abortion as birth control i dont feel sorry for you for the ones that need one i feel bad for you that selfish sluts ruined it for you i hate when people abuse good things and get them taken away
hope they have put plenty of money aside to pay for all the orphans children with disabilities children with severe disabilities then you have all the problems with many many children with no parents to guide them therefore creating plenty of new recruits for the gangs should be ok though coz usa doesnt really have a gangs and guns problem
trying to stop abortion by murdering peopleits all about controlwhat did this man do to help mothers and babiesnothing  other than terrorize
this lady is going straight to hell
gods number one rule is not to judge and what are they doing protesting judging  mind your own business
those killers of abortion workers are no different than the abortion doctors murder is murder be it a fetus or a grown adult  
those protesters are great people
the guy worrying god might be angry he didnt harass and cause enough distress to women and girls if his god exists he id going straight to hell for his cruelty
what is anyone business what i do with my body no one has told this people to have abortion so dont tell me dont  these are people sit by the window and watch neighbors house
in the past 50 years that has never been a valid case made against abortion all the anti freedom crowd has done is lie appeal to emotion intimidate extort commit violence acts of vandalism terrorism and even murder what they really want is to feel self righteous over other people so they can feel good about themselves while ruining other peoples lives
are they aware abortions was performed in the holy bible
so that lady works at an abortion clinic i guess im not clear on how abortions are performed does she eat them
these old men shouldnt have a fing thing to say about abortion
"jesus comments on true life and true death
 you are indeed the children waiting to be born to the life of heaven this is not life this one which you live on earth during the mortal day this is only the formation of your future being as one living eternally human existence is the gestation which shapes you to give you to the light to the true light and not to the poor murky light of this earth

i bear you in me like a mother forming her child i surround you and shelter you with myself i nourish you with my food to have you be born immortal in the hour of what you call death and it is nothing but a passage a passage from an incomplete phase to completeness from imprisonment in limited space to boundless freedom from darkness to light from obstructed caresses to the absolute embrace of the soul with its parent

this is what you call dying you that with your proud knowledge still are not able to give the right name to things and like children a few years old you call things by mistaken names i want to teach you what death is and who the dead are

death is to be separated from god like an unborn child that before the proper time is separated from the maternal organ and putrefies in the alveus which expels him painfully the dead are those who because they are expelled in this way do not differ from the remains of an animal disintegrating in the sun and rain along an earthly cart road causing repugnance in those seeing them this is what it is to be dead sin is the cause which separates you from god and makes you decaying corrupted flesh food for satan who has poisoned you to devour you a prey to his hunger as a devourer of souls and an enemy of god the creator of souls 
 dictation from ma valtortas notebooks dated 10oct1943

do not abort if you do not want to become an abortion"
mcconnell and thomas should worry that next the court will revisit the right to interracial marriage legal since only 1967 remember the domino theory america is killing itself corporations are going to pay travel expenses for women who need to leave the state for an abortion if corporations are people will sony go to jail
so  they dont mind taking care of born children free healthcare education and food
well with the shit that went down with scouts these people are now gonna feel more justified
so much unnecessary pain bloodshed fearmongering and interference of at least some medically necessary abortions just makes one wonder whose god is going to forgive whom for what wrongs
"what i see is a lot of people who most probably have mental issues 
this is sad but also often a result of abuses and neglects of children that were born when they shouldnt have because the all women cant be good mothers and many dont have resources in your country like in canada where everything is made towards helping young mothersfree healthcare for everyone free dental care a year off of job paid by our government after the birth of a child and we recuperate our job thats the lawwe also have very little fees for school mostly their materialsa monthly payment by child also given by our government until he reach 18 years oldyes we pay big taxes for this but our system is made not to forget any people of our country and for the well being of mother and kids in priorityhere our children is a priorityand even with this we are not going to force a woman to keep her baby
we will encourage the ones that would want to keep them and will talk to her about all the perspectives of their choices first but her decision is between herself and god no judgementsonly god can judge and forgive not us humans we often think that we have all the answers for othersand clearly take ourselves as god in our worldlook at all the dictators that do impose their ideas to their populations
also abortion are free in canada and we assure women to recieve all medical and psychological help necessaryshe wont have to go get an abortion on a kitchen table with risks for her health like many women will probably do nowand if i were you i would start to look at the statistics that will come over women suicidal and child abuses your country is pressuring women a lot when they are having their hormones up the roof  and no consideration of her age she will have to face maternity and parenthood without any help most of the time or promises from friends and family that will end up abandoning her with her kid often left alone with her kid
this decision is never an easy one but remains a womans decision because she is the one who will live with the consequences of it"
waitthese escorts are helping violently and cruelly kill a life in some states now after this week they would be an accomplice to a homicide or even serial killing depending on numbers thats not heroic thats serious and extreme mental illness they should seek professional help asap get them to a hotline fast
antiabortion extremests are the biggest hypocrites they dont want abortions but will not pass legislation to provide healthcare and or financial aid for the less fortunate or pass legislation to go after their rapists

god bless the people of the clinic stay we the people are behind you thank you
i am all for freedom of religion for anyone to choose whatever floats their boat but please for the love of the allmighty spaghetti monster could we maybe also get freedom from religion so people can not pester and penetrate others constantly with their deranged relgious bullshit views and opinions maybe even throw in a s bit of secularism so the usa wont become a califate or a republic of gilead
"cant we ban rasing children if you dont want to do the constitutions tell women they have to raise their children if they dont want to
can women deny doctors and other healthcare workers to assist them giving birth
we have to find a loophole in this mess 
can we force the father to take over after birth the father is just as much mother as the father of the child women can provide as fathers can care for the child"
ask these protesters how many children theyve adopted
its the left that is violent and unhinged its not even close years ago there were a few wackos on the right but its not close now just look at all the places of worship or womens health care facilities that are under attack there have been over 40 places vandalized and trashed with all kinds of stuff graffiti and threatening messages and human excrement people have been assaulted and sent to the hospital its not close the radical left becomes unhinged and violent if they dont get their way
she doesnt need to worry about getting pregnant
good for her
his maker is going to ask him how many unwanted babies he adopted or supported through college
what i find interesting some of them are willing to kill people over this bomb clinics etc how is that prolife and what if they bomb a place  there happens to be a child or baby in there
nightmarethese people are in a cultthey are the talibanthey are happy now that we have sharia law
"these people want our country over flowing with poor babies suffering in poverty  slums    of course they dgaf about life once its been
thats why they dont care about rape victims or women who die because they cannot bear having their rapists or dads or uncles baby"
she 
hypocrites
how can you be antiabortionand pro murder there are some insane people out there yall 
god bless donald trump
shes a hero  comment by bailey bell
as a european i am utterly shocked  what shocks me the most is anti abortion men  first they have no idea what it means to be pregnant  second i would love to see them pregnant and delivering a baby of which they know they cant take care   we as women know what is best for us and for a baby because sometimes a baby will have a miserable life for different reasons   i myself have had two abortions when i was young  i simply couldnt have coped the two men would absolutely not want to take care of me and a baby  and i would have had to give up my job which i loved  anyway this whole issue is is our women not mens problem   with all the issues like abortion racism extreme right movements you have in the states i consider myself very lucky to be european swiss exactly
thank these women for helping these ladies
it should be illegal to harrass anyone seeking medical treatment from healthcare professionals throw these lunatics in prison
our country is going backward because of the minority  i feel sad that theyre attacking womens rights currently but we should fear what theyll come after next
why are all these crotchety old men protesting i guess they take their cue from all the crotchety old men in congress who get to decide whats best for women
instead of protesting how about prolifers adopt the kids already here and needing a family even as an adoptee im still strongly prochoice and these hypocrites disgust me to no end
one very courageous woman thank you for protecting these women god bless you i can not understand the types of people who insist the country  everyone in it live under their rules americans have a right to choose how they want to live and those protesters have no right to harass women if the protesters believe so strongly that  their god doesnt want abortion then they should live their lives under their gods rules and have faith that these women will be punished it is no ones right to make others live a life that they have not chosen this is why i detest all these man made religions claiming to know what god wants  doesnt want and i especially detest the evangelicals what hypocrites they send in their money so that their pastors can live a life of luxury while screwing around outside their own marriages bloody hypocrites go home and pray to your god and let others do as they please 
they are escorting women in there to kill their childrenand they dont even realize how evil they arethey are so evil there is no gray area to thou shalt not kill who gave them the right to decide who lives and who diesi guess it makes them feel powerful
man it must be nice to have nothing better to do with your timeive other shit to do 
shelley needs arrested
when he meets his maker he will be asked who told you you have a right to overthrow my word and they are yelling you have a son or daughter when they could very well be carrying someone intrasex three sexes people dont ever forget how those babies had their genitalia butchered to satisfy someone elses beliefs there are only two
i respect you so much shelley
i just want to smack the antiabortion protesters guess i shouldnt work as an escort then 
thank you shelly
until abortion starts killing these women as well maybe then they will understand
i am a christian but i irks me to no limit that these socalled christians are in direct contradiction of the words from the bible they are shouting at those women  that bible says to follow peace with all men and not just those who agree with them   the bible is not written for those that dont believe and follow it teachings  its for those who say they are believers and gives them instructions that governs their conduct toward others   they are suppose to be lights in a dark world but they are poor examples  and if i wasnt a christian there is nothing they are doing and saying to those people that would make me in anyway curious of accepting their god  shame on them for their hypothetical ways  i pray for the safety of all those escorts who have compassion for those woman remember it wasnt the so called sinners the cried for jesus crucification it was the church people
some retired  vets would like to protect the clinics ask them lord will and he send help
gosh what a surprise a bunch of old white men and a couple of white women trying to force their religious ideals on all women in america yeah that hasnt happened about a billion times since the 1500s
how is having a right to choose life when you vote to restrict someones basic human right to choose these anti abortions numskulls need to be in a cave locked away from society
fact you that aid the killing of unborn will suffer consequences because there is an afterlife and there will be consequences
but yet they believe in the death penalty
"the anti abortionist should teach fucking with responsibility so as not to create a life
keep condoms on penises and crossed legs for the ladies
yes very basic"
crazy people outside abortion clinics need to get a life live their own life with a little purpose cause dont make a difference  they just litter the sidewalk
"why does the christian taliban feel the need to push their magical sky god beliefs on everyone else

didnt they ever hear of free will"
i love babies who are born one of the twelve months spring summer autumn and winter
if a man thinks abortion is wrong then all of those en should be fixed immediately
you are an amazing woman please dont stop what your doing sending love from 
god is not going to reward you for harassing these women if you dont know that you do not know the lord
so much for the land of the free republicans are such ridiculous hypocrites
boy all this to make sure some unborn people die
"anti abortion protesters killing people is as nonsensical as it gets
pro life alright"
burn it down
wonder what they are going to move on to next
this might cause human extinction if abortion is completely banned in some states
as far as im concerned a baby is only a baby when it pops out crying  a kleenex is not a multiple homicide scene and abortion is just a more complicated way of pulling out
get ready for all the unwanted crack babies the ones born with severe mental and physical disabilities the ones born with no limbs the ones born destined forever to a wheelchair and finally in 16 or 18 years you now gotta deal with those that were raised in the foster care system what pro life group has the money and facilities to take in millions of unwanted kids
how many of them have adopted children or offered support financial mental physical etc support to women if they have the baby my guess 0
these people saying they will help what does that help look like are they going to fund the low income women are they going to adopt unwanted children are they going to help pay for child care food health care college
what an unfortunate job title  can you imagine applying for a job later in life with escort on your resume
its like they are only prolife when its a fetus in the womb these prolife politicians and citizensdo nothing to help and seem to stop caringonce the child is born children in america are starving children and woman are being raped and here these people want to force them to birth the child from that like its their fault or something its disgustingand honestly people should be ashamed of themselves mybodymychoice and its just creepy that men put so much time and effort into telling us woman what we can and cannot do with our bodies
prolife however they murder and execute the healthcare professionals how does it make sense
protest wont help much in usa your not in europe where politician takes citizen opinion serious and they will resign in the favor of the citizen usa you run and lie in front of the voter faces in europe if you do that you can be fire and resign in a year a laying corrupt judge is immune to being fired i guess they can change the whole country
i wonder if they get their animals spayed or neutered
notice how more than half of the anti abortion people are men people that never have to make the decision
so governor asa is bragging about all the wonderful services his state will provide to women enslaved by his state to produce children for his future workers these women did not desire his services they were not looking forward to his services and they may hate that their stateenforced slavery against her has forced her to receive these services he loves making women his slaves he worries about the life of an unformed human but he does not give a damn about the real life of the woman who is pregnant in reality gov asa hutchinson rark is a murderer of grown women and he loves that about himself
any monster who could serial kill their own children has serious and extreme mental issues
i bet a lot actually had or paid for abortions and are hypocrites vote blue everyone and stop the radical republiecan agenda
this woman is a phenomenal woman
"gotta love the woman saying every woman has the choice of life
but no other choice is available"
im a conservative and pro choice im against abortion but telling a woman what she can and cant do over rules my feelings on abortion these people that stand outside of clinics and yell at these women need to get a life they should thank god shes there and not me
"why arent these people supporting universal healthcare and education why arent they fighting for guaranteed maternity leave and childcare assistance for working moms
why because this is not about life this is about controlpatriarchy"
god bless you shelly and the doctors at this clinic and all their staff for your assistance to these women in their most difficult times  these protestors are nuts and none of them will adopt a child so how can they tell someone to choose life when they wont choose to adopt
lamelet these people live their path youre not their savior youre not god let them be free in a free state dont be a lame trump supporter that guy is a rapist
i grew up 6 blocks from there dr carhart has a very interesting story women owe him a lot im very grateful for what hes given up so we can be safe
 4 of the 3 protesters were very old white men what is that about
the music really sets the mood
"i dont agree with an abortion just because its my body although i feel they should still have that right hey freedoms a bitch i fully understand that banning abortion only bans _legal_ abortions that a woman who has committed herself to not having a child is going to do whatever she has to by whatever means she can find which includes some dangerous and deadly stuff to not have that baby

ive always felt like the decision from a standpoint of well i just dont want this baby because im careless and never been big on learning a lesson or keeping condoms was a selfish motivation especially in a world were there are good couples who really want a kid yet cant make one themselves i mean there should be options in that case

but incest rape or a medical diagnosis that fully confirms the baby is just lining up for a miserable existence or going to endanger both lives coming to term thats just necessary and i hate to think a woman would need that and not be able to get it

people who protest abortion dont seem to realize that to prevent the one selfish case they endanger two lives in every other instance to protect one life that they _never_ really cared about in the first place or as carlin put it are just outraged that theyre never going to get the chance to stop caring for this baby after theyre born"
nice ticktok shame lol the chinese are laughing at you while doing the xi xi ping shuffle sometimes youtube is a wonderful place notice its people with northern accents most southerners are actually cool with having the right to choose except for the religious and maga hat minority yeah im glad we addressed the issues we were having here with nonsense
that guy calling her mom was as creapy as ive ever seen
can they feed them can they those kids they call life why dont they start feeding homeless kids first and get them education  them maybe  maybe  i will think if they really care
their bodies their rights 
no  one has the right to tell a woman what she can and cant do with her own body   not even a law past by the corruption of the supreme court judges
she was sick of the mentally ill so she posted them on tiktok should be the title here
"scotus by its dishonest tricks sided with those terrorists antiabortion the people must ask kavanaugh gorsuch and barrett to resign or at least to recuse themselves given that they lied to us and the debate must be resumed with the remaining judges a liar with a conscience is a liar who resign when caught on the fact to let liars caught on the fact not being fired is like keeping a broke engine in a plane except that here the plane is the country the court above scotus is the people and the people have to ask kavanaugh gorshuch and barrett to resign or at the least to recuse themselves in the debate which has to be resumed if not the us looks like being already a theocracy àla saudi arabia or iran
btw in my religion it is a sin to impose to people doing something with their body that they do not want that rules infringes my religion which shows that such a ruling is also completely anticonstitutional it has 0 merits the trigger laws should not be applied"
"why those prolife people dont go to protest in harlem or in the south bronx to gang members and tell them not to kill childrens and grownups there are real criminal out there that kills and torture other people for no reason 
i think those protesters will do better job with real criminals"
"god bless all you misguided souls beguiled by demons





"
thanks for covering this woman she is out here doing gods work if you see any of these comments maam just know you are appreciated by many people and deserve to be recognized by many more
its our bodies we can have as many abortions as we choose to jesus gave us the opportunity and privilege to choose if we choose to have abortions its our choice to do so i wish one of these people who is against abortions would approach me i would kill them
why doest anybody realize and bring it up that all these conservatives want to do it control you  period  they want to control you what you do with your body what you do inside of your homes etc   the saving of lives of the unborn is just a scam lies and a sham like everything else they say and do  they care a hoot about saving livesand i mean any lives except their own  if they really cared about lives they would do something about guns and ban them  so why doesnt anyone bring this  the real truth to their hypocritical faces and to them  the proof is right there for everybody to see it  all else is whitewash and hogwash
bravo to shelley these mostly are men that are anti womens rights
america is 
these are the real heroesgod bless themand we all need to vote in november to stop this madness because this is just the beginning of all this shiit
its always the people who dont have wombs or no longer can use their dried up wombs that are so concerned about another peoples bodies and its beyond disgusting
the worst thing we can do to another human is to assume we know their lived experience if you want to affect change in the world stop harassing people and go look in the mirror and start with yourself
why is it anti abortion terrorists are almost always men
either be prolife or youll be killed yeah that logic checks outsmh
what kind of help theyre going to help raise it feed it clothe it educate it or they just going to give her a pep talk you can do it
the atlanta olympics bomber was part of the christian identity movement and also bombed at least two abortion clinics killing a cop in the process rightwing extremism is by far the greatest terrorist threat to the us today its also sanctioned by a growing subset of the gop
this is a repeat from months ago  not news
"i love how people think its ok to kill an actual living and breathing female over a fetus that cant breath on their own i was brought up believing in god i still do but these religious extremists are actually insane stay home its not your bodu so its none of your business these are the first people to not have their tax dollars go to welfare they are the first people to judge a single mother because their husbandboyfriend has abandoned them because they actually had the baby the first ones who abandon these children when in foster care those children are abandoned by the church and state the antabortion people are ignorant if they believe one second that their freedom of prayer in public is not in jeopardy now they are severely mistaken i hope they have to go pray underground or in an alley  some day they dont realize this is more than abortion its a freedom and civil right being taken away it leave us as americans venerable to have all our freedoms stripped by the way justice thomas is a sexual devient he is the devil incarnate below is verse for you false prophets and religious nut jobs since you like to quote the bible

matthew 715 beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves"
these protesters are going to meet their maker satan they are literally doing the devils work and they are acting as if god would be proud the bible directly says not to do this type of tomfoolery that he is the only one to judge it encourages the slaughter of women and children who do not agree with you because they arent christian how is that worshipped or when lot throws his daughters out to the town to get red then they both impregnate themselves by their father this is what prolifers want disgusting if people actually sat down and read through the bible they would find a majority of it makes no sense and is absolutely amoral
so much mental illness why normalize it instead of helping them maybe margaret sanger was right
the audacity of a man taking this stance 
these bible pounders deserve some lead
dismantle the churches topple them they are sources of antilogic and abuse dismantle them
lmao shouldnt you at least be capable of getting laid before you have an opinion on abortion no way someone is throwing it in that
postnatal abortionists i hate them all
"its funny not that ive never heard one of these forced birthers advocate for services for families and children it feels pretty hateful to women when you wont support kids and families but impose your will on them

freedom is weird in america you have the right to a gun and to shooting kids but women and families cant make decisions about their families you guys are messed up freedumb thats what that is"
all these pro life idiots are so pro child abuse its disgusting  how they want more unwanted and starving children they dont want healthcare for babies  no food for babies  sick
"romans 12225
king james version
22 professing themselves to be wise they became fools

23 and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things

24 wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves

25 who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen"
total biased coverage  another slow day for cnn
"abortion   killing unborn babies

call it what it is "
this is what social security is allowing
the ban on abortion does not go far enough an ban on male masturbation is needed sperm is life and these men are look suspiciously guilty
i believe in abortion but i have limits i knew a girl a few years ago she had 2 weeks before her baby was to be born her and her boyfriend broke up she went and got an abortion i dont agree with that she was only a couple weeks from giving birth the baby she said they cut the baby head off before they pulled it out i havent talked to her since i could never let some chop my baby head off and pull their limbs off if thats what really happened thats disgusting i cant agree with it
if a woman does not want to get pregnant just dont spread legs or take contraceptive pill to not get pregnant omgosh   killing babies is just another crime
when your state seizes control of a persons body and forces that person to make a product for the benefit of the state that is slavery throughout history the most despised form of slavery is when your state enslaves women and forces them to make babies that form of slavery is called baby breeding slavery it has been reviled for thousands of years and now baby breeding slavery has been forced on our united states
they are harassing not protesting there should be laws against that call the police
"wheres le harassment is legal distress lord of the flies sub 
how much treasure  resources do these antiabortion protestors give to children  their parents"
for once i would advocate for holding guns to protect the clinic
thank you shelley you are the actual source of love to those women not those very ignorant people outside
shelly is a very brave woman  we could use more like her
"women in america think that they have it  better than women from other countries sorry  even other countries realize  women  deserve a choice  
these protesters dont care about  the abandoned children sexually abused children and children in foster care"
please dont stop we all need more people like you love and respect coming your way
very courageous thanks for what you are doing
abortion may be wrong to some people but the thing is its that persons life n choice what they want to do worry about your own life n let people do what they think needs to be done with thier own body
once your born your on your own
those anti abortion activists are so ridiculous  mind your own business
respecto  respect and love for all of you 
these people protesting the abortions but none of them are willing to take these potential children and give them a home and raise them after children are born they have nothing to do with them
50 of all fertilized eggs do not implant on the uterine lining  if god is the reason for everything why does god abort 50 of all babies
think about this at the next election   especially with all the rolling back of rights in the us
"they are praying but are they paying for the childrens needs for the next 1820 years as dr phil has said many times the childprotection services are broken in the usa 
every child should be wished for and none the result of their fathers neglect and irresponsibility give women the protection and services they need and stop male privilege  let women decide over their bodies and make usa a modern and developed country with some freedom and essential rights at last"
im sorry but on one asked to be brought into the world i surely didnt and if i had been aborted i would not have lived the hell on this earth
let me throw out a bizarre thought recognizing this is not even reality but let me throw out a thought what if the government said men no longer could have vasectomies what if the government told you that you had to father children and being those childrens life daily have complete support of medical food clothing schooling and should you not provide that you go to prison for the life that the child is on earth the responsibility always falls on the mother even when the courts get involved many many sperm donors managed to avoid taking their responsibilities it is time to make it an equal playing field rapist lovers one nighters have to take legal responsibilities or pay with prison time for the 18 years the mother is not the only one that created the child these men in courts and on the streets are so damn righteous i dont necessarily believe in abortion but men have to remember the government is controlling womens bodies it is time they realize that the government could take over theirs as well oh yeah men rule sarcasm noted
isnt this an old rerun i swear ive seen this same episode like 4 other times on cnn
based and abortion pilled
cnn inciting as always
this man has it right too many people wanting to kll babies instead of helping babies they want to kll themno help with sxual abuse and rape is swept under the rug but can make such a up roar to kll our babiesgirls woman  please stop listening to these people tricking you god help them alli know someone who has had this done and shes crys and regrets it everyday she says and wishes the truth would come out there using baby parts to their gainits a life threatening job meaning they take the babies lives
put the white fascist in prisons for they love walls make sure they have entertainment of recorded babies screaming kids nagging and screaming on intercoms all day long so they can be fulfilled  we know they wont need medical care as they did not want america to have it no hot food  homeless people cant get hot food they made sure of that so that should be the heaven that they wanted
all men saying this shit but dont bare no responsibility
there is no constitutional right to kill babies  that is fake news
these women will meet these children the children will stay in heaven 
wow those people are weard how can they think they have the right to decide  other peoples destani is that the free country 
"she is doing a great job
keep these nutjobs away from the patients each patient has good reasons for getting their pregnancy ended and should be respected for their decision"
dan i am the result of date rape and the subsequent abuse i endured by those who claimed to love me should never be the result of an unwanted birth you are shortsighted in your extremism
these pro lifers really love to resort to murder to get their point across
the u s is going down the tubes
what a bunch of hypocritesi wish they would use the same effort to ban ar 15 and make it harder to get guns that kill born again born little kids in schoolsthe constitution says freedom of religion yet republicans and most christians want to force christianity beliefs on pplagain what a bunch of hypocrites but wont fight for stricter gun laws and the ban of ar 15 which have been used to killed alot of born children in schools
be ready to afford baby formuls and diaper  ffie faraday future new ff 91 futurist  180000 suv ev preorder video commercial released thurs production starts by sept 2022 over 175 global ff 91 videosshorts
why is it that all the men protesting and harassing women only care about the fetuses and abandon them the minute they are actually babies there is more than a bit of hypocrisy and cruelty displayed here men will never have to make this decision so they should be busy supporting charities that help real babies it appears to be against their principles which are missing in someone who will never find themselves in that situation
these effing idiots should be held crimininally responsible for all the resulting deaths of pregnant women and financially responsible for the unchosen born
religious or not if you want to be a help help but dont be anymore of a burden to people you want to help just saying
"the men who are against abortion must stop fcking women and start fcking themselves
edit oh and praying is not helping just so you know"
i had an abortion 35 yrs ago it was the same shit show with especially men outside the clinic its not used as birth control and i dont believe in your hateful religious beliefs your hateful god or your bible thumping bullshit it is way past time to tax the churches since they dont understand the separation of church and state they have no idea what the fn constitution says except of course the 2nda and miss the well regulated militia part
religion is the practice of using nonsense in order to explain ignorance
when are these antiabortion protesters going to line up to protest against lack of health services for babies infant mortality is a thing as well as various serious health issues and social outcomes they dont seem to care as soon as the baby is born
"its so funny

libs of tiktok is singlehandedly dismantling the intersectionalist progressives  this woman is doing nothing"
 and theyre mostly males
hypocrites   they dont care just follow their evangelicals desires
i couldnt be a clinic escort because id just haul off and start throwing hands with some of these anti abortion people then im suddenly the bad guy for being brought to a violent rage by stupidity and ignorance brought on my a self righteous need to force the rule of their own religion on others
educate people on ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies stop having unprotected sex make contraceptives readily available
santa clause kills babies all the way up to delivery date wow
shelley and all others protecting pregnant women are so awesome  those forced birthers who hassle these women are pathetic and disgusting
the same nutjobs who didnt want to be told to wear a mask for their and others health wanna impose a pregnancy on women thats rich
these people are pro life until the baby is born  they couldnt care less about the poor the disenfranchised
abortion should absolutely be legal but third trimester abortions i assume those are only done whenever the child is severely ill not viable or when the womans life is in danger here in sweden abortion is not a controversial topic  it is absolutely the womans decision no questions asked however after 18 weeks you need a special permission from the national board of health abortions are not allowed if the fetus is viable and are generally never done after 22 weeks
"you could start guarding these places with assault weapons
thatd not just drive off protestors but it would win the gun debate with republicans outright
once a couple of republicans got aborted too theyd try and ban assault weapons so gd fast"
040why does this woman not say that she has never had an abortion   probably because she has had at least three of them as a teenager at this same abortion clinic  these abortions according to her are not her fault because if abortion were illegal she could have forced the fathers to marry her    if the clinic released her records would she sue   and would she be insulted if i said that having babies for the purpose of asking people for money is prostitution and should be so prosecuted
they are allowed to protest just like pro choice is allowed to protest but a right winger took it too far by running his truck into peaceful protesters protesting the overturning of roe im pro choice but im against abortion in late pregnancies there are gop that also want to ban contraceptives which means that women will be forced to have the child no matter what even if its a result of rape or incest as a medic i responded to a 12 year old who was having post partum depression a 12 year old these states that are making abortion illegal want to prevent women from crossing state lines to get an abortion as well charge the woman with homicide there are a lot of men who dont want to have children and with abortions being illegal then what do what others have done and beat the living day light out of the woman to force an abortion kill her to avoid her from having a child men have done that several times and if she needs to have an abortion because her life is in danger then who gets to decide if she is allowed to have it call a judge to decide if she is sick enough to have an abortion especially when its early stage or deny her and use her as an incubator and let her die after they take the child do we have to call marjorie taylor green and ask permission from her because the mother will die if she carries to term we all know she is so pro life right oh wait she is pro life for the fetus but once the child is born she doesnt care about the born child and thats evident with all of the bills she vetoed such as bills to help families receive formula mental health services gun restrictions and so on those she vetoed because we cant allow biden to get any bills to pass because we have to get trump back in office right even if it hurts americans trump is number one and the american people are wayyyyyy down on the list
"their right to choose life

as oppose to a womans right to choose anything else you know if you take away all their other options theyre not really giving them a choice at all

i want to kick these idiots in the head"
preborn okay preschool your fucked  george carlin
people really need to mind their own business and let people make their own important decisions about their life  they are the ones that have to live with it 
what about the sins they are commenting openly or secretly is this what their religion tells them is that their gateway to heaven
oh the outrage for the 11 killed what about the millions killed by abortion 
all of those anti abortion protestors are middle aged probably middle class white people
"so its okay for prolife advocates to gun down and murder doctors and staff at abortion clinics i call bullshi these so called christian do gooders are a bunch of homicidal hypocrites stay safe shelly and to everyone else please vote these corrupt sycophant maga republicans out of government and vote blue in november before they take all of our freedoms away
vote blue "
hey the vast majority of americans want legalized access to abortion and many of whom normally voted republican but not any more i cannot think of a better way to get couch potatoes off the couch and into the polling stations this november
we will defy them
so if blue states cant keep up with the influx of abortions coming in from red states should blue states turn away people from red states and give those appointments to people in thier own state first i think so they made their bednot us and when that time comesthey should be the ones forced to lay in itand have a baby they dont want
why dont all these complaining people go help poor already born babies
we are coming for you democrats we are going to take your rights awayone way or another bwahaha
vasectomies should be mandatory as it take two to tango
everyone for abortion has already been born
you call yourselves the land of the free but will not give women their own right to make a free choice but are happy to sell guns to any tom dick or harry so they can go round shooting your children at schools 
scotus is stacked with liarsrepublicans leaders dont care about people after birthcrazy stuff
"wow only in america do you get threats outsideof a medical institution and patients who need escort for 

youre gonna help you right now a prayer how about a truck of money to help support poor moms i bet they run away if they are charged a ton of money every time they shout outside of an abortion clinic"
this woman is a human hero the likes of which republicans will never have
mom let us help you how adopt the baby cover the healthcare or pray how about they put all of this free time into some real good and feed kids at a youth shelter then again i forget after the babys born their mission is done these escorts are amazing
typical bible bangers
"there are two bots following the cnn trying to troll everybody
one of them is lauryn green another one is auditing the epics they have the same computer that sends out misinformation and also trolls anybody that stands against justice fueled by putin and trump cronies
if you read this can you find them and report and if you see more bots you keep reporting them until one day there wont be any bots"
imagine being shelly mann you walk into an abortion clinic and say that youre pregnant if i was the doctor i would be in complete shock because there is no way
"i might be fucked up for this but when i was younger me n my friends would drive by rotten egg these types of protesters 
my gf at the time had a red paint ballon thrown at her for going to the clinic so i figured fuck it imma terrorize these assholes right back"
anti seems non violent however the pros are destroying property i see a left wing democratic pattern here
bro she doesnt even have a counter argument
wont these protesters be surprised when they close their eyes for the very last time and then there is nothing nobody a complete void  forever
"its not my body once the human being is alive inside its our bodies and america will protect that unheard voice

be responsible and abort before and stop thotting"
abortions are violent just watch how one is done if you can stomach it
amazing perhaps hypocritical how antiabortion protesters use violence in their socalled efforts to stop the murder of innocent children i say yall get your heads out of womens uteruses and mind your own damn business
"i will aid and abet abortions
made me cry"
herr escorting job is horrible i hate her
all these antiabortion people should pay a 35 tax that would then be used for rearing an unwanted child a  sick child or a child of rape and or incest i  can imagine how quickly they change their mind
"seems like a lot of women dont want to be accountable

the responsible women are not afraid of the hearbeat bill"
im not a woman  as you can see by my name  but i understand that having an abortion is not an easy choice for a woman
thanks shelley youre doing the right thing
"where are the women
the guys look so ignorant"
can she be arrested now  
good for u these people should not be allowed to do that leave our bodies alone
no surprise by democrat media no word about left wing mob vandalism and attacks
shelley is risking her life big time i wish her all the best
no surprise by democrat media no word about left wing mob vandalism and attacks
"educate yourself a little bit and youll become antiabortion after the heartbeat 
special cases are always excluded 

cnn found the least useful argument for antiabortion and perfectly planted it here

well its cnn"
you arent offering help maam you are making a painful decision infinitely worse its not your body butt out roe v wade balanced the rights of women to own their own bodies and lives with that of a fetus an embryo is not a fetus
religious nut jobs have taken control of our country
the thing is the antiabortion movement would receive a lot more sympathy if you heard kinder words from many of them with a softer tone and if you saw action behind those words the one thing we know for sure is while we have a lot of people who want to be antiabortion when it comes time to offer the mother of a child health care things change when it comes time to offer a child healthcare after being born things change when it comes time to feed the mother and the child or to help pay bills for the mother and the child or to do anything for the mother and the child after the birth of the child things change the same antiabortion prolife individuals you dont see them after the birth of the child for instance you see lots of protesters outside the clinics why are the same protesters outside of adoption facilities saying give those children more they need more why are those same protesters outside of medicaid facilities protesting for access for single parents you dont see those protesters pushing for more food benefits or better housing stipend for single moms but they push for the pregnancy to reach full term after that they disappear
dons picture of the as yet unborn full term infant is from the final scene of stanley kubricks movie 2001
the men protestingwow
if you dont have a uterus you shouldnt have a say on what a woman does with her body
these people are ignorant god got nothing to do with abortion they there is god so far god has not shown up
the greatest trick the devil played was hiding in plain sight   she is escorting them into the shower in away 
well first of all there is no god 
they are not antiabortion they are probirth and that is all  they could be volunteering their time helping children that have been born and are under resourced due to poverty  but instead they harass women with their religion  they cant mind their own business
mostly old white men fascist kooks
are these people prepared to take the unwanted babies into their homes and raise them as their own no way  they will not
this is what happens when you let religious extremists take centre stage enough already tax the churches
i think she is awesome for what shes doing please be careful and stay safe
abortion was never the answers for me but i was thankful to have the option im pro choice and im for taking care of the kids already here all those people screaming about abortion being murder  are the same people who complain about low income families getting food stamps and healthcare from the government they only care for the unborn and when the baby is born its fuck them kids its not about unborn kids this is about controlling a woman and her body  we need to clip a their nuez and band the blue pill make men start supporting the unborn baby as soon as she test positive if they abuse a woman or a child we start wacking that off too  matter of fact jacking off should be considered an abortion and murder of unborn kids
"women should have the choice to decide for themselves
as a christian i know for sure that our choices and actions in life have consequences but its the individual that must answer at the end of the day"
their right to choose life  they dont have the right to choose unless they choose what i think is the correct choice
nebraska abortion clinic im guessing closed today ha ha
but whats an abortion
"put them blast with their intimidation
i want to see the opposite happen in this country there are well known organizations sending out vans to trick women into these vans to tell them all kinds of nonsense and not given all the options available to them i want pro choice activists to go and find these vans and stand outside with pro choice posters and pamphlets with accurate pro choice information"
"abortion is not healthcare killing a baby to save your career is not healthcare killing a baby because you hate the daddy is not healthcare killing a baby because you had a onenight stand is not healthcare killing a baby so you can have fun  travel is not healthcare reminder 

whats more democratic giving 9 unelected and lifetimeappointed judges not lawmakers unilateral federal authority on such a controversial issue for which the constitution is silent or deferring to each state whose state legislators are voted in by the people

who cares how long something has been the law of the land if it was the result of a faulty interpretation

the vast majority of these my body my choice activists were totally fine with you being forced to take an experimental vaccine or lose your job your livelihood and your ability to put food on the table theyre phonies at their core"
the tolerant leftist
gosh they are ugly
its time to send the supreme court and antiabortionists photos of children attacked in their schools by madmen with war weapons ban arms not abortion i am sure more children in the us are killed by arms than abortions
when entitled people lying about shit they are not willing to have it done back to them
for being supposedly christian these antiabortion protesters have a lot of hate and a lot of time to waste
bah hathey got some actors because the lefties are making complete fools of themselvesshowing that public school taught them nothing about america and that they literally want to kill babies  good riddance to wierdo lefties and thier bizarre propaganda machines cnn  msnbc
i hate this lying hyhpocrisy they are protesting but they are not offering the women help and support after the birth of a baby that the woman and the baby will hve a good life they are not interested in the situation of these women they dont try to understand why are so many men protesting men are the ones who are impregnating women deny the contraception with condoms and many of them run away when they get to know that their girlfriends or wives are pregnant they dont help and support them especially when the child is born men you have no right to dictate women what they have to do i am impressed and greatful that still so many people protect these women who come to the clinic be safe and protected to the protesters dont think that what you has anything to do with christianity
all the unwanted children in foster homes that have been ignored by the antiabortionists are waiting to be adopted what will happen when millions more unwanted pissed off 18 year olds hit the streets with the guns they bought on their birthday we live in interesting times
these pro lifers never show up at schools after mass shootings wonder why    
welcome to white christian fascist america
we will help you no not financially but we will pray for you which is essentially nothing
theyre fking mental
love it  jesus saves the babies  yet the same jesus  kill all teh first born children  doesnt save kids from any childhood diseases like cancer  wipes out all man kind through floods killed countless in his name through religious wars and so on and so on but yeah sure lets call on jesus to save the children
sickening how does one rationalize taking a life in defense of ones religious belief wtf
sure they miss her at the job she doesnt have 
thank you shelley thank you
im fed up with the pro abortion protestors going insane in the streets tearing everything up again starting to burn shit down a pregnancy center
the idea that the majority of women who have abortions are burdened with feelings of regret guilt shame etc is not true to research it is the antiabortionists who project this on women and then claim it to be true to girls and womens experience
your beautiful baby its a boy or a girl err not any more it could self identify as a mushroom  and become a fungus feeding off society just like these self righteous ignorant morons
lol if he meets his maker he hopes he has mercy well i want to imagine that god will look at him and say sir you wasted your life trying to prevent people free will i gave people you wanted people to not have a choice and supported people that hurt need the help not loving thy neighbor and you want me to have mercy for you when you couldnt show mercy to your fellow man have fun as he pulls a rope and lets the fucker fall down to the deepest parts of hell
not prolife not probaby this is all they are antiabortion
instead of banning abortion men should be forced to take medication that has them shooting blanks their body my choice abortion laws will quickly change
"a week or two after my state abolished abortion rights a gal made the news she was raped by her uncle  his buddy
 their plea was simple enough they were strung out from smoking crack poor guys
 anyway this teenager was impregnated as a result convicting the crackheads didnt solve her problem
 the irony comes from the fact that her church paid for her abortion  the traveling expenses
 this child has been traumatized but can still grow up without the awesome responsibilities of parenthood
 the aborted child knows nothing but the real victim learned more than any teenaged child should ever have to"
the only thing that girl will abort is pimple juice
women that are anti abortion shouldnt vote since they want to be subservient to men and turn back the clock they might as well turn back the clock 100 years when they were considered property
some people have too much time on their hands  can we improve on public schools  system 
i wonder how many unwanted children pro lifers have adopted zero
"remove churches completely recycle bibles to make better stuff and youll remove the hate misinformation and highend ignorance and intolerance  by recycling bibles the rules for slavery and all the hateful and sadistic acts the bible god does wont be taught anymore or promoted  i do not mean by fighting gun fire or any destructive means other than taking the building down and dont built any others  ending christianity and all sects there of would slowly cause willful ignorance to end or at least not be passed on so much anymore

shelley youre awesome"
the antiabortion protesters look like a bunch of losers and look like they dont live in reality they are too lazy to help at a food bank or work at a community garden harvesting produce for food banks or to help senior citizens
abortions over hahaha lets go brandon
i wonder how many people in all that time have been killed in surrounding intersections perhaps they should start helping with other crosswalks also
no matter how you look at it 3rd trimester abortions are killing a viable living human being 6 7  8 month old babies are born and live long lives every day guess what im saying is i feel after 56 months thats a little person and should enjoy the same rights a brand new baby does im not anti abortion just feel after a certain point it should be off the table barring other medical considerations
they are more peaceful than pro choices protests
yes a little humor killing babies is hilarious
54 nobody asked you  great line
   thats what the neocons hierarchy wants    fewer babies of color to grow up and vote against them     these sinister mfers should be held accountable for all the damaged and dead women as a result of their incompetency and religious bias  our method of revenge    vote them out
"remember good ole prohibition and how well that worked
didnt detour people at all and it made drinking far more dangerous and deadly  home stills were killing indiscriminately  bathtub gin could make you blind  un like masterbation 
good old christians dictating your life for you"
"now if republicans dont support increased parental leave subsidized childcare increased wic and medicaid funding and availability greater access to programs for people with abusive partners minimum wage rates  just off the top of my head  that shows you what they really think of those lives they fought so fiercely to save if their masskilling enabling gun degregulation laws werent enough

the role v wade fight was devised and engineered years after the court decision as a way to turn evangelical christians into a unified voting block for republicans

women just lost rights in exchange for increasing the republican base and theres nothing preventing justice alitos willfully myopic justification from being applied to contraception gay marriage interracial marriage and whatever other culture war issues that socalled conservatives dream up"
that woman just said their right to choose lifedoes she not understand she literally just expressed prochoice
stop killing the living if youre pro lifejust a thought
"if not for these wonderful brave people this country was doomed decades ago 
what a wonderful human being"
i wish hed find a better fn hobby
unborn baby killers and supporters should have zero rights
i wonder how many of these pro life people also believe in the death penalty
to say it the short way those antiabortion activists give more rights to a foetus not yet a child inside of the body of a fullgrown woman that has in their eyes no right to choose they impose their ideas not granting any option of consent to the women having to go through this not wanting to know the story behind this act they impede on the human rights of those women i wish they had at least the decency to try to understand the human aspect of it seems hard though
000 oh my the language coming out of that mans mouth compare that to abortion activists night and day difference
"its there choice 
end of story"
anti abortionists get harassed and assaulted everytime as well
"action is the antidote to despair  joan baez             now is the time for action                           true blue tidal wave 22 and 24
 get active in the campaign of your choice knock on doors hand out flyers put up yard signs make phone calls donate engage in conversations"
these anti choice protesters have no idea how terribly self absorbed they are that old man is guilty about choices in his own life thinks the god delusion is gonna save his dumbass
"thank you for everything you do shelley 
and to all of the other walkers doctors and nurses that put themselves at risk everyday to make that walk less lonely and more protected you have my gratitude and respect"
i cant imagine having to deal with those looney toons each and every day
how many of these protesters are qualified to adopt not that i expect them to try
if this man feels that abortion is terribly wrong then maybe he shouldnt have one  let everyone else decide for themselves
save all the babies then after that sorry your on your own how stupid does that sound very
i am anti abortion but also anti taking advantage of woman  i want peace n my family to b happy i have experience gop extremism myself but also witnessed how slutty and disrespectful woman can be with their own bodies so what do we do
"excellent report  thanks
courage shelly "
the prolife people getting violent and murdering folks over personal beliefs in the freest country in the world im shocked  no the christofascist poss dont want anyone else daring to tell them what to do since their twisted and wrong interpretation of the bible is all that matters and the second coming of christ trump but theyll demand you to do and live as they say or youll end up getting assaulted or murdered man woman child it doesnt matter they will kill you and in their gods name which is the sickest part theyre like wonder bread plain mayo suburban alqaeda and like usual the bad guys think theyre the heroes in this story because their pov and main character syndrome is the one that matters we all have a long road ahead of fighting off these unstable selfish greedy white christians who are demanding our rights in one hand and lives in another because of them guns will soon have more protection and rights than our daughters
i dont want religious idiots telling me how i have to live my life
f12 f catholics f christians f republicans  f america  acab
they believe in a religion that says a women got pregnant without sex 
psychosis is not necessarily a moral issue for when he meets his maker
shelly doing gods work
why are they not helping kids in foster care the homeless the elderly wasting time on something that is non of their business
these protestors really need to get a life and mind their own fin business  they love to offer help  but not any money once that baby is out of the oven
bunch of hypocrites wont support universal health care wont help kids in need but think they have the right to decide for other people sickening
none of the antiabortion people care about the impoverished hungry children just their fetuses its fucking insane
"donating to charity
"
fun fact abortion is not a constitutional right im glad roe v wade was overturned
when i went to planned parenthood for a procedure  they had us come early and thank god because i heard they were vicious
this is inciting violence
the creepiness of old men calling a younger stranger on the street mom there is something mentally wrong with these people
i pray every day that all the christians will shut the hell upthey know everything but they dont know anyone except different versions of themselves
stop stealing the peoples vote let the states decide not new york and california
they should be lucky they dont have any one blocking the street or driveway where they cant get to the place
this vid is years old
"its nine of his business
go mow a lawn"
impeach the catholic taliban masquerading as supreme court justices prevaricatin varmints
only the most cruel sadist would bring a baby into this dying overpolluted planet and this dying corrupt country facing bankruptcy
i cant believe this is not called murder when its called double homicide if you shoot and kill a pregnant woman maybe they need to sterilize women who dont want children because if this is your decision instead of birth control you dont deserve to be a mother
what are these protesters doing to help the children that are already born  if they care so much about a child
"you are awesome 
crazy f in religious scum"
in downtown louisville kentucky there used to be used to be one of the only clinics in the state that would perform abortions i would travel through downtown quite often going back and forth from work and i always knew when it was a clinic day not because of crazies out with signs but because both sides of the street in front of the clinic and across the street from the clinic would be bumper to bumper with mercedes bmws and cadillacs no they were not there for a procedure they were there to tell the women who had to park blocks over coming in for a procedure that they were worthless human beings then they would get in their cadillacs and mercedes and go out to lunch i suppose
lead poisoning is a bitch
i never forget a pastor that went to see the protesters of his congregation they were doing in front of the clinic he was standing and listening to the antiabortion group approach to the people going to the clinic after he heard them he went and talked to an older woman with a sign on the other side god loves you she wasnt aggressive or yelling things to the people driving into the clinic he decided to wait and listen to her if anyone approached her when he heard talking with such a loving merciful  compassion and not condemning them and encouraged the couple to have faith the lord will provide and you dont have to this told them have a blessed day as they drove into the clinic and on the way out they stopped and thanked her for her advice and told her they changed their mind without yelling or condemning this lady kept doing it everyday and he kept going to listen  he noticed and confirmed how she was able to get people to change their mind except cases of rape incest and high risk pregnancies and even some raped victims decided to give the child for abortion and she gave them the information where to contact the people approached by the other side had no effect on the people driving into the clinic because of their rhetoric and attitude they didnt achieve what the lord expected to happen in his sermon at the service he shared his experience outside the clinic and he ask the congregation are you showing love compassion and mercy to these people when you go to those clinic he say what are we doing to help this people do we shelter or feed and support these women making a hard decision are we providing them support or have plans on how to help them because by condemning them we are pushing them away who wants to listen to you if youre yelling at these people or women he said the group started changing the way they were approaching them and not showing condemning signs think and pray how to do it if youre in this mission evangelizing and spreading the gospel are you prepared for it  because were sending or expressing the wrong message
odd that every time i see one of the religious whack jobs doing thisit is a man pressuring a female when it has absolutely nothing to do with thembut their brains are so atrophied it is pathological funny how they say the right to choosethat is 100 correctthe female has the right to chooseor well she used to have that right theological tyranny or lets say a christian form of sharia law is coming 
stop trying to steal the people vote let states decide not california a new york
a bunch of crazy people
how many babies have died
real christians and people that really care about children do not have the time to stand there because there are millions of children already born without parents without income and nobody care for them for sure not those fake christians who just want attention for themself
how many babies have been murdered
what about the kids being cage up at the border like animals being separated from their parents having that trauma for life why dont they go protest there if they really care for kids lives then lets do it for every single kid specially the ones thats are fully form and have a chance at life because they are already here
i love her
as a european seeing this makes me wonder how the usa can be calles a first world country we got amnesty spreading  awarness about you guys going baclward in time so much crazy religion what makes this different from extrem islam
"abortion was made for horror in abortion a mother is pitted against her child the madonna becomes medea and the child usually a symbol of innocence is experienced as an invading enemy the distortions of the pregnant womans body are mirrored in the dismemberment of the fetus and the helplessness and terror felt by many women facing unwanted pregnancy are mirrored in the unfeeling unthinking total powerlessness of the embryo the present is turned against the future the doctor works to end a life and the womb becomes a battleground regardless of your political or moral beliefs theres enough material there to give anyone nightmares

perhaps this is why abortion and unwanted or monstrous pregnancy have been explored countless times in horror movies comics and prose and horror has treated these topics much less reductively than one might expect approaching them primarily in emotional or visceral terms and secondarily in moral terms rather than primarily in political terms

there are at least three obvious approaches creators could take to abortionhorror the two ive run across most frequently are grotesquerie and grief horror focusing on a monstrous baby and horror focusing on a haunted postabortive parent i wont attempt a complete survey of abortionrelated imagery in horror these are merely observations about how horror has managed to address our intense and conflicting fears around unwanted pregnancy and the unborn

in the monster show a cultural history of horror david j skal argues that the 1960s and 1970s brought a wave of monstrousbaby movies which he links to the terrible birth defects caused by thalidomide and the growing movement for legalized abortion rosemarys baby  of course and the bodyhorror flicks eraserhead david lynch and the brood david cronenberg plus a score of much lesser flicks like humanoids from the deep and its alive and its sequels he focuses on the hit movie alien  the poster art for alien was deceptively simple and evocative a cracked egg in a dark void and the tag line in space no one can hear you scream  whether the space was internal or external was not made clear

these images reflect and perhaps strengthen the real revulsion many women experience at the thought of an unwanted pregnancy its impossible to spend five minutes reading an online discussion of abortion without coming across a description of the unborn child as a parasite or a tumor a mass of cells an intruder invader alienalmost a rapist

as anyone whos watched rosemarys baby can see the images of monstrous children recur in horror not because the filmmakers want to get us to donate to planned parenthood but because they tap into preexisting fears in the audience

but there is another large subgenre of abortion horror for reasons not entirely clear to me ive run across this other kind of horror almost exclusively in short stories and independent comics

these are stories about ghosts the return of the child who was never allowed to be born as with the monsterchild films not all of these works are very good f paul wilsons 1989 novella buckets  for example is an uninspired rendition of an obvious central ideathe children an abortionist killed returning to wreak their revenge tanith lees short story the abortionists horse a nightmare  reprinted in 2001s years best fantasy and horror  features her characteristic overripe prose redeemed by eerie imagery lee describes a pregnant woman alone in a country house who cant stop hearing the clipclop of a ghostly horse which once carried a rural woman who performed illegal abortions the inescapable hoof beats a horrific echo of the heartbeat in her womb both reflect and heighten her own fears about her pregnancy leading up to a bloody tragic ending

for genuinely artistic representations of abortionashorror however the best examples are comics alan moore  watchmen  v for vendetta  suffuses his returnofrepressedconscience horror comic a small killing with imagery of abortion symbolically portrayed as the destruction of youthful innocence

this symbolism seems to have escaped most readersdespite its ubiquity in the comicperhaps because of the comics equallyblatant leftwing political slant once again the force of the abortion imagery is best understood by reading emotionally and morally not politically

a similar collision of the politics of abortion and the emotional aftermath of the act occurs in jaime hernandezs flies on the ceiling the true story of isabel in mexico one of the darkest installments in the extraordinary comic series love and rockets  flies may depict a womans psychological breakdown or her encounters with the devil or both her abortion is depicted by showing a scene of generic creepy protesters outside a clinic the politics of this depiction might even be called antiprolife

and yet the story of isabels grief and partial healing follows a more complex emotional and symbolic logic her healing begins when she becomes the housekeeper for a lonely single father becoming part of their family although her maternal idyll doesnt last it effectively shows that both her abortion and her divorce are experiences from which shes still recovering the comic doesnt take a final stand on whether the satanic figures who stalk isabel are projections of her own catholic guilt and shame or if by her actions she has opened herself to visionary and terrifying experiences of the supernatural

i had expected to find one other subgenre of horror the horror of repression in which the focus is not on the monstrous baby or the haunted adult but on the social pressures controlling womens choices and circumstances john carpenter did a masters of horror installment called prolife in which a woman carrying a demonic fetus is prevented from aborting by her prolife relatives i leave it to the viewer to determine whether this explicitly politicized treatment of abortionhorror succeeds as art an understandably obscure french movie house of voices  at first seems like it will be repressionhorror since it centers on a woman hiding her unwanted pregnancy in a 1950s orphanage and is suffused with images of binding covering and cleansing however by its confusing hallucinatory end its embedded firmly in the second haunting subgenre

even david skal who often overpoliticizes his reading of horror movies acknowledges the demonization of fetal images does not lend itself to a simplistic ideological interpretationmonster children are not exactly prolife or prochoice but like the sick joke articulate unspoken aspects on both sides abortion horror whatever its creators political sympathies explores the fears and griefs and blood so often ignored or repressed by both sides of the political battle"
i love this woman
i wish this heroic brave woman so much love xx
it pisses me off to see these self righteous people terrorize innocent women  especially since these same people dont give a damn about the babies after theyre born they vote for people who reduce assistance for poor people in regards to healthcare financial aid and the pregnant women dont get prenatal care for free but these terrorist protestors dont care equality now for women our bodies our choices we wont back down  we wont fo back
absolutely  disgrace the american taliban forcing their  evil beliefs
why do have to stop people from bombing killing other people because of a key word unborn element
"wow liberals heads filled with tds must just be exploding this week trump just keeps winning and winning and winning
1 because of 45 you have a right to carry a 45  stay alive
2 potus 45 keeps babies alive
3 because of 45 you can pray and give thanks that youre alive"
there was no jesus christ and theres no god just look at the people who say otherwise
"ok so you americans have totally gotten this all wrong it is really simple to get rid of abortion forever simply because every every abortion is always and only the fault of us men so if you american women want to feel safe then fight for a rule where every accidental pregnancy is to be regulated fined and penalized by those who in fact are to blame males 
see no woman in the world can be accidentally impregnated by herself there needs to be a male spermhosing villain in the picture and most reasons as to why you women get pregnant is either because the man impregnates you out of his egoistically acted upon the instinct of consuming the act all the way inside of you or because men rapes so the men should have to answer to every time he ejaculates inside of a female without her consent that is it if the men have to go to jail or lets say after one proven act of such accidental ejaculation he would need to be forced to undergo a vasectomy or even better after three times of accidental ejaculation such a man was forced to undergo a medical castration i can promise you that the american abortion problem would cease to exist besides criminally executed acts whether by rape or incestuous rape committed against any women and those would be much easier to legalize since it would not be from a onenight stand gone wrong seen from the females perception

so to all you american women there you have the way to go at this get into the true source of this male egoistical issue
and to you american men now that the women have gotten a new angle to look at these things be ready to show much more sympathy and restrain the outcome will not be as rosy once your females starts to take action against your longlived idiocies and old ways of doing things"
whats goes on in other peoples bedrooms is none of their business these antiabortion protesters arent paying these patients insurance or medical bills they need to stay in their own lanes mind your own business
i love her ive followed her for a while on tiktok 
exodus 212226 states in no uncertain terms that the life of the fetus is of lesser value than the life of the mother in the scenario in exodus if 2 men are fighting and a pregnant woman is injured such that she miscarries the offender pays a fine if on the other hand someone is injured then its an eye for an eye clearly the fetus is a not someone according to exodus
i love her thank you shelly and everyone who works in this clinic
shelley is doing gods work the personal decision that someone has to make to have an abortion is their own personal decision shelley is walking them in and keeping them safe
imagine never learning anything since 1973 thats what happens when you think you can get everything from one very outdated book
"i saw a priest explain that the overturning of roe v wade is the beast rising the beast rose in germany  hitler essentially became king the republicans are coming for all of our rights  freedoms 
vote blue
in november 22
save our democracy
vote no to autocracy"
thank you from canada    may you all be safe in the future
"and their right to choose life

cognitive dissonance thy name is christian"
selling babies and calling it adoption is a sin
i dont understand how people can kill babies and feel okay about it
keep on fighting shelley the evil troops of gilead must not win
i dont mind someone praying or trying to reason with someone until they say leave me alone then it is time to stop there should be no killing no assault no threat of violence of any kind verbal or written format it is not godly to promote violence and convinces no one to willing comply it only points to your opinion being wrong and not of god
so some fatty mcfat broadcast them on tik tok woopdy do lol
"if life begins at conception then child support payments should start at conception too 

regardless her body her choice
stay out of my uterus"
how is she getting tv time  cnn is bias they the devil feminist station should be abolish
while im not for abortion i would have to say at least she is nice about it but she is just doing her job for the clinic however taking part in something to murder innocent babies i cant go along with the problem with abortion movement is theyve dehumanized a baby to the point where its a thing and not a human being thats the only way they can justify what they are doing but if they really think about it logically there is no way they can be for it it has nothing to do with a religious belief its murder pure and simple there is no religious aspect about it
dan needs to get a life pos wont ever help these women just judge and try to control them
this lady is almost as much of a hero as that officer that took down ashley babbitt
in canada its illegal to protest near clinics because its not really a protest its more like intimidation and shaming and forcing your stupid fake religion on others
isnt amazing that the people who want to ban abortion also call for executions
so if all life is sacred men should stop performing self love on themselves since after all sperm is alive
those protestors are creepy
dan needs to get a life
these escorts are doing gods work not those morons protesting funny how they started in 1973  hmmm
"coming from denmark this is absolutely nothing short off horrifying abortion is a personal choice and nobody does it for the fun of it 

this is religious brainwash making people act like this its so disgusting 

thank you shelley"
my first job out of college was working at a prosecutors office   the first week i was there a little 12yearold girl was brought in by her mother   they were oldorder amish the horse and buggy type  the child was pregnant and she would not tell her mother who the father was and the mother wanted it investigated   to make a long story short after weeks of investigation blood tests etc it was scientifically proven the babys father was his grandfather   the little girl was raped by her own father   of course then the mother wanted the case dropped   the baby was born he was a little boy he was born with complications of incest such as severe mental and physical disorders and disabilities   up until then i had not believed in abortion   when you see it in person you have a different view
why are the vast majority of abortion protestors social misfits or just simply weird
abortion shouldnt even be an agrument
and american trying to tell afghanistan and the taleban to respect womens rights crazy world we live in
hail satan praise be the dark lord on this beautiful day of days may he guide and support his people in ways that god refuses to satan is the answer
"republicans hate women and children
if republicans are going to force women to have a child
then republicans should pay for that child  from birth through college
vote democrats"
old white men telling women what to do with their bodies whats new
i believe in free rights as a believer in god as long as no one treats these young women with malace oe employees with disrespect a life is a life we pray for the mothers and babies who are killed and will help if anyone asks for but no one should attack anyone not in the good book god bless everyone working in these places  going to these places may they see what happens to fetus as it defends itself runs away from the objects being used to kill it a being has a fight or flight reaction to danger maybe when going in for  consultation the parent should be informed and shown what actually happens before going with the final step if a women is raped yes abort if a pregancy occours from lack of a condom no abortion when a baby has less rights then a unborn puppy or animal there is a loss of human kindness
"in the beginning of the 3rd trimester a fetus is just starting to develop its cerebral cortex all the time prior every movement every action is done from reflexive behavior meaning it cannot think learn do any voluntary actions not even swallow at will it is in a vegetative state because its brain hasnt developed yet
that guys message on his van im 9 weeks old and started sucking my thumb thats reflexive not voluntary at 9 weeks a fetus brain is making neuro connections to be able to do these reflexive actions like sucking its thumb regulating its heartbeat blood pressure swallow these are not from voluntary thought its a survival reflexes development 
doesnt it make sense that a brain would first develop survival reflexes then the ability to think well it does our thought process to do anything voluntarily comes from our cerebral cortex and that isnt even developing until late 2nd to early 3rd trimester"
thank you shelley
violence against women will sky rocketbecause they are pregnantunlawful termination of a pregnancy the wackos dont need abortion clinics they dont use them already abuse works well enough thru a man madeup miscarriage to terminate a pregnancy  and they get away with it
i commend her on not running the protesters over so tempting they have no right to mindf these girls and women coming in for a very difficult and painful decisionprocedure nobody makes that choice lightly and i dont think thats gonna get the protesters in the pearly gates
thanks to those who fight for womens rights positive vibes from new hampshire remember to be kind to each other and yourself during these trying times
why these protesting people think they can force their beliefs on others and cant mind their own business is beyond me they are protesting against private citizens not government
these religious types are completely out of their minds which is fine but they want to make everybody else mad as well thats what makes me want to puke
looks like well have another fat libs of tick tock to laugh at pretty soon
what you need to do is have good guys with guns to help escort these women in to get the help they need im tired of these trumpsters and their bible thumping snake handling ideas its time to put them in their place and make them feel intense fear for once time for the tables to be turned on the trumpster taliban they may need to experience a real red wave themselves
"they only seem to care about them before they r born most of these extremists r republicans its republicans that r constantly trying to reduce public programs or cancel them altogether 
wheres the help during  after will they pay the prenatal doctor visits the 40000 bill to give birth in a hospital what about support for raising the child family support programs food diapers clothes schooling childcare medical bills for the child
they only care before they r born then again at 18 when they can sign up in the army to die for a political reason thats usually just to benefit rich capitalists that just want to control another country to make more money 
then if they return  have medical needs or counseling the support for veterans is yet again something the republicans r trying to defund or or even cancel 
before birth service to their country is the only time these people care the rest of the time the mothers r on their own 
support equal funding for public programs  military maybe then there wont be so many women feeling they have no other choice 
even then her body her choice"
god bless these men for doing the lords work here is a thought take responsibility for your actions killing your baby wont just poof make your problems go away
these folks crack me up so worried about an unborn fetus yet wont do anything to help that mom or kid when its born yet they scream their religion yet do again do nothing to help who cares if the constitution doesnt cover abortion neither does your bible love how they scream my body my choice and this is america i have a rights yet are fast to deny women theirs all these pro lifers should spend a day in an abortion clinic cause they have no idea how hard that decision is its not wheres using it as contraception
she looks like she eats the babies once they are terminated  what a disgusting excuse for a human she is a baby killer
similar nut jobs are out there screaming whenever i go for a pap smear its ridiculous
what the hell is assault with mutual consent lol
america is broken full of absolute freaks
congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof the first half protects the second half
"antiabortion protesters dont realize theyre poster children as to why some babies shouldnt grow up

no i do not care"
theres nothing moral with the bible its not even debatable its pure crap
the self righteous mindless antiabortion protesters think murder is okay how does this paradox fit their faith jung explains what happens to their feeble minds when they cant see the truth of existence
this woman is a hero the forced birther protesters are a bunch of delusional perverts and need to be exposed
to all those states banning everything dont forget to ban vasectomy
this is why im an athiest this is why it shouldnt be a religous or a political agenda for abortion this is a medical right for a woman to choose its hard enough carrying a child to term what if the baby had ill effects or even the mother would you think a 12yearold is raped by a family member or a teach then is forced to have the child herself think of the pain shed go through telling it to stop its like the antivaxxers who was against having a vaccination andor a mask then its ok to force a woman to have that baby you know not all sex is consensual right
theyre against abortion they prefer filicide babies must be born we need more to stuff our churches and orphanages with a variety of choices of children to rape plus we need more fresh slaves finally we need the rest for target practice
whats crazy is you bomb an abortion clinic killing those still unborn fetus youre crying about how ironic
its usually old white men who oppose abortion rights wonder why 
mostly bible thumping self proclaimed christians twisted mess of human hypocrites i believe in pro choice dont like it dont care
these people are weirdos
its better to be alive and poor and then to not exist how many great people rose from poverty
those antiabortion demonstrators are some sick people  i wouldnt  trust them with my kid 
prolife murderers way too much inbreeding
wow what will those self righteous jerks do with their time now that roe is overturned hopefully gather aid for unwed or poor mothers and children  but i have a feeling they will find other powerless people to oppress like lgbtq people
i had an abortion it was the best decision for myself and my family ive never regretted it a day in my life i was able to finish college meet my husband and start a family when we were ready both financially and mentally i went on to have two beautiful children that i love dearly my kids have never known poverty or instability because i was ready to start our family they have a wonderful life because of the decisions i made only i know whats best for my family i will fight for this right for all women we must have autonomy over our own bodies its a basic human right that ensures we have a say in our future
throw away your stupid signs and save a real child from our foster care system advocating for a mindless blob of cells while actual kids are being abused
have i got this right  people were murdered by prolifers well that sounds absurdly  hypocritical
the first guy looks like the goon that the scoobydoo doo mystery squad catches and takes the mask off if it wasnt for them meddling kids
i wonder how many boxes of pampers cans of formula pairs of shoes or groceries do any of the protesters buy for any of the mothers they help
shes great and dan needs to stay home to have his movements
im sick of these self righteous people who think they know whats best for everyone else  if you dont like abortion dont have one
mind your own business nobody forces you to abortion would a man like to be forced castrated womens body womens choice
011 aint that the pot calling the kettle black
whats wrong with people trying to deter parents from killing their child im truly sad and confused that so many are fighting to kill children the irony is if our parents aborted us we wouldnt be here
so they have the right to choose life bs they are forcing their religious beliefs on others scotus has taken away the right to choose  it is being forced on women may karma come back on scotus in full force
the antiabortion thugs should focus all of their energy on getting kids who are in foster care adopted to families what they are doing is pure harassment  nothing more nothing less
i think its time for people like her to use guns as a protection
why are these men protesting when theyll never have to be pregnant give birth or face having an abortion
i think everyone has the right to their opinion
we as a people now have a choice we are slowly gaining back our power for both man and women we must get out and vote more hopefully this will not get any worse prochoice
such a brave amazing lady all my love to her
in my country it is illegal to protest outside of abortion clinics i feel so badly for the women who go for medical treatment and get harassment and worse the church has no business in healthcare
the realistic picture is that abortion was not enough for liberals  they kept pushing laws laws more and more and more  many countries have abortion laws that ban after 12 weeks  liberals kept pushing and in some places it was up til due date that you can kill the child and yet it still was not enough  so many people on the ropes about abortion jumped sides and liberals did this to themselves  really a fat white chick with a black beanie and glasses is such a cliche  stop trying to hard sistermake no mistake that these liberals are the system and are what some refer to as the man  they are the ones with the top 1 backing them so make no mistake of them playing oppressed  planned parenthood made billions of dollars aborting babies and selling their body parts at 100 profit  as to my fellow black americans stop letting liberals from rich families and ivy league degrees control you  these rich whites are using your skin to empower themselves while your skin tone blocks for them  stop working for the man
next time we should  hand them a baby and ask them to adopt right there and  they will run away so fast even a 80 year old man there who has arthritis will not stop running
i personally do not like the idea of abortion past 15 weeks but its still a personal decision that is nobodys business except for the woman having one if the u s govt were to put more money towards reproductive education in the schools and make birth control more accessible and affordable these idiots that protest outside of these clinics do not have te patients best interests at heart  most of them have been brainwashed by their religious institutions and misogynists
maby they should go helo the homeless feed people a lot more good could be done than waisting time protesting adpot a  anorted foster kid rase them instead of harassing women help not harm
thank you shelley  you are a heroine to these women and you do make a difference in their lives keep abortion safe and legal
these republican states are forcing women to have babies just for the state to make money off the babies thats all it is think about it if that person didnt want to baby and was forced to have it and still doesnt want it who takes care of it the state and then their orphans to their 18
all those people both the protesters and the lady recording them are extremists both i say yes most people are not pro abortion meaning that we dont see it as a good moral choice for  contraception most people would be fine if it got banned as a do over for people who decided to have sex and ignore the mountains of contraception methods out there however most people also believe that in cases of incest rape or medical necessity abortion should be a viable medical option again i said most there are plenty of extremists who would be fine with abortions up to the 6th month or later for no reason at all and others who would see rape victims bear their rapists children against their will if you live in a state run by extremists leave as soon as you can drain them of population and resources
ban abortion all over
the us taliban what a bunch of sickos
use luke 630 against the protestors it is jesus talking to his apostles telling them how to behave when they are out in the world representing the faith he tells them give to anyone that asks something from them and do not demand back anything someone takes from them get them to read the passage they have a bible and then start asking for their things usually they will refuse but then they lose the illusion of the moral high ground as they turn their back on jesus it creates a delightful amount of cognitive dissonance for them
this lady contributes to death every day for money and dress in rainbow colors leading women to murder theyre babies
to much violence in this worldi pray for peacenothing ever constructive gets done by violence
"cnn 

 roe v wade down 
 right to right 
 donald trump "
this is a reupload lmao
cnn  still scratching the bottom of the barrel for higher ratings  hey  heres one for ya   try reporting on the open southern border  you know where thousands of illegal migrants cross into the country   then given a phone for tracking  money  food  clothing  medical care and transportation through out the land  damn sounds like human trafficking   surely the biden  administration is not guilty of human trafficking  or maybe the fact that over 107000 americans died from drug overdoses last year   mostly from drugs like heroin  cocaine  meth  and the ever so popular fentanyal   try getting back to being americas news source  instead of pushing radical divide  and for god sakes get off the jan 6 circus 
they dont care about life they care about imposing their own opinion on everyone else
do these realize if women could easily care for a baby they wouldnt be here
where the hell do these worn out old fools get off yelling at young women they need to be herded into an asylum
yet none of them can answer the question of what to do with a 12yearold thats been impregnated by her father these people do not live in reality and they dont have to deal with the child once its here
those people are lucky they have no drive by shootings
but why is it only in america the issue is intense and the procedure is very prevalent so to speak should not this overall thing would be rare case i am confused herereallyi am prochoice i guess but why is it such a frequent phenomenon like some flue or some common cold there is fundamental problem in education of reproductive health and focus on preventivecontraceptive is glaringly and evidently lacking
adding a bit of humor what is funny about cutting a baby into pieces to throw in the trash or sell for extra cash
dan what are you going to do with yourself now that youve lost the one thing that gave your life meaning time to kick it
"this is an older video these people are celebrating today im sure but its funny how a lot of them are men people who are always telling women what to do now their is no choice no women who have ectopic pregnancies or non viable pregnancies who medically need an abortion or it will kill the woman are now not even an option in 25 states how dare the extremist supreme court take away rights that have been established before the five politician gop justices were in high school was stripped taken done doctors being jailed in america and women being second class citizens again in 2022 is sick the gop claims its to save lives and thats why they did it then tell me why justice thomas just stated that he is going to review same sex marriage same sex marriage isnt killing people so if it was about saving lives they wouldnt be coming for these other rights the united states is no longer free the gop are taking away your rights to learn about critical race theory they are banning conversations about lgbtq topics they have no issues taking away first amendment rights and the rights of 150 million women and for birth upon them and scream about protecting these unborn babies yet the moment you suggest sensible gun control measures to save these babies being born from being murdered in their classrooms your infringing on their rights funny how that works guns have more rights in america than women do the gop wants to protect lives and children but they vote against universal
childcare and universal healthcare they vote against mental health funding yet they scream
that its not a gun problem its a mental health issue then fund it stop voting against every bill written up by dems just because you dont wanna piss off daddy insurrectionist trump we all know none of the house or senate gop have a back bone their concern is losing their donations if they go against trump and then losing their political careers which in turn they lose their power 

remember that when your wife daughter sister etc comes to you and says i was raped and im pregnant but the baby wont survive and neither will i if i give birth because its an ectopic pregnancy you better tell them goodbye because thats the new reality if you live in a gop ran state welcome to the 1700s folks thats the time frame of the book quoted by the supreme court as to why abortion should be over turned they want to go back to the bare bones of the constitution where the word she isnt in there one time where women were property of their husbands and couldnt vote and when anyone of color or any minority could own property or didnt have the same rights as white men thats what the supreme court thinks the way america should be dont believe me read their opinion piece and then look at america today and what theyve done theyve pushed their person and religious beliefs on 350 million americans in a country founded on religious freedom funny how that doesnt matter anymore to them but the constitution does they pick and choose to make minorities suffer the white men must prosper in the new america and america i want no part in at all"
is it allowed to have a tall ladder on public land without permission
maybe they should be on capitol hill fighting for expanded medical and paid family leave  and daycare
do these protesters have anything better to do with their lives likely not
dan clinic protestor dan chronic pester dan child molester dan cancer fester

they are a pack of religious nuts should on medication they been at abortion clinics for years it a disgrace that the supreme court is allowed to stop abortions my body my choice
these christians are incredibly cruel a slogan im going to begin using mind your own business which is what conservatives have been howling for decades
how tf can american law makers make decisions on the human bodyhealth without studying above high school biology makes no sense if you even took a course above high school bio or listened to medical professionals they will understand how important abortion is to the safety of wowan absolute fools
hope dan understands the lord has killed babies
people do you see all of the bots putting spam replies only on the objectionable comments
eleven dead under gunfire but their pro life
i love how these people keep saying  unborn  children and dont realize it is a contradiction in terms how can you be a child if you arent even born
shelly works for satan himself its seriously beyond sick satanic and dystopian theyve normalized murdering babies the fake news is mostly to blame they normalize it its so demonic wait till everyone finds out they put them murdered babies in your pop food and medicine buckle up cold hard satanic truth is upon us all
the anti abortionists withheld their names for the press and the cameras today  they can act like mentally ill narcissists and damage other people with their words but they wont share their names for the world to see
dan the man should mind his own business can he get pregnant no so he should move on and enjoy his life doesnt look like its going to be very long
the us has become a country of dumb ass misguided
antiabortion movement is nothing but the disguise to take womans right away muslims mainly take womans right away or women are considered not having equal rights as men
cnnfull of godless lefties
"choice comes before you get pregnant use birthcontrol abortion is not birth control
    all the prochoice screamers need to shut up and practice thinking instead"
these people are selfish deep down they want god to praise them when they die lol
"guess those protesters believe that when a body dies the soul dies with it they must be terrified themselves at the thought of us along with our bodies simply vanishing forever
they claim to be there in gods name too shame on them and why arent they offering to adopt and raise these fetuses themselves they want to force pregnancy but wont take the baby whats up with that
i say they start working on taking care of their own issues and quit putting their stupid beliefs on everyone around them 
shameful"
the good lord is going to ask you why you were so evil
"larry on ladder mom let us help you
shelly absolutely not no one asked you
i love it "
a gift from life apparently all vegans what i and i jah admire about the gop and maga is their consistency in heretical blasphemous hypocrisy tucson arizona sonoran desert  jah sisters jah rastafari 
the anti abortion people need to mind their own livesstop forcing your views on everyoneyou ignorant hypocritical selfish waste productsworry about your own life not a strangers life
11 people have been murdered by antiabortion terrorists eric rudolph bombed all those people at the olympic stadium olympic bomber ruined so many lives well it worked he got what he wanted
why are these activest old white people or women no one wants to have sex with wilmrbadguy
shes angel
most are old men past child making age
imagine being upset that you cant murder a little baby growing in a mothers womb what a sick sick thing
prochoice americans should push for legislation that requires states to identify thru dna or whatever who the father is asap and prorate support for the child from the date of conception thru age of 18 if the father cant pay the state will now everybody has skin in the game
im sick of bulldaggers
these people are tormenting young women during a difficult time in their lives that is ungodly that is the opposite of christ like
these are the ugliest escorts ive ever seen
this big nasty lady has no worried about ever getting knocked up  lolits always the hideous leftists that nobody on earth respects that get out and cackle about womens right to murder
they could stand outside gun stores
"yeah its videos come on right after libs of tic tok bahaha hahahahaha
hoes mad
hoes mad
hoes mad found that on tic tok too"
why dont they go help those that are living and got gunned down
most of the time its men yelling outside the clinic they are so sickening
notice how the anti choice nuts are all men that nobody would ever have sex with
and how many pro life individuals follow that through as in anti war cuz that cost life
hope these people that want it stopped give money and have adopted themselves
i hope shelly puts the first and last names of the people harassing patients in social media
dan needs to adopthis maker will not give him a oat on the shoulder this is the nation of fatherless children  maybe he should preach to young men on consequences of pleasure and responsibilities of a sperm donation
pro life people care about children from conception til birthafter that god have mercy on their soulswe have no universal health care  and kids are massacred in schoolsby the same pro lifers
bomb threats thats some fucked up tactics
people especially men have no clue about a womans reproductive system and why we are fighting so hard    before any snide comments get educated  i do not believe in abortion just because but i do believe in a womans healthperiod  judge not that you may not be judged socalled christians
abortion is one of those things where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
didnt god open the first abortion clinic when the the nephilum came to earth and raped earth women just wondering
how brave nothing but a pole smoker
antiabortion protesters are selfrighteous and full of themselves they can shout at others and feel superior if they really cared about children they would be doing something about gun control they would be feeding the homeless they would follow jesus example jesus never stood on a corner and yelled obscenities at people
i wish i could stand with her outside i have alot of build up rage for these entitled people
i think its time we start picketing the religious fake abortion clinics with the same fervor the crazies on the right do abortion clinics signs can read this org kills women  stop here for a life of poverty
pro life till the kid is born no free healthcare no support for single mothers the narrowminded hypocrisy of these people is beyond comprehension thoughts and prayers never did anything for anyone and that is all they are offering as none of these protesters would even consider adopting a baby of colour as for their attacks on lgbtqwhen we have kids they are wellconsidered and planned for and well looked after
what an amazing young woman selfless trying to protect this women from this zealots we need to recognize their work
a question for the scotus many states are turning miscarriage into crimes  if the mother can be held accountable for harm to a fetus not a living being yet  then if mother dies as a result of pregnancy then cannot the fetus then be charged with murder  likewise this would mean all those that contributed to the death of the mother from the sperm donor too the doctors  right up too state officials that barred the mother from medical assistance by charged as accessories
guess i guess the christians forgot about the deaths they cause of the native americans boarding schools tuam baby deaths and the sexual abuse from priest
the republicans are not the american talibans the talibans are the afghan republicans
wtf you need protection 
"these people are hypocrites if you want to do whats right ban teens from having sex without being married  the bible says no fornication so why isnt supreme court banning sex and condoms 
they are hypocrites yes we should not kill but we should not lie fornicate commit adultery no stealing from others no bad words no violence no pray to false images and idols  no blood eating yet blood transfusion are okay for them really when ur hospitalized tgey feed you through an iv in your arm so youre eating right there same thing w blood transfusions you are eating blood no corruption  no gossiping ectyet supreme court allows all that thats why i said hypocrites if theyre gonna base on the bible than do it 100 to tge fullest   conservatives tell their kids that thats its okay to have sex just to be wise and use condoms  really hypocrites if you tell your kids to keep their snakes in their cage and girls to keep their doors closed then their wouldnt have to br abortions hipócritas 
just as jesus said to fake leaders you hypocrites you say you love god but with your actions you repute god"
love this woman
help by praying lol
the same people who stand on corners claiming to be jesus
lets vote on it the majority of americans are prochoice majority rules
do they protest governors or court systems that impose the death penalty
those peoples are against abortion ask them you want those babies  and want to raise them you can have them
i live in rome and literally in the shadow of vatican city the seat of the christian church on earth women here get abortions with no one doing this crazy  america is a country built by crazy pilgrims that created a culture of mental neurosis 
"

hi cnn heres a good article "
youre being too polite with these anti abortion morons
he properly paid to do what he does
its so funny they say these protesters say will help you will help you financially its 100 bullshit
separation of church and state and no taxation without representation can all of the states that still want freedom stop giving our federal tax money to the states that want theocracy and chattel slavery
prayers are not  help
"judges felt they needed protection but over the years it was ok to kill doctors workers now texan to be paid bounty money for womens rights and your right to kill us
now your mega to kill not just tgis but there is so much more ro come
blood on me mega hands
your god is not my god"
theres no evidence anti womens rights nuts care about babies they are karens that cant stand those who disagree with them and they hide behind religion because theyre cowards
the fact is unless you are the pregnant woman your opinion is completely irrelevant
"dear lord in heaven i come to you now in prayer for these poor confused would that believe it is ok to destroy your most innocent most beautiful and most precious gift on this earth please father i ask you open their eyes and let them see the error of their evil ways so that they may repeat before it is too late for i know the time is very near for your return and i beg you father forgive them for they know not what they do
amen"
i love when they say  we will help you  we will pray for you  because that works so well  praying lol
theres no hate like christian love  im so done being nice to their twofaced asses  and the universe is sick to death literally of their nasty violent misogyny and their thoughts and prayers
sad very   protesters if you are not going to help these people go home clean your house cut your grass read the bible love  your neighbor life starts at 1st breath  bless you sheli
the good lord will give you mercy if god is all omniscient hes the one that is killing these babies even though most abortions are performed on a clump of cells so you should probably ask why god is so violent
prodeath believer
"wow what a very courageous lady more power to her elbow and i hope she stays safe

these escorts are heroes unlike another escort that comes to mind hoebert4prison
righttolife protesters murder doctors and nursers and patients  yeah the pro life party think murder is acceptable as long as they do the killing
jesus never mentioned abortion they dont even interpret their own bible correctly and then they harrass people based on their incorrect interpretation at one of the already most difficult moments of their life
when baby killers thing the pro lifers are evil the world is upside down
that woman is a hero and has inspired me to volunteer to pro life individuals are the same people who try to force they beliefs and religion onto those who dont want or need it pro life is the same as being pro suicide to me before abortions women took there own lives drunk bleach or purposely fell on there stomachs how about we not go back to those dark times this is america not gilead
always amazes me how men feel they have right to protest   have never encountered a pregnant man
"the pursuit of the destruction of democracy in favor of autocracy in america has always been part of the conservative mindset but because conservatives polluted both partys it was difficult to isolate when most of them gathered under the gop banner during the goldwaternixon era the quest began in earnest as they realized their marginalization or extinction was inevitable because of their retrograde thinking  philosophies the main reason they survived was because of their support mainly to reap large campaign donations of the ultrawealthy  powerful while brainwashing their hoards
from the 1960s onward the undermining sabotaging subversion distortions and distractions began to fracture the nation based on republicans removing their dupes from reality truth  logic theyve continued to erode federal government competency at every turn via obstruction  violation of sworn oaths 
conservatives can celebrate most recently that they got what they wanted via hypocrisy stealing cheating lying perjury  there was a complete abdication of ethics  morals in obtaining this temporary victory minority rule is the road to fascism  should not be tolerated"
i saw this content before either early this year or last year odd
where were these people last week
really  to me these people really have no better thing to do but just attention grabber
"lets review abortions 
a woman makes the choice to either provide a new life with all the equalities of life which are limited in every country based on economy they may of may not have an living wage in
whole governments are against abortions yet not carpet bombing or nuking a neighbor in time of war  
does anyone besides me see the irony in that  
so my personal opinion it should be a womens choice 
final statement on this issue by me 
mr stormy c natero"
the socalled pro life religious tyranny killing people deserve to be sent to guentanamo
maybe the antiabortion protestors should be confronted with images of children who were victims of gun violence and asked why they support the murder of innocent babies
usa is now a theocracy a country with religious laws controlled by religious people just like you afghanistan a superstitious third world country and thats the new norm for usa no healthcare no childcare hard to organize and now this wtf people you are moving in the opposite direction of every modern nation on the planet being unique isnt always such a good thing
maam please stay safe yourself
what a woman with so much hate in their heart so much evil shes attacking an elderly gentleman who has the right to speak his mind what kind of monster attacks pull old people what kind of horrible person can have this kind of hard to attack and spread her poison to all people who are protesting their rights of freedom and liberty what kind of evil lies in the heart of a woman like this whos so aggressively in humanely is attacking the elderly
why special abortion clinics why not just go to a regular clinic an abortion clinic of course will bring out the ignorant wonder if those protesters are going to pay to raise these unwanted children education health care food and any other needs they may have or i suppose they think the government and the tax payers will take care of those unlucky children born  get the protesters names and drop those anti abortion kids off on there door step people need to mind there own business
men really should not have a voice or a say in a womans decision regarding her body
so she thought that the antiabortion protestors who are prolifeas in preserve lifewould place a bomb at an abortion clinic you have to be kidding me 
humans have achieved so much for the past 2000 years but yet we still believe in religion
people that think god is ok with abortion are biblically illiterate
the catholic church will not baptize a baby until its born even though it doesnt believe an unbaptized baby will go to heaven  i know because im catholic and ive had this conversation with priests in the past and they agree that its difficult the most dangerous time in a persons life is in the womb as miscarriage is so common and yet even though the church believes life begins at conception its willing to play russian roulette with a babys soul until its born the catholic faith is a convenient scapegoat for these people and their agendas most catholics believe in abortion these daysthese corrupt justices are the outliers who got a plum lifetime highpaying job by doing the gop dirty work
hate is so ugly
she shouldve kicked that ladder
guss cnn cant  show the criminals trying to break into to capital of arizona why not show real news
id tell the antichoice people if you are willing to sign a contract that i get paid 5000 a month for 30 years to not get an abortion then i will not would love to hear all the excuses why not
leaving puppies and kittens in a box on the side of the road is worse than an abortion

today we have shelly whos happy to be part of an industry that helps kill 700k healthy unborns a year
no man no state no religion has the right to tell a woman what to think what to say what to do
those protesters should be protesting in front of their state buildings for support for these women they may not be wanting to have the abortion but there is no viable option there need to be better laws and education to help make abortions less of a necessity
threatening supreme court justices with violence is all on the pro abortion crowd thats perfectly fine with them
this woman is amazing interestingly they could care less for the child once born
hey dan how many children have you adopted out of the terrible government system well dan how many children have you taken care of cause none of us will survive when we get past ten billion people on earth
"it is insane
religious people should just keep their religion to themselves we do not want to be in your cult rebranded as religion
we do not push our beliefs or lack of beliefs onto you so why do you think it is ok  to dictate what that we should follow your cults religious teachings"
god will look on those who oppressed women as he did the nazis as lost lambs who chose evil in the face of compassion they will fall below the sinnersbynature the homosexuals the nephalim and the heathens and will likely be saved by gods grace alone

their help is the contact info of the state organizations that the politicians they vote for want to get rid of
i love her she cant keep silent these self righteous devout morons cant argue they can only shout they need to be shouted down
aborting a child is no light decision nobody has the right to dictate such a personal decision i dont agree with crazy whack jobs harassing clinics and ppl for their decisions its absolutely insane they all need to mind their own business im so happy im not american living in such a messed up controlling racist country
what a woman does with her body is between her and god you gotta be pretty self righteous to make it your business to tell someone you know best for them
what the hell is this garbage this is not news this is clickbait
why do we have an exception for democrats when it comes to protests  what happened to equal rights  dems think they are gonna run all over us i have news for you republicans are powerful people who also have opinions  dont tread on usyou will only stir the whirlwinds
what makes sense is that the federal government no longer dictates that states have to allow abortion finally each state can decide the will of their people period
ask these people how many kids they have adopted
seriously i would tell them to give money to these mom if they want the moms to keep fetus
its none of my business or these anti abortion folks business what a woman does with her body these people are theocratic nazis
355 cnn why dont you tell it as it is rather than half truths both sides have been known to have extremist tendencies not just the pro life camp pro choice have also gone as far as being violent and staging physical attcks at church premises too its only fair to be objective in your journalism except you decide to exercise your choice to report otherwise but then you dont get to give the world an impression that you are being fair when in reality you seem to be the opposite we see through the facade of both you and fox news
this is not about god so please stop putting god in this in the bible not one time did god force anything on anyone you always had a choice this is about a person putting their beliefs on another person
if we plot morality on a graph it indicates imposition of will is immoral also moral progress and intuition suggest this  making abortion immoral but justified  pushing your child out of the way from an oncoming car is imposing on ther will making it immoral but again its justified to stop a more severe imposition of will likely being death  this is not my hypothesis but one iv heard changing my view of moral being wellbeing
notice the left wants to convince you the anti abortion protesters are the crazy people theyre literaly saying dont kill babies how radical
hopes god favors him for protesting pretty selfish reasons for trying to control peoples bodies
"an imagebearer of god you say i seem to recall something in the bible about graven images what was that 
i consider myself an agnostic with leanings towards atheism and a lot of my decisions and choices come from having grown up in a catholic churchgoing family that actually read the bible and i would absolutely love to debate this ignorant hypocritical douche stain on the bible because he obviously didnt even know the 10 commandments"
they always shout well help you but they never actually do they look down on single mothers talk behind their backs and ignore them when they really need help all they say is the the lord will help you the lord wont pay child support though
shes got guts
wonder how many of these antiabortion protesters have ever shown up to protest a statesponsored execution written letters or lobbied to abolish the institution of death row or are even troubled in the slightest to know that there exist people awaiting execution for whom exonerating evidence has not been deemed admissable afterthefact in instances when they have been egregiously underserved by counsel and in specific instances in which they have been framed or scapegoated not a single member of the fivestrong roebreaking supreme court majority has ever ruled to give certioriari to a death row appeal amy comey bryant may be fervent in her faith but the phrase she has heard thoisands upon thousands of times protecting life from concepton to natural death means no more to her than to those cheering in the crowd at the crucifixion
im pro choice iv had an abortion myself but i would draw the line at 3rd trimester abortions unless its a life or death situation for the mother thats way too far along imo
"imagine if abortion was banned even of both have high probability of death

is it worth it for not to have it if one or both dead

dont say god wills it because why cant he made women lay eggs instead"
she has to check for bombs from pro liferswhat
i am from europe and have never seen in any country anyone protesting outside abortion clinics ever could it be the protesters are paid by the churches to behave in such a way if not then social reform in the usa is the only way forward the present situation has similarities to middle age europe
i bet not one of those people will commit to help these moms raise these babies for at least 18 years
surgically remove all living fetuses out of unwanted mothers body alive put it in a jar on fluid and send them to the pro life people they will feed it and let it become a wonderful human being
the man said well i want 6 children but his spouse said i dont want 6 children mic22
"americans were outraged when religious zealots took over iran and afghanistan and forced their religion on everybodyand particularly as they treated women like dirt

its sin  crime for white policeman brutality  white policeman to kill black young men  woman for no reason in america make tik tok video of that hypocrite
they can broadcast they clients too against violence hate in favor of love peace and god bless us
religion kills more people every day than any clinic
ya that makes sense advocate life yet rake away lives these ppl are unhinged crazy mofos
lets not mince words this woman is the modern version of nightingale any place with religious extremists like that who shoot a van or commit assault and then get abetted by a judge is no different than a warzone or a lawless zone this woman is a hero
so sick of these old white men and their stepford wives may they have others work against their rights awful douches
america is a christo fascist state
if society as a whole truly understood the supreme science of transmigration of the eternal soul our troubles surrounding this issue would end supreme knowledge is the cure for ignorance
all these pro life people should be required to sign up to be a prospective adopter then they could really help the children
the protester says we will help you what does that mean prayer how about financial support until the child is 18 that might work pretty easy to say we can help but without specifics its hollow
she is impeding their first amendment rights
good on anyone who doesnt support murder of innocent life 
it is a shame the church has weaponized their mentally ill members to push their evil onto others
praise god for this man who has the guts to spend his time on the front lines of hell turning these people away from murdering gods innocent creation that are made in his image
i remember how it felt when they were yelling at me when i went for my abortion it made a horrible time worse for me  however my escorts were so amazing that i felt safe love and supported when i entered the clinic i got my abortion and went home knowing that there were good people in the world and it wasnt the antiabortion people  those people will be judged by their maker and i do not think it will be good for them  shelly and the prochoice people will be just fine and get their angel wings faster

a bomb they are pro life how is this logical
all these protesters but not one will help with adoption they dont want ppl to tell them to wear a mask but they want to dictate a womans right
they need to mind their own business  stop worrying about what everyone else is doing  worry about yourself  the guys retired  the best thing he does with his life is hound women
my bet is not one of those religious bigots dont have any adopted children
the time has come to remove tax exempt status from all churches federally  if religious groups want to play politics put them on defense fighting to remain financially viable
the protestor said women should have the right to choose life women had that right already
wow never seen anything like this in new york you can just peacefully go get an abortion without any protesters
cowards who want to stop abortions but wont give up their names shouldnt be out protesting
"its irksome seeing all these  men  and i use this term lightly 
wish the men would shut the f up "
i think it is sad that people wont mind their own business they wont leave minorities alone lgbtqia community alone the things that really require their attention they wont bother to pay attention to like homelessness or people needing food that is what they should spend their time and money on if they are the true christians they proclaim to be
are they ready to take care of these children especially if they wont be born normal if they are terribly deformed then will they take care of those children

really do you have guaranteed universal healthcare for the child up to becoming a teenager no then you dont care about the childs life you just want to feel better for acting all righteous however even if abortion was legal there should be universal healthcare for all children and mandatory maternity leave and so much more america is a 3rd world country when it comes to things like this"
i truly dont understand why a person would wait until their 3rd trimester to have an abortion i really dont understand 
i hope they are also going to support these kids financial and in every other way once they plop out
the republican party keeping women barefoot and pregnant since 1854
one guy says that the unborn children are being violated and having their lives taken away from them  heres a guy who could be at a school mentoring and he decides to stand around outside an abortion clinic and harrass women as they enter  does he ever stop to think how traumatic it is for the woman to even come to the decision to have an abortion  my guess is probably not hes so arrogant that he thinks the effect is more traumatic for him
the republicans have now started adopting taliban laws  woman should have no rights religion has killed how many for having the wrong or misguided beliefs
hard to believe that people are  still willing to hurt others or interfere with their personal lives because they think there is an imaginary all powerful being telling them to do it isnt this a symptom of schizophrenia the old guy afraid to die thinking he didnt try to stop abortions sooner seems to have a hateful god that hes trying to brown nose what stage of evolution do you call this 21st century dark age lets make america medieval again

if we are a prolife country why do we have so many wars
well its funny that everybody who advocates for abortion has already been born they now regard good as  evil and view evil as good
i hope this apparent female isnt breeding  so that is a plus for abortion

essentially men have a deep seated hatred of women and seek to constrain their autonomy and life choices

a young woman had a late term abortion in cleveland the abortionist didnt remove all the parts of the baby that he murdered and the childs parts were left in the womb she got infected and later died from her infection dont let these people fool you abortion is sick and it stops a beating heart the health department has shut down so many abortion clinics because they are so unclean abortion is murder and most women regret having their child killed
i am 100 prochoice all the way but i dont like the idea of third trimester abortions unless its unviable or unsafe for the mother unlike these people i understand its not my choice and not my business especially as a man
pro choice is pro life second amendment is killing more than women having the right to choose
"gotta love the self righteous telling the righteous there being self righteous just then she says i dont think most people have a realistic picture of what happens outside of abortion clinics
perhaps thats partially true but they do know what happens inside of abortion clinics  you gotta love the irony of a person who isnt dead speaking out for the right to kill the innocent
the hypocrisy is mind numbing"

thank you republicans for saving fetuses and killing children
she deserves so much more credit than she is getting thank you for helping our women
both sides are nuts i am sick of these people fighting each other killing a child is a terrible thing but at the same time there are cases that it is necessary for this procedure however women should be allowed to make this decision with their doctors not by crazy people wearing black robes there has to be a responsible way to reach an acceptable path forward single mothers need more assistance if they are poor because the same states that want to be the saviors of children have the worse policies to support poor families and lets just say it having abortions because people cannot be responsible is not a good way forward childrens lives should be precious to all of us therefore both sides are nuts and i hate them both

if a pregnant woman is killed and the fetus or baby was viable at the time the killer is charged with double murder  why is it that a pregnant woman can have a viable fetus or baby sucked out of them limb by limb at any trimester  i understand that some pregnancies should be terminated but those rare pregnancies such as from rape or incest should be terminated as soon as the mother discoverers that she is pregnant and is carrying an embryo  not months later when she changes her mind and is now carrying a child
these women who work here are amazing  
"look how peacefully and nondisruptive those protestors are and then compare that with the climate change cultists and the blm and antifa crowd causing actual physical harm and property damage

they are pro life but theyll be the first ones to bomb an abortion clinic
the protestors remind me of zombies
