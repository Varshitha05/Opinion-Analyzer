"prolife 
funny that states with the harshest abortion policies also have barnone the worst social support networks set up"
so disgusting the anti intellectual puritan streak in the states
the majority of texan voted for him now they are stuck with him vote him out ladies
people of texas can only blame themselves for choosing the wrong candidate hopefully when its time for election they will not forget all these things and pick the right  qualified candidate
"she can leave texas to get an abortion and spare us the histrionics 
if she were really in desperate circumstances she would have not wasted any time on lawyers and court proceedings 
shes doing this for the drama 

its not unusual for people truly in need of lifesaving medical care to cross state lines to get it sometimes the facility best  equipped to meet your needs is in another state"
"i have not seen anyone who has a true understanding of what the texas abortion kate cox case is really about  

what we need to understand is this is not about protecting unborn life aside from religion  it has everything to do with religion the belief in gods will is very strong in the new republican party  the belief that we must accept gods will is absolute for them  we are not supposed question gods decisions and we wont always understand his plan  

if you grew up in a baptist household like i did you understand this but this dogma is never spoken aloud in the political realm you can accept medical help to save the babys life or the mothers life but line is  you have to understand what is gods will because only god can decide who lives and who dies  there is no reasonable way for these extremist republicans to answer this question in a legal or sciencebased sense therefore republicans will continue struggle with this issue and look like sadists to the rest of us  we need to bring this to the forefront as their weakness  

my grandfather was a famous southern baptist preacher from texas so understanding this deeply held belief is important  it is the evangelists mantra that we cannot understand gods plan so we have to accept whatever happens as part of his plan and still accept what he does as somehow a good thing  

we need to make them admit that this is a religious issue not based on science  they are making the argument based on emotion and pseudoscience but it is not really the basis for their desire to control a womans body  it is all about gods will and his plan and that is impossible to define because we can never hope to understand gods plan

i wish someone would talk about this  thanks"
for gods sake wake up america
so true second class citizenship like in the middle east where women cant decide their own fate cant even drive
and that goes for their own women
"just as the bible commands
christianity is a wretched thing"
2nd class citizens imply they still treat women as human beings on some level but this isnt the case republicans only treat women as their livestock and slaves
to bad we cant kick texas out of the union
the problem with abortions in texas is the fact you can sue the doctor over it if i were to perform an abortion and considered it medically necessary for the mother to live and she comes out fine anyone could still legally sue me in a court i could still lose my medical license because she did fine and the jury didnt think her life was at risk at the time of the abortion therefore no doctor is willing to perform an abortion for any reason
texas certainly has doubled down to make war on women  women still die of pregnancy complications or childbirth
"this is second class citizenship for women

gop response  and"
next state referendum in texas changing the name of the state to gilead
separation of church and state is still a thing except when youre female happen to be pregnant but in need of an abortion and living in the state of texas paxton is not a medical doctor so why does he feel the need to enforce these disgusting laws besides showing religious muscle this is a blaintant violarion of human rights

get your hajabs and berkas out ladies  if they get their way you will be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen of the master of the house
in the seventies the saying was  you have come a long way baby now the saying is we own your body and we will track you down if you try to leave the state or buy birth control that is a giant step back but i am a guy so if they are not united to vote out those want them to be a second class citizen then i say too bad maybe they will want them to cover up like muslim women in the next election women grow a pair if you want to be like us texas is still red with abbott  paxton and trump with a lead in 2024
reminder the equal rights amendment has never been ratified
i wonder how long until the texas  misogynists decide to punish women who seek medical care outside the state   or who suffer a spontaneous abortion  miscarriage will women in this case have to proove that they did nothing to contribute to that spontaneous abortion 
women in america are absolutely 2nd class citizens in the eyes of republicans are you still calling yourselves the land of the free

misogyny is the gift of the devil
abortion should be based on the right to self defense carrying a child to full term is the most dangerous endeavor most women will ever take on up to the point the abortion becomes more dangerous than completing the process to a live birth it should be the mothers decision why is this any different than a stand your ground law that allows up to lethal force to defend ones self and family

i wonder if those people know how evil it is to drive a wedge between men and women in fact men have loved and cared for women throughout human history
paxton thinks he has the right to sit in moses seat and impose the law 
republicans are making women a second class citizen  this is bigger than abortion   control over own bodies disgusting 
all i can say is you elected trump and put the republicans in power who are deciding if you should receive healthcare at all  i would vote democrat from now on to ensure you have a right to receive healthcare by the way wasnt that piece of feiyu trump bragging about overturning roe versus wade you elected him so you have no one to blame but yourself
its a power trip thats the republican party
texas was the last state to accept women as full citizens and not chatel of a man 
amazing the country is watching texas turn into the countrys version the talibans afghanistan every day  how long before abbott and his gang of christian zealots require women to full comply with his version of biblical or should i say sharia law

its a good thing that she went out of state and got the health care she needed

politicians and lawyers are trying to scare women and doctors perhaps we should start scaring lawyers and politicians now
in this situation if the baby survives the birth the baby will suffer for the extremely minimal time the baby would be alive and would then die a painful death  how can these law makers say they care about babies and demand the suffering of the mother and the child  this is not godly  this is mandated cruelty in other words evil
so because shes a texan she doesnt want to flee to get the necessary healthcare so you want to take necessary risk god forbid if something hapens to you because of a radical and ignorant person have u thouht about your husband and chidren do you want to be martyr well good luck because they dont care
how could u want to be a texan if u want to fight vote these people out
paxton is a vile corrupt snake and his wife backing him must hate women
if this doesnt help flip texas i dont know what else will just sad
so a man who can never know the pain of carrying and delivering a child under normal circumstances thinks hes the best person to make this kind of decision ken paxton can threaten legal action against this family her doctors or anyone who is qualified to make the best decision under this awful heart breaking situation will ken paxton be charged with legal action if any of the horrible outcomes happen to this mom and her family what about this families pain and suffering
"if its 2nd class citizenship for women how come so many women are antiabortion seems to me its mainly women who protest against abortion  indeed its well known that  its those evil men who are always wanting their wivesgirlfriendsmistresses to have abortions but i guess its just another sign of the pure evil that men are that they simultaneously want women to have abortions but also want to prevent them from having them

clearly controlling women is what is important in texas because if texas really cared about getting babies born then the future children of this woman would be important and they are not texas is bakcward why would any woman want to live there texas women need to hit the streets in protest and stay there until the legislature changes this backward thinking
pure misogyny pretty soon the rule of thumb will be back
pro lifers congrats you voted for this
republicans are pro birth not pro life
this will cost the republican party any election in 2024

the womans life is in danger so much for the 2nd ammendment
and when the people of ohio voted to put abortion rights in their constitution the government shot back by saying nope and attempting to not sure if they were successful take power away from the judges and put it only in the hands of the politicians the gop isnt going to let something as silly as people exercising their rights and voting stop them
vote ignorant republicans out and dont replace them with another ignorant republican vote blue in 2024
"are texian people that cruelty and too dump to question their bs evangelists and their redneck politicians
hope their wives daughters sisters nieces mistresses and churchladies would not have to go out of states or secretly doing abortions in the basements of some pastors houses or just rise up and fight for your rights to be safe and healthy instead of  just spreading their legs for those thugs to make you pregnant"

"thanks a lot texas  you could have pushed this criminal pos out of office last month but because you dont have spines or balls enough to go against a bigger criminal pos tfg this is what you get

klansman ken has got to go
older whyt uneducatedabout medicine whyt men shouldnt be making medical decisions about a womens choices 
but dumb women keep voting for reps so its their own fault
the texas supreme court should wait to make their ruling until after cox does whatever shes going to do this sends texas lower courts that have democrat judges a message do not give permission to women seeking to preempt tx law and it gives democrat women the message to not seek to preempt the tx laws cox should go outside the state to california if she wants to murder her unborn baby the tx supreme court can afterward make their ruling in favor of the tx law and the message will be reinforced
texas vote these people out its really simple
"why are lawyers and judges making medical decisions   remember during the healthcare debates when republicans were talking about death panels  well here we are  i guess the next step is for the doctors and all the support staff to also get the judges permission  then the postop staff and her husband and children should also get permission to help with recovery lest they be prosecuted for helping   

its a republic  if you can keep it 
as benjamin franklin said"
edwards syndrome has no treatment and is usually fatal before birth or within the first year of life so they want the potential baby to develop and suffer before it inevitably dies imagine the mental gymnastics it would take to justify that
ken paxton was just reelected how many times do these republican women need to say paxton is speaking for us paxton is doing exactly what they want they will never push back against him
prepare for more authoritarian rule if the dumpsters get back in this is but the beginning of what theyll do to our collective freedoms
exceptional evil with nothing but religious overture for cover hey ken paxton how much do you hate women i guess we know now ken paxton the world is in shock and disbelief at your cruelty
whoever is putting these politicians in office is putting womens lives at risk and if this lady dies you have blood on your hands its her body its her choice
glad she is suing also hope she comes to an adjoining state and get the abortion legally to save her own life
they dont care cruelty is the point vote blue for women
the members of the court should be indicted for practicing medicine without a license
yet texas will continue to elect republicans
we the people need to vote out every single republicanespecially in texas
thats awesome that the decision should be in each state however when republican legislatures refuse to bring it to a vote and worse when it does get brought to a vote and they refuse to honor the peoples decision thats when a national law is needed time for the men to get behind the women of this country and actually help
this is medieval sht i wouldnt treat a dog like this let alone a woman gop are sick and draconian

"for a country who keeps claiming to be the best country in the world u guys sure keep trying to prove otherwise and to this scandinavian ur thoroughly succeeding
u guys truly are extraordinary when it comes to continually electing politicians who will rob u blind take away ur rights and generally leave u in miserable lives that we europeans would find totally unacceptable and then u whine in astonishment about how government isnt working gee maybe u should look in the mirror to see why coz when electing these ppl isnt the bug but the feature through decades then u cant keep blaming the politicians its on u guys for continuing to elect them"
i need an explanation of a legal term regarding this situation i heard elsewhere that ken paxton has said that this woman does not have standing to bring this case i recently looked up the legal term standing and it essentially means that this woman doesnt have a dog in this fight which means that she cant bring her suit because shes not personally involved in it i also read that during the last womens group equal means equal  wonderful group btw to take the ratification of the equal rights amendment and fight to the supreme court to have it entered into the us constitution because they had collected the necessary number of signed petitions in the us supreme court one of the judges i think it was john 838 roberts also said the womans group didnt have standing can someone from the legal community preferably a woman joyce vance or the other woman here please explain to me how a pregnant woman carrying a fetus that will die either before or after birth or a womans group which was founded for the express purpose of getting the equal rights amendment put into the us constitution does not have standing in the law i dont understand how either woman or group would not have standing in a legal case that pertains fully and completely to them and they are implicitly and absolutely personally involved in these cases can anyone please explain that to me thank you if someone does because it makes absolutely no sense to me
george carlin was right these people are anti woman not pro life
republicans attempt at trying to stay relevant because their cult leader lost in 2020 this is the only way they keep themselves in the spotlight a woman will die because of these laws
this is just barbaric the corrupt texas ag is just a devil in the flesh but the people who are voting for republican are guilty as well shame on all people who voting republican

the world has advanced morally these people are stuck in a time zone where practically 
everyone was ignorant and uneducated and believed anything that clever conmen said to them
billions are grifted by clever conmen in the us in the name of religion"

i hope paxton just thru away his governor chances this was a wanted child that became unviable  a danger to the mother how dare you step in these parents have cried unknown tears about this but you felt  you should get in the way shame on you paxton
republican government in the lives of families and women making life altering decisions for them
a law makerinforcer without a medical degree uses his biblical opinion to enforce his belief on all others outside of his beliefs
how stupid can you be  to be a woman  that lives in texas and vote for republicans
every woman needs to remember this event come 2024 this is the republican agendanationally
this is a clear and painful example of the misogynistic agenda of the magagop
wow the government has complete control of womens bodies
that should be a womens right thats just crazy
these texas pro life are sick people they have no mercy for saving this lady live
this is sickening  the criminal paxton keeps committing crimes when will it stop  the bully that runs texas
"get rid of all these religious morons
save american womens rights
vote blue"
"please dont call these people christians they are the gentiles and these are their last days as with the right of an abortion there is nothing in the bible denying it actually a wise man once wrote
and i declared that the dead who had already died are happier than the living who are still alive but better than both is the one who has never been born who has not seen the evil that man has done under the sun
the sad thing is the great false religion the murderers of our lord and million of true followers hijacked our faith and created their religion of man they never gave a crap about abortion until 1869 when it was prohibited by the so called catholic canon law but again what more do you expect from the gentiles"
having ken paxtons making a decision of medical needsighhhh a corrupted political official telling a woman doctor and  medical support staff he knows more about human body cause hes a gop shady as heck political members  and now since hes has his law degree he knows reproductive and oby carethis is where a medical persons hippocratic oath should over ride a lawyers false  wanna be medical ideology
the very same party that is against women getting abortion i believe are also wanting to make a move to ban contraception  they cacre so much that a woman must carry every baby to be to term and deliver said baby  yet where are they on affordable childcare  etc  once the child is born they dont care it is no longer the governments   the states responsibility
lower than property
this is insanity
soowhat she has to be on her death bed to have the abortion like really the ag is not medically qualified if anything happens to this women her discrepancy is on their hands
file through the ags background see what boils
paxton should be in jail what a hypocrite
if i was rich id fly her to a state where she can get one without a problem first class and pay all her bills texas may as well admit that it wants no exceptions
apparently ken paxton and the tx supreme court have decided she cant receive the abortion that ms cox and her doctors have determined is medically needed 
this is what it looks like when fascists rule and the people obey
this is what voting republican
no american citizens of the female gender should be voting republican
what would happen if this woman were to die  who would be to blame  shouldnt a woman who has two young children have the ability and the right to healthcare in 2023  it would seem that children already born and facing their mother dying because she cant get the healthcare she needs is ok with texas lawmakers  it is nonviable fetuses they want to keep alive for a few hours days weeks regardless how that affects the woman  who cares right  women in texas have fewer rights that a pregnant animal who needs medical help  all you need to do there is make an appointment and the surgery will be performed without lawyers without judges without delays and without government interference and their lack of any medical knowledge whatsoever  surgeries are even available if its an emergency  to save both mother and offspring  if possible  imagine that
if something serious happens to this woman there will be women marching in the streets until next november no matter what the gop tries to do  my wife and daughters will stop the streets of our nation from moving anything and will make the just stop oil protests look like a tea party
show up to vote people stop complaining democracy and freedom can only survive if we vote out the maga extremist  we can not let trump into office he will go after our freedom to vote next
this ruling was placed on hold by the allmale texas supreme court sickening
maternal doctors should leave texaslets see how republican women deal with it i want them to spend hundreds of dollars traveling to another state for anything dealing with pregnancy
thats exactly how conservatives intend for it to be
if she dies murder charges should be filed against the legislatures republicans who made this a law in texas
she can go to another state which allows late term abortion right texas doesnt wish to get involved
why was this law put in place without a vote from the people state government should not have any decision in womens health
iran of america
not surprised this is happening in texas  its one of those women hating states
imagine that the criminal texas ag himself has criminalized abortion
leave the state of texas and obtain the care you want
also this woman had to also now have her story on blast bc she has to go to court and over explain  her complications not only in becoming a mother clearly wants a baby and this is just unreal that even the medical professionals are standing by her  her poor mental health
"lets make a deal  trade texas for ukraine
meanwhile lets get mscox removed quickly to a more enlightened state
a question for paxton
you claim to be pro life  are you concerned at all about the quality of life or just the quantity"
no  she must abide by the rules and regulations put into law by the leaders she and others have chosen to be in power
is this in iran
dont care about cruel laws i care about her life so much for prolife
if this woman loses her ability to bear more children due to the states insane invasive laws it should owe her ivf a surrogate to carry the child and all associated medical expenses for as many cycles and children as she wants i swear it  owes her more than that
the american nightmare but republicans will sell it as a dream
right but then the texas sc stepped in and reversed the judges order this woman should go out of state i know she wants to make an example but she also needs to consider her health she should come to massachusetts we would be glad to give her what she needs i say if the courts delay her abortion until it is too late for a legal abortion an exception must be made to permit a lateterm abortion this is what the righttocrappers get when they meddle with a womans abortion rights
republicans are destroying this country
indeedwhat gives a white guy with no medical training at all the right to judge what a sick woman needs to do to stay alive they cannot claim religion on their side because i am fairy sure jesus and his mother mary would think and act differently
this is beyond reprehensible
christofascism 
those poor man in texas soon have no gf or wifes anymore i cant imagen that woman want to stay in texas
this is exactly why healthcare has no business being dictated by government they are not medically trained professionals and need to stay in their lane
texans hate women
texas needs to get abortion on the ballot  it should have somehow been a requirement that it be put to the people of the states once roe was overturned  states should not have been able to pass laws like texas did  so it was primed and ready to the asshats in the sc take out row  i know people will not like that comment  ohio kansas and others have shown  even with a rep legislature when put to the people they choose to protect individual rights to choose what you need for your own health  i argued with friends and family that this would happen they believed there would be exceptions  lose of major bodily function should include the ability to have children in the future  paxtons actions and threats show thats not true  rep cowards in the state senate need to be voted out
thats what i want to know when did  paxton get a doctor license
texas is just conservative north korea that whole state is a cancer
"grind my gears


 why do they keep voting republican  this is what you get"
this is about politics  religion and forcing your beliefs on others when the state of texas gets sued into oblivion for billions when someones wife or mother                                                       dies or when a woman cant no longer have a child becuse of their stupidity the christians will change their tune when it hits em in the pocketbook
vote blue and every election in every state and lets end this fascism and bible thumping because republicans are using religion instead of the constitution
she can leave the state and get the abortion elsewhere   almost like she is purposely trying to stay to sue  its your fault now for not leaving  she can even go to mexico to do it for low cost 
absolutely insane for this pos paxton should dictate the future for any womens life paxton should be held accountable for anything that goes wrong
i hope she sue paxton
you could bet if it was the ags wife or daughter under the same circumstances hed get the abortion done under the table
texas has always been an a backwards state aint nothin changed
if the mom dies then they need to charge ken paxton with first degree murder  give him 20 years in prison
why havent the people of texas havent demanded a vote on this matter things like this should be brought before the people whose lives these laws effect
this isnt prolife its something else i would call it pro birth as some have stated
and just what is the opinion of the health insurance they need to step up for the health of women
i dream of the day when we have personhood rights for women in texas
abortion stances should be one of many single litmus tests for politicians and political movements for whether or not theyre good for democracy as a whole a politician says out loud he opposes abortion then he also opposes democracy as a whole also science says abortion is not murder so save your replies forcedbirthertrolls
her body ken paxtons choice
this is an outrage
these creeps should open an orphanage
"your rights end where a conservatives beliefs begin
exceptions that one can never qualify for are not exceptions"
they voted for this garbage
i am prolife but in this case paxton and texas are wrong
ohio voted to protect yet the state is still pushing back against what the people voted for  so even when the people have spoken the government still doing what they want
texas needs to turn their state blue so sane lifesaving decisions can be made for its citizens especially for women
whats not believable about this weve been headed here like a freight train
"first a disclaimer im prochoice and see nothing wrong with the former roe decision but based on a comment on another article i did find that emergency abortions are being performed in texas the link appears valid texas hhs yet there are the women who sued earlier this year plus this case what gives why were the other women in this document able to get abortions

hhs dot texas dot govaboutrecordsstatisticsdatastatisticsitopstatisticstexashealthhumanservices"
texas allowed this to happen with your vote
canadian here i thought the republicans said they wanted the government out of peoples lives guess they lied againtypical conservatives
second class citizen more like a caste system with women at the bottom
yall vote for them to govern so deal with it all texan voters the sense you are making your liberty is  staking
"men need to get tf up and fight for their wives sisters daughters 
allowing this to continue means the us govt decides when women will die 
men if you value the women in your life get in there"
thank god for gov abbott attorney general paxton republicans of texas and the state supreme court letting everyone know its a 100 percent pro  life state no exceptions as it should be
this is disgusting are we really still in america
paxton should have been aborted
if shes forced to have this baby and dies then paxton she be held for murder
"interesting how complaints are coming out of rightwing red states looking at the makeup of the population being 50 women i can gather most women in texas want to have their personal reproductive decisions made by the government otherwise they would have bothered to vote 

i would say in texas democracy is working the way they want it to"
ladies if you dont stand up and vote him out  texas you get what you voted for  you might want to vote 
gee sarah sounds like the death penalties you were talking about i remember
t his man needs to be removed now
as a non american this just blows my mind texas is disgraceful
every one of those deficient texas men should be forced to experience that labor simulator
are doctors dont have words too as doctors we decide also not politicians not everyone of you
women need federal legislation to protect their health and reproductive rights from meddling by state politicians
just think dads farther grandparents  if she dies your now the care givers tonthat family that or the state orphanages some one will need to be the care giver to those children left behimd
this just proved that americans are the least free people in the world amongst the 23 industrialized nations no other society in this category forces its citizens to give birth and die it reminds me of how slave owners would dehumanize slaves as property by taking away their body autonomy todays message is clear the state owns you and your body and you are property of the state
republicans are misogynistic and evil
all this from a man who is currently under criminal indictment and hides from it while he is in elected office  that is the new norm by the republicans
women should leave all these states en masse make the men go to a place where the rules are different and they cant use religion and crooked politics to control women
the voice of women ken paxton cant hear them because hes only listening to the voice inside his head he thinks its god i think hes just psychotic
texas does hate womens rights
my wife and i had to make the difficult and gut wrenching decision to end a wanted pregnancy that had the life threatening complication of trisomy 18 we have two beautiful children now because we were able to make important decisions with our health professionals the texas supreme court and the people of texas that support such abominable policies are deplorable horrible subhuman people that are not even close to being christian
white women have to step up and vote against their husbands ideologies
"turn america blue in 24 go out and vote remove these maga republicans asap
 women have rights"
"denying womens right to choose makes sense only if women are not autonomous humans who belong to themselves how else to explain how when we dont deny right to choice even to save undeniably living breathing sentient humans including children and infants we act like its ok to do so to save not yet sentient zygotes and embryos
everyone has the right to say no to use of their body even to save anothers life there are people  who die because of this all the time we dont typically consider this murder we consider this exercise of our human right of bodily autonomy our ownership of ourselves 
its the same for a woman and the embryo inside her its her right to exercise her right to bodily autonomy to say no to use of her body by another it doesnt matter if the other is a embryo a relative spouse the president or a nobel prize winning physicist nobody has the right to use her body without her consent yet only in the case of the embryo does anyone think of it as murder"
pregnant women have lost human rights in the united states
why paxton not wearing black ss uniform
when republicans say their prolife it makes me laugh so hard i nearly s my pants
"gop  greedy obscene parasites
gop  gaslighting obfuscating psychopaths
gop  leadership
i like government without traitors in positions of power"
when texas politicians had the opportunity to hold paxton accountable and remove him from office they did exactly what texas politicians are good at doing  nothing
go to another state and stop making a big deal
her body her choice
the texas supreme court blocked the lower courts judgment as being illegal trisomy 18 does not lead to the death of the mother you cant make up the rules as you go along as an american citizen she has the right to travel to a state that does have legal abortion without breaking laws name me one instance where trisomy 18 led to the death of the mother you cant if you dont like texass abortion law vote to change the law its unbelievable that women cannot know what is legal and what is not legal
the terrorists in texas government are trying to force their its gods will religious beliefs into womens medical decisions
the lady must of cheated and the baby in her stomach is tyrones
"ag ken paxton of the eye ken paxton reportedly and allegedly a love rat  well ag ken paxton we have all heard of you mate w hat have we heard what aint we herd misogynists of the wold  obviously guilty but let off your taxes  by your own texan peers off with you ken paxton and read the parable of the unforgiving servant
the unforgiving minute taker of td14"
second class citizenship now total oppression later just ask the head of the rnc in florida it is inconceivable to me how any woman or any minority could be in support of this fascist republican party because even if you are prolife they are coming for you
i bet that when the gop mistresses get pregnant these same members will be demanding the mistresses get an abortion
as a pro life supporter i pray for katie justin and their 20 week old unborn baby i found it barbaric that we as a society do not do our best to protect both mother and child why does it have to be just one or the other an honest perinatologist and neonatologist would do their best to accompany the mother and baby during a high risk pregnancy i pray that the cox family is being advised lovingly and genuinely rather than being used as culture war pawns
glad i dont live in america where they treat dogs better than they do women  why arent women getting angry  why arent women in media getting angry  why arent the women family members of these fascists speaking up get angry and shout out loud to these pathetic old white christian fascists
"american freedom 
crazy"
you women voted for this law its a little to late  now to backtrack politicians now make your medical decisions idiots this is pure dictatorship
whats the babies father want 
whats her husband want
so much for the constitutionally guaranteed protection of the lives of citizens youre only safe if your behaviour values or identity are approved by the moral guardians in the republican party otherwise you may find yourself on a growing list of those who are deemed expendable worthless or a threat and subject to an orwellian double standard enacted at the whims of the men who put themselves in charge
"white collar criminals belong in orange suits
making chooses for women"
the people of texas got exactly what they wanted yall voted for this ban
paxton is clearly campaigning for attorney general under a possible tp administration truly a vile human being
we live in a era where doctors are punished and imprisoned for just doing their job
never vote republican never vote republican never vote republican
its ridiculous that we are dealing with with these issues  women should not have to go in front of a judge for permission to have anything done to her body  this control is way off line
still never ever understand why these people are so evil
shame on these republicans this is their answer for healthcare or all of their heartless hateful racist xenophobic bigotry next they will want to bring back stoning personally i have no rocks to throw
she needs an oldfashioned highly skilled village midwife
its unbelievable to me that any of this is anyones business but the pregnant woman and her dr
this is the same guy that admitted on air that he threw out 25 million democratic votes in 2020 because otherwise biden would have won the state
please people do realize that this is the beginning of trumps republican party dictatorship  on americans
remember this donald j trump expresident boosted proudly that he alone was the person who reversed roe v wade    kentucky senator mitch mcconnell intentionally set the stage for trump to place the 3 supreme court justices neil gorsuch brett kavanaugh and amy coney barrett to confirm the scotus justices would be a republican scotus    if american women think that sc justice alitos reference using a 17 century jurist in the year 2022 will stop the republican scotus from finding other oppressive restrictions against women in america you are blind and foolish   eliminating voting rights for american women will be next     control oppression and power is the objective trumps  republican fascist party of america
women must have negative pregnancy test to be able to use a seat belt after all a small short stop at 20 mph might cause the s e at belt to harm the fetus  they are fragile when they have no organs
ambulance arrives at car crash sees a woman trapped and bleeding immediately takes a blood sample she sample to lab waits for results so they know if they can treat a woman or have to let fetus wait to god to let it be born before treating them
folks thought they were fighting satan by   standing up for the poor babies that devil worshipping women just threw away by having abortionsthe life of that woman be damnedsave every baby yupthat is how it was put out thereover turning roe vs wade was just the beginningwomen were put under the control of the governmentjust wait and see
"usa the land of the not so free 
what a messed up country for all the noise about the usa being free  this law fails to the guarantee individuals the right to choose  freedom religion in the usa needs to learn its place those who practice religion that prohibits abortions are perfectly free to avoid abortions freedom but to tell those that dont share those religious views what they can or cannot do is  medieval backward ignorant etc etc"
"shut up and take it already or vote blue its the only choice to get a personal choice the republican party
 is against freedom of choice"
cruelty is the point theres no mercy here theres no care for life this is pure cruelty
how can a woman get thru the court system before they do give birth
if this attorney general should force a birth on a future presence in this world of this woman the physicians should fight back its against the law to impersonate a medical physician by law fake physician impersonators are serving time at this point these republicans are going overboard now their physicians in congress licensed by the vote between them not a diploma from a medical school just  a  lets do what we want with our americans lets see how far we can go sad 
paxton is practicing medicine without a license and it is against the law
wake me up when they realize there is a woman involved here let me know when the commanders have set her free gilead in texas is alive and wellhandmaids tale is here
"texans please vote these gqp 03 out of office asap starting with abbott and paxton 

someone please start a crowdfunding account to help this family gtfoh of fascist texas"
paxton the indicted criminal
incubators of the state
this case is a threat to their control over texan women its as simple as that
i believe this regime will be prosecuting women for having miscarriages next there are already cases of women in the er who could not get medical attention or removal of the remains of a miscarriage because hospitals and doctors are afraid to perform the procedure for being sued by the state
to everyone who was on the fence about republicans not being a totalitarian regime they wont even follow the rule of law they are openly trying to supersede a court ruling by threatening a 2nd party
you never want a man speaking  like this as an ag i feel ashamed for inhabitants in the state no voices but love talking about democrat voters
beware because now they are openingly lying to you saying they want to have excemptions but i promise you if they get a hold of power in your next election they will double down and take away even more of your rights land of the free lol give me a break
wow your country is a sick place any woman who would vote republican needs their heads examined when it is clear that they regard you as second class citizens wow that is so sad 
the state a judge an ag the state supreme court  lawyers all these people are deciding what one woman should do with her body america
as an attorney ken paxton should know that a court decision is the authority if he doesnt like it he can appeal to a higher court but he is in contempt of court if he is threatening anyone for following the direction of the court
i love texasbut our govt is so currupt
it is old men trying  to control  women they are still living in the  stone  age
i betcha she voted for paxton
is this freaking gilead just crazy
yet they will continue to vote republican
im not sure voting is a viable solution to deal with lazyeyed soulless creatures like paxton
"texas is the state with the least citizens freedomslook it up  all of which are directed towards women and minorities white old men ruling si the reason the world is in the shape it is in
we the complacent people"
with three daughters i could never vote for a republican vote blue people
republicans can be so vile
shame on texas republicans for letting ken paxton off to continue to this kind of damage in peoples lives he should have been convicted and removed from office shame on texas good for the judge
texas women always second class citizens
i cant get past his droopy face and blading giant head
i am ashamed of this criminal ag  which century are we in 
greg and kenny are expecting 
how many of the people who are shocked and upset by kennys   actions what were you expecting and when you vote again for the orange republican god will you cry when he takes away your cake
the prolife christian republican party sadly just come across in instances like this as barbaric vote blue this is on obama could have codified roe said he would and did not this is why the public do not have faith in what any politician promisesstart governing for the people not the dark money peddling influences
"no abortion no sir eeeee  lifes too important cant you see
everyone knows what ken paxtons bottom line is "
hey dont ever become ken paxtons mistress and get preganant
respectfully joyce and mika you are wrong voting isnt enough anymore not with gerrymandering in tx come on msnbc grow a backbone already and you sponsors of msnbc were all sick of your gaslighting i wont buy anything from you anymore
lets see paxtons wife or daughter not get an abortion if their lives are at risk or show me ken paxtons medical degree
the only thing i have to say here is that ken paxton should have been impeached and indicted on multiple crimes he committed as the texas ag and before hes a monster and he hates women
the whole legal framing on abortion sounds criminal i just hope that women and all sensible men can get out and vote out the people behind these cruel abortion laws
free texas give it to mexico 
texas 
unbelievable  these republicans want total control over women  women are to stand two steps behind their men and keep their mouths shut  this is the united states  these misogynistic men want to reverse all the social and equality progress made over the last century and return us to a time long gone  next theyll try and remove womens right to vote as they are trying to do with minority citizens  we must vote these people out of office and thoroughly repudiate their fascist ideology  wake up america this next election is one of survival for our democracy
no stateincluding texas has any business deciding such a health care decision for any citizen each human can make his or her own decisions regarding their own health paxton can decide for himself whether he ought to get an abortion or not but he can go stuff his opinions about others health care
everything is bigger in texas including the duschbag handmaid commanders posing as republican ags
just remember this donald trump is not only bragging about getting roe v wade reversedhe also wants to punish women with jail time if they have an abortion if he gets elected in 2024 women and life as we have known it in the us are doomed
its sad that this woman has to fight to save her life the right to have other children and that she cant make the right decision for the best care that she requires since she won her case and the ag is going to go after the doctors that gives her the abortion the hospital and her husband for participating in her abortion i pray that she takes the ag to court for attempted murder of her life for the theft of her right to have other children and the doctors and her husband also has the right to take him to court also for attempted murder by denying the right to have the abortion that could prevent death the ag is also saying that the judicial system means nothing and that he knows more than any doctor lawyer and judge this ag is one sick man no wonder god doesnt bless this country
when you vote republican  you get death panels politicians in your bedroom and doctors office they told you they would do it
women as second class citizens is the great in maga that pubs want america to go back to
until biden packs the sup court women will be slaves of the state
think carefully about the issues you are voting for or against b
the republicans have ruined our state
if god forbid the mother were to die will paxton be charged with culpable homicide or is that too much to ask
jesus christ please come
that is insane who are these men who believe they have the right to tell a woman what she can do with her body
texas ag tom paxton needs a postbirth abortion always has the peoples voice is as the rightwing gun nutters keep telling everyone the 2nd amendment time for texas women to speak up loud  clear
ken paxton is cruel and ignorant   how dare he meddle in this difficult situation  he should be sued personally
cruel and ineffective sums up maga republicans policy positions
this is why i will never forgive amy covid barrett for her magacrimes against the american people  not content to slay a million living beings with her first ruling as a supreme court justice she viciously tore down roe and now seeks another million deaths by miscarriage and selfishly thinks it will win her a golden throne and glory in the afterlife  without her foul religious predation american women would not have to beg the government for their very lives today
this whole clip is some woke trash 3 women complaining about men and talking about their bodies  you going to talk about that foreign guy you banged while drinking that old lady coffee next
i thought it was government of the people by the people for the people  i guess texas is too big for that principle
its not about abortion and saving children its about controling women and girls if they cared about children they would have past better laws for gun control foster care and adoption
texass republicans have more respect for their cattle than women
anyone can be a woman today remember  whats this talk about rights what are those apples engines what
this is a total embarrassment on the world stage i see a fast exit of drs out of us
texas is not part of the democratic world
wasnt ken paxton almost impeached in a vote and in a trial not too long ago 
our country sute has fallen a long waya criminal ag threatening others with charges for receiving healthcare
"well we also have malpractice insurance carriers making medical decisions for doctors   no the insurance carriers do not have medical degrees so glad you asked  

this is the same thing   it is dangerous it is unfair it should be positively illegal for anyone other than a patients chosen doctor to choose what is best for hisher patients   the bloody end man  

im pro choice but really thankful it did not have to be my choice  desperate women will resort to desperate actions   this is why i am prochoice   of course it breaks my heart for the pigs that use it as birth controlbut its not my decision   

i am so sad for this woman   truly"
ken paxton is a criminal and the fact that the american law allows him to still be a governor makes me sick
republic of gilead is alive and well in texas
sue paxton and file charges for attempted manslaughter
republicans must pay for this in 2024 especially in texas florida and all punk states trying to control women
women of the us we the men of god own your body we own your reproductive rights we own your health care you are nothing but property  less than a 2nd class citizen you will do as we say as our bible tells us  if you disagree then vote vote vote vote
isnt this 2023  or 1723
blessed be the fruit
vote for all democrats in 2024
secondclass citizenship for women is allowing men to replace them in society literally
what in the heck is wrong with the doctors of texas that they dont fight this cruel hideous law
they dont care about babies  this baby has zero chance of living  but 100 chance of conti6to devastate this mother and possibly leave her unable to have children  having lost a pregnancy at 22 weeks the grief and devastation that comes with knowing that you will never get to bring your baby home is beyond what most people can grasp  her milk will come in and there will be no baby to feed  to put her through this is absolutely disgusting  cruelty seems to be the point and i am thankful that i dont live in texas
"imagine what happens to the citizens of this country who can not afford a lawyer or lawsuit
what are they supposed to do ken paxton has ignored the judge and threatened to prosecute her doctor and husband this is american we should all be furious"
yes this is health care  why call it abortion turning off life support for a terminally ill patient is not called homicide
the medical community should have created different codes long ago for situations like unwanted losses of wanted pregnancies this is no different than removing someone with no chance of recovery off life support if it had terminology recognizing its not the same situation as what everyone means when referring to abortion we wouldnt be here
paxton is like the villain in a bad movie red states are going backwards
how does it affect womens status men can be pregnant people too ya know
another reason to never live in texas
"if you believe the bible you dont believe that women are equal to men
its not binary like conservatives pretend 
god made man
man was lonely 
god cloned adam and made him a  trans gender partner 

conservatives are hypocrites"
laws written by men for men period we couldnt get the era passed the gop will never allow women to survive their hatred
magaga is going to regret this
this cruelty and negligence to this lady is ridiculous  the usa has gone backwards to the rest of the progressive world
i cant believe that the man and woman kenny pax suppose his daughter wife every woman in texas his selfishness and fear of women  maybe he should have a baby
the irony is the gop wants to cut funding to all childrens programs that help children in need but they want to insinuate themselves in between a doctor and a woman   these men who are making these laws are hypocrites
maybe paxton should be sued or arrested for practicing medicine without a license
the judge already ruled  but paxton prefers to impose his cruel personal ideology on a suffering woman just to show her whos boss  i cannot use the words here that i would prefer to say
texas when told theyve got it wrong say hold my beer
these people need to be stopped may i suggest that emergency personnel when arriving at an accident find gopers on scene and injured the paramedics and physicians claim this is an act of god hand them a bible and tell them they havent prayed hard enough and walk away
religion is the motivating force behind all republican laws being cold hearted hateful and prejudice against everybody that doesnt go to their churchgod must be proud to have such heartless spinless worms standing up for him
lets be real she most likely voted republican until it didnt work to her advantage now we are supposed to feel bad for her years of poor choices stop voting for them then cry when they bite you the republican party has been the party of hate for decades and the european women have been voting for them or decades now they losing their rights the republican party is the party of hate really
what can women do to retake their bodily autonomy that answer is very simple vote for democrats across the board and get those evangelical tyrant republican idiots out of our government
their holy book tells them women are property
she doesnt realize that she is not considered an equal with men  she is property and is now being reminded of that status  we have fought for equal treatment for decades and finally won in 1973  here we are back at square one
i find it very important to point out how much of the issue around abortions is coming from men  i am so tired of men trying to control everything and anything on this planet especially a womans body and health issues  women are not your incubators  and if you really want to end unwanted abortions then it has to come from the root cause of a pregnancy which is the sperm  the sperm is what causes the pregnancy not the woman eggs  no sperm no unwanted abortions
why do we continue to excuse murder 
a bet you a quarter that in the past maybe one of trumps girlfriend had an abortionim not saying its trueno proof but why was he pro choice back in the day then in 2015he change to pro lifebecause evangelist where supporting himand how many republicans have the same history when younger their girlfriends had abortionsiporcrytes
why is ken paxton not in prison yet all government aid to texas should be banned
vote them out
this is so distressing she is cradling her bump so the baby is more than just a clump of cells and for this poor woman to let go and say goodbye to her baby who she knows will never survive must be so sad  and for some republican fool to pontificate and threaten her health care providers who are trying to help her survive its just unfathomable  republicans who support torturing women are doomed
"looney tunes
think people think"
"please can we call it healthcare because that is what it isan abortion is only part of the healthcare she needs
a key part of her healthcare she cannot get"
ken paxton belongs in prison
im pretty sure denying someone medical care to the point where theyre almost on the brink of death is a sin texans need to read their bibles more closely
he should be in prison for corruption but his time is coming
why does your country even have judges if noone listens to them
republicans are using abortion as just another tool against women to maintain control and authority   force birth oppose programs for childcare and economic costs of raising children forces women from achieving higher education and employment advancement
"i am pretty sure that if ken paxton was suffering from a medical emergency he would get the best treatment from texas doctors

so if ken believes that this poor women should not get the medical treatment in an emergency situation then neither should ken nor any of his family even in an emergency situation"
voters in texas wanted it that way they voted their people in
imagine the arrogance and cruelty it takes to force a woman to endure such continuous pain and suffering and mental anguish to prove your christian values and some nonsense religious point  if she is unable to have children again because of this she should sue paxton personally and the state of texas for damages
shouldnt politicans write laws that help healthcare workers keep and support their sworn hippocratic oaths and not break them do to avoid legal prosecution
as a texan im appalled at our republican house  the ag paxton  paxton is a major criminal being allowed to stay in office by the other republicans who are know accomplices in his crimes  the texas republican money is vile  corrupt  how texas has allowed this to happen is beyond comprehension
abortionondemand turns men into second class citizens and brainwashes women into believing that theyre gods that have control over life and death  even the prolife movement doesnt have control over life and death  were the messengers for the one who does
it sure is and the rest of us peones are next in the traitorous republicans cross hairs 
ken paxton is the the most despicable sleazy poshe needs to be removed from the ag office immediately
its too bad msnbc decided to report the story this way because its actually an example of our laws and courts working correctly new laws are sometimes purposely vague in order to allow for the citizens to debate the issue and work out the details in court its impossible to consider every possible outcome or consequence of something like a partial abortion ban so iit sometimes makes sense to provide a general framework gets clarified over time the woman in question took her issue to court because it was possibly borderline and prevailed because of an effective attorney we should be happy with this not angry
ken paxton and gov abbott shoukd be removed  investigates and barred from gilding any office
kkk wants to control everything but other pink girlmen
for someone whos looking from outside the united states this is one of the most depressing things i ever heard its just depressing and sad to see how bad
the left dramatist this case is pathetic and discusting  mika is one special woman huh folks  she knows nothing about this but is telling people that maybe she cant have a child in the future i dont think she has the qualifications to do that
lets see if the most ignorant stupid people in the usa could figure this out and explain it to the rest of the country we were number one worldwide in education now we are number 24 worldwide in  education because we let the criminal democratic party and the stupid people that vote for them take over the university and the college  will some intellectually stupid democratic person explain that to any of us  because i like to know why they were so stupid to vote for the criminal democratic party  they are destroying the usa and everybody already knows theres  the ignorant people that vote for the criminal democratic party theyre too stupid to understand any off this
im glad this guy had the time to give that lady permission to get health care
dont worry  dmbss magamoronic women are still gonna vote for the redumblican party sooooooooooyep
the trans community has made women second class citizens
dang how far along is she why cant she do like thousands of others and schedule a delivery the baby can survive im so confused by liberal thinking
one day paxton may need urgent medical care may the ambulance lose its way
wasnt he acquitted of 16 charges probably feels untouchable  lawlessbc obviously he is aka untouchable elites there are 2 laws one for elites  another for ppl of limited means pfft 
2nd class citizen is better than making available zero class nonbeing status for babies plus making those 2nd class citizens murderers your fancy excuses arent cutting it 
women just need to move out of texas leave these control freak men behind to be the incels they deserve to be
its amazing that paxton isnt in jail  republicans have a moral value at all to vote for criminals for office
smh it strikes me the whole abortion issue is about fear and control those most fearful of what for gods sake women are the ones most hung up on controlling they couldnt control their way out of a paper bag
the last stats and study i saw were that over 75 of abortions were out of convenience with money and not the right time being the top two reasons    less than 5 are out of actual medical necessity
if you want to know how things like this can happen in the state of texas it is because texas is the buckle in the bible belt   these are god fearing fascists in this statenot all of them but too many of them
lol second class as if a mythical 1st class is getting abortions wow leftists are this nonsensical its comical im not even prolife and i cant stand the way you idiots talk about this
i live in texas and yes our state government is run by a bunch of hacks but that does not let the voters off the hook on this issue  no i have never voted for a single one of the abysmal candidates that were elected to lead this state but as a voter i share the collective guilt of the voters of texas who have installed these misfits into places of power  i apologize profusely for the misery that woman and her family have had to face because of our elected crud  and ken paxton is the worst of the lot
nice to see the boneheads havent learned a thing and keep doubling down on stupid 
"ken paxton you nut case

these decisions are not your business "
with ken paxton would qualify the abortion is when this woman has a tombstone and dies from the complications of the pregnancy
"bring it on texas
keep pushing americas buttons
fafo"
this doesnt seem very pro life too me condemning them to potentially die from medical issues  very texas pro life only after people die then do bare minimum to fix issue to look like theyre doing something  texas energy grid comes to mind people who didnt realize how conservative americans are must not deal with many restrictive laws colombia a very catholic country legalized abortion as did overly conservative skorea the usa isnt that pro life more like pro cruelty i wouldnt be surprised if the usa starts acting like uganda or russia and starts going after lgbt next
its shame that they used religion as a tool to control womens bodies
george carlin had the gop dead to rights  they are not prolife  conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers
hold on define citizens ship is that at the open borders
men should have no say in any womens health issues
doesnt texas execute criminals   why isnt that life sacred   christians playing god
theres not a single woman in texas that feels like a second class citizen
"when the comments about abortions after birth wouldnt this be the same thing to force a woman to carry a baby knowing ultimately the baby will suffer a painful death after birth
   "
why do we have to deal with the state when we go see our doctors this is no ones business but our own if you dont like abortion dont have one if you dont like to think about it dont you will never know these womens stories and its messed up that we have to be public with our health issues we are all held hostage by a few men dont like or appreciate women
wheres the surpriseyou voted for this
this is just so sick
"it is the arrogance of xtianity coupled with misogyny and narcissism
paxton is deplorable"
each state should have a referendum on abortion let the people speak
you guys have any breaking news on hunter biden
"i can predict with very high certainty if this becomes the standard  texas hospitals will close down maternity wards and many obgyns will leave the state  just like idaho  

as a single straight male i am very bothered by this just like mika"
republicans must be voted out of all levels of government for this madness to stop
id be curious to know where she stood about prolife and where shes standing now with regards to reproductive rights and healthcare
so let me get this straight  a woman needs the ability to murder her unborn baby to be a first class citizen  just trying to wrap my brain around what you are stating  i understand the dilemma i really do but please do not make this about class rights  its not about that period  there should be limits and women must step up and take personal responsibility for their own choices  personal responsibility does not mean killing it means preventing  stupid argument  foul
paxton says shes an activist  yeah i bet thats why she got pregnant
are we going to imprison everyone who assists 66th  term abortions cause i think mexico is ready to pay for that wall
yeah right this is coming from the party whos trying to remove women from sports by supporting men playing in womens sports so unfortunate
what part of infanticide do you not understand
so sad for her she obviously wanted the baby there is no reason to threaten her life by forcing her to continue to carry a baby that appears to be aborting already and that can not survive even if carried to term
"this ruling would have never happened if the woman suing the state if they were black or brown 

white woman tear are a powerful thing"
the reality is that human societies have to be class differentiated patriarchy and matriarchy because the function of the human mind is to discriminate no discrimination is no mind or mindless state of consciousness
no woman should have to beg anyone for her healthcare  this is goodmn ridiculous
democrats just love  deleting those babies   
a corrupt texas attorney general
ask ken paxton  anti abortion politicians bullying this woman  q how many secret abortions have you had paid for or forced mistresses to have
this is insanity disgusting what maga has done to our country 
its stunning to me that 548 of texans vote for this
please stop saying women need to make this decision with her family women are capable of making their own decisions
as a texan fuk ken paxton 
they dont care about babies  antiabortion laws are not about babies theyre about punishing women
oh well at least the economy is great  according to democrat govt workers in the dc beltway
usa  has always been a caste class society  depending on your race  religion  wealth and position of power in government  if your a poor native american women living of the reservation your treated as the bottom of our society  if your a rich  wealth jewish colonial parents government official your at the top of our society 
thats a rather nice way of putting it 
women should be allowed to do whatever they want with their body theres already too many people on this earth anyway
religion is behind all this crap vote these nuts out
where are all the republican pro life preachers now  i havent heard any of their takes on this  they are cowards come on out and discuss an actual circumstance that happens instead of lying about post birth abortions
this is what forced birthers want for young girls and women in all 50 states forced birthers have repeatedly proven that they view young girls and women as sub human property thats the point of laws like the ones in texas florida idaho etc vote blue to stop them
paxton is a disgrace without empathy for anyone  why is he still in power  welcome to texas  if women arent allowed necessary procedures then make those in government who deny them accountable for the support of mother and child  texas politics sucks  vote blue
maybe paxton needs to do a little learning about these rare genetic problems  trisomy banies seldom survive and their lives are full of discomfort  think of having a baby with microcephley spinal bifida clef palape and lip  do a littlt research ken be responsible learn how your actions may affect and effect others
now i know where i can sell my steel coathanger collection thanks msnbc
women in red states are not second class they are nothing but breeding boxes when they are young and even less when older
sounds like a good test for a selfdefense for the woman
while i agree she should be allowed to get an abortion in this instance and what im going to say is not the answer but wouldnt it be easier to go to colorado or new mexico where there are no restrictions and then sue texas later
"ah so your lifes on the line and you need the government and courts approval to get the necessary health care you need in order to survive 

the republican partys agenda folks"
ken paxton a totally corrupt selfserving sorry excuse for a human being threatening women and doctors on womens healthcare decisions what woman votes for ken paxton or any texan gop poltician
but women are supposed to be second class citizens read your bible ephesians 52223 1timothy21112
never forget  we are the carbon the liberals want to eliminate
and texas state republicans actually voted to keep this corrupt piece of human garbage when they had the easiest excuse to get rid of him ugh
whats wrong with that man is a ten volume series he is cruel and evil and corrupt
if this yahoo paxton does anything to violate the court order he should be immediately arrested and prosecuted
republicans are disgusting they have never cared about babies
secondclass citizenship  kinda like democrats making us jobless because we declined the mrna jabs
white male domination
republicans and their love of the jesus hurt women in the nme of the christ molest kids in church because  god
paxton should be locked up as he should have been for alll of his corruption
ken paxton the guy should be in jail
this is just beyond crazy what is going in texas just crazy
she isnt a second class citizen  she isnt even a person in fascist texas
lets make a ban on men who have erectile dysfunction testicular cancer prostrate cancer etc lets deny them healthcare and lets see how fast they would turn this around this is against the law
"where did ken paxton get his medical license 

and he could orphan two existing children"
paxton is pure selfish evil period 
this is the same abnormality the son of singer prince and his wife suffered when he was born and suffered until his death
holy is texas still part of the united states do better
im at risk of death im a human being its unavoidable
i could be very proabortion if these loons are all reproducing at a high rate
a pronoun can not get another pronoun pregnant why are you so obsessed about abortion
anyone who would force a person to carry a pregnancy is a predator and anyone who would force it upon children are child predators
" religious idiots trying to impose their imaginary beliefs on other people
 a minority of insecure men trying to control the lives of women"
my mouth is agape  this so is wrong
fun fact abortion is not health care
so all you people moving to texass for a better life better think again before moving to a state with corrupt leaders like impeached paxton your life may depend upon it
"in joe bidens america you have to step over human feces on the sidewalk 
keep voting blue "
texas is voting to succeed from the union  america this would be funny to see how many democrats flee texas if that did happen
the gop wants to bend laws for trump and his traitor thugs from jan 6 but a women needing medical care from her doctor they step in unwanted and put that women at risk and in front of a judge
abortion rights to stay
how would making an exception affect paxtons life i never realized how many very cruel people there are in this country
how quickly would paxton threaten criminal charges and prison if this was his daughter  any chance he can be sued for practicing medicine without a license
fascist blue saying republicans are putting women in second class yet fascist blue wants men playing womens sports thats rich     citizens are lastin compromised 46s world behind his wars illegal grifters his ice cream  and his corruption
if men got pregnant there would be more abortion clinics than bars and churches combined and they would be running daily specials and discounts
i have four sisters how dare anyone anyone at all tell them what they can or can not do for themselves especially stupid ignorant bible thumpers
democrat women shouldnt have to worry about an abortion because trying to convince a democrat woman to lose weight is like trying to convince a snake to get off its stomach 
this poor woman her life health and fertility are going out the window if she is unable to get a lifesaving abortion that pregnancy she is carrying is doomed to fail because of a fatal fetal anomaly that kills fetuses before or shortly after birth
just how low and disgusting can the republicans stoop  we will never know because they find a way to disgrace themselves further each and every day
great but its not abortion or the democrats poor messaging its the inflation
paxton is pond scum
they are denying an abortion for a woman with a fatal chromosomal abnormality in the fetus it is pure evil to deny this woman when her health life and fertility are endangered
"repent believe in jesus and be born again becoming a new person in this life 
luke 2447 kjv and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem

2 corinthians 517 kjv therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new"
its not just biden and the dnc that canceled the democrat primary but cnn  msnbc who constantly say that trump threatens democracy says nothing about bidens authoritarianism the voters in florida south carolina and tennessee do not have a right to vote for the democrat presidential nominee cnn  msnbc say nothing about it
"personal responsibility personal accountability never heard of it 
democrats"
isnt that whats great about abortions all these women can freely leave tx at any time but they choose to stayhmm
i would also recommend they seek permanent residence in other states as well
texas is hell on earth
the solution is simple live in a state that fits your values if you are a liberal why would you want to live with a bunch of right wing wackos even the poor can relocate you can be poor anywhere just move if you say its to hard to do then you are not negatively affected enough to leave
protesters should educate themselves on how to prevent a pregnancy instead of killing defenseless unborn human beings life begins in the womb and those lives matter and must be protected
no bltch u had the option of condoms spermicide  pregnancy blockers so dont sit there and cry that u had no other choice u spread ur legs knowing the consequences that a baby could be a result selfish bltch
here we go back to the 50s count on the conservatives to flush women rights down the drain again  vote for rights in midterms this nov 
"i thank my biological mother everyday that she gave me up for adoption instead of having an abortion 
i was adopted at 3 weeks old to wonderful parents that loved me like their own biological children"
it might be ur body  choice but ant ur life being ended is it  u r nothing but selfish  thinking of ur self  not the little  in side of u
this because this lady is was on fornication but baby is a gift for good end the abortion
planned parenthood only push abortion they dont educate on other options because they make so much money and performing abortions think about it why would you not just go to your obgyn to get your abortion why dont you just go to your doctor if abortion is so wonderful and let them perform it no you go to some dirty clinic because its not held up to sanitary standards at all i know first hand that  they train everyone that works at their facility not to ever use the word baby show the ultrasound not to ever tell the person that they have to count the hands arms and feet of they are aborted baby before they let them leave because these poor females would be devastated they dont tell anything of the truth they are all about money i admit pro life has dropped the ball and educating read the book transfigured its simply amazing and its about a girl that had several abortions and that did work at planned parenthood
it wasnt your only option you didnt look elsewhere only planned parenthood they dont offer any other option but abortion they push it because they make so much money they are sick and they train everyone that works at their facility not to ever use the word baby not to ever tell the person that they have to count the hands arms and feet of deer boarded before they let the lady leave because they want to make sure no limbs are left in her body they dont tell anything of the truth read the book transfigured its simply amazing and its about a girl that had several abortions and that did work at planned parenthood
keep your pants on bitch
strange how the most pro gun states 40000 deaths annually are so anti abortion
"what is a woman
the latest supreme court justice doesnt know
nobody on the left can define a woman
which is probably why the left is lying about the pending supreme court decision

yes the left has a completely bt sht crazy"
lord rest in peace these 65000000 lives that never had a chance to live rip little ones 
abortion ladies is just down rightmurder  65000000 killed the nazis would have been so proud of the ladies of america 
the government has no right to force women to have a baby fuckyougregabbott
i dont feel sorry for the girl all i heard was what about me didnt even think about the child at all i gave birth homeless i had nowhere to go i couldve gotten an abortion but i decided not to i still went to school when i was pregnant and i didnt have family to support me at all i did what i had to do when i had the baby i couldve gave her up for open adoption but i chose to keep my baby all i heard from this little girl was i dont want to take responsibility for my actions
is it now a requirement of a demorat that you abort you first born or is it the second just askin
its ok to have an abortion if you want to no one should force you to have a baby you dont want to 
"abortion expenses  total amount of credits allowed on your federal return that includes coverage of or reimbursement for abortion or abortion expenses
credit or partial credit for abortion or abortion expenses  lets go "
i dont understand these people that want someone to keep their baby even though their not the ones that are gonna raise the baby how about we find better solutions like find ways to help pregnant women instead of judging
if your mad then go out and protest or boycott planned parenthood their corporate lawyer is the one arguing in defense of upholding the case made to the supreme court
i am not going to get into ethics surrounding abortion and here is why it doesnt matter it is no coincidence that the places with the least abortion access have the highest abortion rates and tend to be more sexist areas with higher maternal mortality and lower standards of living abortion is proven to improve the lives and educational levels of women proven to improve the lives of existing children most of all it is proven that abortions will still happen no matter how many laws you put in place to prevent them the difference is people will die with unsafe abortion unsafe abortion is one of the three major killers of childbearing women worldwide
good for her in getting an abortion yay
just in the usa alone the money that has been made from abortions equals over 40 billion 40 billion just in abortions oh my god 
i gotta better idea move out of texas permanently
the cutest murderer ive ever seen

6 wksstill able toterminatein texasyikeswatch your menstrual cycle birth control fails often
poor lil puddum engaging in adult activities yet being so out of tune with her own body that it took her to 10 12 weeks gestation to figure out she was pregnant far longer than someone who actually knows her body and is paying attention should take and then shes so heartbroken and cries that she lacks the right to execute her child in the state of texas and had to wait and cross state lines to hire a mass murderer to assist her in her evil desires

14 having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children
15 which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness
16 but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with mans voice forbad the madness of the prophet
17 these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever
18 for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error
19 while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage
20 for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning
21 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them

a womans life is worth more than the possibility of a new life
lol i just saw a different lady do the same thing xd i alwaysed said banning abortions are pointless i am glad these pro sadists that call themselves pro life are failing and women are still finding a way to have their abortion thank you to all the women who aborted and saved a child from this trash world
pregnancy is dangerous even fertility clinics have to go through multiple embryos before success i have friends in texas who wanted to start families but are now too scared to try this punishes everyone across the board if you dont understand that just wait til its your turn to deal with a pregnancy expected or not
lol imagine being one of those absolute tools who got tricked by the government and big pharma that a child is nothing but a clump of cells and is not valuable as a human life so it can be exterminated you realize these same people who taught you to be so stupid are the ones who profit off of abortion  stem cells among all kinds of other things are harvested from babies who are aborted by stupid ass teens who just want to have fun without any repercussions imagine that idiots dont understand the monetary value in things like stem cells and how much of a market there is for it among the super wealthy and elite  but keep offering up your children as sacrifice to them and one day youll meet the creator you think is just a sky wizard and youll get to see first hand what hell actually looks and feels like  enjoy
another thing they say is that  smh i mean for once cant you guys be responsible why tf were condoms or contraceptives invented lol
she gets around u get back to your life now that kid never even got one
honestly cant imagine the shame and disappointment her parents must be feeling  actually raise such a selfish irresponsible person 
i would of adopted that kid so sad i hope she realizes that and prays for forgiveness 
"oh poor little b youre not in  place to have a baby so youre going to murder it thats exactly what youre doing 
youre committing murder because it would be inconvenient for you to have the child disgusting but your typical of the people having abortions thats why it needs to be made illegal with criminal prosecution treat it just like other murderers"

all these ppl having sex but not using no protection its too many devices and methods put here the pill the patch the insert under the skin condoms vaginal rings sponge film gel like if u are getting pregnant in 2021 its because u either want to or you are being reckless 98 of the time its very rare to get pregnant while on birth control do what u gotta do but most of the time abortion is preventable if u use the proper contraceptive messures
i am against abortion because today more than any other time in history we have ways to prevent pregnancy  why doesnt the government pay 100 for pregnancy prevention from the pill to sterilization if a man never wants to father children  or a woman never sees herself as being a mom instead of creating laws that only worsen the situation  and the mantra my body my choice is not valid  it is something you tell yourself when you want to get past something that has put a wrench in your life  once you get pregnant there is another body that does not have a say in what you are about to do
this kind of thinking is sick and twisted how can we as a society sit here and allow this 
"at least she was able to get the abortion she needed it sucks that many women in texas dont have the luxury to travel for abortions though
women are truly living in the dark ages where we have to jump through loops to have autonomy of our own bodies everyone wants to put their rosary beads and bibles in our uteruses"
dont worry liberals  you can still kill your unborn baby girl or boy in 49 states  dc theres still hope
"taliban texas appalling treatment of women as classless citizens 
appalling these male made laws will not stop women from the freedom to choose what their own lives will be"
abortion is murder
the fetus is not your body and is not your choice
clearly you lack controlcouldnt stay out of the bed with your boyfriend
see birth control increases unwanted pregnancies dont have sex thats the best way
private adoption is not good  it is legal human trafficking you exchange a large sum of money for a child in return that is human trafficking with a new name the private adoption industry will make about 191 billion dollars this year  in foster care parent should always go in with intentions to reunite the child with the bio parents unless it is absolutely not possible
"some of these comments are vile until you all are prowelfare expansion low to no cost healthcare pro mask and vaccine pro foster care reform pro comprehensive sex education and free birth control wo parental consent and anti death penalty you all are not prolife you are pro forced birth because you all have made it clear you dont care about that being once it is on earth just be fucking honest with yourself 

also if an embryo at 6 with cardiac electric activity it is not a fully formed heart or true heart beat it is also not considered a fetus even at 6 weeks is considered a child women should start receiving child support at 6 weeks of pregnancy right and be able to take out a life insurance policy right too

the vast majority of pro life arguments are based off the bible guess what we dont live in a theocracy we live in the us where per our first amendment rights in the constitution which for as much as you all claim to love and love your freedoms you sure do pick and choose we have religious freedoms and separation of church and state laws shouldnt be based on religion ever even a little bit because by doing so you violate my first amendment rights to religious freedom"
medical textbooks and scientific reference works consistently agree that human life begins at conception
jesus said father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing luke 2334
"youd want to option b first of all is adoption
the absolute last thing you should have done with kill your unborn child it was disgusting"
when i held my newborn grandson in my arms it was just the most beautiful feeling he was so tiny and helpless  to think some women dont think twice about doing this is so heart wrenching
if you know its not 100 percent whyd you let him let loose how about keep your legs closed
mississippi might be the next state to ban abortion
why not be responsible  person and not get pregnant  abortion is not a good choice for birth control
"im glad these women have to drive hours away and have plenty of time to understand that they are about to murder a baby

if youre not responsible enough to raise a child youre not responsible enough to have sex"
wait a minuteshe felt her only option was gone what about the option of adoption
prolifers have never been against abortion because they care about saving the lives of unborn babies it has always been about wanting to take away the rights of women plus the bible is proabortion see numbers 52022
adoption their is always a family that cant have a child that will give so much love to those babies
god can and does bring good out of evil of all kinds murdering the baby shortcircuits this good process and deprives many people of blessing
dont speak about human beings conceived in rape as though they have no purpose and ought to have been murdered in the womb
a she was hoping for a diff outcome from sex so now you want us to feel sorry for you because you are inconvenienced while trying to kill your baby  please  lets go brandon
calling abortions healthcare is a stretch    its really about making peoples lives more convenient in situations like these
abortion is not healthcare and its not pro women
did you know that every day more human beings die from abortion than covid
abortion is murder
i confirmed a successful transfer of 12000 thanks to your platform this lockdown had not been bad after all
"i think this is good to observe  
she didnt want a family but she was in a committed relationship  i think we as people children  a lot of people have a twisted fear or idea of what a relationship is treat your bodys right treat your hearts right be good to yourselves as well as others "
depotprovera  when injected into men it renders their baby maker useless fairs fair
im tired of journalists characterizing us as divided can they spare us the adjectives and just report the news we have always been pluralistic none od this is new the key is coming together to determine an equally plural solution everybody wont be happy thats america
a condom costs 50 cents   try using one dimwits
"no problem move to california then  
lets go brandon"
"i am sad that people can still argue about saying good she deserved it and its not anyones right to say how her life would specifically benefit from this mistake  yes we have accidents with sex and anyone whos had sex knows nothing is 100 less you dont do it at all  

so with that being said ppd is no joke and she could end up killing her baby from that alone or her own mental state  and not have any love towards the child  

why do people not understand butterfly affects  you dont have to be blood to raise a kid so if anyone of you judge mental people wanna raise one there is your chance "
exactly why would you want to execute the unborn child living inside you yes its living its an act of murder pull your head out of your rectal cavity and deal with the situation sure if the inconvenience to give birth but theres always adoption and then you will not be a murderer
funny how my body my choice applies to killing babies yet employees are being harassed and fired over choosing to be unvaccinated pure utter devine evil
"really great experience i had in 
e l s p r o w e b thanks to everyone who introduced me"
dont let the screen door hit you in the a
"coming to texas soon checkpoints at all state borders and ports to monitor why you are leaving or entering texas

papers please"
the same people in texas fighting in order not to have a covid shot cause it should be their choicewhich it should but then want to tell a women what to do with her bodywhich it should be her choice smh
13weeks  well over 1 trimester 4months isnt that a bit long im pro choice but how did this lying chick not notice her period gone lol come on here yes she is a lier
"the fact she is so upset that it was all an inconvenience for her to go kill her child
bring on the hate i know its coming i just dont understand how someone who is sexually active does not think pregnancy is a possibility when they choose to have it obviously she was not using her birth control properly and if she had used more than one form of contraceptive she would not be here so inconvenienced"
"barbies abortion 1933
"
"got to  be appreciative to  
e l s p r o w e b"
they fighting to kill babies but not fighting against that jim jones koolaid you do not want to get pregnant dont have sex as for them who been taped i understand but give up the baby for adoption do not murder birth control pills is murder  selfish jesus christ will judge you and them who kill these babies i went through this seek jesus christ repent repent
children sacrifice was back then and the holy father in heaven destroyed them and he will now with them who take a life of any today hell is not playing with no one jesus christ is coming repent
thats right i agree with this abortion needs to legal everywhere especially in the midwest where there is large populations of europeans
your parents should be ashamed that you murdered their grandchild 
everyone just remember if you dont want to have a kid dont have sex the solution isnt that complicated
you said you  take contraceptives then your partner didnt wear a condomvery irresponsible excuses and health care insurance should not cover for your irresponsible behavior grow up
thats their right abortion is a states rights issue not federal
"pro life
pro women 
pro child"
wow we just watch a child get murdered on camera classy
"i once aborted and i have regretted my decision its something so painful you will fill guilt every time you here the word abortion and these children deserve a chance to live cause they are blessings from god 
if one is not ready for children
the first thing would be abstainanceif not family planning methods to prevent the unwanted babies"
because of the economic crisis and the rate of unemployment now is the best time to invest and make money 
hmm if bcp is not 100 why not use 2nd protection to prevent an unwanted pregnancy hard to watch  no one wins here
should have practiced safe sex
then when women make choices about what to do with mens bodies
13weeks is not ideal poor thing should have been able to get it when she found out the law is absolutely bullshit its like texas went back in time
american women are guaranteed to equal protection under the law by the 14th amendment a rogue government in texas does not have the right to take away american womens rights and protections that are guaranteed by the us constitution this law  in texas is unlawful unjust and discriminatory against  american women
"my body my choice

oh wait didnt government force a vaccine for people not at risk and against their will
hmmmmmm"
my body my choi oh wait it isnt your body you do you but dont try and justify it  living your life and carefree huh you mean being irresponsible and have unprotected sex and yeah lets slip in 6 weeks into the conversation even though they said 10 15 weeks at the start  abc news is trash
dont kill a child they deserve a chance at life too same as all of us 
none of my business
i dont here one thing about fathers rights
this is clearly unconstitutional and a direct violation of the 4th amendment which guarantees that everyone be secure in their _persons_ papers houses and effects a fetus before 18 weeks when it is developed enough to feel pain has no legitimate moral claim to be considered as an entity in its own right worthy of legal protection the rights guaranteed to all americans of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness simply do not apply to it _at least_ in the first 17 weeks of gestation the autonomical interests of a fullygrown adult woman who is capable of experiencing pain and suffering and seeing herself as entity existing over time the notion of personhood supersedes the nonexistent desires of a firsttrimester fetus to stay alive or to not suffer it couldnt be more obvious what the correct moral stance is here unless your faculties of judgement are blinded by the shackles of iron age superstition put twoandtwo together folks this law is an indefensible abomination in any modern civilized society
abortion is murder these women should be shackled and chain and arrested
all human life is sacred this genocide of the innocent will one day be seen as the collapse of our morals on a huge scale so many innocent children have been killed that future nobel peace prize winners pultzer politicians people that would one day make life better for all who inhabit earth for what because you decided that a childs life was worth sacrificing so you could continue living a irresponsible and unsatisfying life that is all about you human life is the most amazing thing to have ever graced this world and yet we still treat those of us who are the absolute most vulnerable as nothing more than a annoying side effect from a drunken one night stand if you are having consensual unprotected sex then you have no right to take the life of the child that you had so carelessly pushed into this world
kill a life so you can get back to your life what a self centered pos abortions are not healthcare in fact theyre the opposite of healthcare
shes selfish
if you are pro abortion you should be well aware of how it actually works they rip the child apart by each arms and legs and then they literally scramble the poor childs brain and head before removing the child all life is scared either be responsible when having sex or be responsible and at the minimum allow the child to be born and have a fighting chance at life who are we to snuff a childs life out before it gets a chance to see the world that has so cruelly destroyed it
it may be her body but its the babys life adoption is her only choice to not be a disappointment to god only he can take a life
god bless governor of texas
if you have unprotected sex you had better be as responsible as you say you are and find out if you are or arent pregnant before 6 weeks and dont say oh i didnt know i was pregnant until i was half way through my pregnancy no if you have had sex unprotected then you are well aware you may be pregnant and to deal with it accordingly personally i think all abortion should be illegal except for medical and special occasions
"why do republican states keep passing these laws because white people keep electing them 

dont like it leave texas because these racist draconian laws are being rubber stamped by six republicans on the us supreme court"
just wait till the kids are 18 then use a gun like everyone else and take responsibility like everyone else that does it just because the government can kill anyone they want with impunity doesnt mean they can give you the same right its wrong for them and its wrong for youto          you have the right to an attorney     jesus is mine  he already paid my price for sin so i dont have to on judgment day    but for some reason this evil generation wants to kill their children by the millions  it used to be illegal when the world wasnt as evil
u miss one day that baby never sees the light of day
your literally ripping the baby out of u limb by limb thats so messed up they literally slice the baby up as its alive and has a heart beat dang it takes a man to have the kid too
despite the economic crisis this is still a good time to invest in crypto
all the more reason for heart beat bills in all 50 states
who cares
u cant set it up for adoption if u dont want kids dont start screwing then  its not 100 percent protection
why are these women having sex during a pandemic in the first place
it is not your body it is the babys body
dont open your legs to anyone and pls use protections
"stop killing babies dont have unprotected sex
give it up for adoption 
selfish brat"
"140 that care free is what got you pregnant condoms is the best easy after abstinence

she will probably will regret it down the line why not simply give the baby up for adoption "
if you said it wasnt meant to plan so it means it happen for a reason 
watching the msm whine when they dont get their way is hilarious
good if they dont like the laws in texas theyre free to leave
use the safe haven law and drop unwanted babies in firefighters stations since the government is denying you the choice to abort makes it the governments problem to deal with those unwanted kids
your bodies end where the babys body begins
selfish
if billions of dollars are being made off of the genetic material that the women are giving up why arnt women mad they dont see that money
bs all for narrative clear actor
i know its ur body your choice use 2nd protection or calm ur hormones down seg not necessary to live so yea
i dont get it why not have the baby because you dont know if your going to live to see tomorrow to decide to even want a baby
should have kept your legs closed
abortion is not health care neither is contraception however youre there because you had sex knowing the risk grow the hell up stoping a heart beat is murder
yep its all about states rights go ahead  murder a baby in another state
i think only time abortion should be allow before baby formsmedical condition rapist raping a woman and got pregnant   baby are innocent maybe still give birth and give up for adoption  many families want a baby but cant
who cares make your partner use a rubber or get on birth control lady
she felt like a disappointment to her parents but not any more
lets go brandon
shout out to george floyd on eighteen months of sobriety it took some tough love but he did it say his name liberals
"the liberal media will show caucasian

but let see how hispanic and black poll with showing that to a democratic constituency"
well hopefully these girls will understand that texas is not going to make it easy for them to kill their unborn children
lollooking for new places to commit murder
here before all the extreme pro lifers comment
how about keeping your legs closed if you dont want kids
they are welcome in new mexico where abortion is safe  legal
actually if you dont let the pns in your vajay that would be easier dont create what you cant feed wait until you are married
the trip gives you enough time to reflect it would be cool to hear testimonies of people who changed their mind after realizing the actual effort to get one and ended up keeping the baby
yon must be so proud of yourself killing your unborn baby and then posting this story as if youre the victim bull s
what this beautiful young queen signed up for and did may have been for herself but it was to another human being  its definitely more easier to end a life than to birth and raise a beautiful little oneshe has chosen to terminateto end the development and life of her recent little one and its not right period though any and the lovely lady feels its the bestright decision its very wrong  ending the life of your children based on your feelings or situation is never right  thanks for sharing  your story queen monica if you are seeing this comment of course i love your name and i certainly speak life and love to you as you move forward on your journey may you and everyone reading this comment receive much mercy hope and healing for your soul and be made whole there is more to you than you know and you are not meant to be what you did or what was done to you  may you find and become all that you were created to be
nothing stunning and brave about terminating a developing human life
"i really dont see the problem 
no one outlawed dumpsters"
what a beautiful human being im so sad about whats going on she is so brave for sharing her story
thanks for sharing your story you are an incredibly brave person 
stop using abortion as a contraceptive
next time dont cheat on your husband with something younger
millions of typically republican women and men will be secretly voting for the democratic candidate in the midterms to ensure that womens reproductive rights are not taken away nationally but rather have those rights enacted into law by a democratic house senate and presidency
sterilisation is also an option as even though i support abortion the procedure of abortion is actually dangerous the older you get
"always have to use black americans for this foolishness
why not other cultures disgusting"
im glad she survived the two hour drive
what this lady did for herself is very brave and courageous and there is nothing wrong with what she did either for it was the right decision for her life

women are going to continue to get abortions this change will not stop that abortions go way back  there will be illegal abortions somewhere too thats just my opinion
use contraceptives it isnt rocket science
reminds me of that time jeffery dahmer had to go all the way to chicago to dispose of body parts
its call keep your legs close
heres a thought  close your legs  or only do it in the rear 
wouldnt it be great if she couldnt get it and then has to explain to that child mommy almost flushed you down the toilet when you were 3 months old
after i got mine i got my tubes tied ladies that is an option
if you support contraception you support hook up culture there is no getting around that contraception severely compromises peoples natural inhibitions around the act
"this isnt the own yall thought this story would be

that said who paid for the abortion"
then why arent you practicing abstinence if you cant afford another child
the republican judges in the republican majority politicsof our biased supreme court
why can we not have stuff done for justices that lied to us on tv live then turn on roewade
a woman does not have the right to terminate a life that she was only a cocreator of  there is a father with equal rights to that life inside of her just because women carry that life inside of them for 9 months does not give them a right to terminate it your body does not equate to your choice when there is another cocreator of that life a father
watch next they will jail you for having a miscarriage as of now im texas if someone suspect you caused your miscarriage they can sue you and get 10k in damages imagine any disgruntled ex boyfriend or anyone who wants to cause you problems the power they hold
there is no good reason there votes be secret we need to know who is voting for these radical changes
the supreme court needs to have a make over the senate in power shouldnt have the power to select the justices we the people should elect the justices
planned parenthood 
oh and that little fact that during their hearings for the job they lied to our faces on live tv
oh i was surprised about amy thought she is a traitor to women kind
in essence the supreme court is inherently a political entity where considerations such as logic reason and the protection of citizens often take a back seat to political dynamics
best court money can buy
what a surprise conservatives lie they hide how horrible even they know they are until they can destroy from within just like any other cancer
abortion is a privilege
people with seven children have no right to decide the fate of others they have proved themselves completely irresponsible
they all should be going to jail for perjury they all lied on their confirmation hearings
so according to kantor all judicial compromise efforts become irrevocably hopeless based solely on things happening in the media  but the deceptive media they put out to the american public we dont know if were going to take the case despite all evidence and facts represents a window of judicial persuasion that literally does not occur in any real or symbolic way  why does she feel she has license to invent these reporting narratives out of thin air
oh i shouldve looked whos reporting kn this
clarence thomas should recuse himself  period
"donald trump is a traitor to the nation and he deserve to be on jail for a long time  
 nobody is above the constitutional rules of this country nobody  period    if they supreme court judges  if they dont give a big punishment to donald trump  they deserve to be removed from the chairs  period"
the judges on this court are corrupt and biden should appoint more judges to ballance it out and change the job from a lifetime job to a 5 year appointment  they can be removed if they are using their position to push a political agenda instead of looking at legal arguments  funny how they are promoting states rights when it benifits the republican party but if you change states right to gun reform it suddenly becomes a constitutional  one 
just look at the smug smiles of these people
when they promised not to do it and did it anyway why were they not ejected from the bench
the best supreme court that putin could buy
i always suspect that the supreme court is corrupt to the bone did we notice that trump never criticize the supreme court trump pack the court we with his supporters because hebwant them to rule in his favourthats why why trump want to go to the suprime court to declare him over the law total immunity over the constitution of the the usa
they know you all wont do anything but angrily post online about it
they say that trump will still on the ballot does that mean that we dont follow the constitution anymore he not only was involved in the insurrection he is to blame for the whole thing i just dont get it no man is above the law and yet trump is how is this possible and why isnt he in prison where he belongs the supreme court swore an oath to uphold the constitution why dont they in this case
justices dont change law they judge cases based on the law which is based on interpretation of the context of a case as the law applies congress is the only ones who can change or make law however the court can rule on it as they deem fit per the letter of the law and the constitution
the feds never should have been involved in this to begin with up until a child is viable outside of the womb it is part of the person
these judges are as honest as trump
abortion never was a constitutional right it should be an issue left to the individual states i am not for a national ban  it should be decided by the states
the scotus is compromised
if i had to look at ginny naked my face would look like thomas s too
i love this but didnt steve colbert mention all of this in a monologue a year ago
yes lets ignore millions of women the real outrage is the leak itself eyeroll
hey antichoice idiots by killing roe you killed the republican party
you cant convince us its ok to do 
baby parts are sold for money  for profit from late term abortion s its a known fact its a big money making business too
rbg was the goat for womens rights
congress should impeach the 3 justices names i will not say any other person in this country lies during an interview and they find out you lied after getting the job you are fired immediately i have seen valuable team members get fired because they lied on their application in the background documents or during their interview but when politicians congress white house and supreme court yes they are bias politicians lie nothing happens to them they keep their jobs salary and benefits and in the case of supreme court they get to keep their jobs salaries and benefits for life for anyone who really thinks the us supreme court justices are not bias and side with a political party than please check yourself into a mental hospital because you are insane justice alito thomas and the 3 new justices wanted to overturn roe v wade this is why the us supreme court should have term limits they are more politicians than justices they use their religious belief to make rulings
who keeps leaking these things or is it part of the news story to say it got leaked
alice cooper is looking great these days
the us is going downhill  its supreme court is for sale for the right price and is also highly politicized  not much room for sober interpretation of laws in this country
roberts being disappointed about breach of trust thats rich
msdnc is the establishment employee of the month
sc is run by federalist cult members bent on destroying democracy and peoples rights
"i have very little doubt that the antichoice extremism by the trumper party will cost them dearly in 2024 every dark cloud has a silver lining nice to see the terminally inept forced birthers are so willing to help america vote blue 

republicans freedom  except over your body speech books and who you may love republican hypocrisy sounds more like freedumb 

when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross    sinclair lewis"
anti vaxxers and conspiracy theorists argue about governments are taking over our lives but they are wrong as nobody is trying to control the bodies through vaxxinations but these judges and the whole republitraitor party are who they should vent their anger at
media turns political as well what should u expect from a radical liberal media these are expected comments
just a bunch of crooked judges
same goes for voting it is states issue until russian donnie got kicked off the ballot
this is going to win a pulitzer
hypocrite opposing other hypocrites because hypocrisy looks bad
here we see how a few devoutly religious individuals get placed in powerful positions to change laws pure political manipulation the minority forcing their rules  beliefs on the majority democracy sold to the highest bidder by either bribing them or offering the position to an individual with the same religious beliefs

"my bible read when jesus was questioned by pharacees from the communist synagogues followed him areoud semt out by abbotts distance relative probebly

more and more nonsense rbg stated roe was too broad and weak which would be overturned some day
hahaha joe is loosing so the fake news brain washing machine has to work 247 trying to make up false allegations we know how you cheat trump 2024
honestly i feel like we are moving backwards not forwards
set law means something entirely different from the time youre nominated to the time you are selected to sit on the court in other words they lied 
these people have destroyed the integrity of the supreme court
scotus is obviously infected with maggots and is proving allegiance to the insurrectionists and their farright antidemocratic agenda watch out americans your will soon live in a dictatorship if you dont pay attention
to be prolife is to recognize the inherent value of every human being regardless of their stage of development
"i hate this idea that we should read anything in justice cb taking any kind of stand means we should evaluate her character maybe warm up a seat on the resistance high council like we did for megan kelley
no absolutely not"
"what the justices seems to have forgotten is that as a justice they need 
to leave their personal feelings at the door their job has nothing to do with
how they personally feel about a case they are weighing in on they are
suppose to be deciding whats right or wrong according to our constitution 
if they cant leave their personal feelings at the door they need to find another 
line of work same for cops its not about you

"
i want to tell you again for the second time or third time there is someone who is hijacking your ns and bc podcasts and putting them on her site we cannot find them on the regular site please look into this
this is appalling if trump gets immunity in his case that means immunity for biden also and we must rally for him to stay in office
how much did  the supreme corrupt judges get paid off to reverse the will of the people
if biden wins 1124 dear god please please please and has a majority house and senate he should add 4 justices to the court we have 13 districts we should have 13 justices then pass a law stating you can only rise  of justices when districts reach an odd  1517 etc
america is under attack from christian sharia law
its funny how mad corrupt people get at whistleblowers the supreme court has a long distinguished history of betraying the trust of the people
"conservatives we should execute whoever leaked that draft
reporters looks like it was leaked by conservatives to try to solidify the vote 
conservatives "
idc where you stand on abortion but the supreme court should be impartial and fair to everyone
"chris hayes alleges that something is a great piece translation its a moronic piece that wasnt worth the writing of it i notice that the loyal loonies of the left are out in farce in the comment section quelle surprise

just to be clear on the issue of votes they had the votes to both take an overturn casey roe was already a dead letter by the work of casey as usual chris hayes is working hard to be the head clown in the car reading all sorts of idiotic things into the world they werent waiting for rbg to die to do anything her vote was irrelevant it takes 4 votes to hear a case and they had that it takes 5 votes to overturn a precedent since hayes isnt all that bright and neither is this reporter hes interviewing they had one extra vote than they needed

also kantor is attempting to sell people on the idea that she has inside information to the justices conference she does not no one does shes just doing her job her one an only job sell copy fiction is a fantastic tool of journalists for the same reason it is for other folks who make bank off of making things up"
quit reading  in to this and your opinion is not needed propaganda not needed independent
this 6 have to go
msnbc is the last source i would trust on the issue
they gave her cover she knew they didnt need her vote smoke and mirrors 3 justices are political activists 2 of which are illegitimate justices

if we wanted a supreme court thats not politicized wed have devised a method of seclection that excluded bias  the business of presidential selection ensures bias and in disturbed times like ours the wheel falls off completely and the whole process of going to the supreme court becomes a farce  why not make a list of all those who want to be on the supreme court and choose the winners using the lotto selector  the country is going to have to do something like that or continue down the path to a continuation of the civil war  how many more warnings do we need
i never understood why they did it because roe was the republican golden goose they had a topic they could take to their supporters and fund raise off of endlessly they could scream and yell and cry and shake hands and do nothing and ride that easy money wave
i had been holding it down for days but thanks to this piece i wasnt able to hold back my gag reflex  proving once again theres no bottom but only new lows
scotis is way broken and a prime example of the importance of term limits
it is utterly dillisional to think thwt the leak had any effect on the outcome of dobbs covering the surpreme court must really make you think this institution is not utterly corrupted by politcal power unfortunately by any conceivable measure of the court there is no deliberation at all here merely an exercising of power
remember them they will enter history as one of the most corrupt and untrustworthy justices to have ruled america we wont forget the likes of them so we can put justices of higher intergrity into the supreme court someone worthy who is nothin like them 
oh nancy pelosi and chuck schumer accountable they are the corrupted people if you do that you hold the bright people responsible for it and you will start looking like a are real smart person right now all your lunatic look like you all confused
yeah whatever it is its not a bombshellthis supreme court is the fault of lazy progressive democrats
sorry amy your weak but i didnt want to hear the case died when you sided with the other judges to overturn it
the court corrected a bad decision whats wrong with that  roe v wade was based upon something that does not exist the right to privacy
kentucky voters are to blame for repeatedly voting for the monster in my opinion next to hitler mcconnell is the worst human beingever
scotus roles all need to have a term limit as do all public offices competent oversight should be appointed by a committee of unbiased professionals not a president have minimum qualifications be evaluated and investigated prior to assuming the role be subject to the same benefits and laws as citizens there should only be one set of benefits and laws and more  some of these topics may seem to be covered but theyre not  a majority of the present scotus appointees are corrupt andor incompetent
dad go to meg spearman two minute
if ruth actually retired while obama was president that would have been incredibly helpful lol
these 6 hold the future of us democracy in their hands unfortunately there is not one honest or ethical person making up the 6
make no mistake scotus is highly political and the power mongers have helped to tilt the scales of justice
ordinairy business and lobby club
who says we live in postironic times the supreme court upset about the leak that exposed their secret decision to nullify roe vs wade the sc lost all trust with me not that i ever respected them the fbi or other actors in our government the bubblican party is void of ethics
people worry about a trump coup and it already happened when he packed the supreme court with corrupt minions
if she had just retired when obama was president this would never have happened
the leak was alito who was 100 playing politics and wanting to legislate from the bench
from mr billy ray chessher 3bc1 nicknamed mr superman 3bc1 from the united states of america the justice league of america yeah all american women get their rights to 100 total say n choice n decision what they do or dont do with bodies n which all women should have 100 total control of their very own bodies yeah praise god almighty thank u god 
"power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely  john emerich edward dalbergacton 1st baron acton 13th marquess of groppoli better known as lord acton  
and thus we have the supreme justices drunk with absolute power"
over time i simply think all this establishes is how corrupt and political the supreme court is and the fact that there were no consequences for the leaker reinforces the idea that we have a supreme court that itself feels it is above the law  between this and all the payoffs and outright bribery weve learned about  all with nothing being done  it just shows what a banana republic the us has really become
the supreme court justices are more like court jesters  for whoever takes care of them 
thanks to judgment to supreme court justices to usa
the republican voted judges are against all freedom all choice and there all apart of the kkk they work against the ppl they dont work for the ppl the kkk are in the supreme courts
we can always tell
they all need to be fired from those seats why cant we vote for whos in those positions i hate our political system
kantor spends too much time making coneybarrett a hero in this article when in fact she ultimates decides to overturn roe i dont get her kantors nuance here
look what republican voters have to ignore look what democrat voters cant ignore
sobasically they are playing with our lives
its blatant and in our facesmsnbc does the bidding of the white house
didnt this happen a long time ago
not the alternate facts
i wonder how many abortions they paid for in the past  i guess we will never know
they should wear patches on their robes like nascar drivers showing their financial backers
"please encourage your family and friends to register and legally vote democratic 
vote democratic in local school board city judgeships county state governor legislature state supreme court and federal elections 
dems are not perfect however not the smoke that the party of trump pot maga republicans are giving our citizenry"
"the following are all allegations
clarence affirmative action money bags money train kept man thomas is rich he does not officially own much his assets are not in his name presidents cannot keep gifts why should this scotus keep gifts from harlan crow the koch brothers or any other gop 4 known buyers that
paid for his wedding and honeymoon
dallas cowboys super bowl ring
mothers house and properties
nephews university tuition paid in full
leo lenard payments to ginnys law firm
horatio alger association of the wealthy that he is now an idolized member yes he receives gifts from this association 
david sokol is a helping hand
free flights on private jets free super yacht trips and free stays at resorts he never paid from his scotus salary
millions in gifts why
ginger holdings llc
only tip of iceberg there is more to come
the previous comments are allegations "
"heres the latest news from the supreme court 

first orange mans farright maga majority issued rulings to overturn roe v wade weaken the epa end affirmative action reaffirm college entitlements and push all their extremist maga agenda 

then they heard arguments on a case that would end social security and medicare programs that millions of americans count on 

now theyve agreed to rule on a case that could ban mifepristone a commonly used incredibly safe abortion medication and lay the groundwork to outlaw birth control 

these rulings will have devatating consequences for americans in the present and future"
"the party of trump pot
the maga are all high on pot"
"when a supreme court judge takes a oath to our constitution pledges elegance to our flagwhen questioned at interview they lied
so aint is why they must be removed for lying being giving  false statements
"
end of genocidal medical procedure
i am trying to have a baby now but if this passes i would gladder wait until i can move out of the country for good usa is sinking quick
its only about control  because if you believe in god then why are you not going to trust him to judge kate not you that is proof politicians do not trust in god to punish her
supreme court is bipartisan or political my butt
why not ban all live births to compensate for the population surge on our southern border 
this is rgb fault that hungry b hadnt retired we wouldnt be in this mess
the breach of trust are the politicians mateguarding scotus nominees to preserve roe v wade  laws should be decided by the people not 7 liberal justices in 1973
thats  the crooked games republicans play hi allito top crook judge we see you
term limits
god   said do unto others as you have them do unto you 
sounds like god removed her from the planet  and  than  he  replacde her with a pro life judge 
whats with the attempts to white wash coney barrett she voted to nix abortion in the end which is what matters
the will not stop at roe
barret voted against knowing it would still be taken  red herring
i commend jodi for keeping such a level head and stating the facts during this interview this guy can be a bit leading im liberal and all but i really dont like his style in this interview like hes trying to rile people up into a frenzy its reminiscent of the crap they play on the right
psh this could have happened 10 years later and we would have known it was because she died whats funny is these people dont have to worry about reelection or some crap  the supreme court is too political
again i say  wtaf with lifetime appointments  america we can be so freaking stupid
this sounds like lets forgive barrett because shes a woman in power and feminism exists what a joke
justices which shouldnt follow political lines complaining when theyre called out for pushing their political view
i love this liberal propaganda the leak may have been inappropriate because the justices could have changed their vote yeah right and trump can admit that he committed all the crimes hes done over the past five years
418 come on lady this is your cue to say that thing we talked about you saying
if this angers you remember trump is taking the credit for this
american christian taliban
trying to insert reason and justice into a 50 year long political hatchet job is ludicrous
dont understand why its a question abortion is a human right
reform is required no lifetime appointments more justices and a balance across all parties including independents all for starters having the ayatem as it is oppresses the majority of the population
this is why we need to abolish the electoral college  these religious nuts have an insane amount of power over us those are living in 2023
"in 1953 my greatgreat uncle found four strangled newborns hidden in his fields my aunt told me about a much older cousin who had three abortions in secret to avoid raising kids with a violent husband 
this was in the days before roe and these are the days were going back to when abortions happened in secret and when actual fresh living babies were killed silently when abortions were denied"
dont look at mei voted for hillary
america holds itself as a moral paragon while being one of the most corrupt duplicity even the judiciary
i thought we all knew it was saltamayor
being able to buy a supreme court justice is corruption by definition
i cant say i have much confidence in the supreme court i dont believe that the justices are primarily interested in the law i dont believe the american people are foremost in the justices minds they have become political animals who make law secondary to power politics
a whole ton of revisionist history in this the fact remains they had the votes before and after the leak the took the case before the leak they negated the will of the majority of people before the leak the leak was never a problem for these people they wanted to destroy the will of the majority of americans thats the sole reason they were put there
amy coney barret be smiling at sc portraits like she deserves to be there
beach of trust you crook
are we still complaining about having lost roe v wade its awful genuinely but there are so many other stories that the news should be tackling and refuse to obviously this is about politics and power youd be dumb to expect anything else the fact this is still in the news cycle shows that its not a pressing issue but a distraction from what matters what is our government doing right now
so do kantor and liptak know who leaked the document and why and just cant say due to journalistic ethics or do they literally not know
at this point there is no one who hates women than the hard christian right  we might as well live in afghanistan and iran
i have no respect for some of these justices
the supreme court should take cases regardless of how it appears they shouldnt take politics into account at all this isnt at all like taking gifts
correct me if im wrong acb pulled a rico
the reason amy coney barret or whatever her name is voted against taking up the case so soon after rbg died was because she didnt want to look bad it wasnt because of some great soulsearching moment she had or anything like that she didnt want to look like a tacky person plowing into one of rbgs most fiercely protected topics while her chair was still warm
abortion is wrong in our eyes as christians from conception but if not in others and its legal it should have limits on the age 
developed feeling pain in a awful degree 
its sounds like you want to unsurp gods job as  which he does a  good    enough job at beingthat  he can have a miscarriage happened or help save both lives if possibe at least     still born rok yes but they do saline abortions up to 21 24 weeks  burning a baby alive in the womb its wrong morally 
who leaked it though that is the big question that was just kind of dropped by the investigation was it a justive was it a staffer were there any conaequences whatsoever
i have very little trust in the us how many more steps until the country will turn into a religious extremist dictatorship what is the next step after this   remove voting rights for woman as it is against gods will for woman to have rights
no one is entitled to anyone elses body period
"that is a huge pile of male bovine fecal matter 
talk to a lady named anita hill 
yet the so called justice got approved to the supreme court 
money talks lady justice is supposed to be blind but lady justice can here money talking"
what does it matter if she voted against hearing it 6 minus 1 is still more than the 4 they needed i dont care about symbolic actions that do nothing she just wanted to protect her own optics and when push came to shove she still voted to axe roe v wade
yeah not always true i have electric heat in each room
this conservative majority in the supreme court is an abomination and an embarassment theyre overtly political agents
"the supreme court is a farce anytime they split party lines we know it is politics when that 54 vote wins we know something is deeply wrong with the justices not always with the ruling but with those who are on the bench 

1 term limits 
2 unanimous decision rulings required
3 only 3 justices ruling per case selected unanimously by the other justices 
4 at year 5 a congressional review of the justice or opportunity to step down"
so this entire decision was made on partisan buddy politics and not actually the word of the constitution nice to finally have confirmation the supreme court is in fact partisan
im for abortion up to the 240th trimester in certain cases
for some reason i thought that the court wasnt deciding the issue until theyve heard all of the evidence from both sides  silly me
who cares barrett voted to overturn roe and that is what matters
democrats cant tell you what a woman is they think men can get pregnant
trumps judges all lied to get on the bench they knew before they even got on the bench they were going to do what they could to over turn roe they have a lot of nerve to have a problem with the leak they have no respect for the seat as liars dont belong in the supreme court the most honest people should be on its highest court
worst scotus ever   impeach alito and thomas   amend constitution to install term limits for the justices  continually monitor their gifts bribes
besides trump our supreme court has become a group of crooks and liars and that should say alot about the right wingers taking control of our nation 1 thing at a time
its crystal clear that ramming these judges through was an agenda to overturn law and precedent to rewrite laws based on religion not law its an attack on the court system from within
this leak shouldnt shock anyone supreme court justices are merely humans with their own individual opinions of right and wrong and stockholders with investments in a variety of corporations our sociopolitical landscape has always been a battle between theocratic and secular ideals add to that the intelligenceorganized crime corporationgovernment partnerships running our worlds economies and what we end up with are three branches of government legislative executive and judicial focused solely on social baby sitting a population brought up with nonsensical beliefs in an invisible primatedeity our entire understanding of right and wrong in based in false dogmas and nonexistent gods we need a new plan
yeah more free gifts  vacations from trump for the republican judges
from the river to the sea
could we not say abortion leak wordsmithing is a thing
i trusted scotus but no more its bipartisan now  not law thomas is on the take with all his freebees he is own by the rich
judges at any level should not have a personal opinion on any legal review especially at the highest level i realize its not always realistic for personal opinions not to influence a ruling when a judge is at any level of appeal it should simply be was the original decision wrong legally was something done wrong that would change the outcome  when it comes to a persons right is the existing law or decision unconstitutional nationally or locally  the reversal of roe didnt say abortion is wrong it simply stated that the law should be made locally not nationally  states are already making laws but in my opinion it should be made by a referendum before the state congress makes decisions some states say no abortion for any reason after 6 weeks which is ridiculous
your judicial system needs a complete reset it appears to be corrupted by politics from top to bottom
this is just wasting our time
i find this to be a total abomination that one person one vote can affect tens if not a hundred millions of americans thats just playing nutz
the comment section is gonna be a place of civil discourse with no vitriol whatsoever
trump kavenaugh and thomas are the main reasons why abortion should be legal because cowards will never admit to taking advantage a woman should always have the final say when it comes to her body regardless the outcome is between the woman and god
"all of this because rbg hubris refusing to retire while obama was in the office and the dem controlled both chambers of congress

yea the gop packed the court and overturned the rvw but the dem party also played with your life by thinking and assuming clinton would win and she can name rbgs replacement instead of being responsible they played with this and the people ended up paying for it"
it was a left wing democrat
these asswipes were hoping to publish their ruling and then skip off on vacation right after and hide until the firestorm blew over but someone thankfully leaked the details out and they were caught red handed lol
i mean are they an objectively evil immoral person or are they prochoice
hoping the overturning roe v wade means states mamdate you have to get vaccinated and must donate your organs at death
to be fair we didnt need that leak the gop has made it their goal for half a century to overturn roe v  wade whether its constitutional or not the second there was a republican majority made by trump i knew roe v wade was dead
cia or nsa leak
this court is a sham  they lie to americans  they take money from foreign governments  they have become so political its sad
the supreme court more like the s court
you cant trust fellow criminals chief justice
the republican supreme court is a corrupt and dishonest body   the idea that no one is above the law is up for sale and the conservertives have cornered the market
it terrible that the majority of the scotus is slimy
moscow mitch creep
reps are nothing but confederate trash
i bet at least two justices made a large bundle off this vote
"gotta give them crazy jesus bible thumpers due credit cause man can they get stuff done they been plotting and scheming and got it done

unlike democrats who just lie out their buts about healthcare for all free tuition for public college maternity and paternity leave theyve done absolutely nothing"
this is what happens when you elect a bunch of unqualified conservative judges to the highest court in the nation  they cant even make basic decisions about the law without letting their emotions opinions and the people that own them tell them what to do
corrupt clarence thomas needs to go lets start there
the supreme court is full of frauds
we are so proud of our democracy here in the us we shout our conviction that we live in the best country in the world when we look at the facts we see that our democracy is railroaded by neo conservatives who weaponize the supreme court how can we allow a political party to own our freedom how can we allow them to hold up a legal nomination of a moderate justice so that he can be replaced with an ultra right politician i fought and bled for our country i thought but now i realize i lost my youth and my health for no reason but the political aims of a morally bankrupt president my country is sliding into third world status and nobody seems aware of it
the conservative supreme court with their black robes is a corrupt court
free american people need to rise up most other countries in europe fight for their rights and we need to do that
not exactly a bombshell she still voted to restrict abortion rights to women theres nudging to think about shes the trump of scotus justices compared with the washington general of equality rbg
call it what it is  a conspiracy of parties on the supreme court that actively worked to overthrow settled law
we knew we saw it coming i hope the clerks who do actually have enormous sway over the rights of us citizens  will be vetted beyond their political attractiveness to leo federalist or heritage going forward congress could and should enact auditing or ig for scotus staff who are paid by tax dollars
he gave us moral  absolutes that are  what our court systems agree with do not murder dont steal etc its a crime punishable by law 
and hope they do not decide your life is worthless too  god bless
we decl care that all men are created  equal   and given  inalienable  rights the right to life  the right to liberty  and the right  to happiness  by god 
"the supreme court consists of a christian conservative majority thanks to pressure from ex president trump and the christian right wing now making christian conservative decisions and opinions
as an atheist that does not recognize the existence of the christian god yahwehjesus i find their ruling that overturned legal abortion irrelevant"
what im hearing is the final decision on abortion was made long before the court even heard the case
it does not mean she is against repeal only it would look bad for her
other than roberts the other 5 conservative justices are way more concerned with advancing conservative policy than being neutral arbiters of the constitution   to them overturning roe v wade is the main reason why they were appointed   that is what they truly believe was their job description  not to objectively interpret the constitution but to advance the conservative agenda  as an attorney and someone who cares deeply about the law i find that extremely sad   i dont even care one way or the other about abortion  i care about the constitution and what it means to this great country  stare decisis means more to me than any particular substantive issue  i get that if legal precedent is clearly erroneous it should be reversed as society becomes more enlightened and as certain past draconian views become obsoleteintolerable by society  the court in brown v board of education was right to overturn plessy v ferguson which by the way was a 9  0 unanimous decision which indicates the prior decision in plessy was clearly erroneous  but ignoring stare decisis should never be used to go backward like in this case   also ignoring stare decisis should only be done with a unanimous or near unanimous decision not a 63 split like in this case where the decision is made on partisan lines
so constitution says judge serve based on good behavior so clarence thomas has not behaved good so he could be impeached
scouts is a breach of trust
clearance wife is the one who leak it
bombshell no new information just a bunch of speculation based on  anonymous sources that could easily not exist i wonder why reporters expect total trust when they have shown many times that they dont hesitate to lie ann misled based on political economical and social inclinations by the way i respect kamtors tone it does not seems she is trying to blow the stuff out of proportion or building a narrative
the supreme court may think they are the boss but they arent  everyday goes bye they show their backside in the wind but the day is coming when they will be swept aside with the other trash  the good lord will reign their unjust ways will be no more
direct descendants of spanish inquisition
it was nothing more than pushing a religous agenda that is all it ever was and they have tried to overturn it for years but did not have the majority to do it this is why the gop wanted trump in
the first thing i want is for men to shut up your vote came when you impregnated the woman who is in charge of childbirth  the last thing i want is a woman to have a child who does not want a child  any questions
no wonder we stopped hearing about the leak it went from being a travesty against america to oh well once it became undeniable that it was a conservative who leaked it
sad our highest court is owned
"person 1  does backflip
person 2   who cant do backflips  we should ban backflips lol
america in a nut shell"
who wants to bet the leak was justice alito again and theyll blame it on a staffer
im thinking once biden wins his second term he will add judges we need to make our scotus liberal bc the definition of being liberal is accepting and understanding all being republican means you will judge and rule based on your religion not for all americans
the courts decision was based on religious views not the rights of women
who cares if barrett was hesitant in the end she did what she was picked to do take rights away from women
superb work  great article  i believe alito lied and leaked so he could lock in the vote he knew he had risk of losing
the leak came from the gop appointed judges
this logic concerning ruth and justices waiting for her death does not make sense  she was not a legaly valid justice some time before her death  requires siting for the bench  not at home where no one actualy knowes if its really even her votes
amazing how they think more babies are going to be born i see more birth control being used
alito leaked it clearly
"so basically it was not a legal decision they had already made up their minds and just wanted it to come before them so they could essentially stomp on it
disgusting
i dont know how anyone could ever trust the supreme court ever again"
they are all racist crooks
how could 51 of us citizens not feel that scotus is a breech of constitutional trust
personally i believe that originalism in constitutional interpretation is as uninformed hermeneutically as fundamentalism is in islamic jewish and christian doctrine each is more about personal certainty and power than it is about genuine interaction with a text
congratulations america  you have a corrupt supreme court
the justices should be disbanded for dishonest behavior and bribery
the conservatives supreme court is a threat to american democracy now that theyve been overturned roe v wade theyre coming for voting rights and then theyre going to come for interracial marriage just you wait  the evangelicals wont stop until we are living in a religious theocracy just like iran
notice alito is the only one not looking at the camera weird
anybody know who the scotus members are
wow another overhyped nothing burger of a report from msnbc
sam seder called it when it happened
i would say vote blue but the dems are ok with anything thats technically legal and will bend over backwards to reach across the isle no matter how many americans the republicans harm
ban abortion
scotis has 6 greedy corrupt lying judges   i hate those 6 judges with all my soul
thomass wife was the leak  duh i knew this within seconds of hearing happen it is so painfully obvious
the right organizes  there is a deep state of rightwing activists who have planned an end to abortion for decades  planned it while the left talked about bipartisanship and reached across the aisle  it would be nice if the left recognized that its in a fight between an open inclusive society and christofascism
is anyone surprised that kavanaugh would lie and deceivecompletely consistent with his confirmation testimony
the damage is done its always the people who suffer from currupt decisions  which is politically all day every day what says c and his besti please
prison cell for trump putin clarence and rudy 2024
since when under our constitution does the sc make laws  oh since we have the robertstrump court  they dont believe in our constitution nor follow their 1 job is to destroy it for a trump dictatorship
the overturning of roe vs wade was entirely politically and self serving  to maintain profits the corporations need workers and consumers  handmaiden tales has some truth to it
laws made by men or women cant last forever just like the men and women that enact them
"politics and power

no  the politics and power grab involved the original 1970s roe v wade scotus decision

the issue belongs with the states period  theres a big flippin reason this is the united states of america and not the all seeing all knowing knows whats best for everyone big daddy switchwielding federal government"
they have got make sure thier anti christ is born
and this changes nothing 
honestly most surprised that a women and a black man did that to their own
stutter sputter cant they get a guy that can speak well
from day one of the death of rbg i did not trust that she died of her cancer my information at that time was that she was just getting better after some therapy at the same time all media discussed russian interference in us elections without identifying any action of them specifically her death came last second for a new nomination by trump and a possible elector boost that was just too convenient to a possible interference with infamous russian poisoning my mind made this all up and  i wondered that apparently nobody else considered it then again i also saw january 6 coming before most other people anyway i remain in my belief and would appreciate if someone could give me factual information which could change my belief
"this is all just noise 

doesnt matter rvw is overturned"
the supreme court was never supposed to be partisan we need to  impeach criminals in the scoutus
"its broken the us supreme court no politician shoud apoint a judge other judges do that else its not divided and not free of politics 
thats what a normal democrcy works in the 3 branches like its surposed to be"
they are garbage
stupidity reigns supreme in america
the supreme courts lost all respect from the people of america
isnt it great that a reporter will dig for news but wont give source no one will trust me again if i tell who it was so i am guessing the reporter just like the judges presidents ex predidents senators congress persons put their careers above the people in this case mostly women the lives of the people of the usa
"i do not understand how this supreme court thinks they have the right to stop a woman or anybody else from murdering a child
 its your child and you should have the choice to murder your child
 what a bunch of sickos in this world"
amy has not real opinions nor does she have the skills needed to be on the court she was picked just to vote with the boys she is a traitor to women feel sorry for her children especially her daughters
vile bunch in that thumbnail  vile lying and evil
women are not property anymore get the courts to prove that definition it sounds like women are still being oppressed it needs to stop
this issue should never have been a court issue in the first place never out of the doctors office and patient but there were billions to be made for the agenda it only went back to the states 10th amendment  it was about money from the get go not health not women but power and money
judge should not be political only interpret
even ginsburg said rowe wasnt a valid ruling it just passes it back to the states
now that weve seen the sadistic consequences of overturning roe was it worth dividing the nation by your dogmatic decision
congress not the supreme court needed and still needs to make the proper laws codifying the right to abortion and specifying the limits and rules that are or are not needed  in this interview she talks about them considering a 15 week rule and such  thats not their job  they are supposed to interpret the existing laws  congress needs to do their job as usual
this is the best court the republican party could buy
roberts breach of trust is a good way to put it  but whos trust are you saying  the american people trust the court anymore 
no wonder they gave the green light for police to lie as they did the same during their senate interviews how much does it cost for a vote as we now know at least some of them can be bought on vacation
"the corruption and greed of clarence thomas are blatant and obvious he put his gavel on sale to the highest bidder this is illegal he has betrayed the trust of every citizen and he deserves to be prosecuted and held accountable for destroying the trust the world had for the highest court in america 
vote blue  save america"
to think i have respected the supreme courts ruling most my life now i am not even sure if they care how rule affects the people of our country it makes me very sad for this country and the future of this nation
"the protestants were right to fear a papist court when kennedy won the presidency the republicanappointed are all on the take and antiamerican pos they follow pius xii who thought hitlers final solution was a swell idea they even have their own blöd führer in trump

"is being a supreme court justice about scholarship anymore 

this is why people are foregoing university they dont want to become sophists like these people"
i think what we need is more old white guys in the supreme court ugh
neither kamala nor any of the other proabortionists can answer when a fetus is considered another human being
stop political appointments for the supreme court  vet canidates then use a lottery system to choose the canidate  remove the politics and the allegiances required for the nomination  these people should be non political and only there for one thing  to interpret the law without bias
i just wonder do they ever go to bed at night thinking  how their sc will be remembered in history as one of the most corrupted sc in united states history they are the worst of the worst of humans even if they dont believe they are the world knows they are
"this lady is too close in take a step back barret had within a matter of months declared that roe was settled law in front of the entire country she was hoping to put distance between her and the lie before shed have to admit it was a lie once the cat was out of the bag she voted exactly how she was intended to vote all along aint no mystery just an attempt to save face
     i think the leak was a good thing it forced their hand in time to cost them every election since and its going to continue to cost them every election purple states are going to turn blue over this one and red states are going to turn purple we already know what the women of ohio think of it will be interesting to see what the women of texas will do with their own personal gilead"
republicans nothing like having your own court
us scotus is the new world clown show  when things start going down hill it runs away from you pretty quick  far quicker than you guys and gals figured ya  well some of you at least  now how long will it be an embarrassment to be a scotus justice  i think they are responsible for that  my guess is it will be for some time
"the supreme court is not an abortion 
scrotus rules ok
and can someone stop judging amy
the kicker 
hows this for a fun fact roe not her real name is a born again christian now and doesnt believe in abortion 
oh america youve done it again"
we know who did it and so do they there is not process for investigating these black robes
tldr it was alito obviously
oh really you dont say now that you see the real cost its costing your party you are scrambling to do something abt it shame on you you liers and thieves
"their garbage  i used to respect scotus more than anything but i say theres at least 4 that need to be impeached  have great reason to back it up their disgusting 

also whats the value in doing anything as far as states rights if scotus can just come right behind with this knucklehead group that lies under oath  undo everything youve done"
we do not believe them in the supreme court nor do we trust them barrett lied kavanaugh lied and i dont even know what to say about thomas i wish we would get more supreme court justices that are fair and follow the constitution
"yes supreme court bought paid for corrupt judges bought and paid for by billionaires and instated on court by trump  so of course this corrupt government will rule for trump
we have no justice in america"
yeah but  he definitelyhad to getelectedsooohowsthat working for you  not so good huh    wellthats exactly what happenswhen youcheat
states can do what they want no one stopping them
wellonce we gain powerover boththe senate and the house of representativesall will beok
was this really four days old or an attempt to keep abortion top of mind for the elections
why is she making excuses this is the problem people need to stop soft peddling this nonsense and just call it as it is conservative republicans did what they said they were going to do there was no nuanced discussion or debate on abortion
thats exactly what they did and they wonder why the american people see them the way they do because thats who they are 
when that putrid curtain is pulled back thats behind the supreme court its gonna show a scared little orange man just like in the wizard of oz all these people have been like the flying monkeys and melania will melt
the abndonment of reason and logical rationality in such high legal decieons and replaced by political manouver means the ussupreme court is no longer  a defender of legal right and truth it is a buyable political agent of others it has undermined its high role and besmirched itself badly it has also galvanised huge numbers of woemn who are very angry at this intrusion into their personal liberties
reporting is disingenuous  barrett did not switch sides she merely acted to withhold facts from the american people
omg i thought that was a guy 
when does a law become a crime cruel and unusual punishment prohibition stated in state constitution medical privacy between licenced medical proffessional provider and patient and legitament decisions pregnacies and medical risks are not created equal and one size fits all bans or laws of an abstract ideology cannot be regulated and force non medical and political interferences political malpractice and medical imposters do not protect anyone
so now we are giving acb credit for being reasonable really all she did was play hardball in a futile attempt to avoid being vilified for the rest of her life as a republican political patsybut we all know thats exactly what she is otherwise her monumentally hypocritical appointment in the last days of a failed republican presidency wouldnt have happened in the first place she deserves credit for being politically savvynot for being reasoned and impartial her placement on the court is as corrupt and illegitimate as kavanagh and gorsuch even if she didnt exactly lie under oath as they did she prevaricated better than they did because she is smarter than they are so call her what she is an extreme maga political activist who will go down in history as a traitor to women and a lynchpin of the movement to destroy american democracy because lets face itwomen are the canaries in the coal mine anywhere and any time authoritarianism is on the rise gimme a break
one major problem  we the people have euh we do not have enuff n words as judges on the scotus especially female n words
a known billionaire is sucking up to these republicans and they all know that eventually they will be rewarded for their actions in helping the ultra right wing dangerous morons not directly as they know they can be traced but it will happenone along with his wife is already getting a lot of money just because he threatened to leave this phony court and be replaced by a democratits a strange justice department this highest court filled with quid pro quo people all on the right
if they want to complain about a breach of trust perhaps they should look at themselves and how the american people cannot trust them its time to change things up in that old lying supreme court
how can a sc nominee tell congress on their confirmation say rvw is settled law then turn around and and say rvw is unconstitutional  says a lot about lying justices and a lazy congress
let me guess it was trumps fault in the end
theres no bombshell its just a stupid who caresshell
gosh i thought that corruption was endemic only in african countries
nevermind the fact that roe was decided far too broadly  roe ventured too far in the change it ordered and presented an incomplete justification for its action rbg
this edition of the supreme court is an abortion a legal abortion stare decisis be damned
"i wonder who could have possibly leaked this opinion  

schmarence schmomas 

we first heard about how  scotus planned to rule in a leak from congress hateful eight everyone also knows which justice has the strongest or at least the most obvious ties to maga"
ginsburg did the country a disservice by not retiring when a democrat was in the white house
so why those justice can lie during confirmation and has no consequences
thank you to the new york times 
the breach of trust was them lying in their questioning at their vote to be a judge
the coloured judge let all coloured people down by being absolutely brainless
"roberts was so interested in investigating the leak and then nothing

he found the leak and didnt want admit it was a conservative justice or staffer"
"roberts was so interested in investigating the leak and then nothing

he found the leak and didnt want admit it was a conservative justice or staffer"
the way i see it a few of the scotus lied under oath and set precedent for all to be able to lie under oath and face no consequences
she was a worthless guest she gave no meaningful information
such a surprise that kavanaugh is playing fast and loose with his role said nobody
msnbc i continue to wish you were better news speaks for itself let influencers pretend the public needs to be emotionally charged to click on their videos bombshell is opinion the story is real let it be when you stop sucking ill tune in
this is the most corrupt  classless sc weve ever had
jodi kanter seems to be trying very hard to make the story about barretts decision but im with chris hayes here the real story is that they tried to do this as quickly as possible after rgbs death while trying very hard to make it look like they werent
lester holt can you answer viveks question  why did you lie to america  why are you fake news vivek exposed msnbc and it has yet to defend itself from the allegations
judge dies and then they over turn roe v wade theres a movie they killed the judges they may want to watch  the pelican brief
msnbc is the enemy of america
gee ya suppose gini thomas had anything to do with that leak
oh it was settled alright shouldve dug a little deeper and asked them to explain more classic doublespeak
i dont care about the leak i care about the decision to overturn roe v wade
you forgot to mention that justice ginsberg supported the relitigation of roe because it was flawed and was not decided on the text of the constitution that was obviously true as many other recognized legal and constitutional experts had said the same thing for many years and decades there is a strong case to be made that the issue should be legislated by congress and not 9 members of the court but congress has still not passed a law on making abortion legal which shows that roe was not settled law why doesnt the legislature carry out their constutional role and responsibility to pass a law this has caused a great deal of public unrest since roe was decided
so ive noticed something all these people were worried about how they would look but no one even considered how it would affect people
"alito is the chief person of interest hands down 
i like many americans have lost confidence in the scotus ive always believed the scotus was concerned about protecting the rights of our citizens sadly im no longer of that opinion"
why is it saying this is 3 days old
"there was never a right to abortion there was a right to privacy on the issue of abortion   that was what roe decided    in another case the court decided to limit abortion on viable fetuses     now they changed their mind  protecting a babys life is indeed a function of the government and overruled roe

bottom line the liberals did it to themselves   they just had to have later and later abortions for perfectly viable babies then babies born alive then murdered on the operating table then harvesting organs   despicable act after despicable act from abortion providers was the straw that broke the proverbial camels back"
what happened to the supreme court not being antiamerican the breach of trust is the fact that the supreme court has been guilty of openly attacking americans 247365 since the decision to abolish roe was announced the leaker is the only person involved not guilty of attacking the american people
about barrett no it doesnt there is nothing profound or fascinating
regardless of the excuses given the reality is that this extremely conservative supreme court is poised to deprive women in this country of their inherent rights under the us constitution this supreme court has unequivocally shown itself to be deeply corrupt willfully negligent and a threat to the nation period when the highest court in the land engages in bribery and attempts to selfregulate its own corrupt ethics the entire country will inevitably face the resultant consequences
the most corrupt branch of government
dred scott was once considered settled law  its horrible they overturned rvw but nobody should consider any decision irreversible especially now that dobbs is on the books
there is gun control with gun control nobody blames the target so men have the bullets sperm yet woman are controlled by said bulletgun holder
they fined the doctor that performed an abortion on a 10 year old rpe victim one of the politicians even going as far as to say she should have been forced to give birth are you really surprised if that was your daughter would you force her to have the child would you stay home to care for the newborn as the 11 year old mother repeats 5th grade 
republicans thought overturning roe would help them win elections they were very wrong about that
so who leaked it
playing with america based on their affiliation to the gop party without the leak and this investigative reporting after the mess we now see that someone interfered all along so my remedy is to replace every justice that trump appointed since it was illegal how he got into office and why hes sitting in a courtroom today if the founders of the constitution didnt see this crap happening then we need to amend the constitution to crosscorrect these corrupt individuals we have to put america back on track for the people not these politicians or careerdriven people like george santos and clarence thomas are great examples
"its intellectually disingenuous to say that news of a deliberation locks you into a position you werent already locked into
i highly doubt the leak cemented anyones position"
old racist white supremacist judges are totally ignorant and do not care about the reality of a woman who does not want to raise a child 18 years without financial support from the father just because of a one night stand of 5 minutes they are bastardized in their 1950 view that all women seeking an abortion are happily married and have money to care for a baby no womenteenagers have unwanted pregnancies because there are no womens clinics for low income women to get birth control this causes a strain on foster homes the adoption legal fees are 3050000
in peoples eyes  god always shows mercy to the repentant  soul 
the other sometimes a unremorsefull person being served justice  
i dont understand why its a problem that the trust of conservative sc justices has been breached when you consider that theyve lied to us about their intention to not overturn roe v wade and theyve violated ethics standards like taking bribes from people whose cases theyre presiding over  the sc tried to hide the decision from the public  and the leak breached their trust  no our trust in the conservative justices has been breached egregiously
the us doesnt want to do anything to protect their kids from getting shot at schools so theyll just replace them with unwanted children great job
rgbs legacy will always be colored for me by her inability to make the choice to step down during obamas last term and keep us from being in this situation
lester holt uses bombshell as often i use hi he sure can read a teleprompter he reads the 48 hours script as if he were doing the nightly news same writers i bet
what a disgraceful scotus
msm bombshells are hilarious
so most likely it was a republican that leaked
why arent more people talking about this new part of the story
imagine being so overly fair that you ignore and obfuscate the blatant truth it was done for political reasons there was no oh well this makes it look like it was possibly done for political reasons are you stupid or scared because its like saying the earth could be round
the votes against roe v wade were planned from the start thats why this was kept hidden not because of this womans fantasy that maybe the conservatives would have voted against conservatism if theyd just been allowed to do their secret process in peace its insulting to all the people affected by the courts behavior to say that these judges might have done anything but stick to their plan
all of this being said will the right of a woman to control her own body in the united states of america
the shady six are not law scholars theyre far right political activists holding two stolen seats hostage
huh hows that investigation going  will there be a report anytime soon its been well over a year now or did they not like the answer
"barretts gesture to vote to not take the case was just empty theatre  she knew as well as anyone they had the votes to take it without her  it gives her the opportunity to say that she did the right thing

she didnt recuse herself when they ended up taking it"
there was a big foardian slip right ther
we need better ethics oversight of the court
all of them are liers
"say anything about it you want
everyone knows that it was a progressive person who leaked it
hoping they could force them to change their decision
and somehow you act like this is perfectly fine
shows everyone how little character this network has "
every headline has to have bombshell shocking blasts in it  constant violent imagery so american
scotus is corrupt
the supreme court wants us to respect them and trust them ruth bader ginsburg is in my opinion the last of her kind they waited until she passed away and then spit and peed all over her grave by overturning roe vs wade sowere those lavish gifts that non of us could dream of affording kickbacks or bribes im sure they were both so now here we are and they expect us to trust them with the integrity of democracy and the constitution you say it was only one supreme court judge that accepted these gifts for rulings or was her just the one who got caught the people are watching
abolish human abortion
"republicans are the american version of the taliban

women are things"
all of this comes down to the 2016 election and mcconnell blocking merrick garland  had hrc just won this wouldnt be a thing  hillary cost the country roe  i hope she realizes that  her utter failure as a candidate has had a decades long negative impact to the country
what i dont understand is why the democrats dont apply the law to the supreme court justices we know for a fact there is no doubt that these people lied to the united states congress in order to get these positions the law says if they lie to the united states senate and house of representatives that they have committed perjury and they should be impeached
"the fact that they are appointed by the politicians means they are political 
all supreme court appointees should be hired and fired by their peers"
"it means nothing  i hate that reporters try to romanticize this stuff  they wanted to overturn it so they did  thats it thats all  it was a 40 year long game they played and we let them win 

im still side eyeing rbg because she should have retired when a dem was president but she put her stock in hillary and this is where we are"
at what point are enough white people without so much money hurt enough that they get fed up with this corrupt court and the corrupt gop
"an investigative reporter thinks publicans can be swayed

i think she needs to go continue investigating"
obama failed when he rolledover on his nomination justice ginsberg failed to retire at an appropriate time
you mean the supreme potus did something inappropriate and ethical so what
how sad is the legal profession as a whole when members of the supreme court are proven liars just pathetic
inappropriate and intended to interfere in the process just when justice breyer was considering joining the liberal 15 week ban this strengthens my point that justice alito was responsible for the leak it cemented the votes to alitos advantage
the reason democracy is difficult though is that there is so much corruption  here that occurs with the votingand it opens every single one of you up to coupssoi would get a feel from what a country needs and make sure their people like it and put them in therealso some regions need much stronger staying power in terms of leadership to prevent war and couping and conflictso for those regions like the middle east i would have a different approachfor their own good  its not about oppressing their people its about securing their security so we dont everyone attacking and going after one another like its a hobby  i really hate ongoing war  its horrific this place doesnt spin on suffering  the suffering and rampant abuse must stop  it must stop  universal income is the quickest way to do that  no social scores just give it out flat 3500 month to everyone on the planet  take away from those with over a billion as no one needs that much and redistribute  its not that hard  we start there
why are these sc judges appointed for life 
"they  the court w a super theocratic fascist majority representation  of in just the court represents the minority in of the american 
public opinion this is  the virtual end of trust in the sc"
"on the supreme courts dobbs leak many of us floated the he who smelt it dealt it theory that alito mightve done it himself
and the fact that scotus dropped the investigation advocated by people who said the leak destroyed the court and none of them have objected adds to that"
"why are we paying more attention to the leak than we are to the fact that kavanaugh and barrett both said that roe was settled law and they wouldnt overturn it 

they lied how can you trust the integrity of a sc justice that lies to get their job"
what does barretts not wanting to take the casebut still voting with the majoritymean it means that far from giving a crap about the law she cares only about her own optics and she wanted to pretend in line with her and kavanaughs and gosuchs fake senate testimony that she considered roe settled law that she was objective on the issue
from this i draw the conclusion that scotus had already come to a decision before hearing the facts in effect the justices were governing rather than arbitrating clearly the scotus needs to be saddled with the sjotus supreme jury of the united states to prevent them from governing and restrict them to arbitration
the supreme court has a problem their name i believe it has gone to their heads they need more defined rules and term limits and i never understood why ruth didnt step down maybe supreme went to her head
the confirmation hearings are a joke  what is the legal purpose of the confirmation hearings if the nominated and approved judges cannot be held accountable to their sworn statements
breach of trust funny coming from rightwing members of scotus
that branch of government is disgraceful zero ethics and zero accountability
"so politically speaking the three levels of government are the house the senate and the supreme court
thats what happens when law takes a back seat to politics"
scotus the highest judges money can buy
the leak shows the deceiving
they waited for ruth to die  no woman is safe with those judges
what are msnbc cnn and other left wing outlets trying to do to our country the roe law was sent back to the states for people to vote on rather than have the federal govt telling us what to do the left still believe in korematsu v united states 1944 and other destruction of civil liberties like dei why is it that the left wants to have the federal govt dictate our lives i believe in freedom not fascism
possibly the last sitting supreme court its no wonder this country turned naxi
no surprise here
need babies for the army
50 states50 countries get over it libs
amy worried she might get become a pawn but she is clearly a crazy god extremist person she believes in santa too
"you guys failed to mention that if it werent for mitch mcconnell changing the rules 
this never would have happened 
republicans cheat to win"
tired of men making choices about our body health  reproduction
another bombshell headline just reporting the news not being hyperbolic and hackneyed
what i also find concerning is that the anti abortion justices make a decision against abortion before debate and thoughtful consideration of the will of the public in the end it clearly is a political decision
im appalled among many many others across the civilised world  at aspects of this whole issue and how it is dealt with in your country on both sides of it first of all the way women in favour of it as a necessary part of certain aspects of womens  improved medical care and also choice of whether they should be pregnant or not in often very appalling circumstances are pirtrayed and behave with frankly ottcheering etc undignifies and trivialises the whole scenario it does wo m en no service bbc whatsoeveralso the business of the unbalanced political bias of scotus which defies commmon sense surely it should always be a balanced set up especially as the appointments are for life how is this never sorted out mass public hysteria seems to rule the roost across the justice board on so many issues that require clear non emotiional responses at every level deplorable  all round
the supreme court is corrupt and owned by the super wealthy and maga republicans term limits for the corrupt court six years limit and can not run again
they already made the decision amongst themselves to overturn rvw before they case was before the court that is proof that the court is corrupt and the judges involved in overturning rvw should be impeached and disbarred and most likely criminally charged with conspiracy and corruption they already sold their votes and accepted bribes but congress will defend the american people from these criminals this is what the criminals in congress wanted and they support these criminals on the bench
republican rats
216  it may look that this is about politics and power whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat it may they are appointed by politicians who listen to lobbyists its all political
155 lol the passing of justices helps refresh the law like 4 times a century
jive bull crap trump is trying to be dictator of the greatest democratic government ever the reick publicant party is dead 
iti is their bodies you selfrighteous fools have no say if we wat to be controlled by ignorance  fear we will go to a church of our choice  dose not belong in government
the ignorance of most of the lefty replies is breathtaking
scotus is corrupt and illegitimate until all that lied during their confirmation hearing are removed from the bench
dont count on these trump shills to hold the line when it comes to putting the orange cancer in prison
justice roberts do your job  alito and his three stooges and both thomass are liars and cheaters taking our rights away and country backwards church and state must be separate once and for all or tax churches now
barrett is the same backstabbing gal as in the show ozark
imagine taking away rights and and the people that are always saying their rights are being taken away cheer for it
the female justices are the only ones with any backbone and morals
"if the gallows sat outside each home of scotus maybe then they would stop leaning over to the side of white isis maga

if youre reminded every day of what your blind support of maga will bring"
its not exactly a bombshell if it is so predictable 
"when a document that was going to be released anyway gets leaked this is a breach of trust we must investigate
when clarence thomas has been accepting very expensive gifts from a mein kampfloving billionaire for many years crickets"
root out the federalist supreme court justices  we will never have a balanced court with them on the bench in addition there have been for example so many times when clarence thomas should have recused himself when having a conflict of interest and he did not they operate at their own will and ideology and even if we are able to purge trrump we will still have remnants of his appointees left making the rulings to give lifetime appointments seems not the way to go because you get stuck in their ideological rigidity and resistance
todays supreme court does not represent even 0000001 percent of the american people it is no more than a political cult a  right wing political cult elected by less than 1 of temporary and career politicians who are also on their way to become billionaires through mysterious means
whoever the leaker is needs to be charged
"im sorry but i dont buy that the leak cemented a position thats a very convenient excuse but the deliberative process cannot change bad faith 
the second the us sc decided to relitigate a closed decision with 85 public support they lost all credibility 

and to say the leak forced us to double down is like saying well its ok that my kid lied to my face i busted them and maybe theyd have changed their mind and come clean 

why are we expecting honesty from the corrupt"
thomas is a crooked crimal and he should not cover cing  any thing
theyre a bunch of corrupt rightwing liars in this court
"blah blah blah
decision was reversed
deal with it"
this is what you get for keeping unencrypted memos laying around on their windows 10 desktops they make for great influence tools to use especially when you hack the judges by weaponizing their individual beliefs against them to plant a trojan
"the last 3 scj should be removed 

they lied to get the jobs"
all these old corrupt people deciding a womans rights is fricken nuts  non are without sins
isnt it pritty disturbing to think the highest court in the land  cant be trusted
ive heard this journalist on npr and now msnbc im left more irritated each time it appears as if shes suggesting the leak potentially caused this outcome or that the justices had no other choice but to stop negotiating can we do a deeper dive and ask why they took up this case in the first place what superficial and lazy investigating blaming the leak even suggesting it for their ultimate choices give me a break
term limits and appointed by national popular vote of 60 or better a president should still be allowed to appoint these judges but the nation should be allowed the final vote its wrong that a tiny handful of individuals are allowed to determine national law for all they effectively have more power than any other branch of government as well as the populace it creates an institution dedicated to upholding corruption
it will come out that one of conservative justices leaked the case themselves to cement the votes against roe however i have lost all confidence in scotus
get your sports equipment armor and face paint ready the man made apocalypse is coming
this is what happens when dems take their eye off the ball on the long game biden is up for reelection and the team is wringing their hands about him when they know the alternative will be trump show up and vote or see what else you lose
supreme clown court     impeach thomas  and the three  clowns that lied under oath saying they wouldnt over turn roe v wade
i have even less respect for barrett now she cares even more about political optics than taking away womens rights wow
everyone knows it was one of the left wing justices
if trump never got elected none of this bs would never have happened disgusting
roberts calls a breach of trust the whole supreme court has been a breach of trust to the american people
refuse for what she knew what her opinion was going to be sounds like grandstanding to me
conservatives is now the most disgusting word in english language
its simpler than all this  trump stacked the court case closed it all goes back to the votes
it was ginni thomas and it was deliberate
these people clearly bad  why are they elected for life that is insane we all know now anita hill was right and thomas is a freak then you got lying amy and black face judge really  laughable
clarginia thomas do the right thing and recuse
end of an empire corruption at our supreme court 
to the supreme court
why would it be ok for the justices to discuss cases outside of deliberations when jurors are told to never do that while a matter was pending
i dont get it you have more guns in the usa than citizens men women and children yet no one is prepared to take  arms against a sea of troubles
this is appalling   is there no branch of government with honor and integrity 
sc  supremely corrupt roberts has sold the us democracy to the highest bidder with citizens united and sat around knowing all the while his colleagues are taking bribes from billionaires he should be tried for treason and corruption its only a matter of time before we find out what hes been taking under the table and his false indignation is sickening
happened so methodically that i i even suggested on fb that could justice gs death have been hastened its enough that thomas is still on the bench as crooked greedy and bought that he is scotus is sadly political and sloppy i cant respect it anymore
"yes  theres the root cause of all our problems
they fail to understand that abortion is a medical procedure
they fail to understand what privacy is
they all collect a paycheck on violating our rights 
if you american soldiers were telling the truth about protecting us you do something about them now"
ok im gonna guess that alito leaked the draft opinion and that the republican justices were all in on overturning roe v wade and were searching around for a vehicle to do it now im going to listen to the clip
this is why other countries no longer look up to the us as a role model its politics has become trash
they are all deceitful duplicitous disingenuous and despicable
hopefully the democrats can take power in congress then they can draft a bill that makes supreme court justices accountable as other nonjustices are  what applies to normal judges should apply to supreme court justices  it should include that any supreme court justice found to be corrupt will automatically be removed from his position and indicted for corruption and have a minimum mandatory jail term of 10 years with assets ceased in remuneration of their corruption
there was a good chance that rgb would have voted to overturn it anyway she was on record saying she would have never voted in favor of roe and she thought it was a bad ruling
was alito or someone affiliated with him the leaker
the leak was only inappropriate when they got caught
in canada there is a requirement that all judges at whatever level must retire at age 75 that may not be the right age perhaps could be older but it makes for way more rejuvenation of the judiciary that in the us where judges whether liberal or conservative can hang on until they become a bit senile that results in a much less politically perceived judiciary than in the us
why are those for abortion parents didnt believe in abortion   at least in their case
trump found three judges willing to lie under oath
in what imagination of the universe is it correct for the minority to dictate the right of the majority
who else was thinking jodie was a dude till she started talking
were they waiting till she died
a puff piece on justice barrett wow why i am going to say this is allegedly the truth allegedly
get these judges out of my doctors office get this government out of my pharmacy
kavanagh and others during their confirmation hearings all said that roe v wade was settled law and that that was that turns out they were all full of crap
abortion leak im sorry that sounds terrible 
the breach of trust was the supreme court overturning roe v wade itself like excuse me 
"to me the most obvious and important point that is constantly overlooked is how blatantly the last 3 justices flatout lied to congress  they all swore that they had no predetermined intent to overturn roe swore up and down that if given the case they would make their decision solely on the case presented  they all gave this impression under oath to congress    if lying to congress to get past the required screening process so you can do exactly what you truly were intent on doing if that isnt an impeachable offense i cant imagine what else would be  
then theres the other two prizewinners clearly in the pockets of rich special interests that they then sit in judgement on cases involving them  how is this not impeachable    
im not pointing a finger at them because they are on one particular political party or the other  only in that their actions are at minimum a disgrace to the office of supreme court  supreme suggests that these should be the bestofthebest  turns out their just corrupt politicians just like the rest"
get the government out of my doctors office
"so much for believing in the court ever again 

christian values 
brought in "
this just goes to show you how critical elections are never skip voting if you dont use that privilege you will lose it and you will find you are living under a government that doesnt respect the ideals of the people or the constitution in fact you may not even ever get the opportunity to vote again vote prodemocracy and that means at present vote for democrats
abort the court   
was it a death  or a murder im perceiving the latter
we all know the drunk judge kavanaugh is a liar why do we have to have a drunk judge anyway i always wondered about that arent there some sober judges around i have no problem with drunks as long as their not making decisions that effect my life
i just want to ask dont republicans have or had abortions thank you
i suppose the next thing to bring women under control  is to send them to jail to protect them from gender based violence like the taliban is doing in afghanistan
who said trump never got anything done
this is a pointless story once they made their ruling we knew how they felt
msnbc this story would be much easier to understand if they would quit using future tense while talking about the past what happens next means it hasnt happened yet other times they were using presenttense verbs that is confusing and i am well educated if this usage is mildly momentarily distracting to me it will likely make it hard for others to understand at all use past tense verbs please
bruh she is placing blame on the leak instead of allowing supreme court justices of the united states to be accountable adults
dont we have a system or checks and balances why arent these judges being punished
i think it is political  thomas needs to be kicked off the court he is a crook  kavanaugh  is a liar and a pos  these men need to have their viagra taken away
thank god i cant get pregnant good luck women but seriously if that old bat wouldve retired years ago this wouldnt be an issue
more national enquirer reporting from msnbc time waisted here
abortion is murder and needs to be banned
isnt the removal of roe vs wade a breach of trust as well
bottom line all is that all of them need to be removed from the court totally corrupt court without doubt
heres the thing  it has become obvious that these supreme court justices have their fingers in many pies  the corruption of quite a few of them has become public knowledge  after this piece of information regarding roe vs wade has now been revealed it is my opinion that the public trust has been even more damaged and possibly irrevocably so  at least for these far right justices  with that in mind i would think all of these justices should be painfully aware that their decision on whether trump or anyone else for that matter including themselves is above the law  their corrupt actions may have hidden for decades but the truth will always out  should trump be gifted  with the title above the law and he gets back into the oval office he will inevitable proclaim himself monarchking and with complete power have the ability to denouncedisband scotus if not for their redundancy alone then for their actions in dismissing his cases or their decisions on ruling against him  then they will have no cover at all against trumps vindictive hateful destructive decisions  for him throwing the judicial system into utter chaos would be just another day at the golf course for him  beware the easy path inclinations become slippery slopes that may lead to hungry alligators in a pit at the bottom
decisions about reproduction should be made by people of reproductive age
this report is the first time i have heard why a supreme court leak is important and yet its importance had to be stressed by jodi kantor  granted chris hayes already gets it but for the rest of us i am thankful jodi kantor emphasized that a supreme court leak makes it very difficult for any of the justices to change how they would decide  as i understand this during the deliberation process of the justices as they tentatively state their positions assuming they will still be able to change their ultimate decisions an insider may leak an interim point wherein the leakers desired outcome would be met if this interim point were the final decision  thus by leaking this interim point the leaker makes it very difficult for any of the justices to change their interim position when making their final decision
dear supreme court human biology and best medical practice dont differ state to state  your dobbs decision was ignorant and arrogant
liar liar robes on fire
why are they doing this again with election around the corner this is definitely done on purpose
may i introduce mrs thomas
none of this corrupt supreme court people cares about the people they just want to get all the bribes they can what a nerve garbage
they are horrible
corrupt leader trump   corrupt adjudicators courtesy of trump   religion taking control of our democracy   stop the madness in congress remove the corruption from among the controllers in scotus   doesnt this make sense 
this is no longer the land of the free now is the land ruled by the religionist cruel politicians
ok so ids anyone going to be held accountable i feel like these people talk in riddles is anyone going to jail or not
a politically appointed body with exceptional powers no accountability and no oversight what bunch of morons thought this was a good idea
abortion is with the states where it belongs
lol it can look like politics and power instead of legal reasoning  yeah no duh amy youre an illegitimate court
the least legitimate least informed least morale supreme court in several generations of the united states of america its shameful hope roberts is proud of his legacy leading the worst most corrupt court  perhaps in history
lol john roberts breach of trust comment is absurd given it turned out to be a real trickster move and given the times john roberts has breached trust with the american people such as citizens united and rowe v wade
one of the great mistakes of this court this is what happens when the gop catches the car there were reasons all the other courts upheld roe v wade and they were wise enough to see what the fallout would be which shows just how wise this present court is
"term limits

how do we do this"
why on earth do judges on the scotus have lifetime powers to shape america according to their own politics even a president can only serve 2 terms it is plainly stupid and as the judges age they will lose contact with the changes in culture that happen over decades the law should adapt to the times not live in the past
i think we need to ignore political lines with this issue   the first 40 years of my life i was comfortably prochoice  birth control has come an extremely long way and options today make it very easy for the majority of people to never have an unwanted pregnancy minus risk to the mother or an extreme situation  abortion in todays day and age is just callous abortion is not birth control
"yeah johnny is going to conduct a through and painstaking investigaton
i have bridge to sell ya in arizona  for five dollars"
this discussion will ruin the gop as if trump wasnt enough americans preferred gridlock
this guy lies twice in his reporthe said initially that they decided to take the case before rbg died then later says they decided months aftercant even make up his mind 
i wonder how much the six made for selling out a womans right to body autonomy and health care fortunately the roberts court will go down in history as corrupt
great job of reporting
what could possibly go wrong when the highest court in the land is compromised and corrupt
its funny that pro life people also complain about social aid if we dont have unwanted children in our society  we wont have to spend as much on social aid we should encouraged  and sometimes mandate this for certain groups of people like chemically dependent people those on state aid and people who are here illegally
every judge is a politician in black ropes exercising their bias and prejudice 
this is all about politics this is about timing and after justice ruth bader ginsbergs passing donald trump and republicans moved very fast in getting their justices all in with overturning roe vs wade i hope voters are seeing and understanding how donald trump and maga republicans can basically take away our rights the voting rights sequence should hopefully be investigated a vote for donald trump is a vote for authoritarian dictatorship a vote for donald trump is a vote for supporting vladimir putin
this shows what happens when a foreign entity  catholic church dictatorship theology is allowed to run our democracy
looks like someone did something really inappropriate trying to influence members of the court ya think
a lot of this mischief could be prevented in the future by a law or amendment deciding that scotus jurisprudence become part of the codex of laws of the us and can not be reversed by scotus itself but only by a law of congress or an amendment to the constitution that would also diminish the political power of the court somewhat it would have made dobbs impossible if it had been in effect previously
the new ethical judicial behavioral code the supreme court wrote for themselves without any monitoring or enforcement  apparatus is such garbage so incredibly bogus
the supreme court talking about a breach of trust is hilarious irony
free will  
what i thought that they had already dismantled it
the only breach of trust is that from the supreme court i trust them zero
"whooooo caaaares

just agree and move on to overturning heller

by the same wording on the ruling see you later heller"
the supreme court should be the most transparent of all it is literally our last line of justice hiding things is inappropriate it should be supremely fair open and right not secret and questionable people need to know why they are deciding the way they are everything should be based solely on the constitution and what the public wants for the people by the people and of the people maybe we would be better off with ai deciding based on the constitution it wouldnt use feelings or beliefs to decide just facts it also couldnt be bought off
also good that msnbc is keeping this subject front and center it will cripple republicans in 2024
supreme court a contradiction in terms these people are a medieval throwback
no different than royalty in olde europe minute laws and punishments for the peasants vague rules with little over sight for those up the candle
if thats true amy berret has to be impeached and replaced by a real conservative justice
the supreme court is political  five justices owe their appointment to the ultra conservative federalist society  they are all a disgrace in so many ways
barrett just wanted to delay the blowback of her lying in confirmation
"did russia pay 24 million  to a biden shelf company 
its russian collusion 
but hunter did end the gun debate
bwahahahaha 
whata disfunctional family
hunter sums up the presidency to a tee
1 big trip to the atm"
the supreme court is all about partisan politics and evangelical christianity and lets not forget about bribery from billionaires
sick party
why do people care if a stranger gets an abortion or not like dude get a job a hobby anything lol
sounds like damage control
"it should be up to each woman if they  want an abortion its their body their mind and their heart
  too take away someone rights and free will is wrong what will be next band birth control for  women if you start taking away the free rights to control your life
   then we will lose in time all free rights to decide for ourselves 
 we will  be under a government rule state"
i dont like opinion in the news fix it minions
abortion is going to happen legal or not keep the squrty end out
"listen  plz to the last thing she mentions  to me she almost reveals what judge makes the leak 100 sure thge lkeak come from a judge that got scared of the 15 week ban that most of europe have but wanted roe overturned wanted the states to ban it
i remember there was accusations of leftist judges was the ones who leaked i bet to differ  i would love to know more about this "
what does that abortion rule do for a womans first amendment or dont they have one
reason is there any reason on the court
the supreme court should have age and term limits
vote marianne williamson president 2024  give her a chance to debate
all you woman you gotta start really opening your mouth  these idiots are trying to take out all womans rights
 breach of trust  by roberts  
ending rvw was a gift to the dems were riding the blue wave towards a super majority and finally some rational governance in the us t is the gift that keeps on giving
supreme court justices should have term limits and so should senators and any other political entity 8 years and no more than 8 years for any one of them
get rid of the courts
the more i think about it  chief justice roberts has lost control of ghe supreme court and is no chief justice by any means
its dangerous you gamble with one 
no abortion is safe 
its a matter of  being more morally sound and accountable to prevent them alot of women have died from botched abortions too most drs do them for money only 
our democracy is already gone  in this country  the corruption of this supreme court is disgusting 
why are people not trying to get birth control to prevent unwanted  pregnancies 
a breach of trust  john roberts just who do you think you can trust  one thing is for sure _you_ are not trusted  in fact your corrupt scotus is held in well deserved contempt
all i can say is men fighting so hard to keep women pregnant is all we need to know and exactly why they have no business making medical and life decisions for us 
supreme court political ideological ghouls hard to believe a person could reached the pinnacle of judicial authority  and not understand that judges are supposed to be unbiased by their own subjective leanings
chris hayes is a stuttering mess please msnbc invest in some speech classes for him you could probably write it off on your taxes
the womens rights have to be respected
at this point of scous could we even believe the leak investigation they have shown their own ethics to be in question 
what happened to separation of church and state  shame on them all abortion is healthcare not up for debate by religious zealots
nice group portrait therethe judicial division of the republican party politicised and compromised
christians are destroying america
we need to have term limits for supreme court justices in my personal opinion we should have never given lifetime terms for any of our government positions with such power and magnitude over the people of our nation duh
the ruling is that it is up to each individual state
women in texas and oklahoma now live under the same religious laws as women in syria and libya  the gop want all american women to live and die under those same laws
it must be very hard for every woman to have an abortion a decision that will have the effect of a lifetime but is was her own right to do to find peace and the power to continue
justices are politicians toocorrupted politicians you dont change the devil the devil changes you  money and favors grant access and access influences policy   internal accountability is not possible
"the question is they all said at their conformation that they wouldnt overturn roe
ethics seem to be a major problem for our supreme court justices 
they lied to get the seat and are being bought by the very people who are against roe"
supremely corrupt no lifetime terms self policing or secret anything the whole setup is deeply flawed  ripe for going sideways it did so its time for reform  least complicated fact
so they did an entire story just to say they dont know what happened
they need to stop the lies they planned this a head of time anyone that cant see them for what they are is blind the people of the united states of america are in trouble big trouble this our country and we been sold out the whole world watching
maybe youd be happier in a communist country try moving to one 
lets stop kidding ourselves about the judiciary it is about politics not the law and reason kantor is covering for barrett because shes a woman not buying her story as a portrayal of the court as a noble institution
rescue both to the best of ability 
so typical that the gilead level not so supreme court would be upset by the leak rather than their crap ruling that completely ignores the law
mr justice gorsuch thanks for spending 10 whole minutes reviewing mr justice alitos 69page opinion of dobbs 69 pages per minute that elianor woods speedreading course you took at yale really paid off for ya mr crow and mr leo sure got their moneys worth out of you
every time i hear justice kavanaugh i wonder justice kennedy stepping down and giving trump this liar
if the american people wish to know the history of  little corrupt secrets of scotus then buy the case against the supreme court by law professor chereminsky especially in the 1920 or at the turn of the 20th century regarding child labor i think even charles chaplin has a movie and took a stand regarding robing stealing thefting the childhood of little americans to satiate the suply and demand of workers for big corporations yes justice robing barons legalizing corruption
this entire story is bs clearly her sources are from roberts office trying to paint him as trying to save roe but the leak messed everything up foh they had every intention of overturning roe and his descent was just symbolic because he doesnt want the court to look partisan
sounds like politics as usual i thought the supreme court was not supposed to do that i know i dont have enough knowledge to speak about this in depth but all i can say is it seems like theyre doing the same thing that republicans and democrats are doing i thought they were supposed to be a neutral and just based on the constitution but its really the same its all about power im so sad
how dare roberts make such a statement he should be in prison right now with his wife for accepting bribes we need to march on the court and demand the 6 republicans resign as theyre provably compromised
its the best court that money could buy
three branches of government yet one branch consists of 9 individuals that were not voted in by the people and on top of that lifetime appointments thats not balanced at all the reason they do this is because they know they cant be removed or vote out garbage
as a christian im ashamed jesus would never want someone to lie their way to the supreme court to put up an abortion ban this isnt righteousness its evil pure human greed
everyone with two brain cells to rub together know it was alito and that he leaked it to force the conservatives to stick to stripping bodily autonomy from half the population republicans and conservatives will pay for this for decades
a bunch of conservative snakes that cant be trusted no wonder the court has a low approval rating because of these sell out corrupted judges
they will not answer truthfully if they answer at all
if anybody still believes that supreme court justices arent just politicians in robes they havent been paying attention
no one gets to decide what surgery i will have
in other words her reporting tells us nothing we didnt already know
its soooooo true these partisan republicans justices are drunk on power and politics and knowing they can get away with crimes is the reason why they need to be stopped
i dont now wher too longer
all six of these corrupt conservative judges are maga politics  moscow mitch mcconnell and rrump conservative water carrying tools term limits would help but like gun legislation and weak republicans excuses to do something  they offer only mafia tactics and prayers and thoughts corruption at its best
so who was paid off to get this decision scotus is corrupt
its wild how 6 people can decide the fates of 331 million people
maybe they should be looking into jan 6 being a inside job the new video evidence is pointing to that being a real possibility trump 2024
the supreme court of canada has a retirement age of 75 the court works just fine
if justice amy wants to have 7 or 10 kids it doesnt mean everyone should or want to they should have left roe v wade alone and mind their business
hmmwhy is she saying president trump biden is president just wondering whats the use more republican supreme court justices only time they voted correct was when trump took his case there to overturn the vote to still be president they said no
quick reminder our constitution does not say court justices get lifetime appointments it says shall retain their offices under good behavior in the past we had justices who held to the standard of good behavior by not taking bribes not committing perjury by lying in the job interview they all held lifetime posts because they refrained from bad behavior hence we do not have a system of lifetime appointments we have a system where a justice who refrains from bad behavior shall retain their office until they choose to retire or they expire constitution could have said life appointment but chose not to because life appointments invite dictatorial tyranny after some 200 years america came to see justices as having life appointments because of lack of crime on the bench but that is not what the constitution says the originalists on the supreme court have never even noticed this phrase or how it potentially limits their dictatorial powers
which constitutional right is next to be taken away as easily
making unilateral decisions about peoples healthcare from a bench is not only antithetical to democracy its wrong
i dont understand why the supreme court judges have never been charged with perjury during their sworn testimony at their confirmation hearings before congress
ive had tacos at taco bell more supreme than this court what a stain on america
keep voting for gop and continue to watch your rights vanish  doh
so just blame biden in the made up impeachment
elections have consequences remember that statement tough luck liberals
coathangerbarrett was _trying_ for plausible deniability but this leak removes that plausibility
what else can boomers wreck in their limited time left
conservatives are packing the court to force their will on society democrats need to stop play games and start packing to court no matter what because right isnt afraid to do the same abortion rights shouldve been codified a long time ago now we gotta deal with these morality policemen being in installed on federal benches
the new justices had just went through lying about roe and it being case law
or maybe sound of getting canceled if the entirety of the justices on the supreme court think that abortion is wrong maybe its because it is wrong
it is way past time to dispense with the lifetime appointment rule i have nothing but contempt for this court their ethical standards are a joke some of them sit on seats that were stolen some of them are patently unfit does what goes around comes around sound like a sentiment that a supreme court justice should hold
dont forget to vote for trump on november 13th
they did it
this is the evidence required to end lifetime rolls  term limits we need to make mandatory and soon
bs she pulled a lisa murkowski she performed an ethical stance knowing full well her buddies would make sure she got to vote to wage war on women she got to keep her hands clean while doing nasty
the thing that still bothers me is the fact that justice alito included the history of 16th century views and feelings on abortion by sir edward coke in england claiming it as part of the uss history when this country is only 250 years of being considered an entity in its own right our history as a country does not carry forward the beliefs and laws of england therefore quoting anything before 1776 from england as part of our history as a country is incorrect 50 years of having the right to abortion means it was and is deeply embedded in our history that is 15 of the years we have been an established county with our own laws etc
there own by the republicans  party
context is everything and the crooks on the scotus know that along with their corrupt ignorant clerks who are just religious and political fanatics in the antichoice lagers and wacolike compounds
this is sickening absolutely sickening vote blue insure womens rights republicans are intent on making women second class citizens
trumps mob would even embarrass some corrupt african nation the supreme court looks to be the most crooked part of the usa what a joke these clowns are so unpatriotic and disgraceful
"gee msnbc needs phony made up bs to understand that the ussc decision sent it back to the states to decide
dont worry democrats you can still extinguish human beings"
two men talking about abortion interesting
"bravo to the brave  patriotic person who leaked these supreme court back room dealings

there clearly was a personal agenda and a premeditated plan concerning the timing of their actions  this is so discouraging  so disappointing  but sadly not surprising or shocking in the least  many of us saw this type of behavior coming when certain justices were appointed

their job is to uphold the constitution of the united states and protect the rights of all citizens 

they dont have to like abortion and they certainly dont have to get one but they do have to protect the rights of others to make that choice for themselves

the highest court in our land we look to them to make decisions based on the constitution law and the good of the nation  this pearl clutching because they got caught doing something they knew to be sneaky  wrong is as silly as it is insulting

there should be term limits for supreme court justices  and the selection process needs to be improved as well

it will be interesting to see what else comes out and what if any changes occur because of this"
bombshell the most used word in media
how about we ask medical professionals not once has anyone with experience understanding and years of knowledge been involved in this bs overturning
fatal pregnancies are not abortion but how many will lie and say their fetus is a toxic parasite that needs removed
each supreme court justice was asked during the vetting process if they would dismantle roe vs wade and they all said they would leave that alone and the first thing they did was dismantle it they are all lying christians
you will have that child in tx whether you want it or not you die or not you both die or not but you willhave it or run 4ur life in texas so help us our god
supreme crooks
total abuse of power this is not a decision based on law its political you frigging idiots scotus not sure your gods will forgive you for this one
i dont like how they are making it sound like elena kagan stephen breyerketanji brown jackson and sonia sotomayor as the supporters of the overturning of roe v wade just because theyre part of the supreme court doesnt mean they all voted in favor of it being overturned
yesterday i read the piece it is fabulous journalism as it needs to be uncompromised and relevant it deserves an award the best at least for me of 2023
republiban  gop anti choice death panels now operating over womens lives in texas
need more than just white n one black thats the problem
the current supreme court contains too many odious creatures dismiss the lot create a high code of ethics including oversight require a political balance on the bench ex 3 repubs 3 dems 3 indeps and term limits any lying cheating or political stunts gets them dismissed from the bench permanently
as long as we respect religious beliefs and allow theocrats to be judges this will never end the three of them were put on the court to overturn roe its what they did its political it always has been no judge is impartial or unbiased
when the law takes a back seat to politics there is no law money cant buy
abortion ban is about work force not religion the far right are extremely immoral and also tend to be business owners they are struggling with having enough low level workers
supremecourt is a scam operation clean house
i hope people dont forget that trump single handedly destroyed roe v wade
chris hayes is so annoying just report the facts without sensationalistic spin
since corporations can not perish in the field of war they should pay the financial costs of the us military 100 
100 bet that it wasnt the liberals who leaked it the conservatives were the ones with a motive ill bet chief justice roberts investigation is just a red herring to deflect suspicion  just like oj trying to find the real killer of his wife corrupt court indeed this decision will go down in history like dred scott the 1 position of women according to polls is abortion vote blue in 24 then we need to pass a constitutional amendment for judge term limits across the board judgeships have become way to politicized
corporations dont even pay their fair share 4our military which protects their interests more than ours most times 
kavanaugh is a lying liar who lies though he saw it as his birthright he has no business sitting on the scotus
they really shouldnt be smiling for the pain and suffering they have caused
whatever you want  msnbc will just make up something to lie about
those six pics of the sc judges could be at a carnival shooting gallery
roe vs wade was unconstitutional and needed to be overturn  1  there was no federal law in regards to abortions therefore the supreme court was making a law with the roe v wade ruling and the power belongs to congress not the supreme court  2  there is nothing in the constitution that gives the federal government the power to regulate abortions therefore according to the 10th amendment that power belongs to the states
seems like someone would have preferred to hold off the case until after the election all for political reasons
it seems to me that the supreme court is no longer supreme in brains
the supreme court has destroyed their credibility on their own there are justices thomas alito for example who should clearly be removed as they have been proven to be corrupt term limits and clear legal laws are needed for this court now
ruths refusal to step down while she had the choice to do so while the political landscape democratic president and congress is so incredibly selfish and she is the reason why roe was overturned that a selfish woman is the reason that woman lost their rights classic
please stop repackaging the same information and start digging up new information like journalists please we need the 4th of state
they made a whole movie about spin its called  wag the dog spin doctors need to be exposed like the individuals making up the electoral college maybe thats why the world is aiming for robots cant we be real with ourselves or do we need a war to make us come together as a country
"i will never respect barrett  for her to accept the position under the ramrod they used to put her in place after mcconnell derailed obamas nomination because it is too close to an election says loudly that she is not concerned with fair play  she cannot be trusted with her position

lets not forget that she and kavanagh both testified under oath to not upset the precedence of rvw

it is a political court"
republicans are orwellian they talk about freedom while they are busy taking it from you
so what 
so fake dem news says law is about which party has power to divided without any constitutional argument that they are wrong you see sheep how they lie
"as disgusting  reprehensible as this story shows the conservatives of the scotus to be im in no way shocked  especially about the revelation that it was kavanaugh who was responsible for scheming to take the case but move the date in order to deceive the public based on his actions in the w bush administration  his specific involvement in the ken starr investigationfishing expedition into bill clinton 
just on a basic human level the fact that ruth bader ginsberg  a colleague of many of them for decades  hadnt been deceased for more than a day before they began scheming to undermine her lifes work is a testament to the utter depravity of men like clarence thomas  samuel alito in particular 
i dont know how much more reporting  evidence could possibly be needed at this point to support the fact that these 2 obscenely corrupt political operatives need to be impeached from the sc then theres kavanaugh who needed multiple attempts to become a judge in the 1st place  has had more questions arise about his ethics since becoming a justice than any other person ever confirmed to the court  if he is to remain a justice then the sc needs to enact an ironclad code of ethics  the most scrupulous means of enforcement of any of the lower courts or the other 2 branches of govt combined
even then the scotus needs to be expanded to 13 justices  to match the number of circuit courts of appeals  have term limits imposed by congress the last thing this country needs is more bought  paid for political operatives w no reverence for the law or the rights of the american people who arent just protected by their lifetime appointments but are actively immeasurably emboldened by them  like thomas  alito"
save your context narrative crap you are a utility like electric companies or phone companies
this supreme court is corrupt history will show that the extreme faction of the catholic higher authority fronted by leonard leo the fascist opus dei  a group of antidemocratic wealthy individuals and the federalist society have had key roles in the corruption of the third branch of govt under the us constitution the vast majority of american catholics oppose the efforts to destroy religious freedom in the usa
this is absolute proof that the supreme court is purely political  they want everyone to believe they actually consider the arguments on each side then rule  instead they do whatever their backers want them to do  we still need to know who paid off kavanaughs huge debts just before he got on the court
maybe they were hesitant to take up and overturn roe because brett and amy had so recently taken an oath to uphold roe  they took all of that dark money from the prolife faction they had to  pay to the piper  all of the rest of this is just smoke and mirrors  they are stuck with their lousy decision and it makes them look like what they are  bought and paid for
"the republicans are like the dog that loves chasing cars and finally caught one
it does not end well for the dog"
let me guess thomas or alito leaked the decision both are ethically compromised and morally bankrupt mitch mcconnell has a lot to answer for as well
013 what about the breach of trust this court did to the american people by overturning roe if he wants to point a finger at someone over a breach of trust he needs to look in the mirror first hypocrite
what repubs have done to our now inferior court was 100 political the court now is a majority of repub aka fascists loyalists
plotting to deny women their rights is the breach of trust leaking it was an attempt to save rights
take away mens reproductive rights equal treatment no one gets a say in their own health care snip snip gentlemen no more viagra either if your god wants you limp you stay limp and jail the doctors who fight for mens rights to their own bodies
this is what has me nervous about this bench looking at the djt prosecution issues
"every dem running for senate needs to run on expanding the court voting rights and preserving our democracy
put the insurrection the coup the corruption of the gop and their bought and sold scotus justices on the ballot
do not allow a republican a moment of peace in the public sphere without being on the record about these issues
do not give the gop a platform for any other issue shout them down talk over them control the god damned conversation

and most of all the doj needs to start arresting and convicting these criminals including the bribed off scotus judges sic clarence thomas"
lol supreme court called it breach of trust but there has been no trust in these corrupted judges for a long time from the people 
"if you do not understand why the abortion process is necessary then you are not doing your due diligence and understanding things over which you are voting and complaining  
the gop is against normal people they are against us succeeding and being educated and they want us to be sick  why  because our suffering  their profits"
a dem sc doesnt know what a woman is and in sports
this is all about them forcing their religion on us period
united states of theocracy
"its been repeatedly proven theres only one body of law makers the supreme court
  only 5 people rule supreme  5 of 9

right  wrong logic  illogic fair  unfair is not required by the supreme court  they are allowed to interpret the constitution however they wish  
just as the powerful have reinterpreted and even rewritten the bible to suit their laws of god  these 5 people have that power to override whatever they wish 

do you understand the unending reach of this  5 people

only 5 of 9 justices have the power to determine what is law of the land in this ridiculous country   not the 3 branches of governmentcongress not individual states of this country have the power to make the law of the land   five 5 people of the supreme court hold all the power "
nothing changes what these conservatives have done and will do
"gotta say again  its unfortunate that the democrats arent strategic or long range thinkers they really had every reason for ginsberg to step down and be replaced by obama by a younger judge in the first place in the second place you know i dont know if there would be a second chance or on this but he had the opportunity to put merrick garland on the bench during a recess appointment and he chose not to its such a patronizing mentality so im not sure is it obamas fault that were in this place he did a lot for the gop who won were another did a lot for him helping him get into office he certainly failed to pass or even try to pass important legislation and lets not forget those pictures of children and dog cages were taken in 2014
part two of the short term stupid thinking of the democrats was not having joe biden run for president in 2016 i supported hillary clinton for president in 1992 i thought shed be way better than her husband but its a lot easier to get a successful vice president on the heels of the president currently the democrats are trying to do that with kamala harris and it wont work because she does not have leader ship charisma at all its not because shes black because shes indian its not because shes a woman its because shes a twinkly a little too faced woman with no managerial authority and i dont see her being a commanderinchief she just doesnt have that leader ship vibe i think she wouldve been a better ag way better than merrick garland and hillary mightve been an excellent vice president in that administration forging a steppingstone for her to become the first female president of the united states but as usual the democrats and leader ship back there and dc do not have any strategic foresight they dont seem to understand where people are at or how they look at things they really seem to live in a bubble among themselves as elitist clueless patronizing and phony people i say this even though im a democrat its grossly disappointing that we have all these horrible people on the supreme court and half of them go back to the days when the democrats were all agreeable and allowing horrible people like clarence thomas onto the bench they were always being so collegial while their colleagues across the aisle were always plotting the downfall of our democracy and the rise of fascism and oligarchy it was obvious to anybody paying attention since the reagan and bush administration"
this is a separation of church and state issue  thinking that you are somehow killing children is a religionspecific dogma position not even part of many religions resulting primarily from a very common spiritual failure thinking that you must convert others to your beliefs rather than take responsibility for yourself  its a selfimprovement avoidance pattern common among humans as they avoid their own spiritual issues while massaging their egos about how good they are being  it is used by political propagandists to promote voting regardless of the clinic violence and violence to women they are winking at
what an awful corrupt court
this may be really off topici thought the nyt journalist was a man until she spoke  like a glitch in the matrix
america sure seems to be turning into a regressive hellhole
you can thank mitch mcconnell and the gop give them a thank you would you please have a great day take care and god bless 
the jusitces didnt need to read the draft it was written by the federalist society the society is the law
the supreme court overturning roe versus wade was unconstitutional and it is a violation of other laws the hipaa laws prevent anybody from using your medical information and no state has a right to stick their nose in your medical information i wish these attorneys would actually utilize this information because it is accurate to the letter of the laws you do not have to go to law school to understand the laws you simply just have to have the ability and the skill to read and comprehend
supreme court justiced need to be elcted by the people with term limits
oh good the supreme court participates in political pr by playing the public as fools why am i not surprised that theyre just politicians in  black robes
its time for biden to pack the court
the supreme court is just a bunch of liars and definitely not for women because it should be a federal right only s women should have a say over her body since men dont have that baby in them that could only affect the rest of there life men dont usually have an attachment until after the birth  remember who made all this happen the right wing extremists and romp who it will never affect
funny that all these privileged people who went to the best schools couldnt understand the word choice in a case   you dont like dont believe or dont want an abortion  you have the choice to not get one   just like the peple who do need or want an abortion have a choice to not believe as you do or have their religion pushed onto you
nothing changes set limits on supreme court  no more life terms
oh no sc followed the constitution and dem news trys to bandwagon with no constitution argument
the last four republican appointees said under oath that roe was settled law in order to get on the bench  they lied under oath  let that sink in  they lied under oath  then the moment they have the votes to overturn it suddenly its no longer settled law  they lied in order to get appointed to the bench so that they could do what their mega donors sent them there to do which was to end roe v wade
the leak may have been inappropriate but the justices playing politics was even more inappropriate  i am very concerned of our future with a supreme court that is seemingly for sale to the highest bidders
access to the justices of the supreme court   i heard today that it is very difficult to ask questions of the justices it must be because we arent billionaires who have personal access to justices i wont use the word corrupt for scotus it is political we are a democracy we didnt vote for them now people have no access to justices in the beginning justices had a circuit to ride and they ate and boarded with the people they were given their salary to aid them in the hardships they had to endure riding circuit and being away from home these guys wont cancel lunch for any of us who are the people they have pulled out the bible quote from the worst of it and hammer the public with old testament vengeance because they see god as vengeful and they see themselves as gods surrogates worried about trump wanting to be the king we ended up with at least 6 in the court
it appears that much of americas democratic directives were established based on a reliance that the directives would be discharged with a modicum of honorability and respect seems as if this approach is coming apart at the seams
these corrupt judges make me sick
time to reign the court in i think they should be limited to 10 years  not life  in the position theyre obviously arrogant and disgustingly entitled alito and thomas need to be impeached because theyre blatant crooks sucking off the teat of their privileged positions it was a criminal move by mcconnell when he denied obamas choice for the court obama was a wimp he should have fought tooth and nail to fight that but he knew he was on his way out and just didnt want the hassle for that alone i think he was a failed president
msnbc is fake news msnbc is the enemy of the people
the right has been planning to put these anti roe in for years even though it goes against the majority of world opinion
i like msnbc in general but i would like it more without chris hayes hes a bit overboardan extremist he pushes ideas a little too far beyond the facts and tries to sensationalize the news tries to start fires in other interviews of his ive seen not so much this one hes very hyper and often interrupts his guests too much he needs to tone it down or find another outlet
the supreme court sees whats happening to our country why arent they doing something
i hope kavanaugh  himself everytime he walks into his chambers
mississippi wanted to end abortion because that state is the highest in young black female mortality rate while giving birth or soon after legalized murder of young black breeders is all it is
hopefully people remember that the judges involved stated that they would not overturn precedent law without tacit changes to the circumstances only one of the many lies they told to get appointed
vote blue so that they can expand the court
a republican led scotus is corrupt yes of course it is that was the point
i think it was alito who leaked it
the world is watching the us cannot call themselves a country of democracy or law and order ever again what a joke the curtain has fallen and we all see you now for what you really are corrupt violent antiwomen racist and fascist certainly not 100 but just look at who is actually ruling your country from your local school boards all the way to the top all the while the people are playing with their toys and stuffing their faces with greasy heartstopping burgers and fries
a handmaide tale isnt supposed to be an instructional booklet
biden needs to match the number of justices to the number of federal districts
not allowing women to make their own reproductive decisions makes them second class citizens lots of people are good with that
cons and piracy put them together and you get conspiracy the court is the most corrupt in american history lock them up throw away the keys
in an authoritarian country usually the authoritarian ends bad in usa we have at this point 6 authoritarians that are going to retire from their luxury lives despite how many american lives they destroy and you the republicans call the democrats and some other countries third countries and   authoritarian countries communists or socialists
a justice system that is so lost and broken make their citizens have no respect for that institution the supreme court should be abolished at this point
i dont care about the leak what concerns me is that millions of dollars were wasted during these confirmations that ultimately mean nothing kavanaugh and coneybarrett said in front of congress that roe v wade was established law and these people clearly lied and are on the supreme court for life thats a problem
religion infused justices are exactly the wrong thing when trying to maintain separation of church and state
"its okay with the justices violate ethicsbut not their assistants

do as we say not as we do is not a good look for any judge or the rule of law"
you missed the entire point  of this story  why was the conservative  wing of the court so fixated on roe  why were they so motivated to change the law   it is so incredibly obvious that it was done for political reasons to serve their political overlords and the federalist society    this story strips the black robes  and reveals a bunch of political operatives
the current supreme court made us women second class citizens again want to protect your rights and your daughters mothers sisters aunties vote and bring like minded people to the polls 
"term limits

vote  across the board always    "
soooo thomas and all the trump appointed justices are just as heinous and immoral as is trumpinstain
women in the us are now headed for a talibanlike existence pregnancy is now governed by the government and natural processes that lead to an unviable fetus in the womb are now crimes against the state
it was donald trump who appointed those three zealot justices
john roberts should be ashamed to lead the most corrupt court in living memory he should resign because of his failures
"the us population has doubled since the last time the number of sc justices has been adjususted

it is time for biden to immediately appoint at least 9 additional sc  justices"
the supreme court the easiest to buy these days
the justices released it on purpose  thats my opinion
no one is above the law not even the mega republicans the supreme court is the court that we depend on the supreme court should not have block the views are the abortion right clarence thomas and his wife should be fired do you know what theyre coming into supreme court judges they were not here trying to make money what they are trying to do thats a bunch of bs
the only incentive you need to be a model citizen in this country is have an intolerance for stupidity once you become intolerable to stupidity youll do whatever it takes to avoid the justice system in this country because it is full of our stupidest people from county level all the way to the supreme court
"wheres the bombshell
click bait trash"
weird i thought it was liberals who were activist judges who legislate from the bench
its easy to be prolife politically but when your wife or significant others life is hanging in the balance and her life is to be sacrificed to save a nonviable pregnancy then you have finally faced the failure of this regulation of the human body in protecting life
who needs a constitution a congress or a president when you have these unelected lifeterm authoritarians forcing their vision of america on us  they have made it clear that they are the law
havent we been told criticizing the court isnt protected free speech   the court needs to issue a gag order
best jutice money can buy so you think alito leaked or was it thomas my moneys on alito
the corrupt states of america
probably leaked by stephen breyer on his way out the door
sounds like one of the conservative justices leaked it to force the other conservatives to vote in favor of overturning roe  clarence thomas and sam alito are more like politicians than justices
our supreme court cannot be trusted 
lets remember for all rbg is revered she caused a shitshow by not retiring while a democrat was president and could have named a successor  theyre all the same their love of power and the prestige that comes with it is more important than anything else
they didnt want to miss an opportunity to get paid to rule
treason
to me it is all wrong a tiny group of people supreme court decide on something that can affect a population of 300 million  this should be decided by a referendum  people can vote for what they want not for what 5 people want supreme court is 9 people but you only need 5
traitor appointed corrupt judges they are waiting for his commands
who done it this abusive supreme court after 50yrs of a womans right protected this supreme court broke that trust for protection inside a patriarchal society the background of women oppression for ionsusing oppression over women for powerpower over here we are againjustices need to back to the drawing table and right their wrongstop trying to control women and their bodies easy for you to pass viagra though sick
this whole affair makes the us supreme court come across as just another political arm of the farright  they show their theologic ties  someone needs to present the arguments that justified abortion  it requires an understanding of the nature and science of reproduction  the antiabortion faction live in religious fantasies   every time a women menstruates she is killing a human being  the farright feels no shame in diminishing the value of humans after birth  they deny the value of funding humanitarian efforts
the not so supreme court
am remembering the judges who lied about overturning roe when they were being interviewed crooks and liars on the court
thanks msnbc news
theyre coming after birth control next
republicans contradict themselves in word and deed daily more so than some dirty democrats
obvious from the beginning conservatives leaked to lock in votes we cheer these dumbasses for their induced consequences that are demolishing the gop
united states supreme court is simply the upper house of the republican party
the other conservatives might have giving cover to amy comey barrett during the early stages through her initial vote to not take up the case  because of the inappropriate look much as a legislators are given cover on votes that damage their political position in getting reelected when their vote is not needed to pass the legislation
i think alito or thomas definitely were behind the leak
is it possible that people on the left could consider that may be the people who are against abortion truly believe it is wrong just like you might believe killing puppies is wrong and you might want that outlawed im prochoice but i understand the argument on the other side and i dont think the people are evil
"we need so much more transparency from the supreme court bc if this is true then they didnt really lie to congress in their approval hearings to get their seats after allbut my strong sense and from all we know now of all the  trumps appointees he picked for top positions throughout americas institutions during his term is that everyone was made to sign ndas and promises of lip locked loyalty to him without questions and it may be that hes got the rs on the bench divided for a reasonnot his but whatever his puppetmaster tells him to dohe does  hes not to dumb to know that hes clueless when it comes to politics but hes taking his orders from our staunchest foreign enemies  ive been consistent on this point from the very beginning no matter how he actedthats not part of my decision that hes on the side of every one of our adversaries and treats our allies like dirthe does this in plain sight why is that ok with some americans  ive always been on the side of the underdogs but this is not thatwatch how the leader of china and the likes use these mind control techniquesits fascinating when its happening to others way over therethats all i can saythank god ppl here are saying
lol sorry so long "
"she was just using smoke and mirrors  if she was serious  she would have voted no in the final saying
however there is also an element of control she is still a lower being being a woman

so much corruption"
all theyre doing is kicking the ruling back to the states which is where its supposed to actually be
"the us constitution specifically forbids any attempt to establish a state religion
it follows then that any evidence that relies on the supposed words of some invisible unseen entity the evidence for whom relies entirely on the words in a single ancient unreliable selfcontradicting book which few of its selfprofessed adherents have ever actually read should play absolutely no part in lawmaking
in other words if you want the usa to follow the laws of a god then hesheit should be ready to appear in court to justify and explain those laws
you know the sort of thing  why slavery is good genocide encouraged as are stoning naughty toddlers to death and banning women from holding holy office
the silliest thing is that the organisations that claim to believe these things are not us taxpayers  but they still bleat and whine about tax dollars being wasted on things that the supposed founder of their religion commanded they do
the really funny thing is just how few of them seem able even to spell hypocrisy"
so if this investigative reporter delved deep into the situation with the supreme court and the alleged leak of the draft decision then why didnt her investigation reveal the culprit who leaked the draft
and usa justice system is corrupt  what is going on in this country  is it just the beginning of a total collapse as it sure seems so everyone is just in it for themselves  what a corrupt corrupt country
rbg was good but should have retired during obama administration
these people want you to believe their conclusions are valid even though the evidence of the corruption of scotus is obvious the duplicitousness is of a trumpian scale
term limits and accountability for the supreme court now
200 in nothing when chris says i forgot about the details i have not
if it looks like a duck quacks like a duck its a duck
the 1973 sc decision said that women had the right to bodily autonomy  the male justices on the present sc said no they dont
this makes me upset the fact that people have the power to harm people women are being treated like secondclass citizens
trump wanted to seat justices that would overturn roe  so the sc justices went with politics their religious beliefs  not the constitution
this supreme courts conservative men are about politics they are fabricating legal interpretations that magically align with their personal political leanings that makes them nonelected lawmakers and not interpreters of the law
"these kind of wherever they are are claim they are religious and good people but you look at their faces and you can see the nastiness and hatred there because of all the pain they carry around with them 

when youre this evil the universe wont let you be happy"
trump figured out how to tear down the trust in every america institution in 4 years in office why are these justices using their beliefs or opinions as metrics for which to judge your job as a judge is to follow the law the constitution it has nothing to do with anyones political opinions or religious beliefs the entire gop is dirty and trying to destroy our nation
of course  the newly appointed justices committed perjury during their confirmation hearings  they were inherently uncomfortable about striking down roe vs wade  they wanted a period of time to allow public acceptance of their tainted confirmations
john roberts has a lot of nerve to talk about this leak being a breach of trust the scotus has broken the trust of the people i literally see them as enemies of liberty and democracy at this point none of them care about justice or do process just more greedy little children
manassehisrael1025  you are taking the lords name in vain fake christian
the most corrupt supreme court in american history
she is field dependent and unable to weigh other concerns  she is deaf to human concerns other than being the darling of zealots  she is a zealot and so is alito who is back in the 1500s  he hates women
it shows to all those watching  how easy it is to take over powerful positions in usa  you better believe theyre watching 
if something is being leaked it means something is being hidden hidden from we the people we are not governed we are ruled
she has seven children and an army of people to care for them  she could have advocated as a woman for some concerns that are now evident she did nothing
jody kantor is clear concise thank you for your insight and reporting
contact your federal legislator and say you wont vote for them unless they bring legislation to codify roe into law no compromise
barrettcover your own butt
the supreme court needs to have their medical license revoked
relisted a crime against humanity
"so msnbc is just realizing they were eagerly waiting for rbg to die so they could do this 
now  seriously"
it was either alito or thomas  my money is on clarence

once upon a time i felt like i leaned republican but now i will never forgive them and never forget that theyre trying to do to women economics foreign policies nothing of it matters if we dont even have basic human rights in the first place 
of course this person giving supreme court apologetics is from the new york times a right leaning paper and not known for honesty this reporter wants to mislead   make people think the majority on the supreme court arent domestic terrorists who want to destroy our country w christo fascism 
all medical decisions should never be made by anyone except a patient family and the doctor doctors are the authority for medical decisions they have more education than a lawyer and they know their patients better than any politicallyappointed judge

could america be more corrupt

like the third world countries americans are always on about

"
women didnt create their body themselves nor did women create the baby by themselves
your headline sounds disgusting
this is from 2022 why is it being posted as news
the supreme court under republicans is corrupt the senate under republicans is corrupt the house and congress under republicans is corrupt and the presidency under republicans is corrupt so can your imagine what would happen if all those ducks line up
anyone that thinks the scotus is not corrupt this is all the proof needed that they are
womens bodies women make decisions  not you  shams
republicans are trash
whoever was responsible for the binder at the time of it going missing should be questioned and held accountabke
you can bet that wealthy republicans will have access to abortion and will use it
it is absolutely sick what is going on in the us my honest take on what is going on is that every single woman in the us should leave the country all at once in protest that might get their attention
democrats are something else boy smdh and i used to be a democrat in 2008 but they are pure evil now
the thing this tells me is the court must be much more open with their deliberations this was all very underhanded and clearly an abuse of the respectability of the court these justices dont deserve the secrecy they demand and we cant afford it
it was alito and thomas who leaked the draft
republican anti freedom party
whats next  atheism becomes illegal childless is illegal fahrenheit 451  slavery returns child brides burkas it sure seems like the states is already sliding down the slippery slope never say never
they have not held up their oath of office we do not need justices on the supreme court who respect the oath they took
conservative means to not allow progress and control all our lives to keep us all in place because of an ancient religion brought to us from the old world
the current us supreme court is a breach of trust
term limits now omfg disgusting and outrageous omfg
the supreme court smells like bad fish i dont trust them at all anymore lifetime appointments should be stopped immediately all it does is breed corruption what motivation do these judges have to play by the rules when they dont have to answer to anyone and cant lose their job no matter what they do 
im just astonished how they are allowed to serve after lying to congresssenate and taking bribes etc smh
i do not trust the super majority they lie they cheat
seems like a lack of transparency transparency is the heart of democracy
rgb helped create all of this turmoil by refusing to step down when her health was obviously failing  ironically she bears a large portion of blame for the demise of roe v wade
dipshits for trump 
term limits and ethics rules for scotus 10 yrs period end of story its sad when the highest court in the country is full of political hacks and grifters voteblue
ive got my money on ginny being the leak
amy changing her vote on taking the case is meaningless its just for appearance and changes nothing about how i see her shes still a dreadful person
the blame should fall on ruth bader for not stepping down when she could  have been replaced her desire to clutch the power until it had to be pried from her dead hands cost every woman in this country their right to choose
ruth ginsburg should have retired when obama asked to but noooooo she had to play justice till she died putting herself above country shame power corrupts now women pay the price
scotus surely torpedoed the gop they havent won an election since
why does not the news report the truth they ruled that we have no rights to privacy
and if weasel garland was not being paid off 3 of them traitor would be in prison
"it was justice alito

its not hard to figure out who leaked the dobbs decision he did it to force the others into not changing their minds to this new 15 week ban that justice roberts was touting"
they are plotting to make american women brood mares n korea china and russia are wanting bigger birth rates for economics and soldiers now we can say the republicans have the sane agenda johnson has said that all the aborted babies could have been viable tax payers

its not democracy if the majority of people want something and supreme court goes against that
lawrence needs some yacht time to think about it
repuglicans had been politicking on abortion for decades and then when they finally had to votes to overturn roe v wade they had to choose between enraging the evangelicals or the rest of the country  may they go down with the evangelical ship  theres a reason religion is in decline some people recognize hypocrisy and unethical behavior
the american evangelical fascists would have been ok to elect the devil for president if he helped them to overturn roe v wade and they came very close to the dark lord with trump
"this christian fundamentalist scotus is severely overstepping their boundaries  duties overturning roe was purely politically  ideologically driven they were more interested in shoving their personal opinions down the throats of the american people than following the law  settled precedent
also ill never forgive rgb for not stepping down during obamas 1st term when she couldve allowed him to replace her with someone like minded"
love that all their machinations have actually increase support for abortion whod have thought
term limits and rights of recall
when i think of supreme court judges i think of liars and paid for tools
"contrary to what democratsliberals and their propaganda outlets are trying to make people believe the us supreme court did not ban abortions  they simply and constitutionally ruled that abortion is up to each individual state and not the federal government  
tenth amendment  the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people"
"yea so what will happen
nothing 
the rich get away with treason against the peoples will again
and we bend over and take it
the french had the right idea in 1789"
so someone saw them scheming the american people behind closed doors and leaked the document in hopes of a change good on whoever did that thats more american than what these religious zealots are trying to do
its absolutely hilarious how stupid msnbcs reporters make fox look its real reporting with undeniable evidence hayes is the man
lets just hope americans vote blue and make republicans pay for taking away rights
abortion restrictions have already been influencing elections  im sensing a crushing defeat for the right wing in 2024
excuse me since when is determining constitutionality done in secret leaks within the military is treason  maybe the court should focus on billionaires destroying this democracy
justice clarence thomas should do the right thing and resign its probably the biggest single immediate step that could be taken to restore faith in the supreme court id be fine with replacing him with another conservative provided they were someone with integrity competence and loyal to the constitution
and alito is scumalong with thomas gorsuch kavanaugh and barrett all of them are liars
abortion should be an option i mean taxpayers shouldnt have to pay for it tho
"alito lied the founders didnt allow abortion
franklin in his publication gave  a recipe for inducing abortion and warned women to stay away from fancy men
go ahead magats push this
we not miss your circus in congress
npr"
i dont think coathanger barrett trying to protect her reputation means i need to think any differently about her she sucks just like the rest of these boughtandpaidfor conservatives it is disgusting
msm ny times 
i think the bombshell was the supreme court justice illegally placed by trump that spoke of human beings as if we are cattle herds and her the sheppard we are part of your eugenics program btch and that alone should have forced the presidents hand to come to womens defense rather than leaving them out to dry we need to elect a president that isnt a geriatric white man
we liberals can cry all we want but rbg new she wasnt going to live forever she should have stepped down when obama was president and the dems had control of the senate but  no she evidently thought  she would live forever so i blame her and i blame obama when he nominated gerrick and the senate led by mcconnel stalled  obama should have gone ahead and appointed gerrick saying the senates role was to advise and consent not to stall but no
the problem is the majority of ww voted for dt in 2016 and in tx 62 supported rs being elected which now tx has a full court with rs serving beto should have won so if you are putting race over gender then eventually you will be affected by the same extremist patriarchal system that affects marginalized women js
conservatives are apparently for small government but are happy to tell people what to do with their bodiespeak hypocrisy
look we all know alito was the leaker
i do feel bad because sotomayor kagan and brown are not at all part of this theocratic nonsense  i dont like them getting lumped in with the welldeserved hatred the other six get
the supreme court is full of liars
the reversal of roe needa to be overturned
our federal justices are no longer about the the rule of law but the power of politics such a shame
i wonder given the damage the dobbs decision did to the republicans in 2022 and in the many referendums on abortion and gop special election disasters if this conservative majority would have overturned roe given the devastating fallout for the gop i predict it will lead to massive gop losses in 2024 polls show the gop has never been more unpopular  the dems are taking the white house and both chambers of congress next year thanks primarily to the dobbs ruling
i seriously doubt that the supreme court will find the leaker
"theres two that are maga republicans judges not only favoritism to hide then when all is forgotten then the rabbit is out of  the hat
there should be more democrats on the supreme court why did obama not filled that seat how did mitch mcconnell sneak that woman into that seat 
no doubt just recently two justices on the supreme court should had been disqualified yes thats right disqualified off their rocker 
they knew they were wrong 
they made up there own law 
and place themselves above 
laws of our constitutional 
because they subjects of the same laws that goven the american people and including the president
they the three of themselves have valilated there oath of office by the 14th 3 amendment
"
"three of these trumpsollini scotus judges lied under oath in their preappointment hearings and now theyre personification of maga evil
when these stooges grant trumpsollini total immunity then so has president biden"
_ as per her bible barrett doesnt care about being a 2nd class us citizen but to make her fellow females 2nd class too just might ease the pain a bit is that it amy just like a dab of iodine or mercurochrome 
i see this as just another way to divide the people in the usabecause divided we fall we failchoice is the one given right god gave the worldthis is not abou prolife or prochoice this is all about dividing the people of the usa just like democrats or republicanslaws are made to protect those rightslike the hippa laws roe v wade confession rights  catholic  or tax exempt lawsi would like to see scotus rule on confession rights and the tax exempt lawsif scotus ruling against abortion and contraception but leaves medications like viagra on the marketa contradiction of rights
scotus is the most corrupt branch of the us government
like there is literally a whole political party based on killing babies
i am a new convert to republican justice over turning roe v wade bothered me but when it comes to  laws making way for genderaffirming puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors it must be stopped immediately i am glad we have 6 republican leaning supreme court justices i am with them now
put sen whitehouse in the whitehouse in 2024
alito probably leaked it himself
the breach of trust came from the supreme court when nominees lie under oath then refuse to recuse themselves for conflicts of interest they should all resign period
"in their confirmation hearings gorsutch cavenaugh and coneybarrett all said row was estimated legal precident 
then ruled to over turn it the first opportunity they had"
the only thing that trump has been right about is that the total system is corrupt and of course as a totally corrupt person he wants to be at the top
interesting people these christian judges this supreme court is now like catholic church  full of secrets and crimes against humanity
no bombshell detected
you cant call them justices if they lied on their confirmation hearings
dont tell me let me guess ginny thomas
the supreme court is a breach of trust
liars appointing liars
while they protect the embryos before that child is born but when the child grow to school age  and killed by gunman that is ok with them  what do they really want
the democrats have been hijacked by godless baby killers who wants to turn children into trans
so dismantling roe vs wade was a goal doesnt that negate the authority of being a judge sounds like they have acted like tools
we need to remember that barrett has 7 children because she adopted some are not her natural children and obstetrical doctors warn against having that many children because it takes a serious toll on the womans health these things need to be said publicly so that women who have not had children and men who will never suffer pregnancy and childbirth will begin to be aware there is a complete disconnect in our society of what women actually go thru and the long term affects on the woman
i have as much confidence in the supreme court as i do the corrupt fbi agents that are still employed many agents have also received a promotion for their corruption it makes me sick to my heart i hope theyre happy
democrats are an evil evil party now and this is coming from a former democrat
"there is leadership and there is following  the court failed in leadership  roe v wade created one national law for abortion overturning it creates 50 state laws  that is failure of leadership

in effect denying medical care to women "
this court robertskavanaugh beret and thomas are a breach of trust
roberts says this leak was a breach of trust not as much as the breach of trust created when they betrayed their oath and the nation playing politics with peoples lives and bringing suffering to women everywhere in their effort to turn back the clock to a time when women were the property of men
justice alito was and is the leak
how dare they make killing babies illegal  thats transphobic
the scotus is so corrupt how can we ever respect their opinions such a disgrace to our country 
lets get to the bottom of this
just the fact that they discussed the scheduling of the hearing of the case shows what a fd up clubhouse the supreme court is now
literally everyone upset about this are godless baby killers
the supreme court is long overdue for a tuneup if not a house cleaning i wish it deserved the title supreme but lately it feels more like substandard so disappointing
the results of religious brain washing of children from an early age backed up and reinforced by fear of judgement  man rules with the woman as second class who has to do what they are told if they know whats good for them
"its very clear all these justices have no backbone to stand up for americas democracy america demands justice she cries for justice and she will have justice 

lock trump up now"
abort the supreme court
i think bombshell is doing a lot of heavy lifting here the court is illegitimate and wholly corrupt not sure why everyones so surprised
lets make this very simple  when one party intentionally stonewalls an appointment and then presses forward multiple appoints by their own party to create a conservative majority that results in the changing of law that the majority of americans do not want it is absolutely political period full stop  when you have justices that lie and say one thing to get appointed and then do another they are not judges of high integrity they are politicians  period full stop  there needs to be scotus reform oversight ethics standards and term limits
a corrupt bunch
lock trump up now
oh please we all know that a republicanstacked court was always going to overturn roe there was absolutely no chance it wasnt gonna happen this has been their goal for decades well one of their goals this was inevitable if it took republicans another 30 years to get a majority they would have still overturned roe the first chance they got the only way you can stop this is to stop voting for republicans period if you want to keep your rights and you know the republicans are against you absolutely never vote for a single one of them and always vote
literally everyone whose pro abortionist are godless baby killers
"rbg should have stepped down in 2014 she didnt and amy barrett will now be a reliable rightwing vote for 40 years

did it to yourselves white women  take that 53 of you who voted for trump and figure out how to fix the abortion mess that you created "
with great power comes great responsibility apparently absolute power becomes corrupts absolutely it is time to restore balance to the supreme court to restore our rights and freedom
7 kids tf cap those tattered frayed tubes 
i think ginni thomas leaked it she had access to her husbands computer and we know she wanted roe gone they hid who did the leak to protect her
kangaroo court basically the idological cesspool of the slop known as conservative
seems from outside the us like deep corruption prejudicing cases before trial
"the fix was in when mcconnell interfeed with the functioning of government during the obama administration and the orange mob boss gained power 
everything else is just lipstick on a pig"
i ejaculae more substantial loads than whatever this cm rag of a court passes as tenured stability
every time they think they win they loose more election vote blue  and reinstate womens rights to healthcare
conservatives will reverse the ban on abortion when they realise that the growth of nonwhite populations is increasing significantly
roe vs wade was always going to be tossed out by this supreme court the whole song and dance of careful deliberation was just as much a song and dance as the gop swearing to listen to the evidence against trump for his impeachment and then openly saying well never vote for impeachment the democrats know it the republicans know it and even the neutral voters know it
so they conspired strategically  it was all step by step plan  and what about all these cases conservatives are putting forward that are fake like the wedding planner who wasnt a wedding planner who made up a case and got it all the way to the supreme court  i call bs
truly awful reporting the court didnt take dobbs to spit on ginsbergs grave they already had the majority ginsberg herself said that dobbs was bad law and would get overturned at least the guest host tried to tamp down on his conspiratorial claims
what does this have to do with the law this is entirely political  worrying about appearances over substance is always political this is just disgraceful
"the scotus itself is a breach of trust
in 2023 trumps scotus is corrupted to its conservative authoritarian racists misogynistic core"
all six members shown on this video should be permanently removed from the scotus disbarred and placed in prison for their levels of corruption
"when your country start stripping you of basic human rights and civil rights you no longer live in free country you live in a country ran by the church via the old prunes elected into office over half the civil and basic human rights taken away from americans have come with this phrase said by the politicians that supported it its against my religious views and in good faith i couldnt support or pass a bill that goes against my god 
you want freedom it needs to start with all that serve federal and public office to sign a neutrality agree this would have them agree that they will not allow their religious or personal beliefs or feelings influence the laws they pass rather they will do what the people want or what is best for the people you know the ones of many faiths and cultures second that is all members of both houses of government shall serve a max of 2 terms of 4 years each these terms start via election at same time as the president elect is chosen third no one that has been impeached shall be allowed to run for office that includes the potus any federal office and publicstate office"
cant we just come out and say what we all see that alito is the source of the leak
cant we just come out and say what we all see that alito is the source of the leak
prolife forever
clickbait  theres no bombshell here  it doesnt tell us anything about the leak
the supreme court sucksleaks are happening frequently  that just confuses  people but i have to believe the supreme court will protect mothers as well as fetuses no woman should de because the fetus they are carrying has catastrophic futures women arent incubators the recent woman who had to have the procedure to save her own life should not be decided by legislators politicians doctors know what is best for patients not judges legislators or politicians the supreme court has to see medical complications as actual real life scenariosthis isnt what ifs
that will cost many lifes
"time to ignore and cancel the supreme court  
the are obsolute and have nothing to do with justice"
i think the justices are just upset because it came out that 5 justices or known liars
"lies once again by the dishonest corrupt leftists
what a bunch of media hacks you media losers  the ruling had nothing to do with overturning a right to an  abortion"
more on the wreckage of the us justice system brought by trump et al
i like jodi kantors analytical mind i wouldnt mind seeing her on more often for future discussions
ginny thomas leaked the draft to politico sam alito and clarence thomas were in on it none of these three people can be trusted to tell the truth about anything
this nonsense will hand democrats wins next year
breach of trust this right wing scotus is beyond trust  they are a kangaroo trump court 
"alito said that abortion is not mentioned in the constitution
you know what else isnt mentioned in the constitution capitalism god jesus
these theocrats need relocated to afghanistan"
i still blame hillary for this
why is it just wonens health  sue for discremination
the united states is backwards and behind in so many other ways why not in this bit of personal liberty as well
"person a should never ever make medical decisions for person b

 pro life is made up by conservative radicals to push their unfavorable position ending an embryo to save the life of the woman carrying it outweighs those radicals opinion"
clarence thomas had an abortion actually still does his wife
no report on the american people being removed from homes to make room for illegals
so the supreme court isnt above playing politics  this is a thing i so do not want to believebut the evidence is incontrovertible and that beerboy kavanaugh should openly suggest deceiving the american people so that amy conehead can look good well that one is not a surprise whats most disappointing is where were the liberal justices during all thiswhy didnt they speak out to the american people once it became clear that trumps patsies were working to make themselves look legit like right after theyd lied to congress about roe all i can say is theyd better stay holy on the presidential immunity case bc now all eyes are on them
"so americans are by a strong majority prochoice but a strong minority of religious fascists is antichoice 
but against all logic abortion will be banned for decades this is a disaster and shouldnt happen in a democracy the us political and judicial system is perfectible"
communist democrats and their terrorist projecting their thirst for murdering unborn children and womens rights
at best these dishonorable agents of christian apologism use their power for flagrant abuse of religious  dogma that gets metastases into secular law now dripping with the venom of christian nationalism  this is basic treason and an overt denial of their oath to our republic
biblicallyspeaking life begins at birth read the bible and note the many passages with the phrase breath of life this isnt some superpower of god this is god defining life as the moment when a person takes their first breath this whole debate is a farce by an extremist group parading a deceitful interpretation to gain and hold political power
so we are blaming the right wing justices for all the abuses they are committingwhen in fact they were appointed by one leonard leo and confirmed by one mitch mcconnell and his right wing republicansthese right wing justices were carefully selected for that purposeand if we think is only about abortion think again dont forget that are there for life and they were selected young in age for a reason we are in big trouble on this countryand if we think the abortion ruling is based on on religion then we are been fooled that ruling is all about money and power nothing to do with religion believesince the bible doesnt condemn abortion so we are in danger with this right wing republican justices of losing our democracybeware of all the right wingers with deep pockets cause their power is not limited to the supreme courtall the federal courts are in this texas comes to mind wake up america lets vote all these right wing republicans out of every office of legislation in this our republicenough
medical procedures getting politicized is practice of medicine without a license there is a reason why obgyns got to school for 12 years
the last thing you want to happen is for them to find out who ignored the confidentiality of the court and blabber mouth they were taking up the abortion issue because you know it was a leftist
and nobody saw this coming   from the moment of the decision of roe versus wade the conservative political wing pushed via their appointments to move back toward abortion restriction
nothing more than a bunch of overpowered silly figures 
dont forget that these justices lied under oath about rvw being settled law
as a retired judge i have long held the supreme court in high regard i know have nothing but contempt for the body
theyre mad about a breech of trust on their side to distract from the betrayal of faith for faith put in the supreme court that the vaaast majority of americans support roe v wade and this isnt about law at this point its about not having proper separation of church and state because clearly woman with their doctors should determine whats right for the woman not politicians stealing or rights and trying to silence the majority all thanks to corrupt republicans
a bunch of catholics deciding it is women  rped little girls jobs to hurt suffer  cry to pleasure their sadists selves
a clear case of how politicized the court has become another stab in the back of its legitimacy as the arbiter of american justice
"ordering an investigation into who did it but no investigation into the crimes violations of laws committed by regular citizens are crimes but not if a scotus justice like clarence does it not recusing in a trial against his wife9 and not investigating corruption
biden should have nominated 4 justices and the new majority should have passed ethics rule  even with the option to kick out corrupt and criminal justices now trump will nominate 4 more justices like judge aileen and jim jordan  only condition is absolute loyalty to trump against the constitution"
yes no trust for the doj
"the supreme court are no longer credible they are all compromised and rule how the banks corporations and their masters order them to
they are of no use or value to or for the american people"
what is the basis of law if not religiously held moral values
we need to replace supreme court every few years
i still contend that it was sotomayor all along who leaked the draft dobbs opinion
i think the country should ways new ways preventing preacancies birth control pills for men etc
they dont say who leaks it so dont waste your time on this video
pelican brief
they may take our dog but they will never take our fleadumb  means what
they leaked it to soften the blow and should be sued for practicing medicine without a license 
our family decided to leave the us mainly due to this issue and also the safety problems i will not let the untrained and uneducated people push their religion to decide what medical care i need or my children in the future
the supreme court didnt take abortion rights away they moved the decision about abortion rights out of the federal government and closer to the people just like republican constitutional democracy demands
the supreme court is corrupt
"her vote to not take the case was entirely selfserving not ethical

and that leak changed absolutely nothing i dont care what the justices claim they went in with the sole purpose of overturning roe"
infiltrated with trumpers
"the courts are crooked 
thomas is proof of that 
i think they will support trump throughout as they both need each other to keep what they both want"
yet more evidence suggesting that the us supreme court has become illegitimate
you can still get one in 99 percent of the country so whats the big deal
total bs they turned it over to the states to decide if you live in a libtarded leftist democrat state you can keep slaughter babies all day long so abortion isnt banned in the usa
whats the problem  i flew business class to europe for my abortion and stayed at the ritzcarlton  i dont see the problem
alito leaked that document  no doubt
the supreme turds 
regressive scotus  and what are checks and balances for this body of justices wake up usa they do have a fiduciary responsibility to the rule of law
"thank you jody
and adam"
the writer of the draft is the the leaker  duh 
i believe that alito is the leak
i knew it right away it was leaked by a conservative why it would have been more helpful politically if it was leaked later for liberals you dont need to be named niccolò to figure it out
women need to start thinking about the laws needed to control mens bodies the way they control womens bodies fornication and adultery are prohibited in the bible yet men do it all the time and get away with it and they cause unwanted pregnancies ther must be laws set in stone regarding mens bodies in our judicial system and its time to balance the scales men cannot have their cake and eat it too
i no longer trust the sc corruption has already entered the sc by keeping it a secret they denied the voice of the people to share their perspective they slapped the majority of americans people while supporting the minority group will never forgive the sc
its not about politics remind me dont we have a highly corrupted judge that still resides in there with bribes from rich business people
the supreme court government has no right in the rights of a womanwhy is they still fighting slavery
what is so supreme about a court of 9 people stabbing each other in the back and leaking information was  clarences the only person who knew ginni was working with insurrectionists  yeah right
if the american people vote for a referendum it can introduce a term limit
justice roberts should have shown the same amount of outrage about justice clarences behaviour and lack of ethical standards being demonstrated by his fellow judges and leave womens rights alone
was the plan leaked by alitos office  it certainly looks that way  it was a means to expedite the clampdown on and removal of civil rights in the usa  filthy business  never turn your backs on these justices  they have no justice intended for you
the next time the democrats get all three branches of government they have to fix the supreme court what a disaster
we are doomed as it is nearly impossible to amend the constitution partly because any amendnent can be blocked by a mere 13 states  withholding approval and since the constitution is the supreme law of the land it cannot be changed by any process except for another amendment does this directly effect the supreme court i dont know but im guessing it does the equal rights amendment  sorry ladies is still in limbo a century after a guarantee of gender equality was proposed to congressthe era was proposed in 1923 but did not pass congress until 1972 and under u s law amendments to the constitution must be ratified by three fourths 38 of the state legislatures and do not require presidential approval
rules for thee not for me
the problem in the us is that presidents are allowed to nominate their choices for the court  this needs to be taken away from politicians and done by some other means that removes partisan politics from the process  theres is no way its a fair and balanced system if the court becomes another arm of the party in power
this is clearly disgustingthey all must be laughing their way to the bank both figuratively and literallydid that earn thomas and his wife another hefty deposit to their account no amount of  is worth the pain and suffering to anyone that needs an abortion then to take the right to choose away
chris and jody i applaud all that you do i implore you to always include commentary on the rights agenda to eliminate the separation of church and state as nothing more than a lever to clutch on to power at the cost of womens rights women know when theyre ready to be moms its not up to anyone else also please always include framing on the societal impact of underparented children  the rights prolife til birth and proprison til death are a contradiction that are both morally and fiscally bankrupt  nutured children push themselves to become capable adults unwantedundervalued children push away struggle  need grace from others all the sacred texts discuss this to limit yourself to one book or worse someone elses interpretation of one book is americas new pandemic
surprise surprise a bunch of men decided to strip women of our bodily autonomy asapdisgusting
in making their judgment the conservative justices helped a lot of republican politicians lose their jobs
ah yes blame the leaker not the poor justices
whats up with rudy
chris hayes reading into things that people didnt say sorta seems like a conspiracy theorist
cowards and liars and turds oh my
breach of trust whos
who listens to msdnc
they all lied under oath
scotus is the breach of trust
who keeps these republican rico political honest their actions smell what will they hide when the insurrection and republican attempts to destroy our democracy surface 
ginsberg stood in the gao as long as she could keeping american women from being chattel and now she is gone and so are womens rights amy coney barrett is the worst kind of traitor
"breach of trust is what these supreme court members did to the entirety of the american people to be exact their decision opens the legal door to declare all rights not written down in the constitution and amendments as not rights at all

to be crystal clear rights written into the constitution are legally called enumerated rights meaning theyve been written down in the constitution before this abortion decision there used to be rights called unenumerated rights meaning they are not written down anywhere in the constitution

unenumerated rights were ones like a right to travel a right to wear the cloths you want a right to eat the food you like madison pointed this out before the constitution was finished in the federalist papers and was deeply concerned because he believed a supreme court might nullify all unenemerated rights in a decision and this supreme court did just that with this abortion decision saying the constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion the constitution makes no express reference to a right to wear the clothes you want either see it now

what this supreme court has done with this abortion decision is say there are no unenumerated rights that you do not have a right to eat what you want you do not have a right to travel you do not have a right to wear the cloths you want and all similar things this because those are not written down in the constitution enumerated

this is what madison was terrified of that a supreme court would make such a decision and they just did so believe it or not americans no longer have a single right to do anything that isnt outlined specifically in the constitution theyve declared all unenemerated rights as unconstitutional with this abortion decision outlined in their opinions hows that for a wake up call bet you didnt know either did you"
man it must be a pain in the backside for the honest fair thinking more intelligent democrat supreme judges dealing with the corrupt bias less intelligent republican supreme judges who hold the majority
thanks trump and the republican partyyou big dummiesfred sanford
the six justices who are roman catholic should have disqualified themselves  its like christian scientist judges banning appendicitis operations
mthe conservatives on the bench are owned by the kochs
six of the most hated and  vile people on the courts we wouldnt be going through all this upheaval if they had just left roe as is its clear they hate women and consider us to be 2nd hand citizens to be barefoot and in the kitchen or bedroom and nowhere else i hope women unite and get each and every one of the gop     out and vote blue for all women out there  this scotus is the beginning of the end
most of the people who claim to be against roe have never actually read it  it had different requirements for each trimester of pregnancy
abolish lifetime appointments
old news
so my takeaway is that supreme court judges do not just benignly sit and wait for cases to reach their court and then let the law decide in honest and open debate  nothing could be further from the truth  they have pre determined agendas and they play politics lie cheat steal  to achieve it bending the law to do as they their billionaire ownersdonors want
it was ginnie a bet it was ginnie
the supreme court is corrupt and not a democratic institutionit is an archaic model under the fashion of a monarchy or roman republic there should be no positions for life in america it was all a well played game
collectively we deserve everything that is coming including this topic of course i do not agree
they acted like vultures they lied corrupt not for the people they are for their own agenda for theocracy 
a very corrupted supreme court and even lower courts     all these justices have been bribed      it is about controlling every aspect of womens lives
thats exactly what it looks like 
im so not surprised the only thing supreme about them is their hypocrisy entitlement and total lack of integrity
the breach of trust was done by the lying members of scotus that wouldnt reveal their bias stance on row v wade we have no sympathy for you supreme court 
98 of biologists agree that human life begins at fertilization  you might as well argue that evolution is just a theory at that point  the fact that human life begins at fertilization has more scientific support than global warming does among geologists  let that sink in
dont we all know it was either alito or thomas or their staff on explicit request of the injustice who leaked the oppinion to pressure gorsuch kavanaugh and barrett
got to rework laws governing the scotus we now see this is  a court of greed and corruption they make the roman senate and the chief priest and the pharisees of jesus day look like school boys to be fair not all but enough of them known crooks passing judgemental it some cases to the highest bidder god hated corrupt judgement so bad he said he will clothe himself in righteous and fight against it isaiah59 if god said he hated it they are not getting away with anything
did she get her clothes in the matrix
"it has a separate dna from the mother it has a separate immune system from the mother it has a separate heartbeat from the mother it has separate organs from the mother 

the argument that it is not a human life suggests that because it relies on the body of the mother for survival it cannot be viewed as an individual life with constitutional or even basic human rights  that is the weakest argument because the same could be said for any vulnerable human especially babies  

face it that is a baby and abortion is murder  its not an opinion its a fact"
america just need to stop voting republican and the problem would be solved
mindblowing to me as a german to appoint anyone for life in such a position of power with no good fail safe to prevent abuse of power
biden needs to expand the scotus to 11 andor we need to impeach clarence thomas for bribery which we already 100 have factual evidence of and investigate kavanaugh who was never properly vetted and screened this is not partisan those are facts
the hypocrisy of this court is beyond belief  first of all two of the justices positions should have been appointed under obama and bidenusing a rule that mitch mcconnel set up and then only abided by the rule when it helped him get two more seats  the fact that they seated a justice a month before biden took office is unbelievable  and both of the new justices told congress they would support established law when specifically asked about roe vs wade during their congressional interviews  you would think the supreme court would be an example for everyone to follow instead of being a politically based joke
"states with restrictive abortion laws with the exception of texas represent less than twenty percent of the national g d p  they are welfare states that depend
on the well organiced prosperous democratically controlled coastal coastal states for their survival"
why is there no way to suspend the courts agenda until we get answers  also suspend any more cases to be taking up
a breach of trust but not see a betrayal of the full citizenship of half the nation
dobbs caus8mg sufferingbut eventually will end the gop  expand the court  staggered 12 terms with all over 12 years getting replaced immediately  ethics code with criminal liability
"f _ c _ this
president biden 
needs to add more"
"it was always about power and politics
what else was there"
is there money involved
speazy amoral  right wingers
separation of church and state bible thumpers should not be on the supreme court they are clearly prejudiced
these should not be lifetime positions  that is obsurd
no justice with the supreme court justice team so very very sad
wrong if you not held  accountable to one 
i dont even know why we think its ok for men to make decisions over a womens body unbelievable
people have been brainwashed by godless people to believe it a  choice over a crime 
wrong hows that may i ask  you  
no more supreme courts we need super computers that have all our laws in it both parties feed in their provable facts and the computer can settle the issue with no parole or pardons
two of three democratic powers are held hostage by hostile rightwing cultists
thats exactly what it looks like looking political i believe these decisions should be made by doctors whats the point of years of training taking oaths to do no harm when they have hands tied plus bringing the whole god question into the discussion is ludicrous
"trust in the us supreme court has reached a record low and its entirely justified
these are some of the most corrupt creatures in america when the christofascist members of the court arent imposing their talibanlike doctrines on the american people theyre taking bribes from their wealthy friends their names are smeared in excrement and will be for eternity these people have no doubt convinced themselves theyll be remembered in history but their egos dont allow them to realize theyll be remembered with utter disdain and total loathing for generations to come
they think theyre going to be remembered like jefferson when in reality theyll be remembered like aaron burr"
this is the fifth video in a day that i heard someones fire alarm beeping that it needs its battery replaced 
thank you jesus for  the jjudges who jknow that and wont appove it as ok 
thats crimminal insanity 
term limits for justices and repercussions for accepting bribes for decisions
settled law was a confirmation lie by brett and amy who had a settled opinion and vote to overturn roe and lied about it
its werid how the y dont  call it a baby but a fetus a latin word  why not use the english term baby its because its truth that will make you think of it as one and make  i t  harder  to do to see  its  a precious sacred little life 
disturbing to see that the shallowness of american thinking extends all the way to the supreme court
america treats this as a purely personal issue but it isnt at least not in a wider context the world watches and i know for a fact that most people trusting this supreme court wouldnt get taken for a serious person in many countries outside the us only a matter of time until this influences diplomacy
there scared of people showing up at there house and childrens school  cant blame em doj violated there rights please dont take the job if your gonna cave everyone some freak protests
supreme court is tainted with religious zealots
another genius in new york court too smart to google trumps property value  great jobs and great pensions we pay for as they look down on us trump
so whats the news on alito and clarence not making public all the lavish gifts from billionaires
we have fascists at very level in this country how can the average american defend against
corruption at the heart usa justice its the problem of corrupt political lifetime appointment who are often bribed
amy coney barrett  brett cavanaugh and neil gorsuch all said that roe v wade is settled president during their confirmation hearing which amounts to purgury
"this is all the result of one mans lifetime quest to overturn rvw and why he allowed trump to remain president 
this is evil of the highest calibure all for the sake of ideology in something that has no benefit or loss to them"
no one trust the supreme court anymore
so phantom dark moneys work behind closed doors selling out good childrens everywhere
its the christiancatholic supreme court now and you liberals will henceforth refer to it as such
4 of these judges are clearly not fit for purpose three of them appointed by trump 1 appointed by bush thomas has shown himself to be a tool of the billionaires  he sups with for a long time
"bs judges 
there is no fairness in the us system i give no respect to judges choose side"
she s maga also so there was some hidden petty reason i m sure
what this shows is that the supreme court is a political entity plain and simple
we cant have a supreme court relisting their votes es its nit right our laws are our business  also no more lifetime terms for them transparency
please leave abortion aside its a shame we have several overtly corrupt crooked individuals enacting laws that rule our country and society its an absolutely abject situation we take like it should be the norm thomas roberts  alito and gorsuch should have been investigated tried and put behind bars instead these judges have made their own rules that make them immune to prosecution the rest of the civilized world looks at us laughs but feels nauseated
for me  the only bombshell from this story is that acb wanted to wait until next session i was expecting more details about the actual leak and not the consequences interesting but no bombshell
"scotus  must have term limits what svotus pulled was just plain 
evil "
lied from msnbc
why would you need longer than 15 weeks to make up your mind democrats are sick
lol if whole cemetaries can still cast votes and help the favored politician get elected  death should not hinder the supreme court  justice ginsberg can still cast her vote dead or alive
anita hill warned about thomas
they need to be shamed   every time they show up to court protesters need to shout shame shame shame they know what they did and expect us to forget and forgive
its time to add more seats to the scotus bench
alito leaked the decision its not a secret roe was settled law so there was no reason to take it up other than to overturn it they all lied at their confirmation hearings before the american people when they promised they wouldnt review roe
the supreme court is a corrupt band of magat supporters they are a clear and present danger to our democracy look no further than ginny thomas by the way clarence how much does it cost to buy a supreme court justice may be we should ask your owner harlan crow
i have no confidence at all in the us supreme court it needs radical changes appointees by a panel and term limits to start how is it a good idea to give anyone a job for life
the forces that passed all these bans in the wake of dobbs would have worked around if not danced and skipped around a 15week compromise the exceptions would still be written on air water and sand while the restrictions would steelreinforced oak they were horrible in dobbs but scotus was also explicit do it because we can and talk big about whats to come those two aspects were the only favors they did for reproductive rights making it crystal clear they were there to erase progress reason and hope
the supreme court has too much power in all things
these corrupt judges need to be removed from the supreme court bribes breaking your oath of office are illegal under the law
you were so close at the end when you suggested barret was only holding out because she was being pressured by the other justices that oppose the reversal of roe in fact its the inverse barret is suddenly changing and withholding her vite so get a better deal for herself from the other judges that want to reverse roe remember how much corrupt backdoor donations clarance thomas received and never reported how much you want to bet all those kickbacks happened during these secret court talks they dont let the public know about  corrupt at the highest levels  and the only thing holding it all together for so long was justice ginsberg keeping people honest
ginsberg should have retired during obamas presidency she was very selfish and now women are dying
why hate black conservatives thomas is probably the best supreme justice america has and if he went on a trip with a rich person so what there friends arent gonna be homeless where do you think the bidens were staying in nantucket 
kick out all christian judges no faith should be taken into account with these issues
"leaks of explosive political decisions are never accidental
leaks are a good way to gauge the likely response  by the public when officially announced
all good news decisions are announced on prime time tv  during prime viewing hours in a glare of publicity
all bad news is released at 1 minute to midnight on a saturday eveningpreferably during some or other catastrophic event earthquake or hurricane or mass shooting
carefully choreographed"
"rbg was a remarkable person who led a courageous and honest life and made huge strides for women and all humans 
  that said i wish she had decided to retire early in obamas second term"
pack the court
whoever leaked the decision was for sure someone affiliated with the federalist society and leonard leo the evidence of that is that leo had a party the night before it was released at his home in maine with a number of big players in the effort my money is on alito from the jump
democrats had 50 years to codify roe and decided it wasnt worth it i blame democrats for our liss
imagine having a supreme court the composition of which is dominated by liars
if decision was made based on culture change and religion headings views your reverting removing rights as what the british government did when the first colonists came here for your argument option would have be all allowing of people not history telling us this but human rights and civilization history its sad this pushed the nation backwards and looped people die from this stuff only hope and faith something restores the future brighter future forward as one nation
these maga gop justices lied under oath during their confirmation hearings remove them
great reporting by new york times reporters jodi kantor and adam liptak  so alito thomas and gorsuch were very excited to get their hands on that case not surprising  alito and thomas are the true enemies of women in america more so than the others  john roberts legacy will be tainted and he will be seen as a weak chief justice during his tenure the corruption of the court is what he will be remembered for
these people are called judgesha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
it is simple there is no complete sepatation of church and state you guys remember when trump posed with the bible this should tell the influence of the christian religion
sadly the ussc too often strikes me as the final means by which a minority view can be imposed on the majority this is not justice it is tyranny
"how roberts replaced scalia 
scalia told obama that obamacare was unconstitutional  obama started to look for a replacement   he interviewed roberts before scalias death   roberts agreed to uphold obamacare   roberts was easily blackmailed for illegally adopting irish children obama gave scalia one last chance when he flew on scalias plane with scalia to texas scalia again said no  obama then had scalia murdered "
they are like warwhat are they good fordo we really need a scotus its like they are gods can make laws that all have to abide by but they in turncan be bought by the highest bidder  dont have to be accountable to anyone it is said  no person is an islandwell these scotus are continents
attn women if you want your body to belong to you only vote blue  so we have say over our bodies i wonder  whats next  will they take
the supreme court has never been nonpartisan the law is always a reflection of the politics of the people and the supreme court will always reflect the politics of the judges on the bench how is that hard to understand there is no law independent of politics
republicans one and all republicans are all for personal responsibility and freedom unless we dont approve
the 6 justices pictured above are no less corrupt than a jim jordan its organized corruption in fact
every time you think the us cant be any more of a clown show they go and prove us wrong
its not about abortion its about imposing control over other people  its about taking away the rights of females  next will be the right of women to vote or the right of blacks to vote or the right of xxx  the movement is about removing the freedoms of the constitution away from the people of the governed just take as example the women in texas who could legally get an abortion due to one of the exception who was attacked by the attorney general of the state laws for the governed not for the elites
these judges are just like trumpa bunch of liars
delay to gain votes and change minds
barrett isnt even qualified to be a justice  ginsberg should have left when obama asked her to retire
wah wah wah them some tears there
wasnt it trump its not that hard to figure it out
the most bereft scotus money can buy
 703  why is justice samuel alito allowed to collude with bro dude kavanaugh about how they would vote on abortion rights  alito had already written the outline of how to challenge roe v wade why is he allowed to know how any other supreme court justice will vote
it doesnt look like its about politics and power  it is about politics power and most of all money  these people are easily bribed and they dont do anything to hide it  nothing can be done about it because the people that have been appointed have no morals  these are the absolute worst people in the world to appoint to lifetime positions where they have power over everyone
very telling that a bunch of old men demonstrate their power by deciding what women are allowed to do with their body
"the behavior of the right wing super majority of the supreme court of the united states has done more to undermine trust and respect in that institution since before the civil war
reform is long overdue"
their appointment should not have a political attachment
"your viewers are going to find out very soon that youve been lying to themyou know exactly whats going onand who you take your orders from

your whistleblowers have been saying this for a long time"
completely pointless clip
 222  we already know there was no debate on how to decide any challenge to roe vs wade  justice alito had already written the outline of how the supreme court would overturn abortion rights that has been public for years now but our news providers only talk about what is new
jodi was very good uncanny resemblance to tim roth in a wig though
no surprises that the religious bigots of the myopic regressive roberts scotus acted as such its who they are from now on when any dem in congress refers to cheeto mussolini he should do so as der führer
elito leaked it
i didnt need the recap i wish youd have cut right to the story
im not sure what is new news here it was pretty obvious why there was a leak and the whole investigation around it a sham is this just confirmation
"supreme court of chaos robs millions of pregnant women of civil rights by abandoning their sacred duty to protect citizens from unconstitutional state legislative action criminalizing health care
this is an autopsy trumputin and his cohorts in congress made this happen ripping the seams from the democracy of the united states"
they should be impeached instead of biden the took an oath and they stated that roe was precedent so they broke their oath why else take an oath to the constitution  id it written on toilet paper 
payback to trump for their appointments
the judges gave in to pressure what a shame for judges who should never let outside influence sway them
for the judge who uses the threat of changing her vote from one position to the complete opposite this is a political decision rather than a moral or legal one  the leak exposes this and exposes her immorality  obviously she feels no selfblame selfguilt nor selfdisapproval for her own actions regardless of whether the country criminalizes abortion or not  that is unsurprising since she was placed on the bench with the other two corporate lapdogs kavanaugh and gorsuch to go along with the billionaires house laborer thomas  thomas went ten years on the court without speaking a word  he was a monsanto corporate lawyer who decided over their deadly cases for american agriculture  now the situation is volatile because without abortion the population of unwanted children rises and they become the most likely ones to commit homicide  so homicide rates will skyrocket in fifteen to twenty years depending on the outcome of this case  of course corporate elites would prefer this to distract people from their money and asset collection
so ironic that justice ginsburg who refused to resign during obamas presidency and a pro choice supporter death caused this law to unravel
the fix was in corrupt supreme court
do not assume this is a change of heart by the various right leaning corrupt supreme judges this is a political move pure and simple the single most contentious issue that will swing many voters in the up and coming election is womens freedom to choose take this issue away and many voters may return to supporting trump a purely tactical decision
it is about politics and power not law and reason  the extreme court celebrates the fascist five
a great deal of discussion that ultimately changes nothing this is an illegitimate court purpose built for the intent of dismantling 80  years of socially progressive jurisprudence
the pill is not an abortion there is nothing but sperm swimming no viable anything and a man should never be able to decide women make up over half the population in america and the world equality must prevail
supreme corrupt court does not see women as equal humans to men thus they took away womens rights to healthcare and autonomy over their bodies and life decisions america is much more fascist than we were made to believe notorious rbg worked so hard to finally install womens right to choose and these maga fascists just decided to destroy peoples lives just for control purposes too much nasty religious people in politics that use their faith to suppress people that think differently
"you are praising her for voting no on hearing the the case are overthetop she knew it wasnt going to matter 
this was her attempting to set 
 boundaries amongst her coworkers  specifically her party members

kavanaugh was duplicitous at his hearing not a leap to see he would be more so behind closed doors"
"regardless of barretts original stance against taking the case the conservative justices overturned roe for dodd and now women have to travel over state lines for abortions  theyre probably proud of themselves believing theyre doing gods will

i just hope the child baring women of today keep eyes on who took away their right to choose and ability to terminate nonviable pregnancies"
"who in there right mind  would keep  these  67  far   right  judges  on  the  supreme court
as  im   not  an   american   but as   my  great great great grandfathers  work  which also included   numerous  works   including criminal law and procedure  
and on  education  and   the science of legislation etc             
his   philosophy   of law  and theory of   jurisprudenceetc
was   what  his  good  friend   your   benjamin   franklin  
took his  inspiring  models  from  for   drafting   
 the    american   constitution     
and  i   know  for  one   these  two  gentlemen  my  great greatgreat grandfather and  benjamin franklin  are  watching  over  america   now  saying   
what the  devil   are  these  people doing and  a few     words  thrown into their thoughts the nonsense  that  these  so  call  supreme court judges   are  trying  to  sell  you  all
is  disgusting and   corruptgreedy little blighters
cannot  wait  to  see  the  2024  democrats  win which  they  have  
and  take  all  three   executive   branches  and  then  they  will  sort   you  all out  
thank god 
you   judges  took  an  oath  to  uphold  the  law   not  to breach  and or  break it 
thank you  these are  my  humble opinions"
only in a banana republic you would expect judges to be appointed by the leading political party instead of a panel of experts sometimes the usa looks like one
another fake mainstream mockingbird news channel 
funny how certain supreme court justices whove used their federal jobs of being court employees that have enriched their and family bank accounts whove certain scj chosen to be knowling in the pocket of dark money influences and bribery by giving luxury vacations buying homes and vaction homes and paying for schooling for family education  and  certain actions of scj have continualy shown  that these certain scj are being corrupted and manipulated either thru blackmail attempts or finicial improvementsthe doj and irs need to do investigation for rico and false tax statements if hunter biden is being investigated by irs as private citizen than certainly by federal employee standards of received vaction vechiles homes education these certain sitting judges should also be investigated  in the end they are just federal employees and should be held to same standars as other employees actions codes and ethics across america
the most corrupt white house and doj in history
optics they waited a long time to ban abortion whats another few months
"justice barret has seven children who had the good fortune to be wanted and born into a welltodo family and i do know that the welltodo have existential problems of their own to deal with  
but not having the financial means to properly raise a child aint one of those problems
1 the supreme court justices should be at least subject to a limited term of civil service  since they are not elected but appointed
2 the justices should always have the everpresent precedent of financial needs in mind when a mother to be makes the decision to have or not to have an abortion based on her future economic ability to properly take care and be able to raise her child
3 in my personal opinion the us supreme court needs to have its buble bursted"
there are countries that separate all three branches of government  presidents are not allowed to involve themselves in installing anyone  legislators have no say in the other branches and the judicial are not appointed but investigated and screened by a body experts in democracy
the suprene court will ruin this country
scotus  the dictatorial court would be more appropriate  term limits should be mandatory  
senator susan collins should not be surprised at being deceived during the confirmation hearings of prospective justices any dismay she may have felt is pointless as the damage has already been done
this is so stupid amy barrett did not change her vote for any philosophical reasons only because voting to overturn roe v wade too soon makes her look bad
it is a major disappointment when those selected to ensure that others abide by the law and do the right thing are themselves unable to do the right thing
never again should the supreme court decide against the wishes of democrats they will be haunted attacked and slandered until the left influences the outcome to get their way americas long known glory downhill moving so far under these woke authoritarians
america continues walking meekly into arms of fascismf
scotus has no room to talk about breach of trust
two members of the supreme court were appointed because they said r v w was law  they wouldnt support it so shouldnt they be sacked for lying at their interview
before attempting to carry out their obvious agenda the honorable justices would do well to remember that we all know where their homes are
her point for changing her vote was to try to look less guilty  she was never gonna be persuaded  periodt there was no question
and what  this proves beyond a shadow of doubt is that the decisions of the scotus are strictly political sugar coated with a legalese spin
judgements should be based on the whims of the majority and not on the whims of a handful of mainly white male conservatives regarding womens health issues
yea america is on its way of becoming a not a free nation  slowly taking the rights of its citizens what the politicians should do is take the statue of liberty down what a joke
chris i guess you dont have to be objective
crooked clarence thomas has embarrassed himself and the court  it will never be the same  it has lost the respect of the nation
we need to stop allowing judges to come from the bias and completely corrupt federalist society who we know have a blatant agenda
brilliant jodi and adam  for your hard workexcellent jobthank you
we should all be ashamed of what has happened to the supreme court  corruption is destroying our country
this is why biden should load the supreme court now
their decision to overturn wasnt based on law it was based on their own  personal views espoused to their supporters down the years it was politics not law and that shows that the scotus is in practical terms corrupt
"women who voted republican for decades are to blame as well they couldnt wait to overturn roe 
its absurd watching the trumpers get excited about things they dont understand"
how can the whole usa be held in the hands of 9 people 
a justice who even threatens to change her vote based on a political perception shouldnt be trusted with a scotus position they are there to interpret the law not make it to favor their own priorities
the roberts court has abandoned precedent which will allow future courts to correct the rulings of this court
the democrats should never again approve a republican nominee justice if they hold a senate majority the duality of the gops handling of garlands nomination and barretts appointment is so appalling and has led to a sc that in no way represents the majority sentiment of over 300m americans theres no point the democrats acting with  decency and civility for future appointments in the face of this
an unhealthy leadership leads to an unhealthy populace
the federalist society knew very well amy would cave without much pressure in spite of her switching vote to hold off taking the case they went ahead anyway and therefore she will now be frowned upon as corrupt and rightly so  scotus is corrupted and ailito and thomas
i dont understand how can someone support killing unborn human beings
every one of those conservative justices lied under oath saying they would never change roe they all did the second they got a chance why we are allowing any judges to come from the federal society knowing they are corrupt and have a specific agendas  it should be common sense not to allow these people to even become judges they are bought and paid for political operatives and we appoint them to the highest positions and government with lifetime appointments
didnt this exact same thing happen the last time
judges for life  
supreme more like trash court
when those of you in the media continue to describe supreme court justices as accepting  gifts  when everyone watching knows that they are being bribed by harlan crowe and leonard leo they are bribes not gifts  how about the outcry from the media for these corrupt justices to resign how about the media asking where is doj fbi here is a thought how about someone in the media asking merrick garland how is it possible that the one person who has stolen more top secret and classified documents in our history still walks free the man who is the largest threat to our national security walks the streets free
just look at these untrustworthy faces they creep me out
republicans are waging a battle on women time to take off the gloves women best grow a pair time to shut the bedroom door no pssy for republicans shut the front dooron republicans
another wild conspiracy theory
for 50 years republicans argued that roe should be overturned because it was a states rights issue five seconds after roe was overturned they started pushing for a national abortion ban because now none of them believe it is a states rights issue
best sc money can buy
which justice does the vatican have a direct link to
"it is about politics     the conservative super majority only happened because of politics   
the investigation about kavanough was never thorough either    
alito does not want to follow moral rules about declaring benefits received  
its about politics  influence and corruption "
we all assume it was arrrogant a alito that let it out so proud of the decision he probably wrote immediately after perjoring himself over this issue to get on the bench he has just been waiting years for a case that gave him the chance to reverse roe
if ever there was a time to expand the court to 13 it is now this would have the real effect of restoring faith in the independence of the court and removing the corrupt and corrosive effect of the american heritage foundation that has hijacked our supreme court for good measure trumps corrupt nominations along with mr corruption himself  thomas should be impeached and removed from the bench now as in monday morning not a day later
"what is the purpose of the supreme court and how does it function

the purpose of the supreme court is to adjudicate conflicts and disputes between the states and to resolve petitions for redress of grievances when properly legislated laws are made by a properly assembled and operated legislature disproportionately affect or otherwise disenfranchise a state

this necessitates that the supreme court must be assembled by a consensus choice agreement between the states where every state participates by making a list fixed number of candidates from their own state and the aggregate list of candidates must be reduced to a pool of judges no less than 7 and no more than 9 for 5 judges to be selected by lot starting with the petitioner to hear and decide the dispute or grievance the states must be involved because they have agreed to abide by the decisions of the court for their grievances and those decisions are final not mutable meaning they cannot be changed or overturned by a later court

we tend to forget this fact today both in the assembly which is different than replacements for vacancies where the president is required to provide a list of nominees for the states to consider a number and required qualifications is determined by the states in the senate as part of their role of advice and consent and established by senate rules for their proceedings and the president too must be chosen by consensus choice with the same requirement for the states themselves to provide a list of all the candidates that will be considered for that purpose through their electors making the presidents lists of nominees also indirectly a choice of the states

here is where the supreme court was originally established by article ix clause 2 of the articles of confederation and the only difference established by the constitution of the united states is that the pool of judges will be continually seated during good behavior and the appointment of a chief justice to preside over the court proceedings but not participate in the those proceedings as one of the pool of justices everything else is the same including that all petitions must be made to congress as the last resort on appeal not directly to the court and congress is then required to ensure that the petition is properly adjudicated as required by the first amendment of the constitution of the united states

aixc2
the united states in congress assembled shall also be the last resort on appeal in all disputes and differences now subsisting or that hereafter may arise between two or more states concerning boundary jurisdiction or any other cause whatever which authority shall always be exercised in the manner following whenever the legislative or executive authority or lawful agent of any state in controversy with another shall present a petition to congress stating the matter in question and praying for a hearing notice thereof shall be given by order of congress to the legislative or executive authority of the other state in controversy and a day assigned for the appearance of the parties by their lawful agents who shall then be directed to appoint by joint consent commissioners or judges to constitute a court for hearing and determining the matter in question but if they cannot agree congress shall name three persons out of each of the united states and from the list of such persons each party shall alternately strike out one the petitioners beginning until the number shall be reduced to thirteen and from that number not less than seven nor more than nine names as congress shall direct shall in the presence of congress be drawn out by lot and the persons whose names shall be so drawn or any five of them shall be commissioners or judges to hear and finally determine the controversy so always as a major part of the judges who shall hear the cause shall agree in the determination and if either party shall neglect to attend at the day appointed without showing reasons which congress shall judge sufficient or being present shall refuse to strike the congress shall proceed to nominate three persons out of each state and the secretary of congress shall strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing and the judgment and sentence of the court to be appointed in the manner before prescribed shall be final and conclusive and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit to the authority of such court or to appear or defend their claim or cause the court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence or judgment which shall in like manner be final and decisive the judgment or sentence and other proceedings being in either case transmitted to congress and lodged among the acts of congress for the security of the parties concerned provided that every commissioner before he sits in judgment shall take an oath to be administered by one of the judges of the supreme or superior court of the state where the cause shall be tried well and truly to hear and determine the matter in question according to the best of his judgment without favour affection or hope of reward provided also that no state shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the united states"
"it was not very smart of the supreme court
now this political decision works against them their allies"
god forbid a woman should have the right to choose for herself afterall the bible tells man she belongs to him misogynistic bullsht no man will ever accept anyone telling him what he can and cannot do
fed up with most of the members of the supreme court they should all be investigated  all of them to prove they are not corrupt  trumps appointees are the worst   and thomashe needs to go away
"listen roe v wade never gave a woman the choice to have or not have an abortion never the way the decision reads gives the womans dr the athority to make the decision wether to terminate the pregnancy or not over a short time doctors would just go along with the womans choice not because she had the right but because it makes billions of dollars every year abortion isnt cheap and alot of money is made from the sale of the placenta etc ruth ginsburg states the decision should have gone back to the state of mississippi simply because some states are very liberal and some for example in the bible belt are very conservative 
the decision was never implemented correctly in the first place to bad"
so if im understanding beer boy wanted to lie to the public 
the reporter looked the part
will investigate this but the the corruption that happens what a joke have no faith in the supreme court anymore
there need to be term limits on sc judges this in it for life thing now with two relatively young federalists spells difficult times ahead i suspect
the republicans majority supreme court was created to make law those laws republicans elites wanted but r too unpopular for congress who can be voted out to pass wout losing or risking their seats american voters need to wake up weve had a republican supreme court for at least the past 150yrs which would not be possible if we were a democracy the republican supreme court is also created to overturn or weaken any dem policy that does manage to pass we saw the same thing around 19331970s when fdr and dems were passing the bills we needed given the great depression at first the republican supreme court was oberturning or weakening every bill fdr got passed until fdr who had large enough margins in congress threatened to expand the court only then did the republican supreme court moderated their viewsdecisions im not sure this farright supreme court would change wthreats even if they did dems deserve a turn to have the majority on the supreme court and majority among the entire judiciary we need to be electing more fatleft and left dems whenever possible we need a landslide election for a farleft dem president landslides presidential elections r the only election that result in more significant changes fdr a farleft dem won 4 landslide elections wdems winning the majority of local statestate legislatures and federal government minus the judiciary that was a clear message to all government officials that the voters wanted change and the change fdr was bringing we maintained fdr policies from 19331970s that all ended when voters foolishly fell for reagan a then farright republican wa landslide election weve been on reagan policies most of the time since 1980 its those republican policies that have brought us to where we r today as long as we elect enough gop candidates to either give the gop majority or to have divided government where when the minority of times dems did win majorities in the house senate and wh little significant changes occurrs bc dems in purple districts r concerned about losing their seats and we have divided government where about 50 want demprogressive policies and the other 50 want farright dictatorship aside from a landslide election of a fatleft dem we must get margins large enough to expand the court and carry that out which means the ppl have to apply massive pressure until its done
horrible reporting on the part of msnbc  chris hayes need to either go or return to journalism school  at the very least he needs to take notes from jodi kantor she was the only real journalist in that entire conversation
forced birth is a religious ideology and as such illegal as per the first amendment first sentence  all who voted in favor over overturning roe has violated their oath
"quarreling about words is worthless 

rejoice that your names are written in heaven luke 1020

keep reminding gods people of these things warn them before god against quarreling about words it is of no value and only ruins those who listen do your best to present yourself to god as one approved a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth avoid godless chatter because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly their teaching will spread like gangrene 2 timothy 21417

 what a friend we have in jesus 
by joseph m scriven 18201886

what a friend we have in jesus
all our sins and griefs to bear
what a privilege to carry
everything to god in prayer
o what peace we often forfeit
o what needless pain we bear
all because we do not carry
everything to god in prayer

have we trials and temptations
is there trouble anywhere
we should never be discouraged
take it to the lord in prayer
can we find a friend so faithful
who will all our sorrows share
jesus knows our every weakness
take it to the lord in prayer

are we weak and heavy laden
cumbered with a load of care
precious savior still our refuge
take it to the lord in prayer
do thy friends despise forsake thee
take it to the lord in prayer
in his arms hell take and shield thee
thou wilt find a solace there

 lord jesus god is love joy hope  peace "
shiny object what did trump do now
roberts corrupt supreme court that is the most activist court in the history of the us
the disingenuousness of alito is the most offensive of all we all remember how he was pointedly questioned about the status of roe during his confirmation and he kept saying that in his opinion it was a matter of firmly settled precedent his insincerity is breathtaking
the only reason roe was overturned is the far left and gen z either voted for trump or jill stein or stayed home to protest hillary and elected trump in 2016 and the crazy thing is they are doing it again in 2024
and all roberts is worried about is who leaked it ridiculous 
"thank you court
stoping murder
babies win"
amy has done so much for other women 
brittany watts and kate cox are what happens when womens reproductive health are decided by republican incels and wannabe commanders
the supreme court is nothing more than a political action committee go figure
"they will at least uphold the appeals court ruling on the abortion pill they will probably have 6 votes for that 
but its possible they will ban it completely theyll have 4 for sure alito thomas gorsuch and barrett"
supreme court justices  how dare someone act unethically now let me take this call from a rich friend giving me an rv free money and a luxury vacation
the power of this group is frightening and makes the usa look so corrupt and backward why would you allow anyone a lifetime appointment in such a body
"so you cant confirm that the leak was definitely alito


right got it"
i think all of the supreme court justices who stated that roe was established precedence indicated that they would not overturn roe during their confirmation hearing should be impeached
is the entire us experiment just potemkin scenery
they lied to  us amen
half of the justices lying under oath to get the job was a breach of trust
every justice who voted to overturn roevwade and stated it was accepted case law during their confirmation hearings should be impeached and removed since they lied under oath
im sorry how does justice exist in a forum where the decisions makers make decisions based on their own personal biases supreme court justices should be chosen on their ability to be impartial anything other than that is not justice
tho oscar go to judges of the supreme court 
i am a practicing catholic and a rabid pro choice woman  it is my choice  no one should interfere
my guess would be a clerk with principleswhich the court did not posess
could someone please tell me how a scotus judge can be allowed to work until she dies and apparently cant be thrown out
i think we should be really honest once for all this country is very much corrupt as any other countrylets stop this fantasy narrative according to which the usa is a great country
"well 
somebody in the court needs to be investigated that part is true"
"if the supreme court can reverse roe it can reverse anything no one should get used to their rights
 _ mary ziegler  the atlantic

democrats need to expand the size of the supreme court from 9 to 13 to break its 63 conservative majority hold  asap"
i really hope that you guys discuss that the reasoning was that the science had changed since the first decision come on be journalists
save you time nothing new useless
no surprise thomas is full steam ahead all those financial favours sounds like mafia bribing tactics from the 60s impeach him
if courts have right to abortion decision then we should have rights on how much the neighbor eats or drinks or wears its the same logic
"people in their right minds are lefties 
never vote republican againall the way"
the supreme court is staffed by politicians masquerading as judges its shameful its wrong it needs to be changed increase the number of judges to 12 like a jury in the past and give the chief justice a casting vote
supreme court nor politics have no place making a decision over a womens body  this is a decision between a woman and her doctor  the majority of people making such decision isold men senior citizens
my theory is that it was one of the conservative justices who leaked it to damp the outrage when the decision was to officially announced
"850 so without the leak the decision would have been favorable to women having rights to their body
i guess we know who messed it up "
call it what it is court of bribery the justices that are in there now was more a test on how much money is a chosen verdict cost edit also not the first time kavanaugh lied about doing something at a minimal morally wrong if not illegal in court
the supreme  court  is a  good  example  of our entire  country  being corrupt its about  politics  and power  not law and justice
"i think the biggest thing that we should not forget about these justices is that they lied    each under oath were specifically asked about roe vs wade  they all said that it was considered settled law  they said that knowing full well that they were lying they were intending to up end settled law  this turned the supreme court from a judicial body into a political one  yet no one wants to address the fact that basically they had committed pergery to get their jobs  and now we know they were given their jobs to do exactly that  they were chosen by the federalist society because they were known to be willing to lie in order to achieve the highestranking court in
 the land with the help of the federalist society
in my opinion this single act has discredited the whole institution  once you lie you can not ever be trusted
amy barrett is the worst of them because she professes christianity  the 10 commandments clearly state thou shalt not commit false witness  so she isnt even a true christian  she has lied before her god"
absolutely crazy for the nyt writer to ask the audience what is the meaning of barrett switching her vote with no answer isnt that your job as the reporter to find and deliver that answer
all trump nominations should be recalled
omg reporters interviewing reporters this is a story about a story seriously is this all we have left theres no real news anymore
the second the dobbs decision came out i lost all regard for the supreme court now when they come out with a ruling it means absolutely nothing to me june 24 2022 was the day the supreme court invalidated itself forever in my eyes if they can so easily see me as less than human then they think they can take whatever they want from me and quite frankly thats not a country i want to live in
the country is past the leak  this is another distraction by the sc
we cant have abortions in america who else will go to war and work crap jobs
"i wouldnt wish my life on anyone that is why i am pro choice if youre not responsible enough for kids you shouldnt have them
republicans have no plan to take care of anyone but themselves let alone all those children they want to force to life to serve them not god"
jodi kantor has a brilliant mind  omg
term limits on the supreme court
we all know  who  did it  supreme court justice  thomass
"i still cant forgive ginsberg for not getting off the stage when she should have i also cant forgive sandra day oconner for leaving when she didand she deeply regretted it as soon as she saw who her successor was alito 

regardless of the republican malfeasance in how they have refused to honor any ethics or precedents while stacking the court the liberal wing has had a coupe of epic own goals that have added 2 hard right wing justices that absolutely didnt need to be there"
a breach of trust was reversal of a law because of religious indoctrination
not only in america but in america poor free world
the conservativ supreme court scotuses have deceived the american citizens
we need to pack the court with ethical judges
leaders around the world are asking their citizens to raise their birth rates our government is forcing us to raise ours why
"corrupt scotus
doesnt know the constitution says freedom of
religion
no laws based on ones religious opinions are constitutional
when will the media say those words"
republican supreme court judges corrupt liars all
i hope they barrett least regrets her vote now i hope she gets down on her knees and prays fervently to her god to forgive her and i hope he doesnt
so nothing to do with we the people just a handful of old folks worried about what their co workers thinksmh
"this is the beginning of the end of scotus  they have declared their corruption and made their rulings illegitimate  they have made themselves nothing by the abuse of their power

even a powerful group can delegitimize their power and authority by abusing it  flagrant abuse of power and obvious corruption has a corrosive effect on the roots of the body politic  scotus may continue to exist in some form but they have destroyed the basis of their authority  which is not the constitution  but the citizens belief in the idea of the fairness and impartiality of scotus  the constitution is an important document  but all governments exist due to the consent of the people  once belief is destroyed and it is the inevitable corrosion of the power begins"
"the entire american system of judges being political is moronic  the british system has nonpolitical system for judges which is a million times better

people in the us cant get a fare trial because the political position of the judge decides whether someone will be found guilty and not whether someone has broken the law

what laws are should be decided by people who are elected not unelected like these judges this is undemogratic"
all this behind the scene politicking between just the justices show how little they consider or care about the purpose of their job like them being so concerned about public perception of themselves and when or how long they should take before taking any specific case and all this it doesnt serve their appointed position or the country
the current supreme court is illegitimate
i just want to thank the scotus because if it werent for this european countries especially france would not have thought of enshrining abortion rights in the constitution 
homeboy wearing the leather jacket has got a 5 oclock shadow then it spoke it is a pronoun look it upso now i must be respectful im sorry it 
todays scotus changing how america views the courtas supremely corrupt arrogant narcissistic and devoid of meaningful  consistent values
there is congressional testimony sam alito the fascist witch hunter general was the leak what did mark meadows burn what did donald j trump sell to whom
from president downwhy do we allow people over retirement age to be in positions of power
the last two justices will be held accountable long after the others are no longer defining law
corrupt
this is truly disgusting thomas acb kavanaugh ailito and roberts should be removed alone because of lying at their confirmation hearings and by taking bribes scotus justices are not above the law
scotus  corruption a bunch of people who wears black robes deciding the fate and rights of any woman her body her life her choice
supreme court wont vote for anything unless theres free trips and gifts or cash for them lol  hahaha
uncle thomas
put them on term limits and theyll know they can either be political hack with their short term rulings or true to be law if not which would be changed once their term ends and remembered in history as either political hacks or true justice of law 
the highest court in the land should not have the lowest ethical standards  senator sheldon whitehouse ri 
we arent a bunch of partisan hacks  amy coneybarrett during a speech at the university of louisvilles mcconnell center while standing next to the honoree mitch mcconnell
drop the trans commenters  really hard to watch  edit  rbg did this  zero respect for her selfishness
the supreme court has no ethics to follow so an investigation into ethics of the leak seems hypocritical to say the least
i dont understand christians being against abortion when the bible supports abortion
no one will ever convince me that conservatives are actual people with thoughts and feelings of their own
"every republican appointed justice should be in prison for perjury because they all said roe was law and they would not overturn it 
lying under oath is supposed to be a crime in america although this court and trump have proven lying to get power is the republican way"
i say that a crooked justice is a traitor  and should be treated accordingly
yo why does that guest look like a dude but dressed like a woman
disgusting beyond articulation
the court shouldnt back pedal on peoples rights
window of persuasion there doesnt appear to be any change of opinion to take away an existing right the nyt still playing both sideism
"the corruption in the supreme court is mind boggling
they have to drag the justices out of the court and fire them and disbar them"
i want a public accounting of how many abortions were purchased by every member of congress and donald trump  hypocrites
weak reporting  they know fullwell who leaked the decision  it was to make sure none of the conservative judges switched their votes  because theyd get death threats from their rabid supporters if they did
why is she trying to sugar coat acb stop trying to launder that ideologue
ruths body wasnt even cold
its up to the states to decide abortion abortion is not a constitutional right  so abortion it legalillegal depending what state you live in   whats the issue
ya ya ya blah blah blah everything is a bombshell or breaking news with all these criminals and yet nothing happens to them so why bother 
the us suoreme court is the most fraudulent group of reublican stormtroopers  god please add new justices to take the number of justices to 11 they lack any intellectual integrity or honesty  disgusting
so this is just proof of hypocrisy from the scotus by the entire right calling kb a political appointee they were just projecting what this court would become a political vehicle for unpopular legislation to pass the amount of hypocrisy from alito saying how democratic controlled states would not abide by his ruling while he allows gop control states to put up the middle finger to scotus decisions in the history books this court is going to be seen as both antiamerican and antidemocratic
the breach of trust was when these robed lying pigs said r vs w was settled case law but then overturned it its not the supreme court its the lying cheating hypocritical court
amy coneybarret was only concerned with her own legacy she is not less reprehensible than originally thought she was driven by self interest
as a woman with two daughters in their 20s i am very relieved that we do not live in america i feel desperately sorry for women who live in the gop states these talibanlike medieval states that dictate what women do with their bodies its 2023 for goodness sake
and who should we thank for the this mess trump  he put three judges on the court who made this nightmare happend
oh surprise the court that was stolen by the republicans under mitch by abusing the system of appointing justices then decided to impose their personal religious views on the american people while being corrupted at its core by billionaire influencers with similar religious views and the way they did that was even more corrupt and sinister
cavanaugh has resting punch me face
breach of trust is the court of liars
why no one just say 4 of these so call justices lied to congress and they lied to the people
and then people are blamed for being swept away by conspiracy theories this doesnt bode well because it injured women across the country and this very much damaged the court
chris used the word jurisprudence in the same sentence as supreme court lol
after the gop stole a scotus seat and five of the justices voted to overturn law they all acknowledged was settled law in their confirmation hearings i can only see scotus as a kangaroo court at this point  and then youve got thomass and alitos indiscretions and clear conflicts of interest as well  how can anyone respect this body at this point
i already read the nyt article where is the bombshelll about the leak there in the nyt report it even says that no one knows who leaked the report still
they scotus justices  are 100corrupt  because they know they are above the law and they have jobs for life  im starting to feel that dictators such as pukin for example are more trustworthy than american government officials  why you may ponder  because they are honest about their intentions to stay in power and keep control over their ppl no matter what they have to do  im not saying they are good or admirable by any stretch of the imagination but at least the citizens know whats going on in the minds of their leaders   american government on the other hand  is full of lying  cheating corrupt ppl who smile in our faces and stab us in our backs all while denying everything
when was the last time a conservative spoke without lying not in my lifetime and im 62
why cant those justices be impeached for lying under oath
is this journalist really trying to tell me that acb had a slight moment of self awareness even though that theocratic nightmare overturned roe anyway  thats super gross and disingenuous what do yall mean what is happening they were appointed ngs seat was full on stolen precisely exactly to overturn roe and duhhhh it was leaked by alitos dinner buddies to cement the vote duh it didnt do the dems any better to leak it just 6 weeks earlier either way it was before the midterm
the supreme court has been bought and those justices that accepted bribes should be in prison
"it has been so long since i heard anything on this srory and of course now it is being drowned out by the horror stories coming out ss the result of the overturning of roe vs wadebut i am glad that people are still looking into this there is clear evidence here that the ethics of the supreme court has be irreparably compromised the more we hear about this the deeper the rabbit hole goes 

the irony is if roberts had managed to push roe vs wade to 15 weeks we wouldnt be in this mess the right would still be trying to push back the date but wed all be naiive and complacent snd letting them continue to do it instead eeve got lindsey grahan saying well what about 15 weeks and were all like oh no we were willing to go for that but that wasnt good enough for you you had to have a total ban or nothing

honestly i dont know why the supreme court hasnt turned on itself yet i dont know how they can pretend to trust each other"
didnt this actually happen over a year ago
hey from what you are saying its almost as if the scotus judges are not quite honest  
amerca where they celebrate your tts hooters but they regulate your clts scotusss 
this is a kangaroo court anyway they all believe in the great white replacement theory
thank mitch mcconnell
ny timesgets it right every time thank you
ginsburg should have stepped down long before she did anyone with any sense knows she was not ruling in her last years definitely not the day she died but she was a democrat pawn and they used her vote however they chose trump picked out of a list provided to him so a group of people put a list of people they wanted and trump picked his choice of their list ginsburgs selfeshness to stay relevent hurt the democrats no one else the process and life moves on i find it ironic a woman is picked to be a supreme court mainly because she was black and a woman  becomes a justice and then for the first time in history of the country we have a leak
this is what happens when you dont have term limits and you dont have justice in the supreme court theyre bigger crooks than people on the streets but yet theyre allowed to stay there thomas should have been gone a long time along with many others who have been proven to be just as guilty as him
this is collusion political collusion these justices should be tried
oh the divisive left strange bedfellows like joe and kamala bill and hillary or dylan and bud light
i dont buy the argument that the new radical rightwing justices seriously considered going back on their oath to the federalist society cabal to overturn roe  it has been building to this for a very long time as the rightwing theocratic anticonstitutionalists that they are albeit that they claim to be strict constructionists observing plain meaning it was always clear that they could hardly wait for ginsberg to die  why else did they lie openly and operate corruptly during the selection process to get antiroe fundamentalist catholics on the court
double win for the right wing extremists the supreme court has lost all legitimacy as a fair arbiter which further damages democracy as well as making arbitrary undemocratic decisions
how can you have them for life this is why corruption grows in supreme court look at clemens 
our notsosupreme court full of corruption and injustice
if trump wins in 2024 there could very well be pressure for thomas to resign do he can be replaced with another young conservative judge
everybody has the right to lifeliberty and happinessexcept an innocentunborn child
rbg had just passed a health screening btw
leoall over this he is
any judge who uses their personal beliefs andor their political affiliation to make a judgment is not being impartial and should not be serving as a judge  we have too many on the court now that are doing just that and some are in the pockets of some wealthy people is that being ethical or having any integrity  i think it is time for some real changes in how they are selected and voted in and having some strict oversight over all their actions in fact the way things are now we need this for all our public servants and not have any political party involved  yes the supreme court justices are public servants
"i guess coney barrett and kavanaugh were reluctant to take the case up immediately since they had just recently testified that roe was established law during confirmation hearings just a few months earlier i guess they figured the public memory is very short but in this case the public still remembered they were lying during their confirmation 

just another in a long line of politicizing the supreme court under john roberts who stalled on partisan gerrymandering until wavering justice kennedy retired and gorsuch took the seat merrick garland should have had and they wonder why respect for the supreme court has plummeted under roberts hes the head of the judicial branch of the evangelical and corporate controlled republican party not a nonbiased judiciary that respects the constitution and decades old precedents confirmed over the years in judicial decisions and of course second guessing what the men who wrote the constitution intended which miraculously always ends up being what they want it to be as if james madison could envision civilian weapons capable of killing 20 people in one minute or that massive corporations would control taxes and limit the right of workers to exert power through assembling in unions originalism is one of the biggest cons the court has foisted on the public since the early 1900s"
no ore lies like the new york try imes
it sounds like they got even
if you have already taken a side on a case before its happened you dont deserve any official seat nor are you qualified to fill it
i think the supreme court judges should either ride a horse or pedal a bike 35 miles to work each day lets see how many of them want to stay after that
wimpy newsguy newstime
"they violated the rights of every woman and girl in the country
they violated their paths several lied under oath"
this is corrupt kangaroo court dems should get fill the courts with more judges to protect this country
oh yeah that leak to rupert murdoch
such a bunch of  weirdos on the supreme court get rid of the compromised weirdos
the abortion debate is not about right and wrong it is about cannon fodder and defense industry labor in 1973 we were done with war now war is in the offing
all i can say is i told you sothey just want to sort how to take rights away and this was just the beginningand yes they were waiting for her to die change laws and they were not going to be transparent with people in this countryand they never will bei guess i am amazed that you were shockedthis is a test run they will look at other rights
the justices arent so  just
bring back medhi
"so all 3 trump appointed justices are liars 
all 3 lied during their confirmation hearings"
why tf didnt she retire when she should have rbgs arrogance undid her good entirely and aided their evil shame
the current supreme court is one big breach of trust
supreme court must to stop biden to help isreals war
you know what was a breach of trust overturning roe v wade
its ok if trump becomes president there will be no supreme court because dictatorship dont need them
i wonder how many women have died through illegalback streetabortions since roe v wade was rescinded
the fact that a republican appointed judge to a supreme court already has an agenda on an issue like this is bulshit
the current court is illegitimate we all know it
its been pretty obvious to me from the beginning that alito or one of his staff leaked the draft to have exactly the effect that it caused ending any chance to change any votes
if you are going to allow abortion up to 151620 weeks there shouldnt be any restrictions at all  women past those dates needing abortion are for medical reasons  but men would never understand that
although they cannot expose who leaked  personally i suspect justice thomas or someone on his staff was the leak  but it was just a suspicion and we do not convict someone on suspicions
al franken said he believes it was samuel alito who leaked it to seal the votes ahead of the final voting just as suggested here and since they never found the one who leaked it this makes perfect sense
breach of trust more like an eye opener to the inner corruption and political orientation of the highest court and it s melding with  interests  forget precedent what rabbit hole is this country sinking into rights won rights taken
the only people who support the killing of the unborn are godless people
government has no say over the body of a pregnant woman but does have unlimited power over the body of everyone else   democrats
why dont we ever talk about the fact that trump acknowledged in a media interview in the 80s that hed paid for 3 abortions of girlfriends
"a breach of trust from a radical activist hack whos protecting corrupt sob repugnican operatives in the scotus
reich wingers are _so_ lucky hypocrisy isnt lethal"
conservatives will not be happy until they ruin our nation
when you fear integrity and accountability you are not the good guys
the religious right are trying to impose their religious beliefs on to the people of america separation of church and state
without hate or fear in your heart the republican party cant control you
the supreme court is disgusting and a joke  ive given up on our country  its hard for me to feel proud of my country anymore why does any count have a right to tell me what to do with my body my neighbor or friend is prolife and thats great but why should they decide for me their belief maybe i dont believe in their church of choice but should i be forced to go to their church because thats their belief
there is no honor or objectivity in the supreme court  its just another group of politicians
in  canada justices have a 25 year term limit and must retire at 75 just sayin
its no longer about justice and reason its about power this is our theocratic present with the gop dark money scotus
i honestly believe the gop was paid to tear their own country apart
"republicans are liars
these liars are imperial legislators masquerading as impartial judges"
roberts is a disgrace as chief justice  and hes too old to grow a pair
so am i understanding that during the preleak time that it was actually possible one of the conservatives may have been considering upholding the roe v wade decision if it was a private votedecision but the leak forced them to do what they were being pushed to do by upending it which seriously makes me question if it comes from one of the conservative judge group i got that with how the woman was talking through the video or im wrong and its still likely one of the progressive side that did it in hopes itd shame them in order to keep precedence i just dont see any true conservative beliefs in how that court handles it them and the republican party are trying to force a political viewstanceopinion that is gradually going away but use tactics and behavior that doesnt feel conservative or morally right that real conservatives speak of lots of that side are fakes who dont really believe in conservation or whatever they say recent example would be the moms for liberty group founder revealed to have done nonconservative bedroom activities theyre all hypocrites and liars
for some reason i can just imagine the justices looking in the mirror in the morning saying i am the law like judge dread
i mostly hate feminists but on this one even i cant disagree this is just pure misogyny absolutly disgusting these people are not christians
why exactly is this news a bombshell
ginsburg said years ago she truely believed that roe vs wade was in orrectly adjudicated and she believed it would eventially be overturned
i wish i had access to the article because i didnt follow this
cavanaugh  is a right wing zellot
scotus is bought and paid for  america is over
to me i think its obvious that ginni thomas is the leaker
they have destroyed an entire branch of government
 obviously they knew all along exactly what they intended to do each and everyone totally lied during their confirmation nice to know that the right wing justices on our highest court in the land are just simply liars  
this supreme court is illegitimate expanding the court is the only option
this is what it looks like  men want to take away womens rights
just wait until the bought and paid for supreme court gives the koch family all they ever wanted to destroy the us government once the corrupt justices rule that the us government can no longer regulate anything the country will grind to a halt
1 year delay doesnt seem like an evolution of the law it still very much feels political
turning women into secons class citizens is far more evil and enraging and horrible than who leaked the draft
"rbg was selfish obama was in the wh and should have had an appointee ginzberg had had many close calls and was obviously  working on fumes concerning her health yet she clung to power leaving us with barrett  
its difficult to get over her hubris her belief that only she could do it extending her time in the sun i was angry"
"impeach all republicans 
trump for prison 2024"
leaktimed release to the press to keep people distracted
scotus guaranteed a lifelong  job with power since 1789once a human gets power u find out what their all about everybody has a personal agenda i just cant believe that it took 234 years for the dirty laundry  to be revealedthe law of the landi hope the corrupt judges that have already been identified get  removed from the benchthere are terms for political offices  and so should there be terms of 2 4 or 6 yrs at the most  as a youth i constantly haunted my parents about the scotus setup and how could this be a part of a democratic society and i think i got my answer  not what we have been led to believe is all good please fight to save our freedom vte 
so they agreed with rbg that roe v wade was bad law and should be decided by states
abortion is murder point blank
the amount of comments supporting murdering innocent life is crazy evil 
thanks so much for doing this piece chris
"four of the conservative justices on scotus are proven liars
this court is  usas supreme arbiter of law
such is the ethical standard of  usa"
"roe roe roe your votes gently down a stream
merrily merrily merrily merrilyabortion rights were but a dream"
she also wrote decisions prior to her appointment that clearly show she supported anti abortion
this goes to show how desperate the labour party is
i thought this clickbait was about the scotus leak   nothing in this really focuses on the leak
imagine if american women were legally allowed to forego motherhood through abortion and adoption without being legally responsible yet american men are unable to legally forgo fatherhood without permission from women and are forced to be legally responsible double standards and female privilege are fun kids hands off womens bodies hands off mens bodies
too much power for too long with no controls leads to corruption
the labour party is looking for votes trying to rile up the womens  vote the labour party is lame and disgusting msnbc you are disgusting
this is sickening now that we are now hearing this how disgusting
"scotus 
 acting like theyre gods
the scotus is officially a partisan sectarian political institution that is strongly  almost totally bought and paid for by far far right corporate religious donors 

reverse all trump nominees because 1 trump has been impeached and stands charged with extremely serious crimes including fomenting an insurrection against the usa  capitol  newly elected biden government 

both brett kavanagh and amy barrett lied under oath  which surely is impeachable and warrants being sacked"
msnbc has no credibility 
the supreme fraud these court traitors are bought off by the koch brothers and other billionaire neo conservatives shame on them they need to be impeached convicted and ousted
and people wonder why conspiracy theories are so prevalent
should have been investigated yesterday is roberts trying to save facejust think they may be hearing trumps immunity claim this is very scary the decision was political period
inappropriate  sounds like a job for thomas
so much for basing any decisions on the law
typical nyt apologist
"enough bsnbc who freaking leaked the report why is this so hard
who leaked the report who leaked the report who leaked the report who leaked the report who leaked the report"
the supreme court is corrupt  how can we trust judges who cant be held accountable or punished in any way thomas along should be removed for working with billionaires
scotus best supreme court money can buy
those very white people will nit lije bsbies being left on thier door steps  let one of thoer daughters get pregnant  d and c  nice and legal 
imoit was intentionally leaked before the actual decision was announced to quell the potential backlash and unrest that would have occurred if was announced on a special report on tv
the supreme court and therefore the entire justice system is tainted and untrustworthy it is shocking how low the united states has fallen facts are arguments dont matter the supreme justices have already made up their minds they only want to get appointed in order to impose their will and turn women into forcedbirth wombs for the state
roberts is a  hayseed travesty of a justice
this sounds like a big nothing  an appeal was made by a state and the justices considered how to proceed  they tried to persuade one another  something that happens in most cases  as far as delaying the case and not telling this to the public this is up to them to decide  scotus will take up a case and decide it when they decide it nothing super unusual going on here
defund the supreme court they no longer represent justice
joe bidens hole family must stand trial
look at all the baby killers thristy for fetal blood in the comments sick satanic
if it was a liberal justice it would of 100 been reported to the press thats how you know who leaked it
the people who invoke the bible or buy bull as i call it in this debate cherry pick to extremes   and   it is usually men who decide about womens rights   yeah   not good
how old is this bombshell
the leak is a breach of trust but lying through your teeth about your intentions before the committee deciding if you should be appointed isnt a total breach of trust to the entire country
we have the votes now we just need to fill in the law
this is a what about is is im and no one give a flying fuxk about it  it should been at the state level always  full stop
the supreme court process in usa has zero to do with justice
"a nation divided amongst itself cannot standthis knowledge has been known since before biblical times

this is why the president is the man to encourage and foster  a united citizenry not to cause great chasms of hatred and separatism mixed in with bigotry racismfascism and fantasies of being the supreme leader         for life

we got what the electors wanted
again
what could go wrong has any discussion ever come up as to why those electors gave their votes to  bad orange impossible to believe they might just do it again
indictmentsfelonies cases on trial it seems none of this can stop a nihilistic scenario sure to take place
if current polls become reality"
who else thought they clicked on the wrong video 
how the politicians treated rbg after her death was nothing short of criminal
it was a predetermined verdict in search of a case
ok the stock market is now the highest ever and did not plummet like trump projected and biden created 14 million jobs more then the last 4 republican presidents together and oil production is far far higher then under trump still we need to support trump as trump is the only one who will join the russian alliance of russia iran cuba venezuela north korea and nicaragua we need to become close to these countries and stop our western alliances also only trump will support the top 1 incomes of the usa also women rights went out of hand
i feel these justices decided on their own religious beliefs and not on our constitutional rights  i feel in doing so they gave permission to states to become dictorial over women and caused pain and suffering to women who are being forced to carry unviable fetus and in some cases forced to surrender their own lives  they are threatening doctors to lose their licenses if they make decisions that are best for their patients    brett kavanaugh and amy c barrett have proven themselves untrustworthy because they said before our country they would not overturn laws that have already been established such as abortion  then president trump revealed he would use the supreme court to pass laws according to his voters religious beliefs instead of our constitutional freedoms   all three of these persons have proven to be untrustworthy as well as unconstitutional  this leak is important i feel the motive is to show how amy c barrett wanted to deceive the people by rejecting the case but knowing full well she would vote based on her own religious beliefs and not our constitutional rights  this leak proves how untrustworthy this conservative scotus is and even more important to point it out  due to the upcoming vote on whether a president is immune from criminal prosecution
"the supreme politicians of the united states presented the reversal of roe vs wade was an opinion based on reasoning that the court should not make the laws but only interpret them laws are the responsibility of the congress or the state this reasoning is a complete hypocrisy while qualified immunity is still being applied it was created by the supreme court and is used in states where no laws exist for or against if the court reverses roe it should also remove any use of qualified immunity where no state or federal laws are applied after all the court doesnt make laws
mg"
the supreme court is not relevant anymore they cant be trusted and should be disbarred
it was alito
amy barrett and clarence thomas are disgusting pieces of filth  cavanaugh also
"a key factor in trump getting the 2016 gop nomination was he agreed to stack scotus  this was pivotal in him gaining the nomination

this leak is motivated by many of the lawyers working in the court who respect the law above politics and are disgusted at the stacking of the court they see justice as being one eyed they have had enough  alito is not a judge he is an agent"
what is hard to understand its back to each individual state i dont really understand what everyone is so upset about if you want an abortion go to the state where its legal you dont have to broadcast to the world what youre doing im sure the abortionist wont tell most people want to vote on it we are a republic voting counts
there was no true window of persuasion the sc is corrupt and the hubris is outrageous
"we cant say for certain who leaked it but we know the deliberative process was at play and then the leak comes along and those efforts are hopeless 

so alito"
ahh yes justice barrett the hero for not wanting to take it earlier upon giving the optics that she might be considered to blame for the law of roe versus wade being rescinded so is this what msnbc is now  you guys now celebrate the mediocracy of politics
barrett only voted no because of political reasons at 1st the next term she would have been fine with it her no vote was just to make it look good shes no hero here
where does the judicial oversite committee stand where there is evidence of compromised justices being bought and sold which subjects the scotus to rule on matters based on personal emotion while withholding logic
unelected kings and queens with supreme power for life  does that should like democracy to you
maybe presidents who didnt win the popular vote shouldnt pick judges or remove the entire process from  partisanship 
this is a gross anomaly  it will be overturned  the only question is how long it will take
talibangelicals women are livestock in these peoples eyes
you know who leaked it  the same one that leaked last time  starts with an a
scotus is a corrupt institution a great country cannot remain great when the justice system is corrupt
its not about strategy its about the law something scotus has completely forgotten about
we just dont know heres some more worthless discussion on the fact that we just dont know
strange this woman claims she is able to read justices minds  get that woman a crystal ball
hmm did the leak come from the alito camp
the person who leaked this information is at least lacking integrity but more likely absolutely a criminal and got paid big bucks from biden admin and democrats  clear this absolutely benefited bidens corrupt administration
sure is interesting of him how all of the rightwing bot farms are targeting progressive channels and comment sections and youtube does nothing about it
murder has never been a  right
woman is not too smughuh knows it all another one 
any and every courts authority hinges on perception of its neutrality
this shows that the supreme court is now nothing but extremist conservative politics and not actual law and order this nation no longer has a system of law and order and once again its thanks to right wing republicans conservatism as its all about power grabbing and destroying democracy burning the constitution and setting up a russia style autocracy government under only right wing politics
political judges have lost all credibility the day is coming when they will be ignored and even pushed aside
all the scotus did was took roe v wade out of federal hands and handed it down to state by state laws
i got a question if we are over taxed under represented and cant choose our laws what is the point of that system we have reached a new low if justices are pocket judges
only trumps supreme court can fix this
blatantly political right wing justices who were hellbent on an outcome instead of following jurisprudenceand weve learned that john roberts is not up to the heft and import of his job
the supreme court has become as twisted and corrupt as the current gop and taking away our faith in justice the lunacy of the republican congress the maga cult is all based on lies trump has the record for more lies than any politician in americas history to see our country go down this path is disgraceful and aggravating lock trump up and shut him up
if some leftist clerk thought the leak would save roe    and the leak cemented the positionsthen that asshat shot themselves in the foot  the prolife side should thank them if they are ever caught
with the courtsroe decision the court lost even the pretense of being impartial  the court has become an extension of the republican party
omg  what a painful segment  why did this steal 10 minutes from my life  can i have my 10 minutes of life back  what is the point of all of this  who cares about the normal back and forth of decision making of the 9 most powerful people in america  they are judges they talk among themselves they have to discuss their opinions and the language that goes into it  what is the point what is the purpose of this
scotus  sick crooks  onanists theocrats  undeserving simpletons
msnbc is a domestic enemy collusion to highest treason
this is thanks to mitch and ruth for robbing obama of two more picks
whats the bombshell pat the it
the deck was stacked when wealth began to be concentrated scotus has been focusing on their grand theories  forgetting the lives of 90 of americans  the ones without money to pay for lawyers  donate to politicos
cant supreme court justices be impeached
overturning roe led to the open corruption today with thomas and alito  using deceit like this paved the way by introducing political considerations
blacks get the most abortions win win
abortion isnt a guaranteed right under the constitution and roe was poorly decided challenged by fetal recognition as human by lower courts especially in homicide prosecution increasing fetal viability during gestation further weakened roe abortion assigned to the people to decide under the tenth amendment with legislators answerable to constituents is best
we have fell into the mindset that killing our babies is a personal right this is an immoral way of thinking and it has been politicized where people dont even realize how it has marginalized to an extent to where they are playing god and that each fetus is a fleshand blood human and the act is murder stand in a mirror and tell yourself that you were once a fetus
"everyone forgets that there are 9 supreme court justices 5 were nominated by republican presidents and 4 were nominated by democrat presidents
the ruling was 6 to 3 with judge roberts voting against overturning roe v wade that made the vote 4 republican justices for and 1 against
where did the other 2 votes come from
roe v wade was overturned because 2 democrat appointed justices voted yes
everyone is blaming the wrong the wrong group it was overturned because the democrat justices voted yes to overturn it
wake up the democrats dont care about womens rights they only care about controlling power
think of how much money the democratic party has made pushing this issue"
impeach the whole supreme court and replace the with term limits and congress interview of appointees with a special election to be approved by the public we vote for the supreme court along with the president every 4 years they cant get any more corrupt
i love at 650 how jodi kantor says yeah i see what youre saying but heres another perspective
"great the right has  cheated to get in the court they have been taking bribes while on the court
now we hear that they dont care about law because they are more equal than  the 215000000000 people in the country who think abortion should be available"
so it probably alito who leaked it
why cant she tell us who leaked it  does she know who did  what happened to the republicans investigating relating to the leak
msnbc saves my political sanity confirmation bias sometimes sometimes not but my tribe 
theyre already corrupt might as well get paid for it
remember trump fault he put them in there he took our rights he is proud of it thank god i live in new jersey
we can only hope that their actions have caused irreparable damage to the uterus annexation party
"tools and fools total bs 

the supreme court was great when democrats held a majority how interesting and hypocritical"
dont complaint bring your rearend to voting booth
the sc is bought and corrupt af
we have no trust in the supreme court and the liars too
"the frog boiling in the pot
its always the fascists who tell you that nothing is wrong
always"
there are so many useful leftist idiots out there in the us i mean sad reality
i still on the fence with the newest judge and the leak judge jackson especially her being so liberal in her confirmation hearing still on the fence but i sway with jackson saying or talking about it with someone she knew would leak it out
"they had this thing in the bag
they were just waiting for the right moment to strike
 vote blue    "
dirty deeds and bad faith are just business as usual for the phonies on the religious right
i personally dont care anymore the democrats let this happen to raise money they could have prevented it and they refused just so they could uses it as a marketing slogan
after all these years we are finding out justice is not blind
cases are decided by powerful people behind the curtain
amy coney barrett said when questioned in the senate hearing for her nomination roe v wade is the law of the land i would not change that so she and kavanaugh lied which is illegal i thought
prolife people will never convince prochoice and vice versa never even if you could prove when life began prochoice people wont care there will never be all one way or all the other you either compromise or we keep going back and forth the supreme court was right until congress passes a federal law it is a states rights issue stop blaming conservative justices for basing law on the constitution that is their job and they ruled on the case before them not the hypothetical in their nomination hearings there neds to be a compromise on a federal level and put it to bed enough is enough msdnc stop acting as the moral authority you could not be more bigoted and biased
alito did it himself to torpedo the compromise breyer and roberts were lobbying for it also reminded me of how rbg undermined roe by hanging on when obama could have made an appointment had she stepped down
so if these hookers said they wouldnt reverse roe but now reversed that are they not impeachable
remember  justices serve  based on good behavior  justices are not guaranteed a lifetime appointment thats one reason why scotus dont want an ethics standard
is that a man or a woman
always remember that everyone who voted for trump in 2016 is responsible for this
"expell clarence tomass now
put him in prison now"
ginny thomas
just because something is immoral that doesnt mean we need a law for it
dont mistake pro birth and pro life two very different things
im going to send them a couple of bucks see if they will grant me immunity from speeding tickets
the most pitiful thing you will see on youtube these days is feeble old joe biden asking people to send him a few bucks for his reelection campaign the man is decomposing right before our eyes have his family no shame
remember no judge or attorney general ever took up trumps arguments regarding the stolen election  even the highest court took a knee shame on them  then they said he lost 57 attempts when none of them even looked at all the evidence
abortion is murder abolish all forms of murder
guess the supremes lack of ethics isnt a breach of the publics trust  
anything to distract people from the real issue of corporate dominance of society
over 60 million children murdered by abortion and these two are talking about politics
i think the supreme court needs to go
are their confirmation hearings done under oath   they all lied about the support of overturning roe   its settled law  i feel betrayed
"back when the first leak happened i said there were 13 more decisions than were written more than 3 years before acb was put on the sc
she wrote these decisions a decade ago to destroy rights in america

the person who leaked the 14 decisions installing a sharia law government and religious law they were very clear with the people that they gave copies

they told them when they could release the other decisions before they are handed out but there were other notes that she wrote about making sure they dont take away birth control before they have a majority in the house and senate and they have a republican president

the conspiracy is super clear in her notes that go back a decade

the big question is who got these files off her laptop

this has to be someone who had intimate access to her

most likely someone who was in her house a lot

i believe she knows for sure and i think the sc knows now who it is that got the files off her laptop
and it is a person in her inner circle and they did not know this person was not a true believer and they believe in freedom not religious law and is a traitor to her and the other half of the government who want sharia law and ban all birth control and make it a death penalty for anyone who is caught trying to get it

some day we will know who the leaker is and it may be one of her kids
or her husband"
is there anybody still trusting this fraudsters they are lawless and still have the power to do what they want why dont they chance the law in senat or congress  well wherever in us law is installed why are they not in prison the whole world knows they got paid for their ruling us us now a lawless nation what is it worth
the supreme failure
these new judges are money plants in the supreme court
while i certainly understand its a matter of contention i dont understand where its a right to end a life at its beginning   i personally have seen several times where abortion was used as a form of birth control there are dozens of forms of birth control abortion should not be one of them
roe v wade was decided based on policy preference not what is constitutional supposedly it was based in a right of medical privacy but homicide was never subject to 4th amendment protection its a shame that it took strategic planning and politics to allow a correct ruling it should have never taken 50 years
anybody with common sense will not vote for biden
joe biden is a war criminal
they should have this removed and put back as was as it only hurt republicans they have been losing to democrats like crazy ever since and even if trump gets to run he will never win because of this as long as abortion is not returned to as was trump and his gop will lose more and more power
"i dont want fake judges in the supreme court 
these are fake judges"
who is upholding the constitutional rights to ones person
how sad ruth bader ginsburg was replaced by the nutty amy coney barrett breaks my heart rbg was so brilliant
these judicial activists forget they hold neither the purse nor the sword vote organize focus locally but network scotus is like fiat currency its only as powerful as our confidence in it
who invited loki 
all three trump judges who were unethically installed swore under oath that roe was president
can you please stop using the term breaking news and bombshell report for regular news i love your content and i know you guys want clicks but i cant click every video every day expecting something epic
"brit here
the questionable justices sic have introduced an ethics code problem is it is like a shark with no teeth"
wow jody totally massaged the nuances out of this entire thing such an interesting piece well done
trump  the gop fascists corrupt everything they touch
msdnc doesnt know a bombshell from a can of ovaltine
"imagine him spouting about breach of trust
clown"
when the gears of our branches of government become so mired in self dealing they lose sight of the current ethos on an issue abortion and their position in every way departs from evidence based reality what they claim simply does not happen in the context they say and people know it they also know a judge deciding whats best for a womans health is farcical in every way we know this this will be the course correction thats needed coming from the people question is is it still possible given the gerrymandered state legislatures control of mapping and courts deliberately buttressing their arguments this will be pivotal fulcrum within these times of unimaginable consequences
how can they know any of this when the court and the justice system cant seem to find out who even leaked it
roe v wade was overturned in exchange for kamala harris being put into office
how can we even trust the supreme court i know i dont
there now teaching law at 1 of those ivy league schools imagine that
none of these hypocrites live their religion they only mouth it god is the supreme judge not the supreme court of the united states they dont give a crap about you after you get here unless you have money influence and power they all will have their day of judgment yippee
the court is a facade
its clear that the roberts court is corrupt and is not working for the american people we need to hold them to account and put in people who actually care about the well being of americans and not just those who bride them
the thieves oops sorry justices need to have a term limitsthe biggest thieve with the wife that helped to have trump retain power needs to go now
trust in the supreme courtnot any more
same crew who put those fake pipe bombs on january 5th  why wont they tell us
without abortion we are livestock who dont own their bodies ready to have the mark of a beast branded like cattle with fire yikes
i am so blown away as a woman you guys go for it but i know freedom have at it hands off my body and all those that of like minds peace be with you my friends we will get through this very strange time 
its a very sad day democrats number one issue is killing babies that baby is alive at conception if dems dont change they will have alot of innocent blood on their hands
none of their business rather it is a womans prerogative shame
has dumeecratic justice katangie finally figured out the definition of the word woman yet
the case before the the scotus  was not settled because they didnt hear it  previous orders are settled unless there is a new case to hear which there was
the most amazing thing is that people listen to you
god magic took rights away from womenwhat a joke
abortion is murdering a human being
this from the same people who consider corporations people its insane
everyone knows who the leak was why wont you say it
it cannot be a surprise to anyone that the decisions to take the case and the decision on the case to overturn rvw were political literally reverything we do in life is on some level political because we are choosing and making judgements all day every day weighing out what we believe what we think is right or wrong or what is the least bad or the most good with everything and those decisions are about our politics in the widest down to the narrowest definition rvw when it was first decided was a political choice made by supporters and detractors and scotus at the time there is no surprise here the real question is why are so many gop leaders and why is trump and why is does scotus appear to be so ready to make and force political choices that are not reflective of where most peoples choices are today what is driving them to make such bad political choices i really dont think the media has asked the question widely enough what role has the slow but progressive change in our climate played  what role did the pandemic play what role has over population played what role has the migration of peoples away from poor economies and authoritarian states played in the highly charged situation that the world and the us finds itself today are there other are there better choices and is there any ability to change the choices we seem driven to make the media simply needs to do a better job than they are doing by talking about trump 247365 when he is likely only a symptom of much larger problems that need to be addressed
so what does this mean exactly nothing can or will be done about it
america is tied of these liars all in the fascist republican party that is why america is going vero forevermore until the republican party is gone 
i dont understand how a supreme court appointment should ever be a life time appointment they should be removed if not ruling for the constitution or against the people of the united states i believe that the setting president should be able to send a removal to the senate just the same as an appointment
the law is made in your state
this is not rule of law  just rule of personal beliefs and faith  both religious and political
waitit looks like politics and power  hahahaha thats what it is
by trying not to appear political they make it obvious that they are political  time to expand the court
why the judicial system or even any branch of govt having any right to decide over your own health should never be the case
i never knew how that leak affected the conservative side but i knew that it benefited them many were screaming that the left was behind it but from the beginning i could only see it firmly influencing the decision to overturn
abortion is overused as a form of birth control
more reasons for democrats to unpack the extreme court that the federalist society spent 400m to pack
too many explosive bombshells this week
follow the money
we all have the right to deny medical treatment for ourselves   morally no one has the right to deny others of medical treatment
republicans your teaching yoiu children to lie
supreme court justices can be impeached by congress  we need to vote more democrats in so we can remove these who lied and who are being bought vacations house etc
the church bench that was called scotus will ruin our democracy and trash our constitution
i blame the democrats for not putting womens bodily autonomy immediately into law honour system in days of trump a fairy tale the shame is democrates who failed women in usa
seriously nothing but cuss words in my head yup the court is 1000 corrupt
ill never understand why they keep pursuing this poisoned pill gen z turned up in droves after the last time and helped turn what was supposed to be a red wave into a red sprinkle and historically abortion have always been popular but if it ends up costing republicans votes as it already has and hastens the death of that ghoulish party then so be it this will just force more people to vote which has historically been bad for republicans who havent pulled out a w on the peoples vote in 2 decades
the supreme court is corrupted to its core this is a dictatorship with no accountability to the law and the ability to change the law at will to suit their own belief system is the dictatorship ethos judges must be held to the higher court of a citizens review authority based on majority rule had that been in place over the year many of the attempts to deregulate corporations citizens united  and yes abortion rights would never have been accepted into our system of government in my opion yes opinion this started with the lewis powell appointment to congress in 1971 he is the infamous writer of what is most often called the lewis powell memo since then the court has systematically sided with corporations over the wellbeing and rights of the vast majority of american citizens hense here we are with even the middle class preceeding into homelessness and poverty due to a biased congress with the aid and comfort of the supreme court i think a civil oversight with authority to bring court decisions to the process of a national vote before institution would align the court more closely with the constitution
buy and sell  give me a break  they were bought
even ginsberg thought the original ruling was wrong
fortunately the recriminalization of abortion in canada through legislative andor judicial means will not see the light of day  evidently abortion has long remained a proverbial thirdrail of canadian politics
none of this information is new  this was reported when roe was overturned   this video was clickbait
"a conspiracy occurred to stack the court with activist conservatives federalistleonard leo lies under oath to congress etc
we the people have been deprived of our civil rights due to that conspiracy
conspiracy to deprive rights
people have died due to this conspiracy women denied abortion
there are laws against that with the most severe penalties allowed under the constitution  the corrupt court is not immune as the conspiracy occurred prior to their terms

amendment i gives us the right to opine"
i wonder how many times leonard leo was consulted
man i love when hayes has smart folks on his show this reporter was great
rbg should have stepped down when obama was in office there was way too much riding on an 87 year old woman
thank you jodi but man chris was trying to push his narrative
if womens abortion right is denied supreme court would act exactly the same with the devil china communist party which controls whether women can have babies and how many if allowed
i mean it was a double edge sword probably have a gop super majority in the house and senate if they hadnt 
"so whats happening with thomas and roberts again with their corruption


why havent we heard anymore updates about their shady deals while in public service"
this is soooo wrong
"keep religion out of politics 
keep politics out of religion 
or make the churches pay taxes
mike wont like that"
no matter what case  the fact that 5 unelected people can make the most momentous decisions is a flaw one of many in our justice system
the left wants  depopulation abortion poisoned food  poisoned water poisoned airwar   war war killing our young people war is money
notwithstanding the evisceration of roe v wade by the reactionary justices on the supremely political court of the united states roughly eighteen months ago these militant antichoicers will stop at absoutely nothing until they finall succeed in enshrining the patently odious concept of fetal personhood throughout the american political landscape  should this extraordinarily unfortunate situation ever become reality then the united states will definitely cease to the the land of the free and the home of the brave  believe it or not the enshrinement of fetal personhood throughout the american political landscape by these militant antichoicers would actually entail an outright ban on assistive reproduction technology including invitro fertilization
i fear learning just which supreme court roster was more corrupt and selfserving than this one tempting as it is to go by appearances we cant assume theyre the most corrupt and incompetent but perhaps it is critical to learn if not why this particular court is not the most corrupt and incompetent and shameless of supreme courts
it seems amazing that trump instinctively put the supreme court on his side  now the whole right is under his support very concerned as an oz very dangerous situation hard to change or stop them 
i think alito leaked the draft or engineered the leak to lock it down
liberalism is a mental disorder abortion is not a constitutional right the justices are correct its a state issues the feds have no right telling the country how to live
enough babbling what are we the people going to do about it
"people need to stop getting mad and vote voting results are why we have the current court we have voting is why roe was overturned voting is why you have republicans in states like texas who absolutely refuse to allow women to have autonomy over their own pregnancies 

all of the things you see happening are because of the ways people voted if trump didnt win the presidency you wouldnt now have a 63 majority conservative court which in turn not only struck down 50 years of settled law but went against the majority of the will of citizens in the us 

you have women in this country who keep voting for a republican party that historically over the past 50 plus years has been overwhelmingly antiwoman in its policies and legislative voting record but women keep voting against their own interest by voting republican

if you want something different than do something different if you want different legislation than vote differently and put different people in office"
she only voted no because of perception and timing otherwise she was all in
the shady judge looking into a leak is laughable
the court is as crooked as the administration that loaded it
america has defeated many enemies before and we have done so this time justice has prevailed
it was political
kangaroo court rendering the law without merit its only a matter of time when the law will be completely ignored and the people will refuse to acknowledge they have any import at all
the guy that retired is the obvious leader of this leak
the result of taking away peoples rights is _losing bigly in elections_ 
there has never been a consitutional right to anabortion  roe v wade was a lie
speaker johnson  a womans duty is to birth at least one taxpayer  its all about money and control period  they dont have a problem pulling the plug on life support from a beating heart
who dud it
i think they knew who leaked but wont say so because it would be devastating to trump and the republicans my guess it was ginni thomas who leaked it to steve bannon who deliberately published it on mothers day that is totally a bannon move he is radtrad catholic started the movement which holds that the current pope is not the true pope because he is too liberal a long time business partner of ginni thomas and thought mothers day was precisely when he should stick a dagger into all womens heart hes despicable
more lies from the new york times
we have the most corrupt supreme court in the history of the us alito and thomas should resign in disgrace for their failure to uphold the rule of law and the constitution they run over with impunity
you people are such zealots on the murder of innocent childrenastonishing
they didnt want to appear political the whole thing is political from blackmail threats of changing their vote to already have made a decision before ever hearing the arguments half the court also lied in their confirmation hearings no respect for any of these hacks
name one theocratic government that works anyone
false title again nothing to do with the leak
no more skydaddy in our justice system
"no selfrespecting woman should vote republican
same goes for men who care about their mothers daughters sisters nieces wives girlfriends as well"
democrats worried about palestinian children being killed but dont mind millions of unborn babies being torn from the womb things that make you go huh
uncle clarence has got to go
and the extreme dt appointed judges that vote against choice are the ones that dont want to fund welfare or food stamps maybe they should donate their millions to the women that have to raise their unwanted children
something about barrett i thijnk she might actually put her oath and the law before her personal opinions and beliefs and certainly before politics what i am saying here is i sense there is something in this woman that might be ethical after all we shall see
next they will ban birth control
i always suspected that it was one of the conservative justices or their staff who leaked the draft  they knew that would lock in the votes  yet we had fox news losing their minds claiming that it had to be one of the liberal justices
the supremely corrupt opinionated terrible unscrupulous sinnners
"but once the baby is born it has no rights to a good lifethese gentlemen dont care what happens to the newborn or child that is the mothers problem  no public funding not even a dialogue because its not politically convenient to say that now the country will need to support these babies for the next x years
birth control is also being taken off the table"
overturning roe is the equivalent of a declaration of war on american women we will not tolerate this the supreme courts power is founded entirely upon the good will of the populace they can make whatever decision they want  but we the people do not have to  cooperate by making decisions that are so diametrically opposed to the will of 80 of the people the court undermines its own power
isnt there a way to prosecute these supreme court justices or disbar them from office judge thomas and barret are clearly corrupt
"never forget who put them there

the gop"
it is about politics and power and certainly not about law and reason anymore so lets be real about that
looks likeit obviously is someone needs to hold them accountable this antiabortion bs is anticonstitutional
503 no that doesnt change a thing about how we think of her  she still voted to take away life saving health care  look at texas
using abortion as a means of birth control is as obscene as it gets and dont bother telling me that it doesnt happen
usually an abortion leak has a foul odor
long as its a republican around it will be turmoil
my money is still on ginny thomas as the leaker
calling these people justices is offensive a group of unjust corrupt politicians pretending to be judges
great  scotus is stuffed with lying jerks
i still believe some on our highest court are being blackmailed for that escort service in manhattan that muller investigated the steele dossier said several members of the gop and some high sitting judges were customers of this escort service i believe some are being blackmailed tump said he knew he would only put in judges he knew would overturn roe he wasnt wrong because he knew the dirt held on them everyone be out here covering their a
5  4  a super majority jodi please
"shes making decisions based on what the other justices do
how about making decisions based on what the _law says_
since that is her job and all
birth slavery _is_ slavery  its not legal here"
would politicians please quit practicing medicine  leave it to doctors and their patients
like oh wow surprise the two justices with the worst ethics who make the worst legal arguments are apparently the source of the leak for bad faith reasons shocker
wow surprise surprise not if ginsberg hadnt died i doubt that any of this would have happened or been passed she would have put her foot down and stopped it
the important part that everyone seems to skip is the fact that the justices minds were made up before they had even heard any evidence  what is the point of having a trial if no evidence you bring before them has any effect on the outcome its not a trial then its not justice they should throw out the ruling on those grounds
impeach and replace or stack up the stained court
alito or thomas is the leak that much is now painfully obvious
well if the american public continue to believe in supreme court to solve the law should by nfts and if the public doesnt believe its headed towards gilead
if that is not politics i dont know what is  supreme court must not play politics   supreme court must not have life terms    8 years is enough
"bombshell new report on the supreme courts abortion leak explicitly refuses to conjecture about who leaked the draft opinion

i like chris hayes but this is clickbait"
religion is wrong people its racist its sexist its evil there is no place for religious buffoonery in modern society
"you didnt have to give the leakers name  the only justice that would have a motive to leak this and force a vote to go along with this whether he wanted to or not  alito  forced this into the spotlight to cement this and make it happen  alito
was worried about kavanaughs vote   

the timing though thats too convenient  the election was less than 2 months away and as long as ruth was still around they couldnt do it  this whole thing smells  there are no coincidences  amy is in the wings and they needed her vote to make this work  this whole thing was orchestrated to appear coincidental and perfect timing"
it is amazing to people outside of america the justice system there is not about the law it is about politics
youve been sentenced to one night of rehabilitation
this supreme court is actually a religious tribunal theres no court to be found they create law to fit their christofascist beliefs and they twist facts to serve their religious agenda
the federalist society owns the supreme court x45 was just the clown that drove the bus
alito leaked the decision imo
30000 babies were saved since abortion roewat 
"i dont understand why roberts is so mad its almost like he thought the court had some sort of right to privacy and he should have been granted some sort of right to choose  if or when to release a document concerning the difficult decision to terminate a right that had already been created and was well established instead of some random person who somehow found out and made the decision for him

im so sorry justice roberts i have a great deal of sympathy for you this whole leak seems like a gross violation of trust i cant possibly imagine how you must feel"
rbg would have retired and let obama replace her but knowing the chosen one could not be beaten by trump rbg decided to retire after distillary was elected allowing the first woman president to replace her in an historic event sadly distillary lost and rbg bellied up while trump was president and for that i will always thank her
its not interesting that these activists politically one sided people   liers call themselves judges over the population on personal issues based upon someone religion overturning and retracting long established personal freedoms that evey other wealthy democratic nation defends   those are supreme ayatollahs not supreme court judges based in constitutional government
forget abortion scotus is going to take away our country when they say chump cant be tried
this is a bombshell msnbc  a politically stacked court go against presidency and remove human rights but one wanted to wait 3 months  they tok away rights from women in 2022 a bombshell would be that the right wing crooks on the bench all decide to resign because of the damage that they did to the court
half of the supreme court is fascist america
nothing new here  certainly not bombshell  its just a leftist theory  fake news again
barrett was likely playing judicial politics in tgst she knew the 4 votes were enough
ginsberg was the least corrupt
my vote is alito was the leaker
"corruption in current scotus can be ameliorated by setting an age limit of 70 years
so sick of old men destroying the lives of people who still have their own hair knees and teeth"
the supreme court judges are just corrupt career politicians with the title judge their ambition and greed has destroyed any integrity and sense of justice they once may have had
ok whats the overunder on kavanaugh being the impatient pissant who leaked
their decisions are leaked intentionally by them
sure the problem is who leaked the information not the corrupt justices that work for their oligarchs
sneaky corrupt judges
please get to the point of the title
the mind reels that a civilized democracy could even consider such medieval cruel misogynistic and barbaric behaviour as the banning of abortion i am 73 and my generation fought incredibly hard to have medically safe abortions become legal this reversal in the us is just mindblowing and so tragic for women so very grateful that i am canadian 
why do i get this weird impression that theyre suggesting amy coney barret leaked the draft
"this is one thing about the dems that ticks me off  they as far as i can tell arent doing anything to prevent it 
they have had numerous opportunities and options to fix this still waiting "
what this absolutely clarifies is that it was someone on the antiamerican religious right who chose to leak specifically to subvert a slightly more reasonable compromise  its hard for me to fathom why each and every justice isnt thoroughly investigated on a routine basis for clearly many are so thoroughly corrupt they have no business not being in prison  without true transparency there is no justice anyone who believes otherwise is dangerously delusional
this isnt fascinating as kantor puts it its just despicable partisanship and selfinterest those things arent fascinating theyre lizardbrained theyre low
dollars to donuts the leak came from a conservative justices staff thats why the investigation quietly went away without any information on who leaked it
818 bahh  they want that freedom they need that freedom  and when theyre gonna do something unthinkable they leak it
we investigated ourselves and we found we did nothing wrong
it was a political stance that had no bearing on whether or not she would vote to strike down roe v wade it was all about keeping up appearances they lied to get their positions and theyll lie to keep the people satisfied to keep them there
abortion leak
every situation should be looked at individually not all cramned into one abortion bill or law
austin powers    its a man baby   lol     
im so glad that the justices were not on the court when i had my ectopic and lost the embryo from the uterus i would be dead and unable to care for my seven yo i had an emergency ultrasound and then emergency surgery that night i was having pain so i was able to take blood tests on sunday  for pregnancy but level low indicated ectopic likely pain starts becoming more intense on monday ultrasound and emergency surgery this is how fast things can evolve thank god that i was an rn and know the ropes i believe in choice and medical emergencies do happen these decisions are made between a doctor and his patients
omg have them finding out the truth about the supreme court that is not in the public interest and move along there is nothing to see here says the un biased justices who dont want things they do in private and their richpecial  friends to be known to the public
when your supreme court is bent a countrys not in trouble its in crisis
"no one is above the law

exceptions expotuss scotus judges the richyup no one"
women now have to turn to lawmakers to make decisions about their healthcare i guess we should seek legal advice from doctors
soooootrump set the tone
they didnt care what case it was they took they were just waiting to overturn roe and took whichever one came along
they couldnt wait till rbg died corruption  runs  rampant in that court i never thought i would distrust the supreme court  of the us  im 75 years old i worry for my grand and great grang childern
"with the 932 comments already posted i find it fascinating that almost none of them discuss what hates and ms kantor are talking aboutbecause it was fascinating was everything involving justice acb smoke and mirrors what was the motive of the individual who leaked the document was there always going to be a 54 majority no one seems to be talking about these things

rather most of the comments are a woman should have a right to choose and vote biden 2024 if you want democracy and the supreme court is corrupt all things that fall on the probablytodefinitely true spectrum but most of which misses a lot of the points made in the above video"
rbg should have retired when obama was in the wh and they had the senate
i cant understand how corrupt judges make these kinda decisions
once again the word bombshell is overused in social media jodi kantor gave us some interesting information from behind the scenes but it wasnt a bombshell with the majority right wing justices this was going to happen
perjury trials for scotus that lied during their confirmation hearings saying that roe was established precedent liars under oath there are penalties for that
"i dont understand why democrats let religious fanatics talk about abortion on their terms
it isnt about the rights of fetuses it is a religious christian evangelical fundamentalist view on women designed to control their sexuality and essentially making them second class citizens
if it was about minimizing number of abortions mandatory vasectomy on all males of age would be a far less intrusive or dangerous way to go
forced birth and the loss of bodily autonomy is basically criminalizing  female sexuality"
is this interview a joke
its not a consrervitive super majority its a privately owned by leonard leo as tool to bypass the democratic process  this is direct attack on the us constitution
it was ginni
pro choice is pro life life of the mother life of children after they are born
as the republicans racist as a were prevented the first black president in american history from sitting a supreme court justice because what he was black or half black then they let dogs a trump have the supreme court they said when obama tried to fill the supreme court you cant its too close to an election and we have to let the people decide they feel ruth bader ginsburg seat while before her body was even cold which was a very stark difference from the year and a half obama had to wait to not be able to see the supreme court justice
supreme court judges should be on term limits periodt
the last 3 trump appointed justices all told congress that they felt that roe was established case law they lied simple as that
deciding the law guided by political expediency  exactly what supreme court justices are required to be above
"ms kantor is already a great journalist and i look forward to all her future endeavors

oh yeah and alito leaked his own draft the pos"
policians shouldnt be making medical decisions
they dont even look judicial look like they have an ulterior motive to men
"can someone at least explain why the leak cemented votes like if im a supreme justice i control the rest of the story i write the endorsements why feign disapproval for 3 months

this is the kinda crap which seems dismissal in coincidence when it first comes out but becomes a national embarrassment in 20 years once theyve made life altering rulings without any consequence"
makes me think about the same person that suggested to our former president that it was a good idea to appoint fake electors to overturn the decision they didnt like from the voters
news flash roe has publicly said shes pro life
if scotus justices are allowed to lie under oath during their confirmations why would you expect better from regular folk and politicians
we dont need supreme court at all all this 6 of them involved either the money and they have to make decisions for all american people shut the door
the satanic left gets furious when people try to stop their sacrificing
this should be the topic of an expose film and soon
samuel alito was the leaker this twisted mans hatred of women is so intense that he leaked this document and people need to stop dancing around it and him he took a victory lap and spat in all of our faces he tells us every day that he is untouchable and we cant stop him democrats need complete control of the senate to remove that man from the bench
trump needs to be made ineligible for the presidency hes a criminal
like trump the conservative justices  are liars everyone of them is for sale
thank you chris i appreciate your clarity and evidence of the values that you uphold
"filth that doesnt work for the american people


absolutely disgusting"
clearly overturning roe v wade also highlighted why americas founding fathers never even considered allowing women to vote
a great trip mick  so good to see behind the helmet so to speak   nice
we are two completely different countries that are trying to be one we need to let these republican states exist on their own they wouldnt want that though  because most of the government assistance money comes from liberal states tired of these christian psychos forcing their delusions onto us
well complicated my two simple cents seems after the leak they saved face for the hard right not a way to adjudicate the law of the land
love this supreme court
the havoc the supreme court unleashed on women is despicable and please stay out of womens healthcare
it should be prochoice and antichoice
blackmail
pro choice here but it is hard to see how the 14th amendment implied the right to abortion  we wasted 50 years when we should have passed legislation permitting abortion  but we couldnt even get the equal rights amendment ratified and that was as spicy as rice pudding
they should realize that if trump is re elected he wont need any of them
the scotus is a breach of trust the entire court is corupt
overturning roe was one of the stupidest things the right has ever done not only did they galvanize left they handed the left a winning platform on a golden platter
they all lied about changing president  they need to be removed for lying
the way you all  journalists express yourselves with the wrong words fascinating position  the barett  and then hayes making a statement its faaascinating lalalaaa chris it is apalling
the great thing about banning abortions it nullifies qualified immunity you cant have female cops on the force with protections not afforded to them under the constitution or the supreme court how is a female cop going to face her accuser in the court of law when thats also her baby daddy
you do know jeffery epstein lawyer became a judge and was the one who signed off on mar a largo search if not then your not paying attention
why dont they ever have arguenents about how to prevent conception why are all the arguements about what to do after the woman conceives
they lied in their conformation hearings commitimng perjury in the senate and should be removed
the supreme court now is only about politics and not about the constitution
this has nothing to do with the constitution it is simply about fulfilling a minority political agenda
and people wonder why trump succeeded and why hes going to succeed again this video tell all its a sham they seem to be against trump but are fully supporting him disgusting on all fronts
i always think alito himself may have leaked it
theyre appallingly evil
well the satanic church supports abortion kinda tell you all you need to know about it
it is politics even when the court is right this court makes it decisions out of donor ownership loyalty
this isnt a country its a criminal enterprise
this was over a year ago u think
its good that the supreme court banned abortion because now i can have tons of kids
how can this court be trusted  bet the court  will rule that 45 has immunity
bombshell  u told me nothing  what a scam 
elevating trump led to 3 more saltine supremacists on the supreme court
my takeaway from this is that decisions regarding what constitutes ethical conduct are more realistic when made privately rather than publicly
the source of that leak has been obvious ever since it happened
democrats appoint a woman to the court that doesnt know what a woman is and have the audacity to complain about decisions made concerning women their cognitive dissonance is on full display
geees you lazy people they sent it to the states which means  you cant have a say so in what the law says and does do your friggin jobs and call your elected  officals and hild them responsible they work for you not the other way around
this is exactly why scotus has become a joke many conservative justices were bought by billionaires and sold their votes long ago is it any surprise that scotus rulings are being scorned and ignored these justices have lost our respect because they didnt have any respect for the positions they hold or the bench they sit on we need scotus reforms now 13 justices to match 13 federal courts set term limits impeach thomas and alito finally vote blue
there were 3 breaches of trust when 3 supreme court justices said under oath that roe v wade was established precedent and no intention to overturn
take that liberal idiots
trump campaigned that he would pick judges that would overturn roe liberals stayed home in 2016 and gave them  3 judges the liberal government had complete control and didnt codify anything in 2020 22 because they believed lying judges when they said they wouldnt overturn the decision  we then get the leak and people still didnt believe they would do it now here we are with abortion banned all across the us and liberals are once again thinking about doing a protest vote in 2024 against biden mark my words if people stay home and trump wins they would find a way to make the ban a federal law
"she needs the cover for the scrotus investigations that should be conducted

she  voted with the fascist trumpalodyte party and the bought and paid for justices

they groomed these cases with the fascist federalist society
"
even the infamous rbg said roe v wade was judicial gymnastics and wondered why it has been challenged in court before then
please end abortion 
stop minority religious cults from enslaving women
ah so democrat hate supreme court the constitution who wouls have know
if the justices on the supreme court think that abortion is wrong then they should not get one  period
omg the supreme court had a abortion
this court needs to be investigated and corrupt justices need to go how do we action this
brings on a trans guy as an expert on how women feel  how about stop killing babies
its as simple as it getspeople like this just want to pretend they are gods
vote people into the house and senate who will vote to have accountability for justices why am i held to a more unfair system of justice than our scotus
the republican justices on the supreme court lied to get on the court and lied when they did end of story 
advice to chris stop laughing through important points youre trying to make its reminiscent of carlsons hysterical cackle
time for biden to pack the courts and outnumber the criminal corrupt maggat theocrats
justice coney barrett is as culpable every supreme court justice who overturned a womans right health care i dont care how you want to rewrite history the end result is women are secondclass citizens and the supreme court justices are at fault
both bought and stolen court not living by a thing they say we need term limits yesterday
seems to me that this is an ethical situation didnt scotus just adopt a new code of conduct guess we will have a front row seat as we watch the justices investigate themselves for unethical behavior because waiting for your coworker to die seems pretty unethical and even more unethical is the suggestion to operate on secret decisions without the american people knowing thats not just unethical thats deplorable and scary 
this is a poor excuse  to test what to test what to experiment with humans lives  ef supreme court
so which one of them is the rat thats what everybody wants to know
biden also needs to appoint a judge asap dont let the republicans play the games they did last time saying we cant appoint a judge during an election year tired of their crap
it is about politics and power that is what scotus has become
oh yes leaking their corruption is a breach of trust republicans really do have no bottom that they wont drop to in order to show how vile they are
bombshell i thought brett may have had an abortion or something
alito did it  makes me a little sick that he was chomping at the bit to take away womens right to control their own bodies
they are the worst ever
at a minimum all trump judges need to be expelled as soon as orange turd is convicted
wow of course the overturning of roe did help to get people out to vote and may have worked against the republicans
justices lied to congress when they said roe v wade was settled law
i like how we still pretend that we dont know which side leaked it roberts still working on that eh
good people dont lie and do not try to control females i dont see the freedom gop claims they support
when was the leak again cause thats how long late you are getting this news out there it was clarence thomas was the lake 90 the other 10 is one of the other conservative justices i knew like within a couple weeks that was a conservative justice probably within one week that was a conservative within four or five its thomas
the republican supreme court is ruled by large financial institutions and wealthy donors instead of evaluating based on the will of the people
this lady  jodi kantor talks with a natural delay as if the audiovideo is not calibrated correctly but it is  off topic yes fascinating yes
the problem is the political appointment of judges and justices a better system would be promotion on merit within the department
deciding not to take the case based on how it will look is saying  it doesnt have anything to do with law  it presents as we want to do this but dont want to look eager to do it  that is a politicized court  not lawful
"dont like abortions dont have one 

dont push your pro life views on others unless you also support other causes with the same fervor 

those causes
childcare healthcare prenatal health education prison reform police reform voting rights food security environmental protections limits to corporate power and influence not sending troops to die for profit"
christian natiolism wonin the making behind the scenes for the past 2 decadesand everyone fell asleep
im with chris barrett voting no first go round was personal coverage she hasnt given anyone anything to think about when it comes to her alito thomas kavanaugh and barrett all lied during their interviews regular people get fired for jive like that depending on the severity and their lies fall under sever
only white males will have rights
this guys is a great liberal partisan
roberts has failed as the chief justice and needs to be removed from his position by congress every federal group constitutionally overseen by congress is in a state of failure every one changing presidents every four years has stopped working so maybe its time to change the way congress functions
there is no more justice and freedom in america now all are controlled by corrupted people
maybe im not hearing this right from this nyt reporter _blah blah blah_  what difference does it make
curse the court
"i said when it was released a conservative judge did this
they knew that released in june the anger would be felt at the polls in nov but released in february the people will have some other noise to distract their attention and by nov the affects on the election were the pink trickle instead of a blue wave that may have occurred if it had been released under normal court calendar schedules
"
remember this when you vote in 2024 the orange con man nominated these bozos
they still could have changed their votes after the vote
poor little trumpies 
could have thought of a better video title
its so sad that those justices had their privacy violated
who cares
part of what we need to remember says the kantor thanking chris
dont say abortion leak could have chosen better phrasing
wouldnt it be nice to be completely untouchable and knowing you can be for the rest of your life corruption unmatched in any society
why does no one acknowledge that ruth bader ginsberg was highly critical of how roe v wade was decided
why do the majority of the supreme court justices  ignore the seperation of church and state in the constitution  
roberts is concerned with his reputation than the country and the legal traditions they are supposed to uphold
there is no trust in the justices of scotus 
another trumpazee justice that isnt a trumpazee
i am very impressed by jodi kantor as an investigative journalistintelligent sophisticated and nuanced reporting on this story having said that i am convinced justice alito most likely instigated the leak
listen to you snowflakes crying you want to about feeling a law lets talk about 1618 the constitutionin its original format dred scott the savagery of the south after they lost the war and implemented jim crow cry me a river i know the real reason they want to ban abortion dr frances cress welsing
i dont feel any different about amy coney barrett because she just didnt want it to look as bad on her because she knew just like the other 2 trump nominated that regardless of the lies they told in their hearings they were always going to overturn roe she just didnt want it to be so soon because she is a chicken 
i pray that they are seeing what they caused
lets look at this pragmatically  what was the real effect of barrets deny nothing its all theater
so the chief orange justice worries about the leak not the consequences of his decision on the lives of americans  these orange activist judges need to be impeached asap
lol freedom of faith or religion and freedom from religion or anothers faith no law shall be made that violates ones own faith of beliefs or religion to be anothers same faith of belief or religion that goes against the others own faith of belief or religion
theres nothing supreme about any of them
"so much for the legitimacy of the supreme court 

biden needs to pack the court too much power in too few hands hands we cannot trust that cling to power for far too long"
"theyll be coming after everyones rights best wake up and smell the cocos
the goverment and the courts have no business in peoples medical care and they certainly have no business in peoples bedrooms they have no business saying who people can and cant love
enough is enough with these clowns"
scotus is ruled by a group of individuals that lied to get their positions are blatantly political and the most corrupt group of justices in the history of america  it is time for the lifetime appointment to be removed and that several of the current scotus justices be charged for their own illegal practices
"supreme court doesnt care about people they just care about who is president

that is why it was overturned in the first place

not to mention we have very large corruption of the supreme court judges"
i knew it
this country is totally effed up my body my choice
remember republican majority put roe v wade into place to begin with  if they try to tell you its some evil leftist thing theyre fighting this fact alone makes it obvious it has nothing to do with saving babies  if that were the case theyd be talking about how to curb gun violence in the house instead of going on about public urination the lefts war on gas stoves hunter bidens laptop etc
i never thought they waited the minute ginsburg died i knew we were doomed
unfortunately there are only a couple of justices that will simply apply the law then you have the balance interested in using their power for money and favorthis court needs to be dismantled with interims until such time this can be rectified period
most constitutional juris prudence experts say that the scotus to include all courts grant a hold while the legal aspects are being sorted out the conservative justices took 10 minutes to decree an opinion
i have no trust nor respect for the supreme court taking money and expenses gifts from millionaire and billionaire is wrong the court is tainted
this court is a joke they are in it for themselves
"the overturning of roe shows a failing of the senate in the confirmations of the newest justices all three were asked if they would overturn roe v wade and all three evaded the question and replied that it was settled law and instead of pressing for an actual answer the senate allowed that answer to stand all three of the newest justices should have been pushed until they replied with a real answer 
the senate dropped the ball"
he did it alito spilled the information
"abortion on demand 
no questions asked"
this is further proof that the roman catholic scotus is not independent and is not to be trusted
alito was the leaker a criminal in robes
so what are we supposed to do if the highest court in the land is morally corrupt
"coneybarrett belongs to an extremist charismatic christian group people of praise

pop is verifiably and creepily out of step with sane american values survivors stories illustrate the horror any sane adult would feel at the usurpation of selfdetermination

buck the patriarchy"
the lying nine
the us supreme court is illegitimate
nothing will happen to these traitor justices  
the leaker didnt commit any crimes
"so there is no bombshell its just what we already knew it was likely leaked by a conservative judge like alito to force the others into line the new judges were only concerned that it looked bad for them personally because like only 5 minutes ago they were swearing under oath they considered roe settled law who would have thought that a political organisation grooming and promoting judges for appointment to the court could make the court look political when the organisation that put them there openly states the the reason they are being promoted 
america is a backsliding democracy and it didnt have a great one to begin with"
sc justices are there to decide issues of law not to plot to make law that is usurping congress not to mention an abuse of power
it can look like politics and power  yes because that is exactly what it is about
trumps supreme court are they bright people who are just oblivious to the pandoras box theyve opened or are they just not very brightperiod trumps supreme courtwhat a winner arent we blessed
we need to win house and senate and oval office so we can add to the court
sorry to interrupt i would like to ask question why are we not talking about how the third party candidates are hurting the biden administration for reelection and the reason trump will be again a president dictator is because of third party candidates that are taking away the vote and have no chance zero chance of winning they should own up bow out after supporters to vote for biden otherwise well we know the outcome and that is trumpets victor
"liar liar liar kavanagh is american destruction 
"
when king trump appeals everything up to the supreme corrupt court he will get away with everything if theres no precedent then anything can be changed
who and how much were they paid to bring death and poverty to american women
to even have the thought that the supreme court majority are total scum and mostly corrupt is saddening
trump leads biden by 17 points thank you demoncrats for making america great again
just want to point out that these ghouls literally started looking for a conservative replacement for rbg before her body was even cold and by literally i mean literally
sheldon whitehouse has been sounding the alt on the supreme court that billionaires bought
the conservative majority is corrupt   bought and paid for by leonard leo and the far right billionaires whose dark money funds the gop
my money say kavanagh or thomas leaked
yeah but heres the real kicker they both thought trump was gonna still be in office
"weighing the pros and cons of when to hear roe is the pinnacle of acting political
these religious zealots are dangerous and a total threat to democracy and the constitution"
7 of 9 are catholics   the justice system in this country is getting highjacked by jesus
jodis not gonna burn her sources but the report makes it pretty obvious that the leak was from the forced birth contingent to shut down internal debate  which i believed from the beginning  no wonder roberts has shut his piehole about it after yammering on about an investigation lol
all but 2 of these losers should be cleaning toilets in jail cell
justice ginsburg let her own accolades and ego get in the way and wound up defeating the very cause she dedicated her life to  i hate it too  but its the truth
"as a us army veteran and christian i could never understand how conservitives and christians think they have the right to shove thier beliefs down the throats of others who have different beliefs its not christlike behavior
    its pretty simple if your against abortion then dont get or have one no one is forcing anyone to get an abortion but stripping that right to away from others who have different beliefs is wrong
  we are a nation of many different people with many different types of belief and no one form of belief is superior to anyone elsesjust different 
 it seems the conservitives and fundamental christians seem to have more in common with the talibanbelieve my way or else
freedomchoice"
term limits please
the meaning is nothing her vote to not take the case on was purely because she had just testified that roe was settled law and her voting to not take up the case means nothing at all when she then went and voted to overturn roe   just typical two faced lying from right wingers
three daughters vote blue
ginny thomas was the leaker
it was a shocking decision for the conservative sc justices to overturn r v w but no one should have been shocked we knew that the list of recommended sc justice nominees submitted to trump when he was president was a list compiled by the federalist society the federalist society was only going to include on the list nominees that had already pledged to overturn r v w you didnt pass muster and make the list if there was any doubt about how you would rule regarding r v w it didnt take much to imagine that trump in his one on ones with nominees demanded they pledge to him that they would overturn r v wit was a personal promise they had to make to become one of the trump nominees there should never have been any doubt that r v w was going to be overturnedthat was the deal
the ones who promised to never try and overturn roe vs wade during their hearings and then did so should be charged with purgery
click bait
i know shes a hero but rbg didnt do the country any favor by not retiring when her health was getting bad  so obama could have appointed her successor  now thanks to her decision were stuck with a corrupt rightwing extremist court that frequently serves political power grabbing by the gop  not whats honest and best for the american people under the constitution
republicans will never win another presidential election thanks to the overturning of roe vs wade
precedent is just thrown out the window nothing existed before the revolution
so much for precedent and the word of the supreme court  justices
the court made the correct ruling we should all celebrating the wonderful caring ruling that shows we as a country are not selfish but that we value life
so republicans claimed it was the libs that leaked it to help their casebut it was the conservatives that knew it would end persuasion or compromise
i remember thinking in high school that the us supreme court justices must be such great human beings to have made it to positions so incredibly important i thought so highly of them sad how wrong i was
im grateful someone spoke up   these judges think they can do what they want without consequences or accountability this is the problem in america today
the united states supreme kangaroo court
i am done with the men on the court they hate me and want to control me done how do we remove them now
"no trust in this court at all no ethics and full political 

term limits with stronger standards or codes than the lower courts to start immediately"
even the judges at the hague only get 9 year terms  these clowns get lifetime gigs
breach of trust describes the supreme court against the american people
i dont believe those conservatives justice thought twice about over turning roe they dont care vote blue  2024
if it was a right it could not be taken away  roe v wade was a mere privilege and was taken away women have less rights than a corpse
they want to go back to medieval times suffering is not the only option we have modern medical science now
"she looks like tim roth 
this all goes back to billionaire money running everything"
after alito makes his reasoning i hold no faith in his judgement
time to impeach these judges or change law from lifetime appointments to time limit
the corruption court
most of them cant fathom what it is for a woman to have one so why should they even have a say
"they want to overthrow row vs wade but dont want the bad rep of being the ones doing it and failing at it 

pretty sure theyd be the most hated judges if that happened both by their own supporters and their oppositions"
im sorry but i cant help feeling angry at ginsburg this partly due to her selfishness
awesome we love your bombshell reports dnbc and msnbc we keep waiting for bombshell follow up reports  but never see them would this be called spinning perhaps or just plain propaganda
"the bible is neither antiabortion nor prolife but does provide a biblical basis for the real motivation behind the antiabortion religious crusade hatred of women the bible is antiwoman blaming women for sin demanding subservience mandating a slavemaster relationship to men and demonstrating contempt and lack of compassion i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee gen 316 what selfrespecting woman today would submit willingly to such tyranny

the antiabortion position does not demonstrate love for humanity or compassion for real human beings world health organization estimates maternal deaths at 500000 a year with at least one in five stemming from unsafe illegal abortions thousands more are hurt and maimed from illegal or selfinduced abortions unwanted pregnancies and complications from multiple pregnancies are a leading killer of women why do antiabortionists want north american women to join these ghastly mortality statistics every day around the world more than 40000 people mostly children die from starvation or malnutrition we must protect and cherish the right to life of the alreadyborn"
how much more bs does americans needbiden need to expand sc and stop the destruction of democracy
stare decisis is dead because of this decision a court with right wing liars touting established stare decisis before congress then obliterating it first chance they got liars of the supreme court
"selfrighteous red robed rethuglican justices with religious indoctrination rob women of their inherent rights because theyre misogynists if men could get pregnant decisions about their bodies would be private and unquestioned

the abortionwaropen borderdont know which bathroom to use party is still big mad about this  
the supreme court is absolute trash all that trash needs to be removed
time to ban viagra n have men vote blue have 60 senators n codify roe
the breach of trust was 3 nominees that blatantly lied to get a job that demands honesty
funny how every institution that the left does not control is broken and needs to be fixed
it has ruined lives in oklahoma womens healthcare has ceased to exist the all white mostly male republican state legislators wrote and passed the strictest abortion ban in the nation obstetricians and gynocologists have fled the state ivf and fertility programs closed iuds and tubal ligations are illegal gov kevin stitt appointed a task force to monitor all pregnant women from conception through giving birth doctors are required to give the task force information on all their pregnant patients any pregnancy that does not end in a live birth is investigated starting with the woman her doctors her family and friends all social media texts emails and cell phone conversations will be searched vehicle license plate tracking history will be used to determine where she went during the alleged pregnancy  the state supreme court issued a decision that abortions are legal if the doctor determines the womans life is in danger the state legislators are thinking about it in the meantime they are working on a complete ban of all contraception most woman arent getting obstetric or gynocological healthcare theyre going to general surgeons for hysterectomies physicians assistants for ovarian cysts urgent care for prenatal care and ers to deliver babies one hospital er no longer treat pregnant women fearing legal liabilities most woman arent getting pap smears or pelvic exams and if they think theyre pregnant theyre terrified woman are suffering mortality rates for woman and infants will soar in oklahoma  its only going to get worse 
lord help us especially all the ladies the justices of the high courts are corrupt
completely corrupt court  bought and paid for
when will it be called corruption  until the media uses the proper english the way we the normal people do the effects of the maga are being normalized
how can the same country go to the moon and  create a corrupt supreme court
i wonder how much it cost to get roe v wade turned back the best justice money can buy
the sc is wrong in that voters know anyway media as sucks
trusttrusttrustfrom this supreme courtr u  kidding wth
jodi didnt come here to play games
not sure thats the breach of trust to be concerned about here
they got paid to over turn roe vs wade
who cares about a leak about something you were about to immediately do anyway
justice kavanaugh should be nowhere near the law because he has no idea what an entails or how to interpret it clarence thomas is completely corrupt and alito lives in the 19th century
rbg is with gf now
maybe they should ban viagra if pregnancy is gods will so  is limp   
every child thats ever been aborted could have been the next albert einstein cured cancer or just the common cold or even developed a warp drive that would give us the ability to reach other stars and solar systems in a matter of days instead of millions of years  imo the left is literally destroying our future from within the womb
youtube has censored again and again and again
be interesting see these corrupt judges experience some post birth abortion to themselves
"youtube has censored again and again and againthe following
youtube has censored again and again and againthe following
youtube has censored again and again and againthe following
cult continuous cowardice
cult of continuous criminality
cult of continuous corruption
cult of continuous sedition
cult of continuous treason 
cult of continuous terrorism
cult of continuous antiamericanism"
"the process of appointing judges needs solid rules that cant be impacted the way mitch mcconnell did he stopped obamas nominee from june and held it until trump was in office the following january  then forced trumps final nominee through congress in september of 2020 before trump was ousted thats the first crime against americans  then even though they all declared the roe v wade setteled law they went back on their constitutional requirements and readjudicated it according to their religious beliefs  
now who can i take breach of trust to for a hearing if the 1 court in the land can toss out the separation of church and state  weve lost the core of americas founding your religion is yours to practice as long as it doesnt encroach on my religious freedoms they are placing one religion above all others which is why we succeeded from great britain in the first place"
the meaning is she didnt want to appear like she was anti abortion  and she lied in her confirmation hearing
all the justices that voted to strike roe down lied in their confirmation hearings
"maga is to the republican what nazism was to the german 
absolutely no difference whatsoever"
"youtube has censored again and again and againthe following

cult continuous cowardice
cult of continuous criminality
cult of continuous corruption
cult of continuous sedition
cult of continuous treason 
cult of continuous terrorism
cult of continuous antiamericanism"
bottom line its political and disgusting
the supreme court is about politics and not justice
mccarthy cult goldwater cult nixon cult ford cult reagan cult its a cult it has always been a cult just slightly different packaging
amy barrett is a lowlife fake she and that other drunk that got appointed its time to change those lifetime appointments they should have to run every 4 years like the rest of the politicians and there needs to be term limits on all politicians the choice to have a bunch of kids is hers not everyone else she is a fake christian too she doesnt have the right to bring her personal views into politics
a breach of trust to the women of america shame on them do these unqualified justices now see what happens when they let the states take care of it women are usable to get the care they need because wrinkled assed old white men know more than the doctors shame on the last three for lying america now in some states are worse than third world countries i dont care if amy had 17 children she was part of destroying healthcare for women who have no power shame on them
next up take away womens right to vote courtesy of this supreme court
more political bs by desperate joe bidens lovers
so what im hearing is that 9 adults have their internal meeting notes exposed to the public and they all decide that means they have to immediately freeze their decisionmaking ability that they just cant continue as though that leak never happened that they cant say yeah well thats a draft and its not a done deal and theres no guarantee that were going to do that its a work in progress what kind of spineless idiots are on that court
every time this happens every time
that court is corrupt
just imagine america what our supreme court will become if another republican gets elected president in the next two or three presidential elections they will be ruling against the will of most americans for the next two generations at least vote blue across the board this is not time for those who love american democracy to lose focus
why is it surprising that kavanaugh is a weasel
scotus gronk shag mlor breer bos clon and the other cavemen in the group are certainly america back hundreds of years
very interesting great job
these people arent prolife theyre probirth once a child is born they dont care what happens to it
we knew most of this already we knew that alito himself leaked the decision to cement and consolidate it
i am absolutely dry heaving sickened
the whole supreme court is a breach of trust
fixed terms that have to be renewed
everyone knows it was alito he is pretty stupid to think we dont know it was him because he did it before
when it comes to standing legal precedent which roe has stood for 50 years completely unchallenged and the fact that a number of yet to be appointed justices cited roe as being firmly established makes a mockery of them
this scotus is morally corrupt  illegitimate
see it supreme kurt did that turnover roe v wade before the public it a leak from supreme court and the wealthy paid them also 
i dont think a thinking feeling fetus should be aborted a woman doesnt need 15 weeks to decide she wants an abortion 15 weeks is a compromise not a banning of abortion
americans preach about freedom and yet its being stripped away but hey brother we got guns   freedom woo
impeach the court then eliminate the republican traitors
i love the message we are all supposed to take away is leaking info bad and most of the comments are talking about how corrupt these justices are the people have spoken and the government doesnt care
they will all go down in history as the most corrupt bench of our life time
strongly supports the speculation that alito leaked it to freeze in the win  not only unethical with regard to taking favors  apparently the rot is much deeper
"term limits  expand the court now
the only answer at this point
the supreme court has lost all integrity now
corrupted beyond belief
thomas needs removed without question"
how do we the people change this there needs to be term limits
it would be interesting if barrett has a pregnancy where she needs to get an abortion
its not like people have any confidence in the supreme court
meanwhile thomas is bought and paid for by harley crow and other rich white men
these folks on scotus all said they considered roe settled law in order to get seatedconfirmed by senate this is not just about politics and power but about one side who believes the rule of law only applies to the weak or naive i am disgusted kavanaugh barrett thomas etc should be impeached and removed merrick garland deserved seated instead of gorsuch
ill never understand america they protect your right to carry guns but not autonomy over your own body you can take away a life to protect your own if its  with a gun but not a medical procedure law and religion are supposed to be separate
when are republicans and  scotus going to repeal a womans right to vote
"how many leaks is this
leak"
"finally all things are coming to light 
hopefully we all will be more prepared to fight fascism everything ends in the same point fascism love for power narcisism evil its going it always come back unless we do not allow to happen again"
we knew all along that alito leaked the draft to cement the votes for his handmaids fantasy world
but why who is the real winner
trumps republican fascist party including trumps republican scotus agenda is  control oppression and power          antidemocracy  antifreedom of choice
this is one of many reasons why i dont and wont trust  the supreme court of injustice
the decision whether or not to have an abortion should be left between a woman  and her medical professionals and everyone else needs to mind their own gd business an embryos potential right to life should never outweigh the mothers  very real right to life
delay delay delay sounds like the court uses the tactic similar to 45 for political persuasion
chief roberts is like the policeman who blames you for possessing valuables when reporting a robbery
click bait  bombshell  nothing here  distraction from bidens failing presidentcyvote republican no matter what or who 
it was never a case to judge it was a done deal political stance waiting for a case as an excuse
so embarrassing our country is run by people that believe in an invisible man in the sky or at least pretend to 
"alito bragged to his fans
so they leaked it
i think we already know this
these justices need to keep their traps shut if they dont want leaks
how dare roberts"
sure thing we will never know alito did it
"biden was extremely naive not to expand the supreme court
especially if it ends up costing americans their lives as it might easily do"
this talibangelical scotus are all so frikin corrupt and were stuck with them for 40 more years unless by some miracle dems have control of the senate and presidency when alito and clarence kick the bucket
if the changes look like bribery politics and power  watch the pelican brief we need at lease three of those now
the leakers name rhymes with tinny ghomas   
kudos to the level minded nyt journalist who is not trying to push an agenda chris hayes is just pushing that terroristic dem agenda
the supremely corrupt court
future justices of the supreme court should be elected by a straight national vote like the president  taking politicians out of the selection process is vital if the supreme court is to regain credibility
theyre going against the majority of citizens get out of our bodys corrupt court
so the only thing this reporting really reveals is that justices kavanaugh and barrett wanted to hide scotuss decided plans about overturning roe v wade from the public for a period of time in order to make the courts action  which was blatantly political and about power  look less like its political and about power did i miss anything
i dont think its that much of a mystery amy cohen barrett changed her yes to a no on taking the case on simply because the end result would be the same it only takes 4 justices to take a case she wouldve been the 5th and she thought why dirty my hands on this decision when at the end of the day i can say im distancing myself from it and still get the result i want which is to overturn roe
"biden job approval

33  pew research  nov 27  dec 3"
that whole thing was setup and we americans lose
harlan crow and his billions are obviously the 10th and 11th members of our lying corrupt supreme court
"there is nothing more dangerous to the united states or womens rights than christian nationalism

religion ruins everything"
911 jordans king hussein killed 25000  palestinians in 11 days  1980  and it was none other than pakistans general muhammad ziaulhaq then a brigadier who helped king hussein carry out the massacre of 25000 palestinians in what is now known as black september of 1980 102
why dont you guys go back to our british way of having judges where its just a job they cant have a political bias  and they can be fired thats why you never hear of corrupt british judges because theres no incentive to  be corrupt
hmmm anyone looking at 3rd party commission reimbursements aka slush fund payments to any of the justices
lefters are crazy for abortion
its sad to think that a life in progress especially a human life where there is thought and feeling would be snuffed i just cant stomach this but i dont know that it should be banned because of the implications to the expectant mother especially the dangers  of botched illegal  abortions as well as  the unwanted hardship on the woman many women regret getting an abortion there should be more support for women who want to keep their baby
"the arrogance of ginsberg is unforgivable  she should have relinquished her seat knowing how old and ill she was  instead she stayed knowing she had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana  peel  i despise her
term limits"
history decent timeline  rehash conclusions nothingburger  the last time laws went backwards like this we ended up with jim crow and now we have jim roe
trumpy did so much damage to this country
thanks to youtube for explaining what an abortion is
if the law of the land can be interpreted differently depending on the religious indoctrination and delusions of the interpreter then the law of the land is worthless
i said all along a republicanconservative judge or staffer leaked it to push and force the other fencesitting conservative judges roberts and now astonishingly barrett  they leaked it so the conservatives would stand firm  disgusting so much for being nonpolitical
i know you do not have to reveal your source my guess you have no source to protect in house hit piece
wow   the supreme court tries to take this case after a justices passing   that is a new level of being scum
its such a shame that all these people including dodgy gop colluded in such corruption
moscow mitch and his stolen seat rbg not retiring and letting obama replace here now handmaids tale here we come
it was about politics all about politics
so creepy the way corrupt scotus always smile in those photos
we definitely need a third party in this country
i know she was extremely popular smart insightful and wise with her opinions but rbg should have retired during a time when she could have been replaced with a fair and balanced justice  i feel like she gave her seat away to the conservatives and here we are now
misleading headline  there is no bombshell of newly discovered information like who did it
enough with the bombshells already from all news networks especially fox news
some of these justices said they would uphold roe v wade and then didnt why should we trust the ones who lied with a pure interpretation of any us law 
aint that a shame
well either way americans want abortion access and it will return men are just salty seeing women surpass them across the board  just work harder men
breach of trust  exposing the internal corruption
better the supreme court is a kangaroo court with carpetbagger judges with one black
if only rbg in her 90s let obama replace her we wouldnt be here thanks for that
abortion is more complicated now because of science we can see when the baby develops a heartbeat its not an issue of christian morality the being is a life
i am baffled by the hypocrisy of gods country core feeling
unbelievable that these selfish superstitious shameful idiots were ever allowed to take away womens rights
ginny thomas
biden 2024  lock them all up disgraceful thanks chris great reporting as always
roe roe roe your vote  
my opinion is that they took a gambit and it is going to take them all down in my opinion the case is not yet settled
"trump for prison 2024 
most corrupt supreme court in modern times 5 slanted republicans lied to we the people"
they r worrying about the leak when they should b worrying about how a rotten bunch they r
as i said 3 days ago cue the scotus chief justice roberts court messing up again with women of america enraging said women to the voting booths next november as his scotus did for midterm votes go ahead make all women even madder roberts et billionaires
old news
i thought she was a guy  until she spoke
amazing always vote blue  
"crotu must consult with leonard leo to determine how they will rule
how long before they rule that women are no longer people but property"
there was a huge bombshell of information thats just been exposed  i wonder why msnbc continues the propaganda instead of honest journalism
barrack obama hillary clinton and the republican establishment wanted merrick garland to replace antonin scalia which is what would have happened if hillary won 2016
as a woman i am prolife however  i support and respect my sisters right to choose why judges and politicians feel the need to push their personal beliefs on others is beyond me integrity is a thing of past
the supreme court is a breach of trust
im sure it was gini thomas
the  pro life  agenda is based on religious beliefs     seperation of church and state is clearly stated in our constitution    its time to rigidly enforce this and get religion out of our courts and government  
the supreme court is a kangaroo court in disgust
killing rowe vs wade was all about politics not law  after that it is all about politics now making up stuff out of thin air
how grouse these unsuprime court judges are they should be impeached asap 
why bring this news the deed has already been done
face it america  your toptier justice circuit is as bent as a bad penny
people had to be asleep to not know what was happening with the supreme court this is exactly what the republican party was working on starting with ronald reagan
just released a male staffer of a democrat senator was filmed getting plowed in the butt in the senate hearing room this is not a joke
gop on the way to the dust bin of history have never done anything for anybody never will 
our supreme court seems to be corrupt but what do we expect from a court that says a well regulated militia is every person in this country i dont think i can take them seriously as my moral compass these are not people i admire or want to follow
009  lets avoid mentioning trust particularly in light of clarences blatant disregard for ethical standards we failed to see any investigations into clarences immoral behavior
the sp court is such a disgrace
13 of the court was chosen by a president who did not win the popular vote
they have zero credibility none the only saving grace is its bringing together we the people all the suffering this has created for women is unnecessary  and  pathetic
can they be impeached the whole group of congress people republican senators mcconnell and the republican court justices should all be impeached because this was a plot
expert witnesses for hire
i wonder why republicans think its  ok to have traitorous bribe taking criminals and liars on the supreme court
were here because ruth bader was too self absorbed to step down when she needed to when obama asked her  i hope shes rolling in her grave
if trump is to putin what scotus is to trump does that make america de facto russian
the scotus is a joke  they make a mockery of themselves of democracy of decency of justice
"the dog that caught the car is going to cost them the big prize next november
vote blue"
im going to laugh so hard when trump turns on his non rich supporters
republicans are ready and willing to lie to your faces about what their plans for reproductive rights are the truth is and what they have repeatedly proven is that what is happening in texas idaho florida and louisiana  is what they want for all 50 states and dont think for one second contraception is safe because repubs have several bills in 3 states targeting access to birth control
apparently stare decisis only applies to liberal justices but not conservative justices
halls of justice
saved the right for abortion
the supreme court is a breach of justice  no one respects them anymore
the catholic witch is showing her colours
a woman  body is her own a woman body is not owned by the churches or the government  do you understand
lester is such a fn corny blockhead
abortion leak are two words that shouldnt be paired together
breach of trust to we the people sc knew back in february they over turned it yet kept it from we the people of the usa  
bidenharris 2024  scotus particularly the political hacks appointed by the former guy and the bribe takers thomas and alito cannot be trusted vote blue so we can have much needed reforms to the scotus like binding ethical rules the people deserve better than the current corrupt court
ah yes  our illegitimate supreme court  religious fanatics violating our constitution daily  its a great time to be alive  if youre a man right
so the point in time that the question comes to light does not freeze considerations for the opinion  you call that freedom i call that justice denied
people who exclusively vote republican are ignorant and selfish people mainstream americans cant even talk to them
thats a breach of trust but not a corrupt bribed justice on the court
the scotus is the breach of trust
anyone remembers the pelican brief every one of those justices that said that they wouldnt overturn precedent should be fired the supreme court is the only job that you lie during the interview get the job and when people find out that you lied nothing happens and you still remain at the job forever
"definitely the beatle members were much deeper thinkers than any of us fully relied
only much later on did we come to know of their true inner feelings their profound thinking
we actually were a good bit of their anxiety and pressure because we idolized them so
we  probably drove them into isolation"
trump is a traitor
you mean the justices that swore under oath that they wouldnt mess with roe under oath in their senate hearings because roe was settled precedent were uncomfortable taking womens rights away shocking yet they still did it
dont tell me justice thomas isnt the only one with a sugar daddy
if republicans had the white house they would of expanded the court a long time agohintand who gives a f about the leak
the end of rvsw is completely and solely the libs fault
the greatest influence on scotus  was mitch mcconnell 
trump rigged court
kavenaugh is a lying viper  who should never be trusted vote term limits for members of scous
"the great majority women of this country deserve and support the right to our bodily autonomy scotus ruling undermines our human right to absolute control over our bodies and our medical care republicans thought we would forget by the time the 2024 election they are wrong when it comes to our civil rights women will not forget 
we will never forget"
what was the breach of trust was the fact that 3 supreme court justices said during their senate confirmation hearings under oaththat roe v wade was decided and law  that they wouldnt touch ityet committed perjury and overturned it
it sounds messy to me
how can a throne of iniquity like the roberts court investigate itself psalms 9420 it cant
every trump appointed scotus lied to get on the court to begin with just to overturn roe v wade this is proof
gop want to control your body what words you can say what you can read what you can wear how you identify and who you can love
brent might need abortions legal his college age daughters will soon be playing that game devils triangle unless he cares who knocks them up he better keep his options open
trump has paid for his share of abortions
all of the supreme court judges swore under oath they considered roe v wade settled law during their senate nomination interviews
fjb and all his morons 
the most supremely corrupt court
blacks for trump
republicans stripped away the rights of more than half the population they will continue to pay bigly at the ballot box look at the reality in texas
the sad thing is biden is useless  and he is in office now  women in red states are suffering biden is not saying anything  to the red states  ignoring us
the most corrupt supreme court
thank you president trump for your great supreme court the greatest gift to america 
we all know the scotus was bribed thats all they do is pander to the highest bidder
the supreme court is corrupt the justice system is bought by billionaires our democracy is underthreat
abortion is murder
it was about politics the court was packed illegally as an appointment was taken from president obama then the political move by republicans letting trump appoint during his last year of office i call bs
i do not trust scotus any longer   it is tainted and needs to be sanitized
what happened to republicans demanding states decide
" trump2024  
make trump get another supreme court justice pick again"
calling abortion a womens right is like calling chris hayes a journalist
republicanswe have take full control in supreme court good luck with it  with our men in supreme court we are able to break any laws we wants
yes please tell us weirdo because your msnbc audience are to dumb to think
"the criminal all need to be removed they are illegal put in by criminal traitor treasonous plotting grifter scheister
none of their business
president joe will veto ot anyway he has said"
not surprised supreme court got caught with this plot 
mississippi is the poorest state  many blacks  uneducated and poor whites they really needed abortions to be legal sad  if u are against abortions do not get one
"the united states supreme court cannot be trusted anymore 
they have abandoned ethics decency values morals humanity for money and power 
they have been bought and paid for and are not a legitimate court anymore "
"fun fact
  over 32000 babies have been saved from being murdered since the overturning of roe v wade thank you god "
expand the court and implement term limits for the justices
 so shoot the messenger and never mind about the message so much cynicism

this gospel message if you continue to believe this message you will be saved for i delivered to you as of first importance what i also received that christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures  that he was buried that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures and that he appeared to cephas then to the twelve  then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time"
they are not going to clarify anything except take away more of our rights
if your amniotic fluid broke at 18 weeks the doctors should have been able to determine whether the fetus was viable through a csection or not lastly the should have been able to determine whether her life would be at risk especially since the fetus would no longer have the safe environment of the amniotic sac this sounds more like gross negligenceoversight and had nothing to do with the abortion law condolences to the family and glad she is physically safe now
sue texas screw these stupid laws and impeach the supreme court politics needs to stay out of the medical field
"this whole story is bs   what they described is a miscarriage not an abortion 
 they claim the doctors told them tough noogies our hands are tied because we cant read the law  
  50 of the story wasnt told  notice they have only the interpretation of 2 traumatized biased activist people with no legal or medical education 
    what do the doctors have to say they didnt ask the doctors any questions about the case   

no doctor is going to send her home and say whoops maybe youll live or maybe not  we dont know what to do with a pregnant woman or baby

 in the written article the woman claims they reasoned that it would be too dangerous to drive 8 hours to cross state the line to obtain a legal abortion in a neighboring state but waited 3 days at home wo using her prescribed antibiotics and developed sepsis   really   smart choice

thats not so difficult to interpret that the hospitals lawyers and doctors would do what this article claims"
lets deal in facts  it has already been put that the doctor was incorrect and told so by legislation  unfortunate as it is its to be expected  when measured against the lose of life of unborn humans this isnt extreme
obviously these so called prolifers dont care about any lives at all all they really care about is control and power no matter at whos expense
these stupid politicians dont know how to balance
so shes alive and this is just to make a point weak
that doctor is at fault obviously she was in a state of life threatening doctor shouldve done his job thats not legislation thats malpractice
this is extremely sad and my heart breaks for them and everything about this situation i hate saying because im nurse but i knew this during my clinical rotation in ob that after a woman has been in labor for too long after her waters break you give antibiotics its open surface and any organism loves them as well as if a woman that tests positive for strep b you automatically hang antibiotics as soon as they go into labor to protect the baby i dont care if she was about to miscarry she should have treated like anyone other women with a viable baby that waters broke too early this womanhusband might now be able to have a baby now it just goes to show how twisted some people can be in their own beliefs when they choose a living human over a baby they say wont survive i highly doubt this is a doctor mistake because they would be suing for malpractice too
"i dont underestandher water broke and they said there was nothing they could do why didnt they perform a c section or an induction and try to ssve the baby and if the baby died and she got an infection they still should have done a c section or an induced delivery

those doctors are idiots

as a doctor you took an oath to provide your patients with the best possible healthcare so they can live happy and healthy lives but her water broke too soon and these doctors just go damn that suckssorry umm sounds like a personal problem they should be charged"
if i were to become pregnant and see the baby had no brain stem and the doctor said this baby is not going to be viable or if they told me you and the baby could die from this and see the baby and i die my thoughts are one they can do medical research testing on me and my child learning from my child and my death we do not know gods plan if we are meant to die then we are meant to die for a certain cause maybe trust in god  not mankind
the difference is an abortion kills a living developing baby this is very different this is a situation where a baby has died but was not expelled which is bizarre because if your water breaks you usually start labor and deliver very shortly afterwards if anything she should have been given oxytocin if labour didnt start it seems to me like something is missing here
story sounds traumatic and horrible but i cant believe anything cnn promotes can we fact check this
she almost died from septic shock she wasnt developing sepsis this is absolutely abhorrent and the medical professionals should be punished
sue texas broke texas is a dumpster fire of regressive  barbaric ethics
the way these bills are means doctors have to wait till what they know will be life threatening becomes life threatening 
there was zero need for an abortion early delivery shouldve been done straight away either with an induction or c section her doctors are idiots thats the real crime here not an abortion ban
so how did they remove the baby did they give her a csection or did they do the same process as an abortion
texas is the battle ground state all you selfrighteous yankies get your asses down here and fight with us the fascists would never win another election if you did
this is absurd listen i am prolife but when i womens fucking water breaks you deliver the baby you dont have to abort it first but they should have delivered her ugh prayers for her experience im sorry for your loss
texas yall gotta get your shit together you continually fail to make change and actively contribute to killing people everyday
"she was sepsis  
 my god they waited until she was on her deathbed before she got the healthcare she neededbarbaric 
vote  blue to protect our democracy  our freedoms 
 in the 1800s  pioneer woman died in childbirth quite often  because they had no proper healthcare care available 
 pioneer days have long since passed 
 or have they 
i wonder if the people who outlawed medically unnecessary abortions would be ok with their pastors wife being left to die or their wife or their daughter 
pro life my foot 
 if your religion requires you to be left for dead thats your choice 
others may want to live that should be their choice"
the allornothing attitude toward abortion is not a solution it is a problem amandas harrowing story at a committee meeting in texas was ignored by cruz and cornyn both  thats what i have a problem with  maga mobsters who clearly think that they already know everything there is to know  they think they own this country
soo sorry to hear that you guys went through thisi say this with tears in my eyes
oh yes you can finally have an abortion when youre hours away from dying like wtf
explain this to me in relation to abortion laws most republicans are pro life but in relation to gun laws most republicans are pro what selective outrage is real and the motivation is not life its greed
really feel for the women who will go through this in texas and other states willing to curtail personal liberties and access to health care
the gop have shown and time and time again that they hate women theyre not pro life theyre pro misogyny and patriarchy
medicine does not end at conception
inhumane to treat women like this
for the men that want to control women and are happy with this shlt controlling monster law yall will get back the fck fired mostly on the red states theres going to be a big wave of women not wanting to date menhookupserious relationship or even marriage because they will be god damn scared to be pregnant basically sperm is going to be considered a weapon so get ready to either be gay or accept trans woman as your new girlfriendwives intimidate partner get either your balls snipped or be single forever without any women sleeping with you this only goes for men that support this law im not saying all men i know theres amazing men out there that are against this and respect women and are decent human beings
shes lucky she didnt lose all her limbs from the sepsis or die like savita halappanavar in ireland
nonsense what a poor story shame on you cnn
theres also another scenario when a woman gets pregnant and needs to go through chemo for cancer or something like that
it aint prolife its exchanging one for the other oh and btwfor some of those people saying that its only 1 percentyou wouldnt feel that way if it was you in that group and that 1 percent of a population of over 300 million is about 34 million people forcing women to give birth is a form of mass murder and torture especially if its forced nationwide let me know when you feminists are done playing games with the men drop your failed ideology and join with the gynarchists to form gynarchic communities they are murdering women with these laws and they wont stop with abortion some of them have gone online and advocated to take away your right to vote sooner or later submissive straight women and their dominant men will strip away your civil rights after decades of arguing discussion of tireless education what did that bring you theres still rape and sexual assault sex trafficking is on the rise internationally your civil rights are under assault your issues are downplayed minimized ignored denied and your dignity and autonomy are trampled on daily by men who care nothing for you beyond what you can do for them is this the kind of life you want for yourself no more arguments or discussions with the men who keep abusing women and their enablersits worthless become business owners form gynarchic intentional households then communities learn brazilian jiujitsu etc economic physical and social power will get you a lot farther than wasting your time elsewhere real power is what you can earn for yourself and frankly power is the only quality that men respect at the end of the day to the men out there who have made themselves enemies of women and their rights you waged a war against the third and fourth waves of feminism because you were afraid of people like me and of women ruling ironically those people you attacked werent gynarchists at all all they wanted was to have the same privileges and to be treated with fairness and respect however i know what youre like in private and what are lot of you really are when your mothers sisters cousins and aunts leave the room the reality is that men in general will never see women as equals and will keep shining them on until they inevitably strip away their rights its all tactical for them and once they finally manipulate you into a position of political vulnerability youll see what they think of you you were afraid of me and my brothers and sisters and perhaps you were right to because theres no evidence youll ever change collectively youll learn that unlike the feminists gynarchists have no fear unfortunately for you we cant be bargained with and wont listen you had your chance with the feminists to be reasonable and you threw that out the window its interesting that you attacked them when you know nothing of what authentic gynarchists believe or why we think the way we do in a way i thank you for doing this because it showed us how you think and operate and what your weaknesses are gynarchists are doers not talkers selfcultivation is the path to salvation not waiting for the ethical and moral development of men and even if they do get what they want do you honestly think thats a good use of your time arguing and discussing things with people who are going to do what they want to anyways regardless of what you say coding mathematics science workrelated skillsthese are the keys to winning in life and its a real investment of your time to the dominant women and submissive men the time is coming for us to join together to fuse our energies and bring balance to gaia there is no need to smash the patriarchy patriarchies are selfsabotaging and selfdestructive when the men have finally fucked up beyond any doubt and the culmination of the cycle of resentment destruction abuse and violence leaves billions in its wake our time will come survive and thrive my sisters and brothers
texas republicans will live to see brown immigrants breed them out of existence
these laws are insane
republicans dont care they want to torture women
ohhh so sorry are you being subject to the consequences of your beliefs and actions
based texas law
well it was the woman fault for getting abortion and killing her own child
every man or woman who wants an abortion must be sterilized playing parents is for mature people who are responsible for their sexual conquests
as long as people like them live in texas theyll always be in a prison like environment without any control over their own bodies the only solution for them is to relocate to a state where the state government doesnt interfere in their personal lives
if she died that is one death compare that to 50 million babies murdered since 1973
i am so pissed this isnt right and now these people may never be able to try again for another child because of something preventable
they could have not listened to the doctors and had faith but no they speak nothing but negative now and are used by a network that drip feeds child murderers who are desperate to fck and kill
old white men who control texas decide when a woman can get medical care or not they way they feel is woman are nothing more than a host for a baby
absolutely horrid and a total shame 
not being able to murder a baby did what 
almost only counts in horseshoes
this woman was sacrificed to make a stupid point the fact that the law was vague at the time was all the more reason to go ahead and perform the life saving procedure it was a stupid defiant excuse to wait and not help this woman why do people have to be so extreme is balance too hard of a concept for humans on one side they want to abort all and on the other side they want to separate none from the mother none why not  isnt that what the nicu is for also how difficult is it to check for a heartbeat the baby was obviously on its way out they could have checked for a heartbeat everyday until there was none they could have induced labor they maybe could have replaced the amniotic fluid and repaired the sac
i am glad she cant have kids because having kids is selfish and horrible but i am also glad she still got to get the abortion pro life should really be called pro sadists because they only want you born so you can suffer they only care about us when we are not born once we are born they just want us to suffer thats why i wish all women would get an abortion because every abortion saves a child from being born in this trash world i am for everything trump does but the abortion bans are the only thing i dont like because i am only for abortions because i wish i was aborted and every time an abortion occurs a child is spared from being born and having to deal with this corrupt government and crooked school systems hopefully she wont be able to have kids because its not a good idea to force another human being into this trash but i am also glad that most women know that when abortions are banned they can just end the pregnancy themselves thats what most women do anyway they either end the pregnancy themselves or go out of state abortion bans only stops clinics not the actual abortion thank you to all the women out there who had an abortion you saved a child from this trash world
the infection is not what caused the scarring it was the abortion abortion causes scarring and damage to the uterus because it causes trauma to the tissue
sounds like the doctors killing people cause theyre afraid of liability
theres so many people being killed why because their being told that life has no value do you value life give the baby a chance do to others as you would have them do to you matthew 712 if the tables were turned would it have been okay for your baby to abort you instead repentbelieve in gods son jesus he loves you and can change your heart
"maybe people should care less about an unborn child and more about actual fully grown human beings
people are getting dumber by the day"
sue the texas legislature and sue the hospital
the texas women who voted for abbott and the texas gop i have no sympathy for you when you find yourself in this situation this is what you voted for beto would have got rid of this extreme law sb8
that is awfulsmh ridiculous
abortion  killing in horrible pain of unborn children abortion by saline injection feels like being burned alive while abortion by curettage rips off all the childs body parts imagine how that feels the nervous system is already developed at 6 weeks so that the pain these children feel are very real but unlike proabortionists they do not have a voice to express themselves with the exceptions of the pregnancies that put the mother life in danger which are very rare abortions should be illegal if a driver kills a pregnant woman on a pedestrian crossing that driver faces two charges for murder in that context the life of the baby matters instead if his mom decides to kill him in horrible pain suddenly that is not a crime anymore
well this really wasnt an abortion because the baby was essentially dead already   needless to say no doctor wanted to touch her for fear of being sued or prosecuted   texas antiabortion law probably needs to be tweaked
to hell with greg abbott and to hell with this rotten anti abortion movement
do a caesarean and try to save the baby prob wont make it but thats more prolife
this is totally bs they let people have abortions in life threatening situations incest or rape another out right lie of the radical enemy of the people cnn not surprised some people need to wake up their book smart but dont have any common sense what so ever yall better learn your rights so people and establishments like this cant incite and brain wash you
babies this age are usually born totally fine without any complications if your water breaks before 34 weeks your doctor will probably give you antibiotics to fend off potential infections plus steroids to help your babys lungs develop you may have to stay in the hospital to be monitored for signs of labor
none of cnns story made sense medically if her water broke she should have been made to deliver the baby when your water breaks it doesnt mean your baby is going to die it means you have to give birth cnn is getting desperate like wtf
such a disgusting lie you dont perform an abortion for pprom you induce labor cnn is lying through their teeth right now virtually all abortions are performed to terminate an otherwise healthy baby
what an awful situation
i was certain comments would be turned off another unnecessary tragedy hope they had the best insurance you can buy being bankrupted is the next notch in the american way
imagine having to keep a decaying dead baby inside your uterus becasue of the government
dont tell the truth here and expect it to stay tried twice now and realized it was cnn move on
im a christian so obviously i heavily disagree with abortion no one i know is for it so i want some people to reply why its right especially prolife christians i want it to be a respectful debate so i can understand why you people think abortion is right
"this doesnt make any medical sense whatsoever 

if your water broke delivery should have been induced 

none of this adds up 

but keep pushing this propaganda as if its factual"
if the doctor cant set his foot down and say the only way we can save the woman is to deliver the baby and pray work and hope the best for the baby the doctor laces  bone in the nose and should not be a doctor    and that people working in heltcare  are turning this uppsid down putting people at risk to make a point  and te point being we dont have the balls to stand upp for life just hiding behind the law of no abortion to not take a needed desision of delivering to save the women is putting bouth the lives at risk  i am pro life all the human lifes and sometimes hard desisjons have to be made  bretter to save one than none but if possible tray to save bouth
"when pregnant the cells of the baby migrate into the mothers bloodstream and then circle back into the baby its called fetalmaternal microchimerism

for 41 weeks the cells circulate and merge backwards and forwards and after the baby is born many of these cells stay in the mothers body leaving a permanent imprint in the mothers tissues bones brain and skin and often stay there for decades every single child a mother has afterwards will leave a similar imprint on her body too

even if a pregnancy doesnt go to full term or if you have an abortion these cells still migrate into your bloodstream

research has shown that if a mothers heart is injured fetal cells will rush to the site of the injury and change into different types of cells that specialize in mending the heart

the baby helps repair the mother while the mother builds the baby

how cool is that

this is often why certain illnesses vanish while pregnant

its incredible how mothers bodies protect the baby at all costs and the baby protects  rebuilds the mother back  so that the baby can develop safely and survive

think about crazy cravings for a moment what was the mother deficient in that the baby made them crave

studies have also shown cells from a fetus in a mothers brain 18 years after she gave birth how amazing is that

if youre a mom you know how you can intuitively feel your child even when they are not therewell now there is scientific proof that moms carry them for years and years even after they have given birth to them

i find this to be so very beautiful
just a clump of cells right"
prefers the castration cry from school kids due to school imposed sex change
the republican church thats too bad but our imaginary deity still wants us to force all women and girls to comply with our religious beliefs
i call bs save the baby mommas going to hell
why do they continue to vote  for abbot against their self interest he just won reelection despite all the things hes done and continues to do
texas is a pro life state murderers of innocent babies need to live elsewhere we dont have 20 pro life cities in the state for no reason
the gop do not care about this  they dont care  to them a few dead women here and there a few women in icu who become infertile after being denied treatment  this is a price worth paying  dont expect sympathy or revised laws from the gop  they do not care about anyone other than the fetus right up until its born  then if you dare ask for assistance you are a deadbeat welfare cheat sucking the nation dry on benefits
abortion should remain legal but only for liberals same as suicide
well i hope all you anti abortion people are happy
so its apparent the baby died
my mother is a cps worker and saw she was so upset and asked her what was wrong  she came to see a child that was in a watchlist she found out the girl was pregnant shes only 13  she was molested how can she be a mother  shes barely trying to figure out her life i dont understand why a child needs to be forced to have a child  i dont understand why people choose to point fingers at women who arent even ready to be mothers yet there is nobody doing anything to help out in adoption centers
"there is nothing in texas that prevented amanda from receiving the medical procedure to remove the already dead baby this is not an abortion and not related to pro life bills in any way these are activist doctors who played with a womans life rather than giving her the care she needed we now have activists pretending to be journalists using this womans tragedy to further an agenda to electively murder as many babies as they can

you people are vile"
i love how abortion is murder but creating a law preventing a women from being saved when shes dieing isnt what the actual fuck this is such a violation of womens rights is sickening
these antiabortion fantastic need to say out of peoples business
what this coouple went through is horrible and inhumane on multiple levels and what happened to them makes me very glad to be living in california
and 63459 781 baby girls and boys have actually died because over 63 million women were given one
i think those elections need to be scrutinized  gone over with a fine tooth comb he cheated i know it
she needs to sue greg abbott the caveman
so tell me how did the caveman  abbott get reelected  dont get pregnant in texasthats all i gotta say
so im guessing the killer mom killed the baby
what i want to know is did she voted for gop politicians who pushed for abortion ban if she did then shed needs to shut and put up with gop policieslaws what did women in these red states think when theyre voted for republican politicians republican politicians do not advocate for women
i am a republican and i am first hear say how sorry i am for amanda next these abortion laws need to be for causes between a woman and doctor but only for the right reason not just to get an abortion because you dont feel like you want to be pregnant that is murder
its always a bad idea for ignorant politicians to make decisions that a doctor should make
rightwing and christian conservatives dont care if you almost die after being denied an abortion they care if you have sex
how all the babies died in the abortion
i had severe sepsis after getting some of my bowel removed i was septic for 3 days and was told it was in my head i prepared for death and everything told my parents not to come visit me that day i was very very lucky because usually when sepsis symptoms shows itself its already too late was revived 4 times in the or
awful yes but this is a very isolated event doesnt happen very often leave it to cnn to push an agenda and try to make the public believe its a national emergency just like covid which was bs too
now do one about how thousands of children die daily because theyre aborted
let people make their own choices and let god discern their hearts not you people wish they were masters over others smh grow up
thats what you get for living in texas a state where people elect a government that enjoys your suffering enjoy 4 816 possibly 32 more years of this happening to women in texas where god guns and football are more important than your freedom
abortion is a disgusting act but abortion should only be applied under certain circumstances its shouldnt be i got pregnant i dont want the baby i am not ready  my body my decision type of reasoning to get rid of the unborn because that would only promote irresponsibility on both men and women on her case on other hand the doctor or the hospital should have done something about and put it into details why she is required to have one it is their responsibility to defend the need of their patient since it a life threatening case it is common sense im prolife antiabortion again abortion isnt applicable to all so dont abuse it
"this is beyond ridiculous and barbaric in 2022 she almost died amd now likley cant have children its like the government in the us have zero education common sense and empathy  
 come on we have the resources to help and save lives relieve suffering what happened to her medically wirg the pregnancy was tragic enough this is not the 1700s"
some lawsuits needs to be filed
yea got no shame pro choice all day
"of all people you would think that oppressed victims would be the ones to care for these little ones  every man for himself i guess  or shall i say every victim 

imagine a world where people dont care about babies being murdered in the womb and where life itself isnt a basic human right  now add a zombie apocalypse and rants about justice and equality 

or heres one stop controlling my life followed by fighting for the power to snuff out someone elses life   yes i need the freedom to snuff out a perfectly healthy little baby in the womb because im against crazy people trying to control women  you just cant make this circus show up its pure comedy yet still very twisted and sick"
you all in texas still put back the idiots in power so
remember the republicans are the prolife party
"basically turning a perfectly healthy baby into hazardous medical waste is now healthcare  

via a woman medical deciion hundreds of thousands of preborn black babies are aborted every year and millions have become hazardous medical waste since 1973 all we need now are some white robes and pointed masks  who wouldve thought all this woke liberation is starting to make republikkkans look like a bunch of saints

and how odd its only a baby when it fits the narrative  we need to care about mothers being in danger while our most vulnerable in society are being murdered  and tough luck i guess you cant be oppressed or a minority if youre in the womb  theres no place for you in this world of victim"
"this is unfortunately the inevitable consequence of this fascist and insane policies by republicans  but republicans dont care if women die because of the sick and intolerant policies  to them it is all about maintaining power at all costs  

at some point the public will become educated enough and remove the cancer that infects texas politics as well as many other red states"
"this is not just a problem in states with anti abortion laws 

catholic hospitals will never provide abortions as medical care they will let the mother die to save her immortal soul"
get a good lawyer this isnt right
this is how gop cares about people
so i wonder what all the prolifers have to say about this that all said that the mothers life isnt at risk and when it is she can abort
sue the law makers sue sue sue
"barbies abortion barbies abortion
"
exodus 21 for example suggests that a pregnant womans life is more valuable than the fetuss this text describes a scenario in which men who are fighting strike a pregnant woman and cause her to miscarry a monetary fine is imposed if the woman suffers no other harm beyond the miscarriage however if the woman suffers additional harm the perpetrators punishment is to suffer reciprocal harm up to life for life
yet texas keep going red
laws made by people in offices sick
a new jersey woman was killed waiting for a gun permit because of her abusive boyfriend you know an actual right that none of you seem to care about
maybe women should do a better job at vetting their sexual partners this is 100 womens fault maybe they should be more responsible eh
oh come on already if its a medical emergency it can be done
where are the prolife republican commenters at what do you have to say about this i noticed none of you are commenting because there is no defense for controlling a persons life
cnn is ran by satanist
mothers killing their children  change my mind 
sorry dont believe this
quit voting for republicans
as more cases are iike this happen it wiii turn the most conservative person and their entire famiiy to vote biue
horse crap i work in obstetrics and they could have admitted and given iv antibiotics to mom to prevent infection they do it all the time infection is not the fault of the baby and abortion would not have prevented it dumbass people believe whatever for the benefit of this assault against unborn babies and children 
time for governments and insurance companies to back out of health care  leave the decisions up to qualified physicians
this is what happens when you rush through a law without thought or discussion it is massively irresponsible on the part of lawmakers folks get the heck out of texas and florida before this happens to you
apparently pro lifers dont care about the life of the mother
it sounds like she was just used as a political piece of the game  her abortion was medical needed there was no reason doctor didnt give her one they knew everything that would happen to her if they didnt do it abortion that are just use by women as birth control is what should be stop not this
"ah good ole texas the hell hole of america

thank god i live in a blue state"
they both look like they need more sleep
well women in texas have done this to themselves good luck you keep voting for misogynistic men and this is what you get women literally voted for turning women into property
texas  white women voted overwhelmingly for walking crime wave  cheetos jesus   who put  far right extreme judges on the supreme court that overturned roe v wade yea  do that  vote for him again
kinda like the babies life that is denied  gtfo out of this country u sex obsessed disgusting baby killers
prayers for this couple this is the true consequences of not thinking through  overturning roe vs wade hope more women and their partners see this so they make sure this doesnt happen again
"i worked in womens health always did dc after incomplete miscarriage
why is this a political issue and not a medical issue because their asking for trouble if this continues and women could sue the government for negligence of care"
they wont answer because there are all stupid people
if the gop now pretends to moderate on issues like abortion  dont buy it the will lie like their scotus nominees 2024 must be more blue or independent prochoice republicans want to have their cake and eat it too it wont work fanatics never rest maga  taliban
the healthcare in us is so much worse than in many really poor countries its not socialism to pay for your healthcare via your taxes
so then maybe you should stop voting for people who would rather let you die 
oh no nobody should be put through this  i couldnt imagine my prayers are with you girlyour family is beautiful greatful she has a good husband   this is just wrong   i was 11 raped by 10 men n left for deadomg what if i had gotten pregnant  i was devolved early but was a childthey have greater technology nowi am truly sorry  ive been wanting to bring this up to our governor stit    he has kids  he has girlsi wasnt able to have kids cause they tore me up so badlyi couldnt imagine being made to kept a childi was a child
stop having bare sex lady and you might keep your life
yet another victim of dobbs that wouldnt have been had it not happened
"republicans dont care about a womans life  this religious right wing wants to control women and kill them over their religious beliefs 
 

what ever happened to separation of church and state 

we are not england"
being a texan is often embarrassing
her race isnt the most terminating babies its blacks
stupid texas laws  last year i had a septic infection in my bladder from a kidney stone day surgery operation that went bad  i almost died and i was rushed back to the hospital by ambulance when i had a temp of 105  it was very scary  i was in the hospital for 10 days on iv antibiotics  this is not an infection to play around with  this lady could had died because the doctors had their hands tied for these ridiculous barbaric laws   if i were them i would move out of texas
you get what you vote for leave texas if youre smart
move out of the state  i feel incredibly sad and bad for this couple and so many others
"texas state elected legislators not doctors almost cost this woman her life with their ignorance and may have destroyed her ability to have future children this is why a bunch of idiots shouldnt be given this kind of power i hope she sues the texas state lawmakers to hell and back

in what can only be seen as a punitive and hateful punishment of women who have abortions tea party georgia republican rep terry england in support of a bill which would ban abortions after 20 weeks hr 954 says that women should be forced to carry dead fetuses to term why because cows and pigs have to do it and thats apparently how his god wants it never mind the health risk to mothers being forced to carry dead fetuses to term republicans hate mothers and want them to die early and often


legalizing the murder of abortion doctors tea party 2012 
south dakota tried to pass a law to make the murder of an abortion doctor legal as selfdefense
when south dakota was forced to drop the idea of murdering abortion doctors nebraska and iowa picked up the idea see also hb 3308 life defense act of 2012 which has implications in this regard"
made up story
rip little angel vote does those idiots out of the senatethe house never another president who doesnt support abortion rights 
so old guys determine that women are not allowed abortion they dont have a womb so they cant give birth how can they even think about it these old men have no clue at all let alone about politics
"nothing to do with the anti abortion law
this law doesnt prevent abortion if the doctor judgement feels that the mother is risking her life
so it was a wrong human medical decision
my prayers for amanda and josh i know what they feel"
this is bullshit propaganda dislike
"im really really really sorry for this couple

but 
thats what texans vote for again and again 
there was a real chance to change that and bring freedom and safety back for wemon
and for school kids

but no  taxans decide they care a  about wemon children and people at all

so sorry but now you all have to live with it and you have to make a better decision next time "
fake propaganda she could have had a c section and removed the dead baby
"im going to tell some thing not expected at all
if texas under islamic law non of that happened 
im just saying "
most women who want to get an abortion arent at risk like this lady  pro life and pro choice are both wrong it should be in the middle closer to pro life you have 810 weeks to figure it out or else you gotta keep that baby simple you pro choice retards get your choice and you pro life morons get your wish
there was a good set of reasons for roe v wade we will remember why it had to pass  the toll of human suffering was abhorrent   if anti abortionists dont want one dont get one      show us first how you became the superior person     save up and adopt each and every one of those wee babies birthed by ill prepared parents gonna do that       not too chickensht are ya             write the check and keep your mind on your own damn crotches
"how many more lives will be at risk of being lost needlessly how many more will suffer damage by these barbaric restrictions how many more lives will be forever scared

so sorry for your loss and your health issue you telling your story helps so many more to understand the reality of the new law please know that the majority of americans believe your heartbreaking story should never happen again the blessing is that you both have each other and your love is probably stronger as a result if your tragedy"
yep welcome to 2022 inconceivable and what a shame that men laws can decide how a woman can do with her own body
fake news  doctors wouldnt leave a miscarriage to decay  dont believe the propaganda
"people just dont realise how disastrous being antiabortion is until it hits them personally i know that life is precious this womans should be just as precious as her unborn childs was but thats not how she was treated shame on the doctors

im sorry for what they went through it didnt seem to matter to the rest of texas though they reelected abbott and im sure all of their house representatives on the national level are republican

no amount of stories like these or what happened to the 10 year old in ohio are enough to sway these monsters"
put aside the fact that they had to focus on a nice white homely couple who met in kindergarten when theres undoubtedly 100000 of the same stories in black  brown communities this is the travesty of american antiwomen laws youre abhorrent usa
common those that voted for republicans to represent them your vote for any republican has caused this and many more own this couples pain and anguish i hope this pain befalls all that voted republicans into office
shame on people who vote for this
"abortion is every womans choice across the majority of the world
republicans are like taliban men dictating what subjugated women should do land of freedom
the us constitution has been amended 27 times and is the reason they are called amendments"
and yet they kept electing those same people that are opposing those laws or just they didnt vote the only people im sorry for are the people that did vote for the right persons and get dragged down with the rest of the stupid fanatics
this is all gop bs  punt abbot for his ineptitude
shes high risk for issues with another pregnancy and does she want to risk that while living in texas  she could die for sure
the unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for they never make demands of you they are morally uncomplicated unlike orphans they dont need money education or childcare they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships and when they are born you can forget about them because they cease to be unborn its almost as if by being born they have died to you you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth power or privilege without reimagining social structures apologizing or making reparations to anyone they are in short the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe prisoners immigrants the sick the poor widows orphans all the groups that are specifically mentioned in the bible they all get thrown under the bus for the unborn
im so sorry for your loss and heartbreak
shes not dead though and most abortions arent to protect the life of the mother  most are for convenience
nothing is going to change in texas until businesses and more citizens affected by these extremist laws start standing up and speaking out to not only abbotts office but to the states courts as well  as long as you live in texas with abbott as governor he will continue to force you to live by his principles blue voters need to start reaching out to rural and suburban texas because those are the places that kept abbott governor of texas he probably thinks you both are sinners and deserved what happened imagine someone running your state that thinks that way about you 
one shouldnt get pregnant in such a state young couples should leave too much risk
this is going to become a more and more common story if these barbaric antichoice laws continue being implemented glad she didnt fucking die
that sounds more like a hospital who didnt know how to interpret the law its clear in this video she qualified the moment her water broke she should sue the hospital
republican polices are responsible women are second class citizens thanks to them
"almost died  still alive
am i correct"
texans who voted for abbott and the other republicans should share the blame for this
well texas they keep on electing the same people who brought them nightmare
blame the republicans and their barbaric christians  pro life 
there has to be a law firm willing to take these cases pro bono  sue the states
that is despicable that amanda did not receive the care she desperately needed  shame on texas and their barbaric and backwards laws i would never live in that state even if you paid me  god bless you amanda for your strength
i just think that baby almost died before she got done an abortion
they should sue the state
"and yet most texans still voted abbott in as a governor
they will never learn"
used to want to go to texasbut with these barbaric laws the racist governor   judges giving murderers bondit would be the last place id want to go 
i hope we elect warnock is so much more competent prochoice and he was co sponsor of s53  raise the wage act of 2021 hope it passes in the senate too bad we dont have the 
i would get a damn good lawyer and find a way to sue the state
"dose cnn ever report about a baby that was not murdered  
or report alive saved from somebodys bad decision from a night of drinking 
however medical required termination should be automatic if complications arise"
by the gop packing the supreme court and planning the demise of abortion rights more women might end up like that woman or die roe vs wade must be codified
its incomprehensible to me how people keep voting for people like abbott and his cronies from hell who make these laws
you didnt mention the names of the ones you contacted and refused to comment why
she doesnt have to live in texas theres plenty of states she can go to vacuum her baby out if her she didnt die so whats the fuss the left is all about killing babies and grooming children
doctors could stop this they are cowards they could easily band together and do right by their patients and  not the expedient political thing  but their country club lifestyle is at stake cant have that jeopardized
and yet texan still voted for republican so what that tell u
i think america needs the iranian women to show them how its done
thanks to republicans
based texas
sounds like they passed laws halfbaked
talking about one woman we are talking about thousands of babies being murdered she is still alive all the babies are dead
i guess this is what happens when politicians make the medical  decisions and not the physician we already have an ag threaten criminal case against the physician who performed the abortion the 10 year old case so i can see why physicians feel like their hands are completely tied with anything concerning abortion
after being a republican for almost years 20 ill never vote for them again  this makes my blood boil
żurawski is a polish surname unfortunately similar cases caused deaths of women in poland because of barbaric law people do fight for our human rights across the borders
no story on the guy whole stole billions of dollars and funneled it through the democrat party through ukraine our tax money what nobody cares about that thats just shows you how messed this world really is
what a bunch of bull shit talk about pushing an agenda just call yourself the democrat news network
"this is a governor that believes he is making the right decision for all women regardless of the outcome and texas keeps voting the 3 pack back in women need to unite and bring a major lawsuit 
i am so sorry for what this young couple had to insure no one is a second class citizen blessings and love from san antonio texas "
these laws are pro death if anything
you need to move to state that can help you when pregnant for all women
murdering a million americans with covid wasnt enough for the bloodthirsty prolife crowd  theyre going for another million in childbirth  they have zero respect for human life  thats always been fake news
where i come from doctors would put saving a life before the law and the courts would agree
thanks to the unaccountable catholic oligarchy known as the supreme court woman like amanda can now be hunted by vigilantes for a 10000 cash bounty and force to prove in court that they suffered a miscarriage not an abortion  morally foul religious right builds its path to power on the destruction of women
"politicians who try to kill pregnant women must not be allowed to stand for election in a free democracy even the taliban are more advanced in human rights then republicans these days
wake up american conservatives you are voting for criminal assault and female mass murder"
this makes my blood boil how can republicans be so fken stupid
the government should not have the rights to a womans body
good heavens i say those doctors are cowards  they could have defended earlier actions to save her lifeblessings to all
republicans would rather have a fetus burst through a womans abdomen like an alien then claim it was gods will with a trumpy smirking shrug than let her terminate an unviable and deadly pregnancy
crazy shit leave our bodies  ourselves
nazi doctors were better than republicans
im so sad and angry i think this whole situation is ridiculous
my biggest nightmare is literally coming true wtaf all decided by men who will never ever comprehend or understand the joy and horror of carrying life
"this story just breaks my heart in ways i cant describe

politicians need to get out of our healthcare"
congratulations republicans   you cant blame the dems for this one
"how about all the failed abortions on when the baby was born and taken to a room to die
they were issued both life and death certificates
"
"this is total outrageous

got out of texas fast"
and what about all the babies that did die because they were denied a life to live its crazy how people dont care reproductive rights oxymoron call it what it is terminating rights
sweetie im sorrywas raped by 10 men and what if i had gotten pregnantwas left for dead   my heart goes out to you i cant have kids cause they dammaged mei am praying for you always  mathew 424 bless you both
what a nightmare im so sorry you lived and are still living through it 
young parents do not have a certain future in texas and neither do children neither do doctors death to barbarism
how is it an abortion if the cells are already dead im so confused
if she died trumptards would say it was gods will 
i almost died walking across the street whats your point
one of my best friends died from sepsis two days after her child was born
she probably would have gotten less  time for shooting a texas politician than a doctor performing a life saving abortion in some states this is what it has come down to
i know this network isnt considered a news station but dont they have some sort of obligation to telling the truth or is it simply what democrats want to hear wheres jackie
"welcome to america in 2022 moving forward 
and for all the dems winsthere are so many places now where womens lives are at risk daily  so sadbut we still gave women killers the house"
my heart goes out to amanda and her husband the anti abortion laws should be finetuned to better address amandas situation but there should still be a total ban on elective abortions the extreme cases like amandas are extremely rare less than 1 im not mad that cnn is showing the extreme cases one life lost is many but the lawmakers should finetune the laws to serve the people better our mantra is save them both we need both the mother and her child alive
omg this makes me so sad
0ver 300000 babies murdered in one year by planned parenthood
thanks ted
marsha here abortion has never been a constitutional right planned parenthood which has a financial interest in keeping abortion on demand legal will keep fighting at the state and national level to make abortion a bs constitutional right again the organizations most recent annual report showed a record number of abortions 383460 and a record revenue 17 billion
all the dumbasses who want abortion banned no matter what 
this could have been prevented by not fucking in the first place
while i detest the idea of abortion i believe its murder i also believe there are certain times when an abortion would be necessary for instance if the mothers life were in danger the people that make me mad are the ones who get an abortion just because or it an inconvenience to me or worst of all they see a potential human being as nothing more than a mere parasite abortion should be left for each state to decide not the federal government as a whole all life is sacred no matter where you come from and all life deserves a chance to enter the world
thats what happens when the republicans particularly the ones in the supreme court decide to do more harm than good
the us is quickly becoming a global pariah
lmfao false cant believe anything from cnn trump 2024
"how to be saved
there is only one god in three persons god the father god the son and god the holy spirit  one god
humans are one person  in three parts the body soul and spirit  three parts one person
the bible says that we are all sinners
as it is written  there is none righteous  no not one  romans 310
for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of godromans 323
but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags isaiah 646
for the wages of sin is death romans 623  the word death in this verse means eternal separation from god in hell
come now and let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow isaiah 118
christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures 1corinthians 1538
in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins colossians 114
for by grace ye are saved through faith and not of yourselves
it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast ephesians 289
i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain  galatians 221
if you would like to receive jesus as your savior  realize that you are a hopeless sinner and tell jesus that you trust in him and only him to save you from hell
your trust in jesus and his shed blood on the cross to pay for your sins is what saves you from hell
the moment you trust in jesus and only jesus you are saved
then you should be  baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit"
"hello bots 
and the women who almost die from getting one
wont cover that santino blanco"
but its okay to kill the baby huh this is political bs and you think its all about democracy at stake our democracy will never be at stake for we are a constitutional republic definitely need some termlimits on our scotus though left and right
you should be protecting the option of abortion for people who werent impregnated by their high school sweethearts that was an unnecessary detail
this is why the government should never get involved in a womans health care  an abortion is a medical proceedure  it is up to the woman her doctor her family and her god  it is no one elses business period
they still voted for abbott sorry you get what you vote for sorry but they will be more
the gop doesnt care about women health or rights
its not prolife or anything ots being responsible with what one does with their own bodies before they need surgery  and then special cases incest victims rape victims and special circumstances that threaten life so stop the fighting and realize its about being responsible
i think these doctors are cowards they take the hypocritic oath and do nothing in the past people with clout have gone to jail for their believes it happened in ireland and a woman died but the laws were changed she did not die in vainif a doctor had aborted the fetus no court would have convicted him there would have been hell to pay
absolutely abhorrent these laws are insane shame on anyone who pushed for this
there is nothing at all prolife about a doctor having to wait until a woman is near death suffering through sepsis with a temperature of 104 before they can legally remove her naturally dying fetus
here we go again with cnn not using common sense just common ignorance any facts on the total number of people that this happens to cnn thanks for the useless noninformation again how many clicks did you get
propaganda roll out post midterms
so sad this didnt have to be this way this story needs to be told so the law can be amended to protect moms
also republicans we dont understand how we lost women and gen z in these midterm elections   
i am still surprised kkk qop abbot still in office 
an abortion always ends a human life
they call texas the lone star state not because of whats on our flag but because thats what our state is ratedone star
i believe there will be more of these stories over the next 2 years im sure it will affect the next election
when our border is secure we can deal with this
if you want somebody to blame for this blame christians
so republicans  youre now feeling the ramifications of your laws hell hath no fury than a woman scorned or suffering  theyll make you regret passing those laws
texas is like living in a other country and i cant tell you what country but its a very discrimination nation
why anyone would live in a 3rd world it hole like texas is beyond me its hard to believe that place exists in a western democratic country
one thing that we the people know social conservatives follow the principle of the ends justify the means  they lie cheat and deceive for what they claim is their god  doing such immoral actions for god means that they can justify any unethical behavior eg winning at all cost god sanctions slavery flying jets into world trade center buildings etc  and they do justify any and all of their unethical behavior  nothing good nor decent has ever come from social conservatism
bs heres one equality is a two way street if you wanna keep pushing infanticide and calling it bodily autonomy then its time to talk about ending routine infant circumcision and starting federal protections for bodily autonomy for both genders and address the fact that only one gender has had their bodily autonomy protected by law for decades now you cant only focus on womens issues and not even try to cover mens issues any it doesnt work that way if you want true equality
when a man can birth a baby out his body then he can have say as to life in the womb
"this is the biggest bullshit story ever 
so after all she got here abortion it wasnt as fast as she wanted 
where are the doctors   why arent they there to confirm her danger  why are they there to confirm how sick she was "
im so sorry for your pain and sorrow i say bring suit to the texas legislature that made this stupid law it is barbaric
fake news if a womans lifes in danger she can have an abortion thats between her and god
anytime a woman is attacked over her healthcare its misogyny anytime a woman nearly died or does die its misogyny any time a woman loses her fertility because of treatment delay its misogyny anytime a child who is raped is denied an abortion its misogyny so called prolife people are hypocrites who hate women and dont even support fully funded child care
all hail texas
why cant republicans ignore abortion you know like they do school shootings
despite the economic downturnim so happy i have been earning  60000 returns from my 7000 investment every 13days
explain the 600000 babies that actually do die each year from abortions please report on this truth she had a bad experience 600000 babies have a worse experience than her each year because of abortion can you please do a story on these 600000 babies killed each year by abortion instead of the one mother that never came close to dying  you liberals are propagandists you all suck  fact  cheers woke low iq liberals
i would advise any women of child bearing age to move out of texas until those barbaric laws are changed those abortion laws are written by misogynistic power hungry men who have no medical knowledge or concern for a womans health and they are backed up by the corrupt members of the scotus 
its just awful what amanda and josh went through its tragic that she might never be able to have a child and i know this isnt the only case like this the government has no business interfering in  a womans medical decisions
cnn this is beyond bs your creating hate and war
dont ya love cold blooded american  capitolism and americanstrumperschristians  telling another to medically receive  treatment they only approve of aint that coll go ahead keep voting republicans trumpism lol
republicans can be pretty stupid at times literally the only thing they are good for is kinda protecting the second amendment but they fail at that also
you mean the baby almost lived
dems lost the house even though they rigged it bahahahahahahahaha
can anyone here fathom 230000 illegals in a month thats 30 days absolutely unbelievable wow
maybe take steps  to prevent pregnancy next time 
come back to the modele age how sad hope the doutor take off the dental anesthesia when those stupid and low  lawmakers and politics need dental carethis is america now 
anyone who can see stories like this and still say abortion isnt health care is crazy its not pro life
dont expect republicans to care
when yall are ok with removing a full term baby piece by piece from the moms womb i have no sympathy
"republican well i guess she shouldnt have had sex with her husband anymore if she didnt want to die from an infection
yes because that makes sense"
texas lawmakers cant spell
if she hadnt made it there would of been incoming lawsuits towards law makers
it seems the law statement applies to the situation she was experiencing the doctor seems the most liable to have not reacted responded appropriately unfortunate their loss of the baby seems they really wanted to deliver and care for the baby
and texans still voted republican sick
i have nothing to add but arrrrgh you idiots youre killing already born people to save wishes and prayers
so she could have one except her doctors decided to play politics by blaming the laws even though its clear to any moron the law says she qualified blame the activist doctors 
boy if i didnt like this id move to one of plenty of other states that do allow doctors to preemptively kill babies for health sake
no government should get involved in such a delicate and private issue women would be encarcerated for political power if it wasnt for the democratic party who has worked none stop to secured womans protection from unscrupulous politicians like herschel walker
as see the new russian republican party       dosent care if women will die because the supreme court and the republican party wants  to run there lives
i am so sorry to both of you and your baby willow is a beautiful name this is because of politicians and doctors running scared my mom had sepsis and died im so happy you lived peace and love
how barbaric is the correct words prayers and luv from ontario canada
and that abortion is as safe an operation as appendicitis no woman was harmed during an abortion the next step is forced abortion the banks will decide if you have the means to have children its fair too
texas explains everything
thats what radical republicans want for americakeep showing these stories until 2024 when  democrats take back full control of congress to codify roe into law
wtf already
texas does not carehell under wheelies texas froze and children also the elderly passed do not forget the gun bill which is one of the reason why the tragedy in uvalde happededtexans choose that for them
nothing like a bunch of self riteous old men deciding health decisions for women
the usa the first officially recognised 4th world country in the world
omg  but still you voted for abbott soi guess other texans dont care about you amandahow sad is that  i pray you do have the children you so very much deserve
you need to have abortion in law because of this shit 
texas its the americas afghanistan d
amanda i am so sorry you had to go through this much  heartbreaking pain stand strong keep your hope and health up we will fight with you
thats so wrong
and then we prayed  nope
how many more women are going to suffer or die due to facistism laws
wow situations like this kind of make me glad i dont have any kids
yet these geniuses voted for these disgusting so called republicans again
texas sucks so thankful i live in california
how did the baby fare
sickening psychopaths
stupid right wing regressors uneducated buybull driven idiocy trash that must control a woman smh
she was already born so the gop dont care about her life
"gen z voters got suckered by joe  no student loan handout
use a coat hanger and keep your legs closed"
"yet texas voted for abbot  voted him in for a third time  shame shame shame on all those that voted for that man  
they were sacred someone was gonna take away their guns  as if that would happen  well as i said shame on texas "
big shout out to the gop winning the house majority  now subpoena pelosi over january 6th
what does this have to do the title   cnn bullshit
"abortion on demand 
no questions asked 
its not your business"
thanks lying ted cruz
did the baby survive
i almost died skiing once i dont know why it didnt make it to cnn 
how come when its us its an abortion and when its a chicken its an omelette george carlin
im standing up for the victims of abortion because they obviously lost their voice
torture and death is the point of the gop they want to make women suffer and slaves
what a bs story
so there is a reason to kill a child  a friend of mine was pregnant with a child that had trisomy 18 these children typically pass away within hours after birth  my friend was told she had to have an abortion but she went full term and got to hold her child for several hours before god took his life  the parents wouldnt have had it any other way its impossible to know a parent will feel when a child is in these critical situations but we shouldnt be the ones to terminate any life from womb to tomb  there are also countless times an unborn child is misdiagnosed and is killed out of fear of a defect only to find the child was perfectly healthy put it gods hands pax
abortion is 9497 of the cases because the mother doesnt want a baby look at the stats for the outlier cases saving a mothers life the baby is dead  the doctor will make the health care decisionhowever not ready for baby raped too young too immature too careless too promiscuous  are not acceptable reasons and result in murder of the babyas the baby could be given up for adoption  fullstop
"attention liberals    if youre upset about roe vs wade being overturned you should be upset at the democrat party for doing nothing

in 1976 jimmy carter was elected president he had a democrat majority in the house and senate his entire 4 years  why didnt they codify roe into law
in 1992 bill clinton was elected president when he took office he had a democrat majority in the house and senate  why didnt they codify roe into law
in 2008 barrack obama was elected president not only did he have a democrat majority in the house and senate when he took office one of his campaign promises was to codify row into law  why didnt they codify row into law after making it a campaign promises
in 2020 joe biden was elected president not only did he have a democrat majority in the house and senate when he took office they had a 2month notice that roe was going to be overturned  why didnt they codify roe into law knowing the ruling was going to be overturned
if youre upset the only people you can be upset with is the democrat party for doing absolutely nothing when they had the chances"
to say that some women use abortion as birth control was utterly shocking and offensive and just goes to show the incredible judgements people make about abortion without actually knowing real womens stories behind it because i know many women who have been forced to make that choice and i can not think of a single one where abortion was being used as a form of birth control i can not think of a single woman who was so irresponsible and selfish that they did not care about getting pregnant because abortion was an option thats so ridiculous it would be laughable if it wasnt so offensive and evil to sayand i firmly believe that the energy you put out into the world comes back to you and sadly i think thats what happened here i feel horrible for her and im shocked and disgusted that she was forced to endure that but sadly i dont think the experience has changed her ignorant thinking on abortion because apparently she is the judge of when it is acceptable yikes karma
stupid people doing stupid things  every vote matters even stupid ones too bad democracy in this country seems to work only if it results in a stupid outcome
no she wasnt forced to carry all she had to do was go to a state that allows abortion no body would have known anything about this  except for wanting attention
do republicans understand they are voting themselves out of exsistance  first they come for the gays next they come for you this is trrorism
they got what they voted for
funny how pro abortionist will cite this as a reason for legalizing abortion but they still want to be able to kill a perfectly healthy child for any reason
"biden may be doomed in 2024 by the electoral college can he really win arizona and georgia again and all of those gop candidates are bad the college is inherently unfair to the dnc despite trumps ironic claim that he was robbed 

he lost because he screwed up the covid response he won in 2016 despite losing the popular voteby two million votesto ms clinton and that election may have been stolen by collusion with the russians 

my solution democrats in deep south states where their votes count for little should move to texas and some of us northerners can retire there and marry african americans from almsla and oklahoma i would get a prenup the vast majority of aa are democrats these days if you know someone of a different ethnicity is a democratmarry them instead

florida democrats should  by the same token get hitched to atlanta dems florida has been a crucial swing state its too red nowadays gop governors there have refused to let felony exconvicts vote even today they are making them pay restitution to victims after they get out elitist doublejeopardy i sent money to actblue to help pay those fees 

and its not simply because of the above law either texas is the queen of the electoral chessboard if we steal itwe will have the whitehouse and the house basicallyforever 
it may eventually turn blue because of latinos obtaining citizenship in that state but that would take too long the senate is already blue but just barely so"
"you knowthe only blessing here albeit in deep disguise is that this shows how dangerous the gop isand what happens when dubya trump and the rest put a bunch of ayatollahs on our courts

we on the left bear some of the guilt too by refusing to back the late hubert humphrey because his boss lbj got us into vietnam or voting green party or sitting out the 2000 andor 2016 elections because we couldnt stomach moderate democrats 


i concur that ninth month abortions are by their very naturecontroversial

this when the sperm meets the egg crap however needs to go

among first world democracies we are almost alone in this type of lunacy"
absolutely disgusting these hypocritical right wing lawmakers push nonviable fetuses to be born why do people vote for these awful people
if you dont want an abortion dont have sex
god forbid you have the baby and love the baby until the baby passes  there are places that will help a family through something like this
this is an exception nonetheless its a human baby in utero something pro infanticide advocates never admit to they blatantly ignore biology pick and chose whats beneficial to the horrific agenda also careless adults use abortion as literally birth control which is wrong and irresponsible its the era of taking full accountability for ones actions
keep your legs shut and you dont have to kill baby
i looked for a really lovely interview ive seen from them and like four other couples who wanted a baby but had issues and texas refuse them abortions and the mothers were going to die and the babies were going to die and they still wouldnt do anything and i cant find those interviews anymore theyve been scrubbed from the internet they were well done and the couples got to tell their side of the story it was well done like very classy and everything but now its scrubbed off the internet and this is all i can find is pissing me the f off
when the power you held over men is then given to the state and leaves you powerless karma dealing with what men have dealt with for years abortion rights should have never been passed on lies which it was abortion should have never been used as a contraceptive for lazy people which it was
my sisterinlaw carried her baby that died one week prior to the due date my brotherinlaw bought her a little baby dress it was sad but dignified she was named cristy she was a baby she was buried she wasnt thrown away or ripped apart she was a human just like the rest of us
so the baby is only estimated to make it a year by that logic you should be able to muder any human as long as theyre less than a year old and just call it abortion diminished quality of life doesnt justify killing someone
question i know this may sound insensitive but why arent they going to other states where its still legal i know that in kentucky you can still get a pregnancy terminated if its an ectopic scenario even after the overturning of rvw
as a woman i refuse to deliver 920 babies in my lifetime  i have other plans 1 or 2 children and a career in engineering  id never live in a state in which politicians decide my life and death for me
she deems it necessary in her case how blind can she be
who did you vote for in 2016  elections have consequences
the baby should get that year to live rather than straight to heaven right away tho 
it sucks but at least this child got to pass away in the arms of her family instead of being ripped a part in the womb she will be given a proper burial and be mourned and her family mother especially will eventually heal from this tragedy if they have faith in gods plan it doesnt make sense to us now but one day it will this little girl is an angel baby now 
top tier karens who religiously take away peoples basic human rights in the voting booth its only unfair because it happened to them massive eye roll
so the citizens of texas can legally go out of state to have an abortion
this will never stop being funny that a trump voter is whining about not being able to get an abortion
new mexico does not have a cut off of a certain amount of weeks maybe that particular clinic has a rule but there are other clinics in the state and i love how she thinks she has the right to decide for other mothers if an abortion is needed or not no one is using abortion for birth control kylie i can tell they voted for these laws so let them suffer whatever consequence comes to them and stay tf out of new mexico we have enough people to serve and dont need any antiabortion hypocrites coming here when they suddenly realize that abortion is healthcare they deserve whatever comes to them
these antiabortion laws are the sort of sht that i would expect from groups like the taliban or isis its the christian version of sharia law astounding that these laws are being made by people who grew up in a supposedly modern advanced society the gop and religious right are living in the freaking dark ages and think they have the right to drag everyone else backwards too
" she was fine with forcing others to abide by her opinions 
karma 
may it continue to happen to pro lifers"
gop politicians if you want to be doctors  be doctors  if you want to be teachers be teachers  but goodness sake you dont have the knowledge of a doctor so you are hurting innocent people  you are scaring doctor so they cannot give the best care to pregnant woemn  i would imagine that we have the fewest medical students going into ob this year you intimidate teachrs so now we do not have enough teachers  the funny things is you are not doing the things the tax payers want you to do as politiicans like regulations for industryrrailroads and enforcement of regulations  you are all talk cruel hateful talk and no real positive action except for futher cheating to gerrymander and take away voting right s and that does not count  i am doing a search of all the stories of families have suffered already i have sent a letter to my governor about this issue  i guess i need to investigate further who has authority of making these laws that dont have the proper prodicol for women in an emergency situation they wanted to do something  they could have that from the ob doctors in a week so what kind of sick stunt  i wonder is there any gop party member who actually cares about the well being of his or her consituents  i think not  the democrats have been very helpful  i just dont get it  but i guess it has to do with the trump cult   i dont get that at all but clearly trump does not care about women and theri heath
not the whole true story but what does anyone expect from lying left wing marxist devolving abc in the forced socialist dystopia coming full scale in the 21st century
there is no restrictions on abortion in nm  why is she saying we have a cutoff of 23 weeks
"1 abortion bans do nothing women will always have the option of abortion whether its banned or not 
2 abortion bans actually increase the number of abortions ironically so i guess you people really arent about saving fetal lives so much as virtue signaling
3 fetuses now have a right that no other human being has and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another persons body to stay alive no other human has ever been granted that right even if you stab someone and theyre bleeding out and you have matching blood types the government cannot force you to give them your blood to keep them alive or if you use a mask gloves etc but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organs start shutting down the government cannot forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organs you used protection so the chances of giving this person the disease that youre a carrier for were very low but it still happened and now theyre dying because of you guess whatthe government does not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive thats exactly what an abortion ban attempts to do however so im not sure why fetuses should have that right when no one else does"
this story is concerning regarding kylies health and the precedent that texas law sets here regarding the rights to a fetus in babies with alobar holoprosencephaly many are stillborn and if they do survive the birthing process only 50 of patients survive by 45 months of age and 20 of these cases survive by 12 months of age 1 they also have major physical deformities including a single eye cyclopia epilepsy and seizures intellectual disability and problems regulating their own body temperature heart rate and breathing which requires them to spend their entire life in a hospital 3 this is a severe economic burden to the family and to the state and could be a major emotional burden to the family involved this is also without taking into consideration the dangers that come with childbirth especially when compared to the abortion that kylie was seeking the pregnancyassociated mortality rate among women who delivered live neonates was 88 deaths per 100000 live births the mortality rate related to induced abortion was 06 deaths per 100000 abortions 2 with that in mind i believe the laws in texas endangered kylies life and encroached on her medical autonomy and her ability to make a medical decision that was in her best interest and safety it could be said that kylie could just go out of state to get an abortion but this places undo financial hardship on a family when there are capable medical facilities much closer i understand that people might not agree that the risks to kylie here outweighed the fetuses right to life however i think one needs to consider the quality of life here i think the laws in texas as they stand could cause undo morbidity and mortality to mothers in kylies situation and encroach on ethical principles that are generally agreed upon in the medical community
welcome to the consequences of your beliefs interesting how these people think that abortion is primarily a form of birth control same people that ban the teaching of sexed at schools and discourage teenagers from having access to contraception that might prevent them from having to be in this situation they are now also looking at banning birth control pills we screamed at the top of our lungs for decades why reversing roe vs wade was a bad idea  now welcome to your consequences  when you think something like this cannot happen to you or your daughters in the future
as you can now see  the issue of abortions has never been about saving the baby  its been about some weird ultra christianity radical agenda that republicans have been pushing on all of us for decades now that the supreme court cracked the door open again republican doing you get to see states not thinking about the laws they are passing  they are passing extremely oppressive laws that never take into account that abortions are a medical procedure which is sometimes very necessary to save the mother or deal with complications that would let a child suffer unnecessarily with crippling defects that are sometimes horrific the crazy thing to me are all the republican women who still vote to keep these men who are taking away their rights in office do they never think such an issue can happen to them or their daughters a side effect of all this are the closing of delivery hospitals due to lack of qualified doctors because they are leaving for states that havent gone crazy  because why risk your medical license in a crazy state that wants to make you a criminal for performing a procedure  a procedure that is medically necessary a lot of the time what people forget is that row vs wade  was not opened ended  it had limitations as to when abortions was allowed and when it wasnt good luck red states hope you thought carefully about your choices  prepare yourselves for 2 things 1 increase in the deaths of pregnant women due to complications 2 dramatic decrease in people getting pregnant  because why risk it in a state you cant be guaranteed medical services if you needed them
"prolife means return women and girls to where they were before 1900 property of men

thats the current endgame for these singleissue activists its not a return to the traditional family its not a return to some moral standard that only exists in propaganda this is turning back the clock on women so their only station in life is pumping out white christian babies"
people only care when it happens to them did they think about the women who were raped and forced to keep the baby but since now its happening to them they say its not fair for women every decision made has an impact and sadly thats what it took for them to realize that
the typical people with the land tractors the food making capability and means of production of industrial works do not believe in abortion if the nonproductive people like to kill themselves and their young i guess what are we to say to that less welfare
i say let them abort its usually the ones we dont mind anyway
terminationsabortionsprocedures should be available to women its 2023 not 1923 cmon wealthy women have access if they choose but try to convince us that women should not have access to medical care
antiabortion people think women wake up everyday hoping well get pregnant just so we can rush to have an abortion it is a painful procedure that no woman wants to experience let alone do it over and over as a form of birth control sometimes it is necessary for many reasons and nonmedical professionals like politicians shouldnt have a say in it they are not qualified to say if it should happen
a life is a life
prayers for this family
ban abortion imprison anybody that wants it legal demons will respond negatively when you speak up for innocent babies
theyd rather a woman die from a dead fetus rotting away inside her because theyre not prolife theyre pro forced birth
wait a minute who has to pay the bill which can be tens of thousands of dollars once the baby is due this is so unfair im asking as a concerned neighbor from canada
there are always consequences to choices that involve forcing personal beliefs on others enjoy 
unless it affects the mother right as if the mothers mental health means nothing try carrying a dead baby to term and not lose your sanity jesus fucking christ
its wrong that women parents and children suffer because of a ban once a child is born no one will be there for it theres not enough resources and money to make sure every child is taken care of properly then you get cases of child neglect abuse or death because other people choose that it was wrong and a waste of life those same people arent there to raise the children born with health issuesproblems arent there to protect a child from an abusive parentguardianfoster parentadoptive parent they arent there when a child has to live like this poor baby or be there when a baby is carried full term only to diesuffer secondsminuteshours later due to a foreseeable illness that couldve been prevented if given an abortion later on unless it happens to you you dont think about other peoples lives till then its does effect everyone in the end more negative than positive
no joe or jane average should have any say in another persons medical choices period funny how conservatives think they get to control everything including other peoples choices
who cares thats what they voted for
"nobody should be forced to endure this horror sick mentally sick emotionally sick before god in heaven sick before us constitutional law cruel and inhumane grotesque it is sick that a minority in the us is being allowed to force their sick unbiblical religious beliefs onto the majority of us citizens its unconstitutional

prepare to witness this and other horrors over and over and over again just like we did in the 20s 30s 40s 50s and 60s women will die unnecessarily because of these situations and their babies will die along with them"
i tell everyone whose pro life in their politics this is why im pro choice politicallybanning abortions leads to health complications and poorer health services for women through studying countries with complete abortion bans we can see it leads to nothing good for women
this is so sad and not right i cant believe this is happening in america
butbutfreedumb what a joke
good it should never be ok to slaughter unborn babies for your own selfish benefit
no one is forcing her go to a midwife and get misoprostol put it in your vag and it will release the baby
the only moral abortion is my abortion this is what you voted for
birth control is to prevent pregnancy if youre pregnant is not birth control abortion is not birth control
it is so hard to see these people struggle with the loss of their baby and now on top of that this woman must wait to become sick before she can get help the abortion laws are getting out of hand the government is sentencing women to the brink of death before allowing medical professionals to intervene and putting healthcare providers between a rock and a hard place however what is the government doing to provide women of childbearing age with the resources to prevent getting pregnant in the first place the answer is nothing obtaining birth control can cost hundreds of dollars a year something some people cant afford sexual education classes are being criticized and removed from schools not allowing the public to gain information and make informed decisions now in south carolina a bill is being considered that a woman can be eligible for the death penalty if she receives an abortion i struggle to see how this is beneficial for anybody these laws infringe on patient autonomy making it difficult for medical providers to care for these women because they will also be punished this is one time that laws and medicine should not be mixed because it has poor patient outcomes who is responsible for the patients medical providers are not the government more dangerous things are happening in the country like gun control and school shootings that are on the rise that needs to be addressed first not a womans health that should be between her and her doctor only
its important to remember that abortion is healthcare and there are many reasons why somebody may need or want to have an abortion regardless of the reason pregnancy even the most uncomplicated ones can cause adverse health effects and no one should be forced to make a healthcare decision they dont want to i also want to address that the vast majority of people receiving abortions are not using it as birth control the bronx abortion clinic reported that about fifty percent of the women who receive abortion used some time of birth control in addition more than fifty percent of the women receiving abortions had never had one before while i want to emphasize that not all abortions are because of unplanned pregnancies this should not limit abortions to only those cases some people who have unplanned pregnancies may want to continue with it but if they do not it is unethical to make someone continue a pregnancy this will violate many peoples autonomy if they have no choice in what changes occur to their body
republicans always always vote _against_ themselves then blame the left for everything bad in their life
what about if the pregnancy is ectopic thats a situation where the baby absolutely cannot survive and the mother could bleed to death
this is what voting for greg abbot gets us 
the fact that she said i dont believe in it as a form a birth control just goes to show the lies conservatives are told
"texas mother banned from saying welp kids gonna die anyway so we might as well torture and butcher im to death for grins and giggles ftfy

there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to torture children to death if your threeyearold were dying of cancer would you proceed to dismember and disembowel them or would you put them on pain meds and hold their hand until the end like a normal human being who is actually capable of love why should it be any different for any child younger than that"
thats really sad
lol you got what you asked for 
she says that she doesnt see it as a way of birth control but if she does it while pregnant shes literally controlling a birth by stopjng it from happening
karma is a bitch
its a baby no matter what carry that baby and nurture it best you can as long as you are healthy and god will take care of the rest just because it doesnt have a brain doesnt mean you can decide to abort it
i believe it was said before that its easy to have beliefs but its difficult when those beliefs conflict with your or your family rightsfreedoms
welcome to the consequences of voting for an abortion ban you are at the receiving end of what you voted for stop complaining  this woman lacks compassion for other women who needs or wants an abortion is the root of her problem
this is the america yall want so whats the problem
huh maybe we should be prochoice
this sickens me soo much dont people get it these laws hurt women
"be careful what you wish for vote for
hypocrites its good for me but not for thee
welcome to your own nightmare"
thank u abc for bringing to us extreme cases and play with emotions how about you bring the many women  who have abortion after a one night stand and couldnt be bothered
everything that has breathe praise the lord 
glory to god for life 
thank god im australian were so sorry 
people need to see that sometimes abortions are necessary
when she calls it a procedure what she means is an abortion is healthcare
no men or women in cults should be allowed to determine the health for all other women
its disgusting the greed and selfishness of other people i dont even have to watch it to know this is evil anyone against abortions are evil and here is why medically they are needed for things like this not every pregnancy is healthy and can survive say a mother has 5 kids already and now a 6th on the way and the baby passes she gets septic she dies thats 5 other children without a mother because her choice was taken from her no its not the case for every pregnancy but thats where its up to the individual you are a pos if your getting abortions because your irresponsible not because a rape an accident from failed prcations im taking about your 24 in because you cant be responsible which at that point you shouldnt be having sex but thats not always the case there are cases where a child being born can subject them to more suffering then living theres documented cases look them up im not here to make you grow as a person and change your mind im here to explain that your very close minded and ignorant to have to go through these things in order to understand they are real after some easy googling can educate and save lives and or prevent them for the better  its evil to subject people to this
"im so sick and tired of people saying abortion isnt birth control no one anywhere is having unprotected sex under the thought of oh ill just pop into the abortion clinic next monday

also im lowkey loving that people like her are part of the take responsibility for your actions crowd guess what sweetie youre learning about the consequences of your actions you voted for these laws you got em"
she voted prolife and thats what she got she only had compassion for herself and not other women that desperately needed abortions across the country no sympathy for her
never in a million years would we expect yeah exactly you didnt think this could happen to you the rest of us know it can happen to anyone
i know people who have suffered due to her voting i hope she knows the consequences of her actions to the fullest
hurts my heart that voters cant imagine instances like these where abortion is necessary until it affects them personally how ignorant i do feel very sad for their family though
that is so tragic im so sorry for your heart break
this is absolute insanity
this is what i try to get people to understand about abortion but people wanna stand on their views because they know better but they wont get it til they go through it 
these people are literally sad because they cannot kill their child if you stop to think about it thats what this actually is its a tragedy that the baby has abnormalities but ultimately they want to destroy the baby because they are scared of having to deal with a child with abnormalities who the doctor said wont live long their solution kill it what has society become
living in texas is living in a fascist state  our republican government is ruining what once was a great state
everything happens for a reason i hear so many stories of things like this happening to upper middle class white texas families they change their tune on abortion pretty quick i have little sympathy for them because they made their own bed my husband and i talked extensively about issues that could arise with pregnancy and birth before we even tried to get pregnant
please contact me i will gladly adopt your child i live in illinois my oldest son was diagnosed with alobar holoprosephencephaly when i was 3 months pregnant the doctors insisted i abort and they continuously said to be prepared for when he took his first breath of real air he would die let me tell you he is now 12yrs old every obstacle and deadline they gave him he surpassed with flying colors each and every time if you dont want your baby because of the chance and challenges that will come with every child give him to someone who will love them unconditionally as a mom of 3 2 of which are special needs in two very different ways just give them a chance at life because you never know what they can accomplish with love and support around them
and these dumb politicians think they know it all unbelievable plus people uninformed
terminating an abortion because the baby will potentially be disabled 
so much for freedom in your country disgusting and barbaric
totally misleading title watch the whole video the pregnancy is still viable and the baby is not dead in the womb
they look like they can afford a plane ticket to another state or drive so get over it take precautions not to get knocked up in texas next time dont like it you are free to move out
that poor unborn fetus has my sympathy they should never be put through any of this those parents however i have no more pity for people who cant see something as a problem until it stops at their front door maybe they should have thought about this before they went in to vote away their rights as parents
im so sorryprayers be with you 
its easy to say im anti abortion in all instances and tell everyone else that they are evil until you hear these stories very few topics are black or white good or evil  and people need to know that there is nuance to things lets expand access to birth control and  stop women using abortion as such
i understand political pro life agenda what is behind it and why they push it but every day person especially women who vote for this seem truly stunted in their critical thinking any women voting for this not getting that they can end up in situations they dont want that can kill them that can harm their children not just the one your pregnant with if you already have children they will be scarred too men who vote for this not realizing that women in their families their wives can end up here how rotten you must be to want your partner and your child to suffer when you can avoid it deluded evil people
this is bs as in not true people really need to do research there is a very clear difference between a nonviable fetus and a healthy fetus that is likely to come to term it is possible she may have to carry to term for health reasons as the pregnancy may be to far along and this is the safest option so thank abc for being full of it
but i didnt know leopards would eat my face says woman who voted for the leopards eating peoples faces party
im embarrassed to live in texas and cant wait to get out  everything sux for everyone everywhere in america well except for like 7 families   and i accidentally watched this otherwise i dont trust any news outlet
i thought almost all states dont allow abortions that far along its hard to pretend its just a bunch of cells my babies started kicking not too far beyond that
i pray for them and their baby and that they give him the most love they possibly can during the life span he has
shouldve not had that sex if you were not ready for the consequences
yessssss right it was all cozy in the sheets so take responsibility
there it is in a nutshell how quickly the conservative republicans want to back track once they feel the heat of their own decisions  brain dead monkeys 
if the child does die youngat least you did right by him by loving him and fighting for him
doctor says abort 1 of 3 because pregnancy is dangerousmom said no  mom has 3 healthy happy babies
last man in iron lung doctor said he was dead to tb  another doctor takes him puts a tube in and places him in the iron lung  he lived  he became a lawyer and wrote a book  he is alive today you love your child but to an extent  thats not unconditional you never give up  especially with your child
thats your son and you dont want to give him a chance  thats sad you wouldnt fight because doctors have been wrong a lot
people have no idea how many times a doctor has said there is no hope and the person thrived  you abort that child you give them zero chance
thats crazy
i know the catholic position is human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception and in summary from the first moment of his existence a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person catholics and protestants often cite passages from exodus 20 for why they believe human life begins earlier than birth even if you accept their argument its pretty stupid to force women to carry nonviable pregnancies these by definitions cannot form human life i just dont see the point often times i can see some self consitancy with people i disagree with for example many war mongers just want more land and a larger taxbase this might not be great for everyone involved but i understand their position the law is just stupid even if you believe a fetus is a person the best non viable preganncies can do outside the womb is maybe have some cells live on as a collection of cell culture to be used for research purposes although the scientific value of these might be dubious since a tissue culture of kidney fibroblast hepatocyte or myocyte from a nonviable pregnancy might be different than a sample from a baby
this video title is fallacious the pregnancy was viable by definition
"honestly i dont really feel bad for her 
i do feel bad for women that didnt want or choose to have their rights stripped from them 
this woman is part of the problem and only figured it out when her pregnancy wasnt viable  
i told my husband that the only way these republicans were going to figure it out was when it happens to them guess what"
unfortunate but you get what you vote for
we cheer with every freedom taken away the insanity of our new republican religious police state america
for people who are against abortion that is your right you can be against it that does not mean you can force others to have the same stance that is their right you can believe it is imoral and murder but you have no right to another persons body for those that are against it for religious beliefs thats fine but not everyone has the same religious beliefs i could be wrong here as i have not been church since i have been old enough to make my own choices that i do not follow those beliefs but it is gods job to deal with those that sin not yours so you csn belief these people are doing wrong and sinning but its still not your place to do anything about it instead trust in your god and let them handle it
i believe a woman should be able to do what she wants to do with her body i just had to do an abortion and its something i have always said i would never do especially since i always thought i couldnt have children circumstances change i have 3 children my youngest just turned 5 months me and my family live in a 2 bedroom apartment and only my husband is working now we possibly cant keep the baby as much as it tears my husband and is heart its something we know is the best for our family and we will try again once we are where we need to be i feel for any woman now a days who cant get what they need to get done in order to live healthy happy lives
and when women start dying from sepsis because they have a dead fetus rotting inside of them and they cant have it removed because the law views it as abortion yall conservatives are gonna beg for abortion to be legalized again
thats cruel
girl bye karma got you for your hypocrisy for those who dont know the full story this woman suffers from pcos it comes with complications of conceiving alone in the 1st place and other factors regardless your political affiliation  religion abortion is necessary it is a life saving medical procedure now imagine for a moment all surgeries are ban sounds ridiculous right because it is i swear people are beyond stupid today
you reap what you sow
do we euthanize terminal cancer patients simply because their condition is incompatible with life it is barbaric to kill a child because of a birth defect his life belongs to god there should be hospice care and palliative care teams helping parents in these situations prepare for the loss they will grieve for their child regardless let it be in the midst of lifeaffirming moments instead of death inducing procedures
everyone wants to focus on rape and incest  it happened to me i had to terminate a pregnancy that wasnt going to make it to the end and everyone ignored me
sorry but i agree with her ive known so many women that use abortion as birth control situations like this the abortion is warranted as well as situations where the moms life is at risk period some of yall are murderers
good for her she went through with exactly what she believed in  hope people like her go through with it a thousand times  they are the ones that put other women through all the pain and suffering
the title of this video is inaccurate and deceptive the pregnancy is not nonviable carrying nonviable pregnancy to term is an oxymoron the doctor said that the infants usually do not live to the age of 1 she didnt say they usually die in utero this is a baby with a disability that sadly has a short life expectancy calling the pregnancy nonviable is untrue this baby deserves a shot at life like every other baby
sooooo did she get rid of it whats the outcome were left with a cliffhanger
i think everyone needs to cut her some slack
can you believe they have a daughter and voted for this insanity now they are scared for her noe they hate the law they helped pass someone please explain this level of cognitive dissonance my brain just doesnt grasp this kind of hypocrisy and ignorance
see up until 252 i felt bad for you now i feel like you got what you deserved abortions arent only for birth control and even if they were its not up to you to decide what happens to other womens bodies enjoy this taste of your own medicine
develop all this technology to save yourself and then just go back i mean were not evolving were regressing
so she wants to abort a nearly full term baby because he will be handicap and die young but she doesnt think other women with different circumstances shouldnt be allowed
i want to feel bad for her but i dont she voted for this with no regard for any other women she didnt care until it started affecting her abortion bans are awful for everyone not just some women
if you vote for other women to not be able to have an abortion for whatever reason they want to how can you be mad when you are denied the right to
you can always go to another state if you feel the need to terminate
stop saying procedure its an abortion
she still deems what is considered ok to get an abortion thats the problem people deeming what other people should do husband seemed more empathetic with women than her she should make changes in her beliefs
i do not feel bad for her at all she voted for this now feel the consequences
so heartbreaking for this family im tragedies like this we should have the right to choose  god bless
interesting how people think that aborting a healthy and viable baby is comparable to aborting a nonviable pregnancy and therefore this woman is a hypocrite what its totally not the same thing
ancephaly is always used by abortion advocates  it is extremely rare  if mom is perfecty healthy she should carry baby to birth  baby is alive in there let baby live life god has willed  its tragic for parents but we all know pregnancy is a risk
they said with the baby condition it has less then a year to live hopefully thats true because the child was not meant to be born the pro sadist movement only wanted the child born so he can suffer i hope something goes wrong and the child is not born honestly if a woman is not going to have an abortion i hope they miscarry
good karma its what she deserves who cares
some parents go that extra mile and step up to try to give their baby the best life it can have while it can have it and others choose to throw it away bc they arent perfect how tragic and dont even flippin say i have no idea what theyre going through bc i do but i chose to give my baby life despite her severe birth defects
shes anti abortion just getting a taste of her own medicine
this is a hold regardless it was conceived out of love id want to be able to at least hold my child this is truly heartbreaking
they still voted for trump and abbott
"there are certain instances where i deem that it is necessarybut youre pro life and all life is sacred right oh but you see it as necessary because it will affect you got it so all life is sacred until it negatively affects you guys cool hypocrites 

this is what they voted for and now theyre looking for sympathy gtfo

i hope they remember that jesus is watching lol"
"that is a flat out lie
to expect doctors would intervene in this case is ridiculous"
the husband couldnt imagine  hmmm
maybe lets vote for political figures who care instead of those who makes laws who hurt people
republicans are monsters why force this trauma on people people can make decisions for themselves my heart hurts for them
vote to change law keep speaking about it to others for more change
why not go somewhere else to get help though shes not a prisoner of texas
literally no one uses it as birth control you are pro choice sweetie if people using it as birth control is your worry then vote for free 99 effective birth control instead of free condoms at a health department that are hardly used properly yall voting for the wrong thing abortion is a medical procedure that has been stripped away from doctors and interpreted into political opinions
personal choice  it cant be ok for you but not for others
this is so difficult to go through and sad that your baby has not developed normally you need to be aware that this beautiful baby is still a baby and not to be discarded  terminated or aborted this baby is precious and all life should be loved and nurtured the baby might not have a long life but you need to give the baby as much love as possible in this short period loving holding your babykissing and talking with it whether one has a baby with a heart defects abnormal  body missing limbs or any other disability the baby deserves to be loved and nurtured and a chance of life
be careful what you vote for people  you have to read it all the politicians are sneaky and well are not always honest and forthright  so heartbreaking
it may be a moot point as more and more obgyns ditch the profession or move out of states like texas sadly women and children in rural areas will bear the brunt of that
i told my other half he needs to go get his colonoscopy 3 states away his response what for i live here i should be able to get the care i need its between me and my doctor same thing with abortion people stop sticking your nose into peoples medical procedure im pro minding your own business thanks
that is barbaric and inhumane that woman must have been so depressed
non medical people making medical decisions just like many health insurance companies judges and politicians whos going to help folks pay for the health care in cases like these how much money is in the state or federal budget for pre post natal care
isnt this what women like her voted for
shed those tears mommy
"does anyone in the comments know these two people personally no none of you know a fuckin thing about what these people are having to go thru this womans life will be in danger until after she delivers then they saddled with the amount of care this child will need until it passes if it lives after a couple months theyre looking at millions of dollars in medical debt for a terminally sick child all because she couldnt get the care she needed at the time she needed it not one of you mouthy overly opinionated  undereducated freaks would be able to do any better i pray everyday that our country doesnt fall into the hands of the oh so enlightened woke people bc the second it does were all fucked id like to see a tax or some kind of something that would be enough to regulate bullshit and promote truth and facts  



sits back to watch the shitshow this is about to be lmfao "
but why do something that later affects you   like stay abstinent or sterilize yourself if you dont want a poor innocent child
i understand where she is coming from but i do know of some women who have gotten 4 or 5 abortions just because they didnt feel like having children everyone should have the choice to choose what they can do to their bodies but some people abuse it
"i hate when they call it a rare condition because there are thousands of these rare conditions and cumulatively they are not that rare almost a year ago on the 21 week ultrasound my wife and i found out that that the baby had a severe skeletal dysplasia with small ribs and undeveloped lungs and would suffocate to death after birth 

weve met many other people with very similar stories from other rare conditions it can happen to anyone trying to have children"
us presidential candidate we are all human here we know that if there is complications with birthing then the law doesnt apply to that one civilian the law is to put order in chaos doctors mediate with congress gods watching here in the us we live by the ten commandments we do not kill here in the us i received karma in my dreams for abortions god has spoken with scientific truth but salvation of life is law as well saving lives is the positive karmic debt
whos to say that this child wont come out normal and live a normal life
"so this girl ashley  and i had been friends since freshman year during summer we began spending more time together we hooked up just one time thats all it takes i have to note that at that time i was in and out of jail on probation fighting cases and before i turned 18 id go away for 2 years in prison i was reckless and knew i wouldnt make a good bf we both had grown some feelings for each other  hers more than mine but once she found out she was pregnant and told me  i honestly began really thinking about changing my life my feelings grew for her and i was willing to grow up and be a dad and bf she allowed other people to get in her head and behind my back she went and got an abortion i found out from someone else a couple weeks after i was crushed even though i lived a rough life and could be violent towards men at that time i was always real gentle with kids and wanted one that baby literally couldve saved my life because i would end up doing a total of 6 12 years locked up not caring about anything or anyone later on at 28 i would get engaged to a single mom we didnt work out but i still talk to the kids im 35 and still no kids single etc havent been in trouble since 2014 and live a normal life sorta havent dated since though most people have kids at my age and getting close to kids and breaking up is probably the worst thing ive been through and thats saying a lot idk i hate abortion because you deprive the world and others of a life that could possibly change things for the better sorry for the long story ive never talked about this before thank you for asking this felt kinda therapeutic to think and write about it

side note the abortion had a negative effect on ashley she started partying doing drugs and became promiscuous we ran into each other when i was fresh out at 22 she was a stripper then and her life was chaos she later got pregnant and had her son which totally calmed her down and now she seems to be a good mom i think hes 78  just wanted to point out that abortion hurt both of us"
good time to hold you ladies to higher standard condoms and birth control exist for a reason lets not act like you ladies arent abusing abortion for a birth control maybe we need to start making better decisions and choices
so the states are already overwhelmed with too many children they cant care for and thats all that this is going to do is add to that problem so the people who so badly want this to be legal will be the ones who end up so badly having to figure out what to do about the mess that they made and the children will suffer for it
they try to control women and their body but men who love family suffer too it seems just jerks are happy in this scenario for forcing others to live with their stupidness and biases we came back to hundred years ago technology doesnt bring us forwards our mentality and respect to other human rights bring us forward saudi arabia has technology but they live in the past our society started to backward
texas got what it wants full control over women taliban texas
i am sorry did you say non viable uh wow sorry dear we lost as well
im so sorry women have to deal with this no government or judge should have the right to play doctor unless they have a degree as a doctor
these people definitely sound like republicans you get what you vote for
i understand the want to terminate in this case  in texas when something like this happens you go out of state im a christian and i vote for republican all the way abortion is a fine line however i think its more of a moral issue i think we should have the choice i believe we should have the personal choice that we then have to live with for the rest of our lives and in my christian beliefs we then will be judged by our maker for that choice it should still be a choice its freedom and the lord gave us freedom every choice however has a consequence the problem is the women that use abortion as birth control happens far too often this is murder
why are they even on tv they made a stupid vote they can enjoy it
ew shut up hypocrites live with your votes
when did the government have rule over an individuals body  its like the twilight zone or another dimension existing in various dimensions humans are just the energy particles experiencing and observing all at once 
gone back to the middle ages
you reap what you sow lady so you should have the option because of your specific circumstance but other women and their circumstances dont count hypocrite
im so glad i live in a country where i get to choose
this is why it should be a womans choice it is our bodies
you never know what god can do maybe that baby will be healedto make a decision to end his life is foolish no one has even laid their eyes on him in person he is still growing and everything peoplewhat are you thinking
criticizing and therefore ostracizing this woman isnt the way to build bridges or make progress none of us are perfect and we have different life experiences and points of view support would be a much more productive approach
thank god i was born and raised in north carolina and there is no rule against getting a abortion thank you north carolina tbh more woman should move here to have there babies if something goes wrong like this tragedy nobody can stop you from terminating the pregnancy
"to me its an example of one extreme to another abortion whenever use it as birth control its a right to sorry carry that dead baby to term oh youll die if you remain pregnant  too bad  ive yet see anyone argue abortion is wrong unless the mother could due  ectopic pregnancies for example shes raped  surely theres a way to know if shes lying and this though i know after a certain point theyd induce labor this thoughoh sorry watch the baby die after birth 
though the whole have compassion argument people are using is just a bandaid to me  ok have compassion for the life growing inside you rather than think kill it cue the responsibility argument another bandaid  nothing will change because of this one extreme to another  mindset"
"conservatives if you got pregnant now you will bear the consequences for your actions you should have closed your legs
since you are so obsessed with the consequences of your actions you are now suffering the consequences of your actions  voting for an antiabortion law

hypocrites"
look what youve done america we are in 2023 you have created a world for women that you have gone to war over what a woman does with her body is between her and her doctor you have become your enemy in more ways than one
sorry not sorry live with your actions  maybe your dead baby will end up killing you  one less idiot in this world
god bless you both and protect you and your family it is an unimaginable tragedy to think that your own republican congressmen are taking this decision out of the hands of you and your physicians is an abomination i pray for your health and safetyand that your repub congressmen somehow are enlightened to the scientific facts of your case and so many others gods main lesson has always been to love one another he also said judge not lest you be judged i am so fed up with these bible beating repubs trying to use the bible against the others as they see them they have clearly not read the entire bible 
i have never met a woman who uses abortion as a form of birth control many of them used condoms that either failed or were intentionally tampered with or realized their birth control wasnt working as a result of illness or antibiotics and they werent excited for an abortion either smh i cant with these people
"not enough gas to drive to the next state over
gimme a break"
im still prolife  this story does not change my mind
250 abortion isnt used as birth control quit saying that birth control doesnt cost thousands of dollars people who say im against it being used as birth control are brainwashed
this couple is delusional  they dont even know what theybare saying also they said the procedure cost 10 to 15 thiusand dollars in colorado and it was out of the question but they want to have more kids even when they dont have 10k in the bank poor mentality
i voted for the leopards eating peoples faces party but i never thought leopards would eat my face
hmmm something tells me this story isnt telling us the truth also abortion are murder heart beat means life
it wasnt a medical emergency she wasnt dying women lose babies at birth all the time no one wants to talk about that if she didnt know guess what she wouldve gave birth instead of ripping the baby out in piecesshe should be happy she got to see her baby outside the womb and show love for the last time and bury him properly
wheres your coverage on this story live action
this is so absurd why people are electing these horrible politicians
your american taliban
looks like the shoes on the other foot
im against using abortion as a form of birth control  so if some girl was raped and impregnated through rape you believe she must be forced to carry out her pregnancy the reason shouldnt matter let a woman decide period
im not for abortion in cases where people were irresponsible but this is an obvious case come on common sense
hmm not sad for her at all now i am supposed to care about what they want you helped to take away our choicevoting has consequences
let me get this straight she isnt carrying a dead baby but a baby that will eventually die at the age of one
shes concerned now because its effecting her
so the problem here is that two parents view the difficulty of an otherwise normal pregnancy as a burden because the baby might live long enough to be an inconvenience am i missing something or is that the big story here the big story is that people who identify as pro life became pro choice because of personal inconvenience theres no concern for their child this illustrates why abortion needs to be criminalized in texas for everyone who participates in an abortionnot just the abortionist  human life has been reduced to viability based on convenience we are in a bad way we need to become abolitionist not pro life its a term that has lost its meaning
horrible law by america
they should put abortion on the ballot in every state
"is it illegal to go to another state and get an abortion genuinely curious

not trying to invite people to do it but id rather travel to a country where its legal like mexico its legal safe and cheap"
the high cost of living
you could come to new york state and gotten an abortion he will do abortions if theres something wrong with the baby up until the day ofyou could come to new york state and gotten an abortion he will do abortions if theres something wrong with the baby up until the day of the babys first anybody watching desk that read this comment and you need help because your state will not allow you to have an abortion new york state will provide it for you free of charge they will give you a new york state medicaid so that you can get your procedure done there are places that the clinics know that get donations to pay for your plane ticket they will pay for your hotel dental places that ketchel nations that pay for everything associated with your travel to new york state the procedure itself aftercare and the way home do not go through something like this because you feel you have no other option new york state will 100 do the procedure for you and there are places that will help pay for your travel if you cant new york state allows abortion up to the day of birth even if your past your due date and they find that something is wrong with your baby and your baby is unable to survive and has a terminal condition even if youre in labor they will perform the procedure for you there was a big thing on it it has not been decided by the supreme court its still allowed to happen do not feel like you have no place to go new york state will help you i wish i knew of this video or knew of her need i would have told her and helped
so real guys men and women too who voted for this live n fantasy world makes me sick im so sorry for her
this is political propaganda so her child is ill thats not a justification for slaughtering thousands of children out of total convenience and selfishness abortion was murder before her child started developing properly and it will be murder afterwards interview a person who survived abortion and was healthy and is now disabled because mom didnt want to be a mom
you can order the abortion pill online from aid access
some women thinking it never happen to me until it came  and than anger crying  that what happen when this women dont involved fight for their right  one apples is rotten in a basket soon the rest of the apples will also rotten to fungus
i bet this family wish they didnt live in the state of texas wonder if they thinking about moving out of it like other families and people are doing getting the hell up out of there relocating to another state
honestly i dont wish these things on anyone im staunchly pro choice i dont care why you choose an abortion i hate that it took this for someone to understand why these bans are devastating to more than just the type of women you think need to learn the consequences of sex but im heartbroken for them anyway im a mom i have two boys i love them so much could i imagine ever choosing an abortion no do i see every day how it may be the only right option to alleviate suffering for mom and or baby yes i do rather we think its wrong or right i believe thats between the individual and god and its above my pay grade abortion is healthcare and women deserve access to it
god punishes the ignorant and this family is lucky that that doctors saved them from their own hypocrisy  selfish brainwashed morons 
forced to you would have had to if you lived off the land like humans used to you would have had to done this anyways and why not is it so horrible to see your own child at least one time before burying them hold them kiss them you know be a human not just discard it like a bad tuna sandwich stop playing victim this is the natural order of life
is the baby growing does it have a heart beat or is she carrying a lifeless baby she has to keep the baby inside her cant she get sick or something go wrong
"lawmakers cannot be this stupid 
make 1 law that allows to remove a dead baby that miscarrieddied naturally 

a 2nd law that prevents killing a live baby 

stupid stupid stupid"
it is legal is other states  always choose life  these rare cases dont justify millions of lost healthy babies  abortion is not birth control btw  not the same thing at all 
good for the baby it will have a name there will be challenges but the lord will show the parents a strength they arent even aware they have to help their son or daughter praise the lord for the life he gives us freely
"miscarriage is not the same as murdering an unborn baby 
1 baby dies naturally
the other is alive  murdered 
damn people are stupid"
this is what happens when our basic human rights are violated by very stupid men and a corrupt supreme court full of mysoginists shameful and beyond idiotic
i voted for the leopards eating my face party and now leopards are eating my face and i dont like it
they not going to let you carry a dead baby just stop the propaganda
sounds like a bs story
you get what you vote for now that it is in your laps instead of in the laps of yet another nameless faceless family that you never have to meet speak to or understand now its a problem i feel so bad for the baby who will suffer without any good reason because of these laws and the beliefs of people like you that directly contribute
bless her soul so tough
this is absolutely fucking devastating
never in a million years did i think id be  the one going through this yup exactly the issue this is how we end up with bs laws not grounded in reality
i hate texas
your baby has a medical issue and you want to abort at 6 months pregnant wtf if wrong with people
lol its what yall voted  for
carry it to term then let the baby die naturallyno meds nothing
"she got what she voted for if 15000 for the colorado abortion was too much wait until they get the bill for the inevitable csection and nicu

no sympathy whatsoever for this hateful the only moral abortion is mine modernday version of eris"
thank you joe biden for taking our rights away
abortions are health care for women
i went thru the same thing sorry to say my situation was in 1981
that is soo sad 
they need to go back and change these laws its our bodies and no one should have the right to tell us what we can and cant do with them  i feel so bad for her and can you imagine the mental health issues she will have after this and lasting so long  like how stupid is this law  it makes me so angry
and she still cant empathize lol oh christians 
abortion is our right has females
forcing a woman to carry and birth a baby that wont have a good quality of life or that will suffer is just wrong i dont believe in carrying a fetus full term then termination before it takes its first breath but i do believe that if a woman decides early on that she doesnt want the pregnancy its her body her choice
obviously shes not a believer because doctors can be hella wrong my cousin was supposed to be a down syndrome and she came out normal god created that baby for a reason this couple is a coward and weak even if the child is born with the brain abnormality so what you still love the child and be there for the baby again god created this beautiful life for a reasonthe enemy knows this child is powerful thats why he is trying to take him out parents get your butt into church and start learning about the lord and his miracles because obviously you have no clue how to live in this world this is as deep as i can hash it to yall i pray for your soul and i pray for that sweet precious baby inside you to turn out healthy like my cousin whom the doctors were wrong about
probably wouldnt have happened if the baby killers werent out celebrating murdering babies and putting on parades and stuff
this is more harmful than an abortion would be
abortion is no different than murder you want to legalize abortion you might just as well legalize murder you are an american you have the unenviable right to avoid all responsibility for your actions even if you have to kill your own child in the womb before it is legally born is essentially legalized abortion incidentally my mom wanted to have an abortion when she was carrying my sister in her womb but changed her mind after she got to the clinic she left the waiting room before it was her turn i cannot conceive of how different my life would be like if i had never known my sister and neither can my mom my sister also suffers from severe mental health issues shes lived for decades needing even the most basic care because she is incapable of taking care of herself but she is the sweetest human being weve ever known she has saved our lives with her cheerfulness more than once imagine how many good lives will never be lived because they were deliberately severed in the womb before birth i cannot feel any differently about this matter
"my question is why all these gynaecologists were silent when the laws were passed why some politician brainwashed by religion should be allowed to make such a choice 
are we going back to a stone age because this is definitely not a democracy when instead of medical professional we listen to religious demagogues"
your perfectly free to travel out of texas for an abortion no one is forcing you to carry a baby nor to live in texas
i would carry that precious baby i lost my daughter at almost 4 months pregnant  and got pregnant again and we lost that baby in you worry about carrying that baby i lost my daughter and the day she left this earth was may 21st wish i had more time carrying  because i still cry everyday  and for our baby we just lost jan 15th i do anything to have them both back 
its absolutely cruel these laws are crazy to have no type of exceptions cant believe women voted for that
this is such a tragedy for this family to go through a full term pregnancy just for more sadness in the end god protect this queen and her family 
as a texan myself i feel sorry for all the women living in this state
my heart cannot handle another pregnancy
lol so youre telling me women have to put their life and their kids life at risk over some dude being able to bust a  bahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahah  and women still give it up all you have is to blame yourself no wonder they say women are stpd
they voted pro life and now they are still against a womans right to choose but complaining that they have no choice here go figure
the decisions regarding  a womans womb need to be done by the woman and her medical caregivers  only males who support this stance have a part in the discussions  if you do not have a viable womb butt out  if you are not a certified medical caregiver for the female butt out unless invited keep your praying prying protective and creepy hands off of a womans body
sounds horrible but you reap what you sow
thats what you voted for now you want to leave the state to get an abortion what about the women who cant afford to do that
i dont wanna see any shocked faces
new mexico is a safe state still
there is nothing crazy about carrying a terminally ill living child to term hopefully it will form bonds honor the babys life and provide closure there is no way around the sadness losing a baby is awful
omg how sad but be hard and omg this hearts my soul 
if the baby is dead or killing you then that is one story if it is a child that you dont want to care for selfish and a list if you decide to kill it
lets just get the laws out of womens uteruses already side note it is interesting that we dont need to know if a trans person has had surgery down there in order to respect there identity but yet we so openly have on trial womens uteruses honestly it should just be between a woman and her gynecologist 
move to california you can kill a baby at any age
stop voting for republicans and you wont have this problem
this woman never expected to be at the receiving end of her own judgments
what i dont get is why is the husband afraid for his wife what would be different physically about giving birth to a baby who doesnt live long vs one who does
im very sorry for the loss you both must be feeling i hope that somehow despite the politics you can make your sweet baby boy feel all of your love for as long as he is growing and living i wish the outcome would have been different but if he is born and does live with you for whatever time is his i hope he feels the love of his mom  dad and you feel his love too
  no words sending healing  loving vibes your way
"she wants an abortion but doesnt think other women should be able to choose one 

husband its not fair for her sir it is not fair for any woman"
to me even though this woman realized her mistake she is still disturbing to me no one should be able to decide what happens in and to someone elses body
personally id carry an give my son the best year he had on this earth with tons of love he wouldnt have to be perfect to the rest of the world
heartbreaking all the way around no one deserves this situation especially not that baby
well thank the pro life maga conservative for over turning roe v wade and passing these bans as if this wont affect real people
you get what you vote for unfortunately
i agree with her abortion is not birth control
in my country abortions are legal so i have no issue there but if states are going to make it illegal if the baby is not going to survive and will have no quality of life if it does then teminations should be allowed for medical reasonseg brain dead child
yea its not a big enough issue to turn the abortion ban around sounds like a 1 in 10000000 problem keep trying 
i think abortion should be available for those women who get raped but those that have a relationship and want abortion is wrong because in the first place there is protection and like this family just because the doc says something is wrong with the kids whether the kid has mental or physical problems does not mean get rid of the child its called being a parent and dealing with the kid
christian didnt think about this when they decided to push their dumb fake beliefs this is why idiots should not run or countrynation selfish greedy they shouldve known inbreeds would have issues like this cantcontroleverything
why do americans still allow old white men to make decision and control an american womans life  you cant cherry pick either your for it or against it
voting has consequences maybe people will start to understand that they are subject to those consequences as well quit voting for candidates who feel its their right to dictate their illogical beliefs on everyone
fucking texas  this woman just needed to shut up after 252  good riddance sorry you have to go through this but maybe stop being so rigid in your approach on dictating how other women access healthcare  so youre pro choice but only when it affects you ugh
this is so heartbreaking literally feels like we are in some horrendous show where people have no rights over their own bodies
you got what you voted for enjoy 
not even conservative christians want to be forced to carry nonviable babies to term yet these laws are made by people who think their conservative christian base want this
"many conservatives are fond of calling a clump of cells in a womans uterus a child and of calling abortion murder i say democrats dont know how to rabblerouse like republicans do

how about demanding social security numbers for the clumps of cells and that the irs code be amended to allow zygotes embryos and fetuses to be claimed as dependants on form 1040 and make that applicable to all pregnant taxpayers 

there are ways to fight republican zealotry but democrats are too conventional in their approach"
how funny it only matters when its happening to you the consequences of your vote
sue your state vote blue no laws should touch your body or force you to harm your health husbands dads bf you should stand up for your wives  daughters  friends
i say woman need to stop having sex if they want to avoid this situation or a normal pregnancy boycott sex woman there are toys if you want the big o
welcome to the real world  you dont think other people should be titled to terminate an inadvertent pregnancy but it should be okay in your circumstances  this is what happens when the state starts sticking its nose into decisions that really should be between a woman and her doctor
they want to play god
my son might be born disabled so lets murder him
praying for baby boy
girl come to california we gotchu
if the baby puts the moms life in serious danger then it must be killed to avoid the loss of 2 lives otherwise the mom must carry on with the pregnancy you make your bed you sleep in it
so even if it already has died and has no brain and is essentially brain dead she wouldnt even be able to get a dc my mil got a dc right after she gave birth to my husband to get her tubes tied this is ridiculous so she would basically have to have a still birth
now this is a medical reason for an abortion using it as birth control is what is disgusting
if men had to deal with carrying babies this would even be an issue
lol get fucked loser she literally voted for this she must have thought it through and put herself in other mothers shoes no or was she a nasty fucking devil who could see passed her own agenda
and this is why people who arent affected by the situation shouldnt have the power to vote on it give the votes to those mothers who are actually facing these issues and we will be in a better world because of it
i dont understand why she couldnt get an abortion does texas not have medical exemptions could she not have gone to a different states
i get sick of the women in this world that get pregnant and then with to go to a dr and kill it but will go to hell but i no one thing i dont talk date have sex or marry a what that kills a baby dont care about what people say that u me i want
im so grateful to live in colorado even as a christian we need to save viable lives not force others to suffer
youre either for abortion or you are not in all cases sick of people only caring when it involves them
it may sound sick but maybe the texas mom should have her delivery on the floor of the texas state house while theyre in session so they can see the horror theyve created
if the baby is already not going to live why rush to kill it before its born the little boy will die naturally after birth
question does this harm the mom to give birth to the baby whos not developed like other babies does this type of birth put her life at risk
people absolutely shouldnt have to do this not in this day and age and truly they dont unless of course they happen to live in a random geographical locale where some politician has decided that they are going to be in charge of these decisions for us regardless of their lack of education on any of the real issues related to these ludicrous laws this should never happen not ever this is just one more great example of why they want you believe they are passing these laws because in the majority of cases abortion is just used as a horrific form of birth control so you know hurry up and take that away but the truth is in reality those instances represent a very low number of cases and even then they still have that right to make that decision for themselves unfortunately the reality is that a large percentage of abortion procedures a term which encompass a wide array of treatments are performed to end a pregnancy that was very much wanted thats what everyone listening to their rhetoric and constantly repeated sound bites supporting these laws doesnt even try to understand until it affects them or their loved ones which at some point will happen to everyone we are smarter than this people come on
in a rare situation like this the baby will be born terminally ill and will likely be on life support until it passes i dont see why so many people belive thats any different than a person of any age being on life support or in hospice care until they pass its always terrible for a person to suffer and die and its awful for the family members to go through it but we dont just kill everyone whos terminal thats so sad why kill the baby
anyone notice neither of the couple used the word abortion and kept using the word it or procedure accept reality and the fact that you are pro life but want an abortion who wants to make their own decision for their own body now the hypocrisy in this video is remarkable
this is so heartbreaking  sad for everyone involvedthis family is traumatized enough finding out their baby will not survive and then to be told the law is forcing everyone to suffer more is horrific  im sorry for this family
"say yes to live is always the right thing to do
god will blessed you and your family
instead of saying procedure say abortion and see how you feel
we women are to give life and take care of the human being when is in the most fragile stage in life
we women should be against abortion god created us to give life not to terminated
be open to life and receive blessing for every little angel"
i work ems in texas and actually ran a call for a 35 year old woman who has this same disease after she pulled her trach tube out she was in a total vegetative state  absolutely no means of communication or signs of cognitive function she couldnt even localize to objects with her eyes her entire 35 year existence has been laying in bed breathing through a tube and being fed through a g tube with a suprapubic catheter to catch her urine she has to be turned every few hours in bed for her entire life to prevent pressure ulcers shes never been able to talk walk speak sit up or even eat on her own i remember thinking to myself how miserable it must be to live like that and i wondered if her parents knew before she was born of her condition and why they wouldnt choose to terminate if so seems like it would have been the far more merciful thing to do now thanks to the scotus parents dont even get to make that quality of life decision for their kids what a nightmare were living in
this  kind of news is crushing enough  to force this woman or any woman to maintain this kind of pregnancy for another 4 months is beyond criminal
she should have gotten denied she can vote to get rid of peoples rights but when it comes to her its ok
prolife
this so what yall voted for why are yall upset
the only way to solve this problem is to vote democrat there is only one political party that will ensure that women have the choice and the options available to them to safety handle any pregnancy complication that may arise and its certainly not the republican party
this is a lack of good judgment and descernment by medical staff
well you asked for it 
the system is so fucked up so they will not allow her to abort but are willing to let her give birth to a child that will die no later than 1 yr after birth make it make sense america
a lot of valid criticisms in the comments but i really feel for this couple and it is a good thing for everyone that they are coming out with their story
the doctors said the baby was nonviable doctors have been proven wrong before i wouldnt have an abortion theres always the chance that nothing will be wrong  nobodys perfect i would love the baby no matter what only god should take a life away heartbreaking but no doctor would have the right to tell me to have an abortion god bless this baby to be perfect enough for these parents
oh well you reap what you sow 
this is outrageous filled with rage that women have lost the right over their own bodies and now will be left traumatized over situations just like this one lawmakers should be ashamed of themselves
this is sensationalism read the laws for yourselves ive read them
im snitching and collecting the moola if she aborts in big texas  chaooo you get what you vote for pow 
there needs to be exceptions for stuff like this i think it should be allowed anyway but if not at least allow exceptions for emergencies like this
sad proof that no life exist without a birth in brainno bible quote says anything abortion specially in political laws
dont orient the conversation to support murder women culture insistent of murder to children within the womb has directly increased murder of children outside the womb evil is not an opinion karma is unrelenting
if it aint broke dont fix it let the lawsuits begin so victims can get a million from tax payers money if only came from politicians sad
wait until all the compassionate obgyns leave the state so they make medically necessary decisions with their patients and not with politicians who have zero business doing so this woman and her husband had the means to go to another state although by that time it was too late but how many women and girls have to suffer with no hope before bodily autonomy right to privacy and separation of church and state are given back to them
if you turn it over to the lord he will take care of everything
so your beliefsvotes actively caused this so very sad
she thinks she has the right to tell other people what they can do but she gets to chose  what a dope
her comments indicate shes one of those conservatives that didnt think this could happen  
a fetus without a brain is no longer a baby much less a pregnancy it isnt even compatible with life no brain  no heartbeat once the mothers circulatory system stops working to keep the fetus from rotting this is ridiculous and if people knew how toxic a necrotic dying fetus inside a mother was they would terminate this lethal mass of flesh inside this woman immediately
they are the adults they are not the victims this child is the victim and the one who will suffer their son will die either way this is not love or concern or wellmeaning or good this is purely selfish
lmfao natures way of saying fu to the toxic human species the human animal will suffer the consequences of ignorance lol i came into early menopause at 37 because of how toxic a civilization we live in and was never selfish enough to subject any of my would be offspring to the rest of you savages so as far as im concerned im no longer at risk of being a forced broodmare for the state lol
the right to terminate a pregnancy should remain a right
this is why politicians should not make any laws that have to do with healthmedical
no efffsss giving since more than likely it sure looks they voted for that
"this simultaneously breaks my heart but also enrages me 

like how could she be going through this but also still be so against abortion
she doesnt support it as birth control yet she cant see the problems that arise when doctors arent allowed to be doctors 
as she is learning she cant have it both ways the state needs to leave medical procedures to practitioners and patients 

its a case by case basis things are not black and white and politicians should not be able to police a womans body with these laws something is very wrong here 

people seem to forget we dont live in a damn theocracy"
she is the type of person who deserves this
ok but 20 weeks its too far along plane and simple you do realize that the procedure for abortion at 20 weeks is essentially partly giving birth right and non viable pregnancy no non viable means baby wouldnt even make it through delivery
1 in 10k is not an anomaly you demented lunaticthats a lot of deformity lady what drugs is she on tryping to pass that off as a small occurrence and thats without stating the fact this country has the highest of wealthy nations of women dying from childbirth as if there is infinite space and resources on this planet of 8 billion dysfunctional savagewith what information is available one would be so inclined to say that you people deserve to suffer the consequences of selfserving ignorancewhen the chances are higher for having deformed offspring than the chances for winning the lottery then i would say that is not an anomaly and from a doctor no less lol no wonder the quality of people there are in society when socalled educated people say 1 in 10k of deformed offspring is an anomalythis lady is either downplaying the severity or highly questionable when it comes to math either way this speaks volumes
but i was told this didnt happen did the probirth camp s
oh well thats the preferred law in texas this is exactly what they wanted
nah but you guys dont want abortions right you shouldve stayed in texas with all the other trump supporters hypocrites
not deemed for birth control but now that she needs she is okay with it
hes still a person  i would gladly love him as long as he lives poor little guy
what prodeath to human beings abc wont show you are the 1000s of women who choose adoption or at first wanted an abortion but carried the baby to term and now say it was the best decision theyve ever made
im being punished now with their undesirable whining not going to let my cats belly go  its skin
whos using abortion as birth control its costs hundreds of dollars so its not the poor
theyre always whining about me needing healthcare and help but theyve gotten rid of abortion in many places  even though im an adult me bringing a kid into the world is child abuse especially in the us  most people have no idea how hard it is to do simple things because of all the roadblocks we have to do more than normal people too and we can only live if we do quantum physics im not kidding the places i live in become bunkers and a war zone  the us cant be civil about anything i have to be hunted and in hell for im evil i asked to be sterilized  they would not do it  ive only had one true boyfriend for like 6 months  due to how i was treated i dont like dealing with the crowd of cliches  they want me to join the masses  i cant  they did it to me theyll never say sorry  cry me a river
thats sounds like your problem sweetheart you know you voted so enjoy your nonviable baby
who gets to select the reasons it is necessary thats why it should always be up to the woman and not to other peoples religious beliefs and  politicians
i pray in jesus name that god makes a miracle out of that baby boy and that hes born healthy with a fully funtional brain and that this family has beautiful  testimony out of this  read the book god wants you well and watch the youtube testimonies of the many negative ultrasounds that turned into miracles in him
"you dont need to go to mexico where it could be unsafe or end up with a serious infection  if you need medical abortion and your life is in danger go to canada they will help you and its safe you will be taken care of  

this also affects ivf   egg donation sperm donors  surrogate mothers  making people who battle infertility impossible to ever have any children because no one will be donating with ban laws as ridiculous as this in the usa  did anyone even think of that when making this ridiculous law "
a life is a life and just because they dont want to go through the pain of losing him they are willing to put him through pain and kill him i mean really everyone wants to tip toe around the word abortion and how it is actually done the fact that you are choosing to kill your child because you dont want to live with the consequences of your act of having sex regardless of that childs health issues is heart breaking and evil  that child deserves to be loved and wanted regardless of how abnormal he is and lastly you are either prolife or prochoice there is no gray or in between area murder is murder we have killed more unborn babies in this country than hitler did during world war 2 and that is is sad i pray we stop acting like we are god and start acting more human with empathy and compassion we are all give trials and tribulations and our true colors shine by how we choose to act and handle them
i hope this women sues the state of texas  for pain and suffering
im sure california would do ti asap and for free
if they had made me carry to term i would still have a dead fetus inside of me right now lmao this is insane
"apart from a 230 year old document  that was used to justify slavery and deny the women the right to vote  does anyone have anything else beyond pure pragmatism to justify killing a developing human in the womb but not outside the womb






by the way a non viable developing human isnt alive hence this story has zero to do with being pro life"
he had a brain a brain not dividing is way different than not having a brain still terribly sad 
people dont care until its happening to them body autonomy should be a human right
sounds more than nonviable if it can survive for even up to a year after being born
pro choice here i am not shocked this is happening i am shocked she still believes she has any right to deem when abortion is or isnt necessary both of you are dumb and could not make the final stretch if an abortion in colorado costs 1015k its highly probable that abortion cannot feasibly be used as frequent as birth control however even if abortion was why would we force them to carry a child they dont want
my heart was restarted twice with adenosine and me and my baby were on bed rest for three months while our heart rates dropped and i had to lay there helplessly as she was on my sciatic nerve and killed the nerves to my knee i started the pregnancy doing 5ks and ended up not being able to walk in a wheelchair  i literally used my body my choice to try to get the doctors to take her out early when she was viable enough to save her life over mine while they were restarting my heart with adenosine for the second time and it wasnt working and she was losing oxygenation to the brain   because they didnt take her out she is nonverbal and will never speak or have a normal life   they did not respect my wishes as her mother to save her before me even though i have a lifethreatening illness and she had a full healthy life ahead of her if they had listen to me   its not our bodies or our choices  theyve chosen for us
stop voting republican
i had a missed miscarriage at 3 months i still had to carry my baby 2 weeks after finding out my baby had passed away inside me those 2 weeks were horrible i cant imagine having to carry the baby until full term
prayers to the family
its still murder no matter what its situation is
we are not a free country anymore  if i was still in my twenties i would be looking for an exit any way i could find   good luck ladies  we are no longer safe
"pro life people act like medical issues with pregnancy are something rare when they are in fact so common then they are surprised when it happens to them or someone they know 

when something is going wrong with your pregnancy the last thing you want to do is fight with the law

few women actually choose to get an abortion and most of those women who do are either teenagers or below the poverty level the fast majority

its easy to say not to get an abortion when you may end up homeless if you dont"
society needs to stop pushing their beliefs on everyone else mind your own business and keep my body out of your business and leave my body in my business where it belongs
this is a medical issue and should have been delt with medically the dr who did not deal with it was negligent
god works in really mysterious waysreally really mysterious ways
im glad i got my abortion back in 2017 before this ban nothing was wrong with the fetus i just didnt want it 
whats more tragic is that its clear they were pro life voters you dont care until something like this is forced upon you
why dont you abc look into the medical reasons for her carrying to term rather than slicing her children up and sucking them out of her body or tearing them out a leg at a time  birth is a natural process whether or not the babies are alive  abortion is not natural unless it is spontaneous through miscarriage  this could have ended up with a dead mother as well as still born babies
she shouldnt have had sex abstinence is the only way not to get pregnant another then he woman who actually cant get pregnant which that is really sad  woman how can get pregnant are taking advantage of that she could be stupid and go have a backdoor abortion
my heart goes out to this woman  the pain she has to endure is enormous  can you just imagine the pain a baby yes a baby endures during abortion  easier not to think about that isnt it
so sorry 
im sure even with the brain being the way it is this baby would still feel the pain during an abortion at its fetal stage thank god texas is saving these poor babies from painful murder
pure evil someone who wants to kill their innocent precious baby that they created that god wanted them to have for a reason
oh oh it was because god and republicans loved it so much it had to go to heaven before it was born
"republicans we want less government intrusion in our lives
also republicans  make the government ban abortion"
boohoo pro life conservative texas woman cant in her own opinion kill her unborn baby big whoop she even judged other women in this interview this is sweet karma
despicable that a womens healthcare decisions are being made by the government  patriarchy in all its glory   a major set back to women    a return to days when women has no rights
everyone needs to stop controlling womens bodies
american freedom  a husband and wife cannot choose abortion to protect the wifes health but they can own as many guns as they want
im sorry they are going through that  i think its sad that no one feels like this babys life is worth it is it traumatic and horrifying to find out your childs life expectancy is a year after birth of course but many babies sadly die from sids or get diagnosed with fatal  medical conditions after birth and they dont live very long should we terminate all pregnancys if we know the child wont ever become an adult no if its not unsafe to the mother to carry i dont understand why she feels the need to terminate the babys life that baby is beautiful and precious and matters even if we know his life will be short im praying he is healed in jesus name and that the next scan they will see his brain is forming the way is should be
the family shouldnt have ever been in a situation where they werent in control of her reproductive rights if you dont want an abortion then dont have one but it isnt the place of the government to regulate any womans uterus ever
the child deserves to be delivered naturally and feel loved until he passesthats the right thing to do shes not in distress but the baby would be
women reproductive rights are going to the dark ages and still they vote for the stupidest people that make these laws
this makes me mad  how dare the government make this family suffer with knowing they have a child that will not live they want her to carry full term
what about the mental cruelty she has to endure oh my god  horrific
the majority voted in the politicians that bought these types of non exempt laws to the table and instead of the public thoroughly examining the bills before siding yes or no blindly this is what we get so we all live with the outcomes until further notice  in the states where it is illegal lets not expect any changes too soon
every life is valuable every life god gives and takes away life wanting to abort even a nonviable baby means missing out on joy lessons growth and grace that god can provide in such a tragic situation that baby has an eternal soul and is precious
so beyond stupid ignorance of texas
if anyone deserves this its literally her she knew nothing about medicine and decided abortion was bad and now she knows 1 thing about medicine and thinks she should be exempt from the rules she voted for come on
well i hope more conservative folks will listen to this lovely couple from texas this poor family the poor baby reverse the overturn of roe vs wade thank god i live in california although i myself would not get an abortion unless i was in a situation where my life or the babys are in jeopardy a situation like these people are going through but i still believe that abortions must be legal especially today you cant possibly think that no sex ed in schools plus no abortions is really a good idea
i feel for them she has to carry the child full term only to see her beloved child with disabilities and deformities and then to see the child die thats a lot and if she gets postpartum depression thats even worse 
abortion is murder
"sad 
i had to get an abortion years ago because i was having difficulties 
i had to make a decision loose the child myself or us both in danger of dying i choose abortion i already had 2 toddlers  a new husband it would not of been fair for them loosing a mother at such a young age nor my husband loosing his wife"
this whole situation is scary and women being rape are getting pregnant early smh  what happens now 
religious turds making laws about crap they know nothing about typical right wing stupidity
are there really dumb people who believe that someone use abortions for birth control 
that people have to do this   do what  i dont mean to be insensitive but that child will have a full brain in heaven and is a complete person here on earth whether in his mothers womb or outside of it
such a sad story imagine this being your wife your sister your daughter how would you feel about it would it change your mind i am prochoice our government has no business in our private affairs i mean if a woman is out there using abortion as birth control perhaps there should be repercussions but most women have an abortion because they feel they have to not because they want to its done out of necessity this is just crazy how big is our government going to get how many aspects of our lives do they get to control
i love how all the men whove never been women have the most to say the fetus doesnt have a brain how else can a human live without a brain no brainimminent death 
thank a republican
im sorry for your situation
women have had to do this even before roe vs wade was over turned  please research people becmsm is just playing on your fears n outrage
so doctor has said your health is not in jeopardy and the baby is alive god gave you this baby to love for however long he lives making this stance for abortion when you dont believe in it is a shame now proaborts will use your baby and your story to kill many babies needlessly please pray about why you are doing this and whose future besides your own you are affecting
man that ban what a setback
dont feel sorry for you you voted to overturn roe v wade so live with your choice
every human has value even the ones people will deem nonviable its not up to us to play god and destroy that life
could idk go 1 state over it goes state to state
you know i had sympathy for them until their comment about disagreeing with abortion as a form of birth control gives big my abortion is the only moral abortion energy pointless gatekeeping and splitting hairs about which types of abortions are justifiable is why america is in the mess that its in they were quite happy to feel smug in the fact that they would never have to deal with an unintended pregnancy but now the draconian anti abortion laws  attitudes like theirs have supported have meant that they are now in an awful situation
i think i know whats going on i dont know how to put this in exact words but nobody in their right mind is going to do this to another human being unless they are using these poor mothers to show you the downside so well that we agree to reinstate the abortion laws i have a feeling this is not an accident that they put that innocent poor woman though that without it standing for something the government is actually really smart and sick for this if what im thinking is true im starting to think texas is showing you the actual permanent cruelty making women go through birth regardless of the mothers well being i am personally against getting rid of the abortion  and stories like this really just confirms why this is a bad idea to make abortion illegal to begin with if the government is going to be this heartless which is on purpose for a purpose i can assure you than we really dont need to get rid of abortion this is to much and it sickening you have to lock me up in prison cause i wouldnt have made her go through that that would have been a big fat yes approval to abort the baby and save the mother these reasons right here is why people need to leave abortion alone and stop trying to control everything and everyone this is ridiculous and not okay abortion is very personal and very hard and frankly its nobodys business i would never get an abortion unless im in a situation like this beautiful mother but i dont find it appropriate for anyone to judge a person getting an abortion its nobodys business we all are never going to see eye to eye on this but one things for sure putting mothers through this is uncalled for regardless of the point they are trying to make yall really dropping the ball on this id rather save the mother from heartbreak and devastation she would have to go through after all this my answer will always be the same keep abortion legal can somebody please make it illegal to hound the abortion clinics is what really needs to happen its nobodys business i get it save the children but we cant even take care of all the american foster children already and yall want more i can smell the stupidity from here
welcome to texas 
oh so because it may only live for a year its worth killing sooner hm
the forced birth zealots will love this they have no regard for the womens feelings or health she is nothing to them but a birthing vessel and she loses her bodily autonomy by law and she will be owned by the state until she gives birth
thank the old white men in your state ladies
are his other organs viable and working your baby could save so many other babies lives
people like them are the reason that those laws exist they wont even say the word abortion and that woman thinks that there are people who use abortion instead of birth control no one does that they are clearly misogynistic republicans who didnt care until it affected them
its necessary if its for my benefit but it shouldnt be allowed for others the hypocrisy is real
"252 as soon as she said that it made me realize she is apart of the reason her and other women in her state are struggling to access this type of medical care she wanted to ban all abortions she only had a problem with her stance when she realized it would affect her life its not up to anybody else to make these decisions about a persons body only the person who is pregnant hope this experience expands her perspective

edit grammar"
im glad you are sharing your story and helping to shine light on how these barbaric laws will effect people in reality how your vote matters who you chooseto lead definitely matters
could she not drive to another state
"i couldnt watch this bc i immediately started to tear up
10 years ago my boyfriend and i decided we wanted to have a baby well i schedueled an apointtment they did a test said it was positive and sent me to a different hospital i thought it was normal bc this hospital was basically for sick and emergencies well the second apointment they told me there were two heart beats and i would have to go to a high risk hospital after my next visit with them my next visit was a glucose test and after that we were sent to a hospital about 1hr away from where we lived this is where we found out just how high risk our twin pregnancy was they told us from the jump that this would go week by week we had weekly visists and each visit theyd say next week we might have both we might have one or well loose both but lets hope for the best i lost one at 22 weeks my body went into labor and i had the second twin living he lived for about 1 hr and the other was still born their names are elijah  gabriel i had no option to have the still born twin i had to carry him as long as my body would let me and that was less than 24hrs had i made it 24 weeks i would have been admitted into the hospital for the ramainder of my pregnancy

i can research twin pregnancy all day long and figure out a game plan but you never know what will happen nothing can stop what is to come if your doing everything right to care for your unborn child not drinking not doing drugs taking your vitamins eating
they said one of my twins wasnt getting what he needed the living twin weighed more than he did i took my vitamins and ate as my dr directed and still one passed away no one could have controlled how much went to which twin

so i think its ignorant for people in the comments to say nobody cares about what shes going through or she should have thought about this before
to the people who dont want to abort their child they dont think about the abortion laws bc its not something they want to do however if you are in a situation like this there should be an option to do so if the baby has passed on and your body isnt going into labor maybe the doctor can induce you idk if that is apart of the law that the dr cant induce a pregnancy but if the baby 

ok i stopped typing and watched the video
this is very sad
how does a baby or person live with no brain
maybe this ultrasounds is wrong it has happened
ive been there where i was only able to hold my baby for an hour until he took his last breath he wasnt developed enough and the hospital didnt have any supplies  this was supposed to be the high risk pregnancy hospital this was the place they sent people for high risk pregnancies if st jude and leboner can save a baby at 20 weeks then why couldnt this high risk pregnancy hosptial try to save mine at 22 weeks
i didnt fight because i felt in my heart it was time to let him go he went to heaven with his twin brother i knew it was time in that moment to say goodbye i love both of them 3
two months later i found out i was having another baby and her name is lailah shes 8 now 3
i can only imagine trying to care for a baby that is possibly be none responsive
knowing at any moment he or she could be gone

idk what i would do in that situation having been through something not so the same before but right now i would say id carry the baby and enjoy what time i did have with him or her hold them snuggle them bc either way that is your baby it sounds so awful to say i dont want my baby bc he doesnt have a brain saying it that way does sound bad but listen to them they wanted a baby they dont want to abort their child but now they are preprocessing the loss of their unborn child their child wont live past a year based off of statistics and the baby will essentially be lifeless its sad either way you go about it but the baby is developing hes growing he just doesnt have a brian so i understand that he is living and you cant terminate a living baby so id say carry the baby to term and enjoy the time you do have with him hold your baby and love him bc any second he could pass away"
"she knows that i have a hard time controlling it its just she wasnt expecting it to stop no  but she just wanted me to learn that behaviour is not ok you know

like sometimes people with mental disorders have behaviours and violent behaviours that they cant control sometimes  but even if you know that you still should put a consequence on that behavior

even though he might or she might not be able to control it she or he can at least learn that ok yes this behaviour isnt ok and i need help you know

yes i still had violent outburst but thats not the point the point is that i knew it was wrong i eventually learned that  yes i cant control it but instead of hitting i could do you know get a counsellor or do you something you know so that i dont act that way in the future


thats why she created a consequence because she was hoping that i would acknowledge that and try to get somebody to help me deal with it you know  and it worked i havent been violent for quite a few years you know because im not in a situation where i feel like i have to pound the life out of somebody you know im not in that situation so as long as i dont get put in that situation

you should never see me get physically andor emotionally violent again because thats a problem if i do end up living in a place where somebodys screaming or yelling you know when they get mad or upset and its also why theyre getting upset too thats what ticks me off

right like i had a roommate that used to get mad and hed yell and swear at the support staff for trying to help him do his laundry

he would get very rude and belligerent if somebody tried to help him with some thing sometimes i dont even think he was angry sometimes i think he just like to behave like that i know sometimes i think he liked the idea of looking tougher you know

instead of just saying no i dont need any help with that thank you very much though you were very very very kind to try to help me

you know that wouldve been the proper way you know and most people do get ticked off and yeah they do they can get physically violent  but most people choose not to do that right

but with me it isnt a choice you may ask ok if you cant control getting violent then why havent you done that for a few years now

well let me explain that its because i know i cant help it and because im so scared that i will end up in serious trouble you know that i just try to avoid those situations you know

because i know i cant i might be not able to control my actions in the moment so i always like somebody to go with me so that if that happens i can just tell them

ok lets get the heck out of here you know that if i were to be on my own you know it would be much harder because yes i could leave and i have before too as well

but it wasnt as quick thinking i was actually thinking should i get involved or should i just walk away  because i really wanted to do you know if somebody was being mean to somebody i really want to step in there and save them

but you know my counsellor that i have now says that you know if they were to be like that its better off that wait until they leave and

then go up and see if the person is ok and offer them support because if i went to that person and i started it all yelling and screaming in his face or her face

then i would be just as bad as he is or she is you know and i dont want to look that way i dont want to look like an idiot i dont want that person that is being treated badly to look at me and

i think i am being a bully and not the other person you know because thats exactly what they would think you know  they would think im pulling the bully and then all the attention will be on me and

i would be in big trouble i would be being a bully not the other person so its just good to wait until theyre done and left and then you go up to the person

and ask them if theyre ok and offer support and say to the person that you didnt deserve what happened you know that was completely rude you know

and then that way theyre still feeling that support from me without being a bully you know"
i wonder if the antiabortionist do listen to medical professionals about health
elections have consequences  it all sounded good until it affected her and her life and only then does she feel it should be available under certain circumstances
by her own abortions arent birth control logic she shouldnt be given an abortion that baby is still alive and the doctors didnt deem it medically necessary her own lack of compassion for others is officially her problem and that sucks i hope others learn from this and start voting in the best interest of the public not just what they think benefits them at the time or in the interest of controlling other people
"ive done this i never thought boy i want an abortion i knew what was going on i knew the outcome i also knew god would support me through this 
im sorry shethey all struggled with this i know the pain of loss either way grief is involved"
oh god alobar holoprosencephaly is extreme in some cases the babies have one eye in the middle of their faces and no nose
"i thought joe biden was going to make abortion possible but again you people mustve voted for that lady who wanted she was so against people you know doing bad things that she obviously didnt want abortion

i forget what her name was i dont want to know because people like that makes me sick you know

i mean theres people that dont want to have kids and dont wanna give birth because they just cant handle probably what they hear on a daily basis like they dont want their child to end up a school shooter or you know a person who kills more than more people add an event on 

like sometimes in barrie they would have fairs and that they usually have a fair that goes on in the summer at the waterfront  and people just like to ruin that for kids and their families and friends to

like lots of teenagers go there with their friends and have fun and have a ball no just a bunch of innocent people just going to have fun thats all  but people like to use that opportunity you know to kill them at that fair you know

thank god that hasnt happened yet thank the lord  but youre starting to hear more and more and more that now you know would like the july 4 shooting that one was bad i think a little boy like five or six years old maybe even younger had lost his parents you know

i think his dad i think the boy and his mom and dad are watching the parade and just like everybody else you know they were killed lotta people were killed that day you know

so yeah its very very very scary you know so im disgusted that doctors cant do anything to stop a baby from growing in your belly  because i know in canada abortion is legal

and i dont know why in the states people dont have the option of abortion  because i dont think itll change the fact that lots and lots and lots of people will still have kids you know i think theres so so so many people that would at least adopt do you know kids from other countries  so it doesnt make sense to me that abortion is banned because you know

theres lotta kids for adoption do you know nobody hass to give birth you know  i mean when you adopt a child youre basically signing lots and lots and lots of paperwork and signing documents saying that that child is now yours you know

its exact same thing if you were to give birth because  you have to sign papers in that too you know theres a lot that goes into pregnancy probably just the same amount as you were to adopt

do you know what you need to have a room toys depending on how young the child is you have to buy clothing you know so its still as much work as it is to you know get pregnant you know

and plus i think youre allowed to have some say thats the only difference is that youre allowed you know youre allowed to have the same as to what personality of the child youre looking for and you know how friendly you want them to be

like if youre a mother and a father who likes to go out and enjoy boat rides and traveling you would want to adopt a child that would enjoy that too you know

yeah giving birth you dont always have that choice you know you got like a 5050 chance that you know youre taking your chances and

when you give birth sometimes children grow up and they arent very nice and did you get into lots of trouble sometimes they dont care about how their parents feel like half of the school shooters or mass murders probably have a very loving family and that will never never never except violence in their house i know my parents dont you know they never agreed with violence of any kind 

i mean if i had to leave from school because of my violent behavior  then she will have consequences for me and she sure did you know she didnt put up with any of that

even though she knows i cant help it right"
this womans experience was cruel and inhumane
the government trying to tell women what to do with their bodies is so wrong and so screwed up to make a woman carry a baby to term that has something wrong with him and they know hes going to die can cause death to the mother as well and if thats the case the husband should be able to sue the government for basically killing his wife if it wasnt the government that got a woman pregnant then they shouldnt have any say about what the woman does with her own body
they should consider suing the state for mental health issues and for medical costs
forced birth is murder
if only yall can treat gun laws like abortion laws guns take more lives than abortion do another distraction from focusing on real issues instead of banning abortion entirely exactly how your wont ban guns intirely you use the excuse its for our safety well abortions can come at a womans safety men so youre prioritizing yourself over another human being men do it every single day in power you egotistical muts get over yourselves men are continuously trying to tell woman what to do with their bodies youre not the ones pushing out the babies youre not the one carrying for 9 months youre not the one on the delivery bed shut up honestly if you cant carry than you arent part of this conversation at this point regardless ban it if you want youre just causing people to move out of your shitty state which is something my family had to do because she wasnt able to have an emergency abortion due to the fetus egg was stuck in the fallopian tube due that that the baby would either not grow properly if it does pass through at a later point my sister was at high risk of death during birth or the baby could possibly miscarriage as its not possible for an egg to grow in the fallopian tube so to leave that fetus inside of her till term disgusting guns kill way more people than abortions do wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more remove guns than you can continue the abortion debate but till than ladies move get out of there go someone were people care about you and prioritize your safety why risk your life a confirmed one over a potential life be smart dont let them brain wash you with this nonsense fetus are not alive a fetus doesnt even have lungs fully working until approx 2628 weeks so even if there was an emergency anything prior to that the baby wouldnt even survive without life saving devices why would you even want your child to live life like that its sad really be smart ladies remember we are the brains use it dont let these muts brainwash you we know our bodies better than they ever will
america home of the free smh
abortion is most used in the states as birth control sickening many prayers for this family never forget god is great all the time have faith you will make it thru this
the southern border is bringing turmoil to our country these main stream media news is on china side they dont give a fat rat assss china doll news anchors report cow farted before border crisis it does not fit the anti american narrative msm is on our adversary side
its so sad that the government thinks they can get involved in our health and well being
the entire antiabortion issue is driven by religion and religion is make believe end of discussion  engage with reality it will happen and legal  safe
she chose to have a pregnancy of course not all pregnancies are the same if the child is dead it is a miscarriage if the child is alive then its a forced miscarriage also known as an abortion in other countries they have wiped out the disable kids since the doctors see the fetus  not developing properly and advice to have an abortion or it would look bad this is only the second case that has happened and just needs a bit more research it does not happen that often therefore making it not necessarily to reverse the antiabortion laws
if this woman were to die from complications of the forced pregnancyher family should be able to sue each and every political figure thus owning the state of tx in the end
"medical advances are allowing babies to be createdbut there are cases where one or both parents have biological issues that would never bring forth a child 

medically assisted fetus that turn out to be in this case broken should not be held under this ridiculous new law"
ive lost hope for america good luck everyone
to anyone outraged by this and other recent supreme court rulings  if you were too busy or disinterested to vote in 2016   this is on you
no brain baby thats exactly what republicans want someone just as stupid as the rest of them
"thank the holier than thou brainless gop
may they suffer far worse instances of pain  suffering than these countless parents are forced to endure"
most people who are anti abortion think its used as birth control when its not used that way no one uses it that way people get abortions because they need to like its not fair when they were the ones to vote for anti abortion
poor family
i cant believe that people still believe in the myth that abortion is used as birth control no its not think about it logically is it logical to spend hundreds of dollars to get an abortion when you can spend a few bucks on birth control thats essentially what youre saying jesus christ
texas has decided to take control of womens lives im so sorry you have to deal with this
so wrong on so many levelswtf
i hope and pray that baby is  born perfectly normal and they have a healthy baby  god is always good no matter what  amen 
"women are now second class citizens in states where abortiion is not allowed  wo legal safe abortion women will die  we must be allowed to make our own decisions  i come from the era before roe and had to get a safe if illegal abortion  i was lucky but my granddaughter who is 19 may not be  if this woman can get to california or washington she will be ok  i encourage you to
do everything you can to get to a state that is legal"
how is this not considered mental emotional and physical abuse of a mother and mental and emotional abuse of the father
did they vote republican to support these antiabortion laws before finding out her baby was not gonna make it 
so did she end up having her son or is she still carrying him in her womb we need the whole story abcnot just some of it besidesthis baby could prove drs wrong and live past 1 year and so on it just means he may not be able to walk or talk and feed himself its not a big deal if he has to sit in a wheelchair and be fed with a feeding tube device hundreds of children are born every day with medical issues like cerebral palsy that make them invalids for life and their parents didnt abort them in vitro just because they didnt know and thought their lives no matter how long and short were worthless and a waste because they cant be normal
i am conservative but i am pro choice i believe its wrong to force people to go through something like this its not loving someone make a go fund me for her to get her the 15k to get it done in colorado 
cool story bro 
i wonder how they voted
no matter what the reason for an abortion is its healthcare that should be universally available to everyone who  has a uterus all reasons are valid reproductive healthcare choices should not be regulated by politicians youre morals and values most likely based on religious upbringing have no bearing on another persons healthcare
the best thing to do is have the baby fruit of the love between you and your husband they wanted a baby and now his imperfections give them cause to doubt their first idea their marriage will thrive if they can accept this imperfect child and love him even for the short time he lives watch videos on youtube about how to get through this and enjoy the blessing of the child
if shes not an advocate for birth control and is prolife why is she bitching  she wasnt  forced she chose to vote for laws that made this her reality
this poor lady how is it right to keep someone suffering like this these new laws have just caused craziness
no sympathy for this family they voted for these laws with no compassion and in the video still made it clear that the only moral abortion is theirs
exactly i may never choose to terminate personally but i will never vote against a womens right to choose
"why are people in the comments getting so crazed with her statement of personally not for it for the way of birth control thats a very fair statement because there are people who dont use any kind of birth control and theyll get an abortion every time i dont believe that abortion should be for that you should prevent yourself from getting pregnant not get yourself pregnant and get rid of it

this situation this woman is in isnt wanting an abortion because she never wanted to be pregnant the baby isnt going to live and its got no brain thats a legitimate reason for needing to end a pregnancy

people are basically saying you cant have your cake and eat it too but thats not what she wants stop looking at accidental pregnancys and a harmful condition as the same thing"
"theres a scene in its always sunny in philadelphia where one of the main characters mac dog gets pregnant and the only way the dog would survive is with abortion for some preface mac is hyper religious and pro life his response to the vet when he said that the puppies would need to be terminated was to go through with the abortion to save the dogs life a second main character was at the vet with mac when he made that comment and charlie said i thought you were against abortion mac replies oh yeah but this situation effects me 
in short people always want to have an opinion until theyre effected by it"
back to the medieval ages i guess
so sad the country is crazy cruel and controlling
abortion is healthcare
family planning laws need to ensure that they take into account medical needs for mom and baby this isnt a black and white issue non viable pregnancies should be an exception to restrictive laws its already heartbreaking enough knowing a baby wont live to birth or shortly after to risk the moms life is too much 
"this is exactly what happens when women try to dictate the terms in which we can abort abortion is abortion you dont get cookies for using it for medical reasons vs for a lack of readings or financial wherewirhal 

im not happy that shes going through it but the fact that she draws a line of distinction between motivations is hypocrisy let that fetus run its lifeterm since abortion is wrong she chose to get pregnant so thats her burden to bare smh


i hope no one was too dense to catch the sarcasm"
cant do anything unless her health is in jeopardy imagine the stress and anguish she experienced and what health consequences that has
"this is cruel to both the mother and the child inside her this should definitely qualify for a legal abortion 
 tbh the only time i think abortion should be illegal is for those women who just keep on having them they should be forced to have long effected birth control and then i of course dont believe abortions should occur after 23 weeks unless the baby is gravely ill or severely disabled where they would always be dependent of others medicines etc or if the mother is gravely ill where continuing with the pregnancy would kill her

there are different circumstances that need to be reviews abortion should never be a flat out yes or no"
this makes me so angry  vote blue  vote blue  vote blue  this is absolutely inhumane  outrageous
everyone always has an excuse for killing their baby maybe you should just keep your legs closed
so sad just because these people want to force their religion on you people have to go through this
you are not carrying a nonviable pregnancy you are carrying a child who will most likely not survive sounds like youre prochoice and using your very small case less than 3 percent  to justify the majority of cases of abortion
nobody is for abortion for birth control stop believing the propaganda
i always say you cant play a victim when you vote for this suck it up and deal with it because thats what you thought when voting
this is still a very rare case in abortions while most cases are just people who dont take responsibility in cases like these i believe there should be exceptions
this is basically a late miscarriage what the hell is wrong with ppl 
"i feel sorry for them but i have to say i have seen 100s of miracles of babies fully recovered when born what if that happens for their baby there is a purpose and a plan for everything 

when my mom was pregnant with my sister on the ultrasound they saw everything that could possibly be wrong and that she would die too she came out miraculously healed of every single medical issue they saw 

i know there is a chance that might not happen for them but there is another chance it can 

i believe in prayer and miracles "
well if i hadnt been to a womens conference having the wife of the leader of the upci and what i heard awful things said that if governor abbott doesnt see things our way we remind him while one of us pushes his wheelchair towards the stairwell so theyre you have why theres trouble in texas the name is bernards
the way she said she never would have thought she would have to go through this as if any woman ever thinks that like no one wakes up thinking about getting an abortion its not an exciting thing or some form of birth control like i hate women like the one here and personally have no sympathy for whats shes going through
well that sucks  thanks to everyone too stupid to vote correctly
 so tragiccan we spot letting men decide what we do with our bodies please go vote
"there is no lie like christian dogma
there is no hypocrisy like christian truth
there is no cruelty like christian compassion
there is no hatred like christian love
people get what they vote for elections matter
and they can kill"
glad i live in california 
"300314
its no fun when the rabbit has the gun yall are okay when other women are affected by draconian laws but when its your turn wanna act confused"
they look like republcans i think itd be funny if she died from it
"its so crazy i am proabortion for many reasons this being one of them like how does abortion affect these antis does it affect you physically are you physically hurt by it does if affect you mentally or emotionally its like when those people say if you dont like it stop watching if you dont like abortion stop searching it up watching videos about it dont hang out or talk to people who have had or are going to have an abortion if its on something and you dont want to see it turn it off look away all babies know is the womb they dont know anything outside of the womb they havent experienced the outside world parents dont know what they actually look like since its a black white and gray ultrasound the baby most likely has no idea what their parents look like so i see nothing wrong  

i just saw a video about a woman who had killed her 21 day old something baby on my youtube recommendations there was a girl who killed her baby and buried it after prom these crimes were before this roe v wade but imagine how it will increase after this roe v wade all because of these people that chose to vote for antiabortion not even looking deeper and realizing why it is needed just wait in 510 years the affects will be known and yes now its showing both sides will have to face the affects of this ruling 

yes people killing there children was bad before and itll still be bad now most likely with an increase babies will still be dying you havent changed much this time itll be babies that are outside they arent in the womb anymore its the real world"
leopards ate her face you voted for this i hope youre happy
"used to be if you were pregnant you were pregnant no ultrasounds no abortions get what life gives only the convenience of said preventatives leaves people in their feelings of being wronged unjustified rights and autonomy liberals and choices all modern terms to turn something natural into a convention and then steered back to natural through the grief and unrighteousness of it all 

disclaimer my condolences to this family and others who have gone through traumatic pregnancy experiences"
men can still purchase viagra condoms and vasectomies
cruel vicious barbaric and not christian
we is a miracle maybe your baby will survive and be ok
i wonder how many people who are against abortion have ever chose euthanasia for a pet animal
having an abortion is murder no matter what noone had the right to disregard a baby an unborn they have a right to live and yes even if they have health issues they are human beings not to be disgarded like a piece of garbage  if you dont want kids then prevent it from happening
there should be exceptions in the law for cases like this
54 of women having abortions used contraception during the month they became pregnant women having 2 or more abortion are more than 2x as likely to be 30 or older and even after controlling for age almost 2x as likely to already have had a child like this woman here  these women also are more likely to be using highly effective hormonal birth control the pill injections implants the ring the data that the rightwingers use is from abortions peak in the 80s since then there has been a steady decline in them make fully informed decisions dont just rely on what a talking head is saying turn the tv off for a night and research both sides thats what patriotism is about thats how to be a good citizen
this is a lie
yeah everyone says this is why the couple should only make the decisionumm they knew the risks of having a child there is no guarantee your child will be healthy and normal its a life not a car or object when are people going to realise this that you cant just desposeget rid of because you didnt like the order
if you think this is wrong you should not have kids
thats cruel to make her carry to term
she or any woman is welcome to come to oregon
i have an idea maybe we should just pay women the respect of believing they know what is best for themselves and their families
honestly it is sad that they had to get to this point in life and have to carry a baby full term under those conditions however i cannot feel bad because i can only assume they voted yes to pass the anti abortion law and the whole time the information knowledge the empathy to see and learn as to why its so important to keep abortions legal all at the disposal of our mobil phone in our world in this day and age there are serial rapist predators foster homes and adoption agencies which are full to the brim with kids that are not wanted any more or parents cant afford medical care or food we see advertisements on the news to adopt children and yet we pass a law to stop more children who are coming into this world only to be given up removed raped or in this instance live to take a breath and then die nobody turns their attention to those kids and want to do something about no instead we as human beings want to put our noses in somebody elses business and think we have a right to pick for them
my friend has a 6 year old boy with this he wasnt supposed to live past 1yr but god and what he can do
"this comment section does not pass the vibe check
have some empathy instead of gloating over this familys suffering"
"so did she have that baby already or not  im confused 

also id love to adopt if they dont want the baby or did the baby not survive

 im just happy mom is alive and healthy sometimes the moms die too just tragic how these things can end up happening to you and you end up losing the woman you love 

whoever voted for this should be ashamed and do what they can to reverse this ruling they should have been able to abort"
not only no but hell no  that isnt fair to the mother dad or baby
women are under attack i cant believe weve allowed this to happen you cannot force a woman to carry a fetus she doesnt want to carry  for whatever reason the womans say is final and the only one that matters you cannot legislate sex you cannot force the bringing of children into the world  we arent taking proper care of the ones we already have the notion presented that there are lots of adoptive families just waiting is a complete lie  and i know that for a fact there arent enough adoptive families for the poor babies who will be brought into this world with no one who will take them why cant people see that the purpose is to cripple women and  obtain surplus bodies to throw into war into prisons that are now profitdriven to create an even bigger underclass that the upperclass will use for their own purposes this insane law is already causing and will cause horrible things to happen this insane law will feed poverty feed the sex slave industry create more agony hunger and death dysfunction mental illness  and further destabilize our country  and the world there are too many people on the planet now  we are outstripping the ability to feed everyone as it is no woman undergoes an abortion willydilly abortion is a sad but absolutely necessary part of conscious civilized existence if this law is going to continue just go ahead and put women into chains and be honest about seeing them as property and chattel and nothing more than production cows abortion has been legal for 50 years it became legal for a very good reason that history taught us young women who arent fighting this attack on their very beings their very lives are too young to understand why legal safe abortions became law in the first place those who do not understand or heed history are doomed to repeat it wake up and vote to stop this insanity
im sorry for her but all she went through and still sounds like she would vote prolife again its interesting to hear stories from the woman who wantvoted for this
also wtf you dont have to go to mexico go to any other state like us alaska
"god bless you all
big hugs hugs hugs
"
so you agreed with women losing agency over their own bodies until your rights were taken away huh foh
people shouldnt have sex if they dont want kids and if they get forced to then use a weapon to stop whoever the guy is
hmm maybe stop fucking with womens bodies its not your choice or opinion
its so fcked up what the government controls in our lives
come on doctors of america stand and  fight for something did you sell your souls to religion and the corporations i know many women doctors  and nurses are trying to stand up are they the only ones with the guts of course i know  all this doesnt affect you men like it does we women your oath is first do no harm if you dont stand up for that you are not worthy to be called doctors
rightwingers believe selfishness if a virtue they pass these horrific laws supported by awful people who simply dont care about the impact because they dont think it will impact them these people are despicable
clickbait its not a nonviable pregnancy  sometimes the doctors are wrong like when they said the baby had down syndrome they are wrong and the baby comes out normal so you just killed someone for no reason  killing someone with disabilities isnt fair to them and they are saying the baby might not live beyond 1 year but they dont know
no man has the right to tell any woman what they can or cannot do with their bodies  these men are disgusting
people want to remove birth control and place hardship on women for getting pregnant but ignore the guys who are so eager not to wear a condom because  his private is too big or it doesnt feel right or whatever bs these guys come up with
abortion is healthcare calling it birth control indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of why people choose should be able to choose to get it
"well its a conudrum but i personally will keep you in my thoughts and prayers im so sorrythis is beyond stupid and who is going to care for him for a year if he actually lives 
im a christian but i also still have common sense and im a nurse and i had an abortion lon ago because i am rh negative and i didnt know it and got pregnant and didnt know it and i was testing negative but i was pregnant with an rh positive fetus and i ws having a severe allergic reaction to the fetus crazy as that sounds any how i had an awful experience but i am alive"
i dont know a single woman using abortion as birth control wtaf
be careful when you vote against your own best interest
so sad condolences to them its so heartbreaking to have a sick little one in utero especially with this outcome
texas should be all  liable for funeral costs for this baby
she wants to blame someone and i cant blame her however even when dcs were not frowned upon doctors still had the mother deliver the stillborn infant through the last 3 decades when abortion was funded through planned parenthood and clinics in every city abortion has become birth control
this is a tragedy once again politicians have no business in reproduction god bless you and your family im so sorry
elections have consequences folksyou wanted ityou got it
"the echos of this trauma will forever affect the surviving daughter too please dont forget her needs she sees her moms belly grow she hears people publicly ask when are you dueis it a boy or girl 
her friends at school have new siblings coming home she sadly wont 
the unnecessary forced trauma this will have on her is unconscionable
the shrinks clergy etc dont have adequate answers for her ive asked
im navigating this same loss with a 4 year old too 
dont underestimate her profound pain  disappointment
my deepest condolences for yall"
thanks for the explanation
so called christians and  other religious types are the most ignorant people when it comes to the human body the only reason they know where their heart is is because it beats and they have no clue as to how it works just that it beats they are dangerous and are killing  women with their selfish ignorance try talking to one about health and the body you will be talking to dumb and dumber women of america we must fight this evil for our freedom just like the brave ladies  of iran who are being slaughtered by a  government who is trying to keep  them as sex slaves
this ban is simply about control and harm to womens bodies and minds
texas republican death cult
uggghh the mental health of it all 
i live in texas and chose to terminate my first pregnancy last year for medical reasons it was the hardest and most heart breaking experience ive ever gone through and texas abortion laws add insult to injury ive always been pro choice but i never thought id personally be in a situation where i would have to choose you truly dont know what its like until youre there
this is what they voted for dont cry now
atp i feel like this is a lesson in life for them  hopefully they will gain some sort of empathy for all women including the one their daughter will be 
where do they draw the line with this though if your unborn child was diagnosed to have down syndrome its just ok to kill it because you dont want it to have a disability  its a slippery slope
the democrats love killing babies
wellif you didnt have the ultra sound you would have never knownand trust me she will survive  iwe have and we have 2 and you will survive if you choose too  haveing a child with special needs isnt the end all to your life  unless that is what you choose  yep we got what yall wanted in texas  now roll with your vote
this is a valid reason to abort a baby hes gonna be born without brain and that will affect the life of the family its better they abort him than they bring him to the world to suffer abortion was banned because of woke women who started aborting babies for no reason
voting matters tired of saying it over and over yet majority voted for this a man who forces to carry even in cases or rape and incest bunch of weirdos over here for sure
pro choice miserable disgusting men making poor decisions based on hate
guys you vote for the government so you got now whay you voted for
maga evangelicals are not prolife pro child nor pro family their one concern is power to force their dogma onto the rest of america
easy to solvemove out of texas
and this is exactly why abortion should be legal everywhere
in america everyone has rights that is except women
im personally not for it being a way of birth control but there are some instances where i deem that it is necessary    i bet she actively fought against abortions  now she deems it necessary  im sorry but its too late to cry about it now or have the rules specifically altered just for you  how convenient that its only a problem when its a problem for you 
why didnt she just go to planned parenthood which is government funded healthcare for women
good maybe she shouldve kept her legs closed
daddy is sad and mad i am too this is obscene eclampsia is so deadly for her women are human beings even in the bible belt the politicians dont believe this is right they just want some red meat to feed their mad dog base i watched one of my dearest friends gamble with her life and get eclampsia if we didnt live right near a hospital she would be dead privacy means privacy women have always died in childbirth but we live in a modern world why torture women ive never met a person who used abortion as birth control they use it because of all the circumstances life brings including the economy stupid
criminal they want to wait for herself to suffer medical problems  i cannot thanks for bravely telling this personal journey it really shows the heartbreak quiet desperation this is shocking medical professionals should sack up end this tragedy with some medical dignity for them this should be lawsuit precedence they should get something monetary at least in this ordeal 
i am pro choice what happens if a person comes up and ask to touch your belly do you tell them the baby has died and because of the abortion ban judging and you have someone telling you what to do people should get facts straight people do not have abortions for birth control
if youre a female still capable of getting pregnant living in texas you need to be planning an exit plan  otherwise this could very easily be your future or worse
this is horriblethe state they live in had no right forcing them to do what they want the decision should be up to the parents
the devil owns texas
vote them out take back your rights 
can someone tell me why she cant travel to a state where abortion is legal
when are we going to ban viagra needs to happen asap
it is still a baby  i could never purposefully take my babys life
anyone else notice the baby boomers lawmakers want america back to the way it was when they were kids
these lawmakers are a bunch of hypocrites
i dont agree with abortion at all but i do believe that there should be special terms apply to certain cases this is sad
thats horrific its abuse and torture to the woman she could have died
if i had to choose a word to describe this ungrateful so someone who has been actively trying finally conceives then would rather choose to terminate that living gift because of his imperfections and possible short life span than to appreciate and cherish his life no matter the length and disabilities 
unacceptable our women deserve better
"this crap is so ridiculous i cannot believe that our government is interfering with our most personal life choices it is nothing short of barbaric and frightening as hell 
and dont give me your psycho babble bullshit about the bible or what you believe is morally wrong all that shows is how truly ignorant you are and have no concept of what people deal with in our personal lives"
this is a horrible thing to go through however i hope her hypocrisy is not lost on viewers she refuses to use the word abortion calling it a procedure and goes on to say she doesnt believe its a suitable method for birth control now that she requires an abortion for her own medical emergency she finds validity in its use she and her husband may also have voted for the very people that contributed to an abortion ban in her home state i dont feel sympathy or empathy towards her they are also showing their privilege in being able to travel to different states to seek out expensive abortions unfortunately those states also have their own conservative led abortion bans in place will we see these two at a prochoice rally now that they are forced to carry a nonviable fetus to term probably not
she literally said it shouldnt be used as a form of birth control because realistically no it shouldnt she did however say that in medical instances she supports it she isnt facing the consequences of her own actions and you cant assume how this woman voted if you asked me if i 100 support abortion id say not entirely but i damn sure did not vote for the politicians who took away a womans right to choose regardless of my opinions on elective abortion its still every womans right to make the choice for her body stop attacking this woman whos going through something traumatic that most of yall have never experienced its sick
its unfortunate that women used abortion as birth control for children in utero and even partial birth that had no defect forcing states to take such drastic measures to protect children
pro choice is the right of choice freedom of choice not pro murder not pro death its pro choice this is a literal restriction onto women only that alone is an issue
lady you got what you voted for and personally i hope your baby survives and becomes the biggest burden to you and your husband
you can sign paper and have someone taking off life support
heartbreaking for anyone wanting a child to suffer a loss of one with the current law they could have turned a devastating situation into joy for many others youre in dallas there is husband and wife that have had two pregnancies with a similar genetic defect before the abortion band went in to affect they still chose to take the baby to term because they donated all the viable organs to other babies who needed them their first child saved 12 infants lives and improved the quality of life for 30 more and when they got pregnant again the same thing and they did the same thing every year for mothers day they get so many flowers and cards from not just the people whose kids are alive today because of them but from all over the city all over the state i dont know what they did with their child but if they were to have done that they would have  zero cost in hospital bills
sue the state for emotional damage
so the solution is kill the baby so it doesnt die
there is no danger to her life but shes complaining that she will have a baby that will die young and she wishes she could just kill it right now
leave it to government to control womens bodies and choices  they must be proud of themselves
"this isnt dangerous for the mother
 so unless it is a perfect child you dont want to birth it
lets stop being selfish and start caring for children of all abilities
if it had down syndrome would she be asking the same "
why would you want to murder your baby at 23 weeks anyways and just carry your baby to term and let him or her go the way they are supposed to
vote blueesp this family living in that wheelchairmonster greg abbott someone needs to put him on a hill and gravity do its thing texas is a waste of space they have that possom facedidiot ted cruz but i live in florida where our governor is trash too and sadly my state is full of rural uneducated florida men or boomers from places like the villages all are a bunch of fox news watching homophobic racist insurrectionist loving cruel karens this poor lady texas will always be a red state tho too many rural bible thumping cowboys who hate immigrants  no matter how many people die from a failing utility gridthey will still vote slugs like cruz and abbot in until we all vote out every single republican that bans books  bans abortions make up ridiculous laws to hurt gays and drag queens and shipping immigrants all over there are things that can be done on these issues but both sides keep them as hot button issues bc they need votes every cycle  they dont want us working on term limits and forcing them to stop taking lobbyist pay offs its all a distraction get mad and vote blue the lesser of two evils  at least democrats want weed legalized look at what it did for colorado california nevada instead of being a welfare state places like kentucky could leave coal mining in the past where it belongs im sick of the dumbasseslike fucker carlson alex  mtg matt gaetz lauren bobertall are huge turds with nothing valuable to add to any conversation
"i bet they voted against abortion 
but now it affects them so its a problem  typical"
i will always stand by a womans right to choose keep in mind its mostly male governors who banned abortion care in their states women should be making these laws
time to crack down down dirty government make dirty law
wow way to make her trauma worse didnt think losing a baby could get worse but the legal system really just said hold my beer
terrible occurrence but you can go elsewhere
all of these politicians have gotten out of hand its time for this all to stop and make a change going forward not backwards
oh my sorry hun i cant imagine what you are going thrupraying for you n your family
sues the state of tx for assault this is a crime against humanity
from what i am getting from her comment about it not being a form a of birth control the definitely voted to pass the law and put those in place who passed the law i am sorry that they are going through this but not taking time to think about who and what you are voting for and how it could possibly affect your future is insane i will keep them in my prayer and hopefully the next time this law comes or up the people in place to make the laws are wanting reelection they think twice about it
unds like she voted for this tho
theres nothing wrong with prochoice dont let this godless society tell you otherwise have faith 
i think if her health is in danger i can understand it but if not  this still is a life
it breaks my heart to hear parents talking about the children they conceived in such sterile terms and the word youre looking for is abortion dont hide from the gruesome reality of what it actually is and what happens to a developing baby the child is still worthy to be loved no matter how short the life may be is it difficult yes but the value and principle of life is valuable is absolute not just when it gets hard
i had s similar situation i was 20 weeks along i had perinatal counciling and requested a csection and thankfully my insurance approved it and i was given a hysterotomy my baby was born and she died outside of my womb but she passed humanly and i didnt have to go through the emotional grief of continuing in a pregnancy to full term
i feel for them because i have a friend who has gone through 3 miscarriages despite her and her husband really wanting to have children however the lack of awareness is stunning shes making judgment calls on people who receive healthcare when she thinks its used as birth control yet shes upset that providers are making the same judgment call on her not having the choice to receive necessary healthcare is literally what they voted for  its only a problem now that they are personally affected
shes not forced she can drive to another state
"terribly sad for the family  terribly sad about the circumstances 
 
but this is what happens when you vote for republicans  ted cruz greg abbott and the rest of the republicans are responsible for this dilemma  they decided that women are second class citizens and voted to strip them of the right to make medical decisions about their own body  they disregard your health what kinds of impact this will have on your family and the financial costs that this will entail as well
will ted cruz be on the hook for the delivery and any complications  will greg abbott be on the hook for the childs funeral
forcedbirthing is reproductive slavery made legal

im worried about another thing since this family went public will they come home to find a warrant for their arrest for seeking an abortion too"
"she definitely alluded to being prolife later on in the video i have empathy for her awful situation but does she and her ilk honestly believe prochoice women want to intentionally kill babies the reality is not all fetuses will become healthy babies and abortion is the only option to save the mother i hate these selfish assholes who have no compassion until it happens to them

yet theyll still vote republicans because they believe the lie that theyre better economically small government and to own the libs democrats are awful as well so any attempts at a what aboutism is moot"
1 in a million moms and million babies saved from death and being cut in pieces in their mothers wombs
texas the most back assward people in the nation
"republicans talk nonstop about spending to much money less government stay out of peoples lives and here are the fruits of their labor 
a family that will suffer with a non viable pregnancy forced to carry to term  if this child lives 1 year the parents will have to apply for medicaid to keep him alive or allow nature to take its course thus prolonging this familys suffering  it just doesnt make sense  stay out of these peoples lives at their most emotional important difficult time in their lives"
"disgusting pro lifers look what women have to go through bc oh save the babiesyeah how about go adopt children in foster care  and save them
so sorry for youprayers"
love the baby anyway we adopted a baby with this condition and he only lived for a couple months but in those months he was loved and cherished and taken cared of  rip baby matt pat
if texas wants to make the decisions for people they should pay the costs of pregnancy and raising the children including for mothers that must stay home to take care of those children medical food  rent childcare if they are the ones who think they need to make the decision for others and if the mothers life is lost they should pay maybe 5million to the survivor
this has gotten so out of control supreme court has made this chaos happen
texas law does not force women to carry a nonviable fetus physician ignorance or fostering an agenda  stop the lies and fear mongering
now this baby is gonna die if t does grow and leave the womb or itll never become anything and im all for womens rights and we should be able to control our own body but at the same time woman lets get smarter stop having sex without condoms and thinking birth control is gonna help you stop having sex without condoms cause the guy doesnt want to wear it or you dont want to wear it and look for holes and get the right size if its too big for him the cum will slip down and into you we shouldnt need abortions you should be careful when having sex unprotected and protected even if you two have known eachother two years now no keep that condom on you didnt want any kids but youre letting him cum in you come on now get smarter woman
i never thought leopards would eat my face sobs woman who voted for the leopards eating peoples faces party
this is so very unfair maybe we need to look at mens responsibilities and men birth control and what about that little blue pill can you imagine the outrage if that was taken away it is despicable that women are treated so inferior things would be alot different if this were happening to men they would be screaming like little girls
this is so stupid
abortions are free in california
this is not pro life
hop on a plane goto a safe abortion state done
this is why nobody likes texas
this is what happens when you vote against women and need the service you voted against karma
may they enjoy their child as long as they can
but essentially what theyre fighting for is birth control your either stupid or havent been in the business of politics long enough to realize it sad that this wonderful fam went through that sad that abc took it upon themselves to find this one in a million couple to make an example from  when every 45 minutes a baby dies from abortion without any underlying conditions  good job nation wide media
she shouldve been more careful thats on heror no sex if you dont want kids
sad you continue to vote for those that place these laws
if the human body will expell the fetus safely in its ownthen there is no need to interfere if abortions are not necessary to preserve life then they should not be utilized condolences to this family however these scenarios will not be used to justify abortions
yes instead of injecting euthanasia drugs into the babys heart which has been banned for being too inhumane for dogs and cats in most states and then tear the baby limb from limb texas said to allow the baby to pass naturally on hospice with love and care pro aborts are truly the sickest people on the planet
i like how she still cant empathize with other womens situations when she says shes not for it being used a form of birth control abortion for me but not for thee
this is why sometimes abortion is needed unfortunately nature is not perfect alot can go wrong and sometimes it is sever like for example any years ago a good friend was expecting her first she wanted the child and was overjoyed kept healthy did everything right for her pregnancy but in the second trimester an ultrasound showed that some of the babys internal organs where developing outside the body heart lungs and some of the gi track the baby was alive but there was very little chance of the child survival when born she had to make the heartbreaking decision of getting an abortion in the best decision for her baby there was no ryme nor reason for the cause of the sever deformity from what her doctor told her simple explanation was these things happen things can go wrong unfortunately nature is not perfect and can be cruel as we all know it was no ones fault nor no one to blame it just these things happen and it is what it is yea medical technology had came a long way especially with reproductive medicine but there is a limit
so the baby is suffering just because she cant do anything about it the law is letting this innocent suffer until its born 
go to jesus and ask him to heal your child as god to make the child whole and healthy stop thinking to terminate only god knows the future pray to save the child god can change anything even this
"i cannot believe americas lows dont comply with basic human rights established a century ago this is insane 
the more restricting the lows and the society norms towards women the fewer babies are born how long is it going to take to learn this lesson"
the republican party sure is committing a lot evil in the name of jesus religious extremists always do not only do you have worry about things like this now but if your baby survives you have to worry about what if they turn out to be gay or trans republicans are writing laws that could have them taken away by the state placed in to foster care and you charged with child abuse republicans are writing laws about how they can and cant dress if a man dresses to feminine in tennessee its a crime now vote blue and save freedom and democracy
thumbs down for 15 second ads  why  you could do 1 5 second ad
this is such a lie complete and total propaganda just like roe v wade was but what else can you expect from abc
"abortion is the voluntary termination of a healthy viable fetus  should absolutely be illegal she didnt need an abortion she needed medical intervention to terminate a nonviable pregnancy 

its pretty simple"
death unfortunately occurs either way it is devastating for the family specifically the mother to have to go through this im so sorry i hope this baby lives a beautiful life however long he is alive and brings joy that surpasses this great pain nobody should have to lose their child whether it be in utero or after birth its not fair
blessed be the fruit  republicans
leave it to god maybe the baby will be ok
and some wonder why many people dont take churches seriously anymore
"254 im personally not for abortion being used as a birth control but there are certain instances where i deem it as necessary  so you are pro choice  no one is proabortion we are pro letting people make their own medical decisions also  where you deem as necessary will every woman need to run their abortion by you to determine if their reasoning matches your moral compass

never would i imagine wed be going through this  conservatives love making rules for other people and have no concept of empathy until the rules apply to them and suddenly they demand an exception"
the fact that you people dont get this this is nature we should not be interfering with nature anyway look at our world because weve interfere with nature i feel really bad for those couple i do but lets get real about this this s happens people get pregnant in their babies come out fup its nature god just natures basic nature fit kalmanovich ever phoenix chicken come out weird hes not up to us to decide which one of these creatures come out of whatever grayson is worthy of life or not or chance are you serious
"the only comment ill make is that i hope her ob counsels on folic acid and its role in prevention of neural tube defects not saying she was ever deficient or that lack of folate was the cause im just saying she needs to be on it now during childbearing years and continue it religiously during any future pregnancy she also ideally should let her body recover from this trauma before trying again this is not only physically taxing for her but the emotional trauma affects both of them 
my cousins baby girl lived for about 2 hours with what used to be called water head  not a nice way to say it but thats how many understand what it is she had no skull only a fluid capsule with her brain inside
the doctors immediately put her on a strict daily dose of 800mcg of folic acid and she went on to have a strong healthy little boy who is now a us marine"
shes no victim dont want kids close your legs be a responsible adult not a baby killer so texas
u people r sick stop killing children
what about is abortion wasnt an option because backintheday didnt have that option today major planet your baby was supposed to be born no matter what maybe that isnt your choice maybe thats gods choice and youre wrong in this you really are youre trying to tell me youre f addicted to something because you couldnt kill your baby are you serious right now stop it sometimes babies are born again we dont get to just kill whatever it is if we dont feel comfortable with you understand that get real
this is so sad that this family has no control over their own lives and lives of their wellbeing and family the family is suffering and the unborn child is going to suffer  no one can put themselves mentally in this family shoes thats why people are not commenting more people need to educate themselves this is a perfect example of why people would put their life in danger to have an illegal abortion people must stop being afraid to speak up
you can always just shove a coat hanger in there 
"there are herbs that will cause the uterus to contract 
angelica root or yarrow are two 
women have taken care naturally and need to continue to do so
i wish for peace to return to these people this is very tragic "
well maybe this lady should have gone to the state next to her and got her abortion because it did not need to be publicized and every need to be talked im so sorry but the fact that you decided to be a victim all on your own that really is on you cuz you could have gone to another state fortune is not completely legal in the united states this is a big fat lie
this is fucked up and inhumae
"the year is 2023 and a young country like south africa  which was democratic only in 1994 has more laws that protect women abortion and the lgbtqi compared to a country like america which has been democratic for more than 100 years that is scary

i just stumbled upon this post and i am feeling really sad for kylie i believe that a country is not democratic if it is abusing women especially in this way the fact that young countries are progressing in making sure that they properly protect all its citizens and america is heading backwards is sad"
america must wake up see the problems in my opinions there will be depressions from the mothers and possible suicide rates going up which i fear bring abortion back
abortion should be illegal to use as a birth control method not when its medically necessary or from rape
great job abbott rot in hell
"welp you made america great again 
i truely feel when you let religion govern law you start to fall backwards as a nation history show it"
men who support abortion bans are disappointing but women who support abortion bans are traitors continue to vote for anti abortion laws and candidates and you will suffer the consequences along with the rest of us women are people we have every right to defend our bodies even if it means killing another person to do it
isnt there a point where its nonger considered an abortion like if there is a known health risk to mother baby or both when is it considered medical for the sake of your life
watch it will come to a point that women wont be allowed to have ultrasounds so that non of these health concerns are found until to late so sad to see
it is a medical procedure regardless of the reason it is tragic that anyone should have to terminate a pregnancy but life is full of realities it should be available to anyone who comes to the wellinformed decision that this is the best option with no judgement
i super hope the bill gets reverse because damn the people who make laws in america just show the world how a developed country actually can turn into a caveman world its sad she should have the choice if abortion banned due to faith than why stop there lets banned plastic surgery prsh lets hope for  a change
this is  what our great america  has turn into no hope no help and no compassion for women and children
what is the no 1 cause of death of pregnant women  murder by their baby daddy boyfriend husband or ex  that alone is justification for legal abortion
isnt it amazing how quickly people change their stances on issues the second they are personally affected
how could they put those parents through such tragedy they know the baby wont survive but theyre making her carry it anyway that has got to be emotionally torturous
we need to come to a balance no 9 month abortion of healthy babies no killing at 20 weeks they can feel the pain of  dissection or acid bath  a child with no chance if every test has been repeatably performed and sensory receptors to detect pain are not in place do to lack of brain function   it seems cruel to both mother and child
you live in texas you should have known that this would happen i did
wt actually f
gotta love texas
travel a little farther to ca it would be no cost
that heart breaking
why is this called nonviable describe viable
this country is truly unbelievable america the great it is not
pets or animals can be put to sleep tho
we dont need the music playing with something so horrible and tragic
so she was pro life until she needed an abortion
in the beginning abortion was intended for such circumstances  then they wanted more to the point that the child is fully developed and started using it like birth control the beast took over and started harvesting and making big money  while society is left with broken women whose only rights was murder of off spring
if its abc news then you better fact check store bought liberal media
this story is absurd   who is anybody to tell her what she can do makes me sick god bless her i cant imagine what it mustve been like for her its absolutely ridiculous poor thing
im not sure why anyone would want to live in that god awful state
move girl move away and then come back
you got served what you ordered eat it
"republican took away healthcare from women  no big deal  right  women voting rights are next  women are second class citizens once  again  
biden 2024 "
this father is teary eyed and emotional you just know before he was in this situation he was down at the watering hole yuking it with his good old boy buddies about owning the libs
why did this couple not come to california or even looked into coming to california for what they needed for there are plenty of obgyns here that would be very accomidating to what this couple needs and besides california is a lot closer to texas than new mexico
this is just sickening and one instance when abortion can be necessary and lifesaving these rigid laws are doing far more harm than good
many doctors told me my daughter was not ok that she would not make it to full term she was perfect born 8 lbs 9  take care i hope for the best for everyone 
my former girlfriend and her daughter are antiabortion and yet they firmly believe its necessary on occasions like this theyre against abortion yet they are far more rational than the religiously conservative lawmakers who are dragging this country into another dark age
absolutely disgusting having no say over your own body   allowing more suffering than needed  the mother and baby were both at more at risk continuing ridiculous
in yet the no abortion law was passed
add another 10000 on top of that because someone just filed for the bounty on you going out of state for an abortion 
anyone that votes republican is one of two types of people that might hop back and forth personalities 1 votes to make money 2 have no idea what they want or talk about thats it its sad that they still will bite the same way the next election cycle
but she is alive to tell about this so it did not threaten her life to have a baby in this condition which normally would produce a stillborn what is the difference between an abortion and a stillborn she just wanted control over the extraction  it actually may have been better for her health to see all the hormones through such as progesterone estrogen and prolactin to encourage easier recovery from the loss   the body needs those hormones to balance and promote healing after a pregnancy  this isnt burger king where you can order what you want without considering the repercussions are they saying that they know more than medical professionals or that abortion should be like a product and they can have it whenever they want for a reason they are more worried about than professional medical providers people need to learn their anxiety does not equal medical knowledge and just because they are consumers of medical care does not make the whole industry of medicine like a store where idiots can dictate their medical care without exhibiting medical need  they definitely should move out of texas though there are plenty of states that align with their expectations
you blame the women who kill babies for fun 
what a sham american freedom is when women have to endure these kinds of laws there are no words
it doesnt affect you until it enters your life easy to vote for consequences but often harder to live with them
"we need people like them to put their vote where their best interest is
i am currently living in tx i cant wait to get the fvck out"
this is just so wrong sending prayers for this family 
one of those things people dont care about until it happens to them smh
should be a campaign ad for voting red
pro life nah its profit abortions would cost them money they would make from medical bills cost of raising unwanted children cost of funerals for dead mothers forced to carry dangerous pregnancies every unwanted baby born is just another number in the game of profit and senseless greed all the religion and pro life bs is a facade
absolutely horrible this lady had to endure this makes me so mad 
well this is what you guys voted for to have republican leaders that have a god complex and believe that they are right and nothing else matters
they need to bring back roe vs wade
oh america what a disgusting fuckhole
no one uses abortion as birth control im pretty annoyed that a woman who has had to suffer only now understands that abortion is healthcare and doesnt belong in the hands of legislators
well i guess its what jesus would want and no one is more in tune with what jesus would do than the entire gop
this is why if youre against abortion you should not have an abortion everyone else should be allowed to for whatever reason
this is why we are a secular nation by design religious rule is evil
"it is not only inhumane it is also absolute madness  i would love to have been born in a state like texas for so many reasons  
but these abortion bans are going to cause so many problems for women"
wheres the gofundme for this lady this is a nightmare
"im sorry this is happening to her but did her vote put her in this spot 
people need to stop saying or implying that women have used abortion as their birth control method
stop repeating that lie"
if shes against abortion did she celebrate the overturning of roe vs wade if she did suck it up buttercup this is what you asked for
this is a tough situation brave of them to share this i feel for this couple especially the woman at the same nonviable seems inaccurate because the baby can carry to term and be born its that the baby has a terminal diagnosis
what the world
what would you do if we didnt have ultrasound technology  be thankful for your son and the short time you will get to spend with him he is part of your life journey
the doctor said most of these children dont live passed a year why wouldnt anyone want to be able to spend as much or little time as they possibly could with their child letting it know how much they were loved instead of just killing them because they couldnt handle having such a small amount of time with abortion is cruel and selfish and most of all murder and i dont care who gets mad or what they say i have a right to my beliefs just like everyone else does
so sad the pain this couple has to endure abortion is a human right
this is what happens when one doesnt think in principles  banning or creating absurd restrictions on abortion creates situations like this  no one ever thinks it can happen to them  what if she develops sepsis  this is why i changed my mind about moving to texas
my condolences to the family but lets remember we have  great doctors out there who can help
this is why abortions should really only be used in cases of rape incest and emergency health complications with the mother and baby
so they voted prolife because they wanted control over other womens bodies and never expected it to actually have an affect on them sounds like karma to me
realistically if someone did actually try using it for birth control every time they got pregnant itd probably be very stressful for the body i dont get how some people legit believe women using it as just straight up birth control
give women power over their body the science is there the preventability is there let them make a choice
what a world we live in now they cant differentiate between necessary and  convenience  shame on the elites they will be judged one day and i look forward to that day as malformities that should never exist like 1 in 40 children born with autism climb from 1 in 10000  30 years ago to 1 in 2 children being born with autism in as little as 5 years their claim not mine because of the toxic levels of chemicles in our food and world because of allowing thisnow they decide to let a brainlesss child be carried to full term its just like them this is an atrocitie im so sorry for this family i pray they are rest assured that their child will be in heaven and one day they will get to be with them in all the beauty and perfection and wholeness that god created that baby with had our fda and epa not been corrupted prayers sent for this family  i am so very very sorry you have to go through this 
i dont get how texas prides themselves on freedom yet their laws for women are stuck in the past youre not free until it applies to us all
"3 years later  mother forced to sell her body due to republicans fighting against a livable minimum wage and government programs 
republicans  not our problemour motto is from conception till birth after that youre on your own honey"
truly appalling all the states enforcing this should be responsible for all medical bills and therapy as a result
that is a 2 heart breaking events in oneone is nature that is heart breaking for them enough the other one is because the religious dumb f asses in tx
this law is wrong so wild that it is one look at us all people everywhere there are too many then a family like this is being torn up over some old mans idea about making money and making babies
this is horrible im wishing your family well
what third world country do they live in
the sad thing though about texas is they have crappy insurance when it also comes to child birthing as well prolife with crappy insurance
so cool that the government is getting involved in womens health decisions 
good   now stp being religioius  or atleast forcing in to others  since when  an uborn babies life is more important than the moms lmao even if it was already a baby and not a fetus  thats crazy
i hold the same beliefs as this woman although i do not consider this procedure to be a replacement for birth control it should be available in medical situations such as this or other serious issues not to mention rape incest minors or medical conditions for the woman that may not fall under the purview of this law its insane that this family will be forced to go through this entire pregnancy only for the baby to not make it long the additional pain this family is experiencing has only begun and its heartbreaking
btw so few women use abortion as birth control its ridiculous to punish everyone when clearly there are good reasons for taking that step in the vast majority of cases
its always different when it happens to you
the insanity going on in the us is off the chain so a woman could die from disease due to a decaying fetus but thats ok in fl a bill is up that young girls cannot even talk about periods what the hell is going on please vote get these zelots out and let a woman and her dr make that medical choice not the gov or church
mistake 1 living in texas 
conservatives are a menace to society
blessed be the fruit
these republicans are not thinking of the grief of the parents or the death or dismemberment of the mother and how that affects her living children or partner or extended family and friends it really looks as if they want to just punish women for having female reproductive systems we also live in a cruel misogynistic state now and i hope my daughter is able to move to a safe country one day many cant
gratitude and respect to this couple for their courage to share their story i support you and thank you  im so deeply sorry you have to go through this
it honestly wouldnt surprise me if these very same people voted for the lawmakers to get into office
the irony of her situation yikes
absolutely ridiculous come on america we can do better 
the state of texas should have to pay all expenses for that kid up until its 18th bday
please vote all women deserve so much better and the right to choose for our own bodies it does not belong in the hands of antiquated beliefs
this is bullshit they try to find  a person to fit their agenda and then they try to do a media blitze this is not what texas needs to be broadcasting what they need to be broadcasting is the border issues and the 100 thousand plus people dead last year because of it where are they on the 100 thousand lives they caused to be poisoned answer that and then we will think about other things
this is what happens when crusty old men run the country 
they got what they voted for
hearing them both speak on this is heartbreaking
so whose life are they protecting now this people who decide how everyone should choose are ridiculous ignorant this should be an exception
texas and the us have regressed to the stone age and it is beyond shameful and against womens rights and health
oh sorry you cant murder your special needs baby  also nonviable with what sounds more like inconvenient than non viable
so this is what happens when crusty old men run the country lol
when the government starts micromanagement of healthcare decisions it never goes well talk about extreme restrictions of freedom and dictatorship type behaviors telling women they must carry unviable fetuses to full term and risk their lives to deliver a baby much larger than necessary who has 0 chance at survival sick evil wicked politicians pretending theyre a party of freedom while committing human rights atrocities against the american people like this
she got what she voted for dont see the problem here ohh she wants access to abortions just not other women
i was just looking at the background the whole time like damn thats a big fan as soon as she hit us with how she believes i have no empathy for them separate church from state and whatever beliefs you have
this is why people are mad at all the ignorance surrounding this issue abortions are not just for people who dont want to be pregnant themoreyouknow
we have traveled back in time to a very dark place 
i feel bad for them 
not a form of birth control so what it sucks because its you you either support the right to choose or you dont
im very sorry for these parents i cant imagine what they must be dealing with
texas is all in on treason and religiousdomestic terrorism just like all maga traitors
voter of the leopard eating faces party complains that leopard started eating their face
why cant she travel out of texas for an abortion
horrible situation we need to change the people in supreme court
but we keep electing the same governor how do we expect things to get better if we dont vote him out
shes terrified because he baby is going to be born without a proper brain no im seriously asking because i was looking for the health reason that puts her life in danger all im hearing is they dont want to have a handicap child right or am i missing something
hate to say it but they probably voted right
when will these women learn to keep their legs closed she better not get an abortion
and what is scary these politicians take care of themselves in these situations its never been about babies its a political flex
usa this is not the freedom you boast about
i bet if it were a lawmakers wife it would be diffeeent
there are not words in my vocabulary to describe the vile emotions i have for these evil monstrous antiabortionists
well  this is really sad and they are doing everything i would have done  however  it was clear that voted republican and she said never in a million years did she think this would happen to her and she is against using abortion as a birth control   you voted for this  we tried to warn you  this is what happens when you vote against your own interests anyway  we are all in the same boat now  saddle up cupcake because this is a going to be a bumpy  ride
no one cares when it was the black woman in no recently but maybe this white woman will bring more awareness 
going to new mexico for an abortion is crazy scary i get it im glad she said about not using it for birth control
this is what happens when a conservative supreme court changes laws that are not broken this woman passed judgment in this interview that she only agreed in this procedure  for her circumstances that is why she is in this predicament because her lawmakers banned all procedures for all circumstances
she is so stupid for going on camera  its so pathetic our people are so desperate for attention and social media fame she could have easily just went to another state and got it done but now the whole world know shes pregnant stupid
we all know the state will not be providing  for 24 hr care to take care of the child either
bullshit bunch of democrats bs
just because a doctor says one thing doesnt mean that it will end up that way my son has a heart condition he should have died from yet here he is should i have killed my baby just because of his heart condition
if you want to put out your agenda about abortion maybe the law is not it  its so sad yall gonna see a lot of dead babys in the trash dumpsters because of this law
merica is such a sick country
i would be so pissed if i had to have a kid i didnt want especially if it had developmental issues
i can tell by how she described a couple of things that they are pro life this is exactly what they voted for they are only pro choice when it needs to benefit them
she said there are certain instances where i deem abortions are necessary thats the thing its not up for you to deem every single women should make that decision for themselves it should not be based on what someone else think they should do with their bodies this is why that ban is so dangerous ppl who probably would consider themselves pro life are now realizing that this ban could and will negatively affect them and the woman they love
give your baby up for adoption someone will love him until he passes away
because prolife craziness has overcome any logic or science 
the law is only for the corrupt and to help only the irish and government  f the people
poor guy hes taking it a lot harder than his wife its different when youre the one going through it than when your loved one is and youre powerless to help them
i 100 guarantee she helped vote the idiots into office that did this to her lets keep it real its white folks that keep voting in evil so dont cry now
this is heartbreaking
texas is so toxic  im surprised that state doesnt implode
"my niece  had her baby  full term this beautiful  baby  was born  still born who had the same problem 
     she was happy she carried  her baby knowing  what is happening 
the child will die why wont people  let them  do it naturally  not yanking them piece by piece out of womb
    what more is more  loving"
"conservative texans abortion is murder it should be completely illegal 

also conservative texans oh look another school shooting in our stats lets see how good this one was oh awesome 21 people died and 19 of them were kids lets go bruh i love this entertainment"
thanks a lot trump 
give him a fighting chanceso he lives only a yearyou let him live you gave him life for a little while so torture him in the womb because hes gonna be inconvenient to you for maybe a year i just dont understand 
"isnt the point of choice is to use your own discretion on if its necessary to you and the life you want to live  
obviously there are women who will abuse this system and use it as a form of birth control but you better believe i would prefer that over a woman who is either too lazy not financially capable or not educated enough to use birth control to one day have the child due to an abortion ban who will abuse the child she did not want in the first place we have so many children who are born into families that do not want them who are being tortured and killed as is why make that a potentially bigger number because abortion doesnt feel necessary in your own life narcissism at its finest not everyone has the life you do why choice is important"
this is definitely a human and civil rights violation
the catholic church pushed this agenda
you can go to another state that allows abortion  there are options
stupid republicans doings 
this is why we need to think critically before we take drastic steps without thoughts about the consequences
this is so cruel im sorry they had to go through this
gods will be done  
nevermind the 2 trail derailments the nuclear leak and us being on the brink of a world war 3
sounds like their position and votes have come back to bite them   bet they thought lack of female bodily autonomy would never be an issue for  them
this is no longer a free country for women these laws arent about the right to life they are all about controlling women and trying to put us  back in our place like in the andy griffith days it is disgusting how far we have fallen in this nation and how republicans are constantly stripping away our freedoms to force everyone to fit in their cookie cutter box
"that is so horrible
caster oil and certain roots are going to be making a huge come back"
have faith in gods will 
if your wife sleeps with another man will you keep the god giving child if your husband impregnated your best friend should he keep the god giving child abortion is murder remember that you people are fornicators yet tell lgbt people to live celibate lives because the lord dislikes it yet you same people sleep around with your friends from college and high school gay people cannot kiss and hold hands because it is immoral yet the pastors daughters have abortions in secret to preserve that good reputation you people vote to ban gay marriage yet you sleep around committing adultery people are anti gay yet find ways to justify abortion i dont want my boy to see 2 grown men kissing yet she has had 2 abortions lol
my heart aches for this family i was reading about this condition just the other day a mom expecting ivf twins she didnt have a selective termination because of the risk to the healthy baby and because she was led to believe the affected child would die he lived 8 months never left hospital and experienced a tremendous amount of pain abortion is healthcare
so is she going to have to carry full term and give vaginal birth  or c section to a already dead baby thats disgusting
this is the problem with conservative people they get fed through fox fake news that people use abortions as birth control too bad that for smallminded people it takes an issue like abortions to hit you directly to inform yourself and look outside the box tge world is not just black or white
when passing laws i feel they should add in special circumstances like these
this is a horrible situation texas is wrong for banning abortion and its also wrong to abort after the 20th week first trimester abortion is necessary for population control of unwanted babies these abortions have been banned because the system supports human trafficking child pornography etc the system needs unwanted children to exist so that they can be abused in this way abortion should not be an option because a privileged couples wanted pregnancy didnt result in a healthy child its extremely sad but this couple wants this child probably planned the pregnancy this child wont survive beyond his first year and thats heartbreaking but this child will never be subjected to child porn or trafficking abortion should not be an option because its inconvenient for the couple to care for their unhealthy child
just travel out of the state sucks its our reality but my wife and i just had a similar situation we live in texas and got the help we needed in new mexico
what does the bible say about abortion
thats wrong
anti abortion laws are inhumane  its heartbreaking to still be fighting for basic human rights for womens healthcare  but we will keep fighting to make things right  im so sorry for all the women affected by the current backwardness of the legal system i hope they all get compensation for their inhumane treatments
"my cousin in europe was told that her baby boy with the same condition when he was born would live for 20 mins 
they tried to convince her to abort she did not want to  so she carried through with the pregnancy till full term 
delivered him and he passed away at exactly the time they told her he would  she goes to visit him daily for years 
it was her son and she did not choose to abort  i feel for you that the laws have changed but i understand that 
he still is a human being with a brain and i pray that god gives you the strength to endure this  i wish you nothing 
but the best outcome possible"
pro choice is not pro abortion  it is pro  patients make their own medical decisions  it is your choice not the governments choice  vote blue for you
its your body but your governments choice sad world we live in
texas aint no fun when the rabbit got the  gun is the saying about reversal of circumstances i do pray she survives this ordeal and teaches her daughter about why women should always vote to have reproductive control of their own bodies
i cant believe the leopards ate my face cries woman who voted for the leopards eating faces party
now this is cruel i normally do not stand by abortion but in instances like this i would how cruel i feel for these parents
i hope she donates the organs so another baby can live
im pretty sure they are republicans so this is what they deserve
the prolife party doesnt give a flying flip if women die so much for prolife theyre all a bunch of lying hypocrites
"then dont use it as birth control and mind your business remember no woman ever wants to get an abortion they are not fun or easy everyone that gets one has to for whatever reason that is not our business i cannot freaking believe we are having this stupid debate again federalist society scotus decision will cause women to die it will not be different than 1971 they only prevent safe abortions with these laws and this will not be the first woman forced to carry a dead fetus around for months and worse for these draconian religious zealots 
religious people need to remove themselves from other peoples bedrooms and reproductive organs jfc like really what is wrong with yall dont give me some saving lives line of crap women are alive and you dont care about them universal healthcare saves lives why not back that"
not all pregnancies are viable  which is why abortion is healthcare  caring a miscarriage can lead to sepsis this pregnancy was wanted republican elected officials have gone way to far its not a clear cut case of yes or no its a maybe
and if you voted republican at all thats what you voted for  i know better  my body is mine not yours and i have the right to choose whats best for me  not you  so if you voted for republican thats what you voted for  sad isnt it
wow the people wishing ill on this woman are just as cruel as the people who voted for abortion to be illegal if she did vote for that then hopefully shell change after her experience sometimes thats what it takes for some people thats what you wish on othersnot harm
texas and florida draconian laws against women
if you feel bad remember these people probably voted for trump and probably vote republican
she could easily drive to another state and get it done  so she doesnt really care
this is what happens when you have extremists one side wants abortion as birth  control and the other side wont allow it when necessary
self righteous republicans to blame for all these problems
no pity whatsoever you were ignorant and naive enough to vote and support abortion bans thinking that it was mostly people using it as birth control  statistically abortions are more common with miscarriages than used as birth control now that you see how detrimental the ban truly is you want sympathy fck no this is what happens when people let their emotions dictate their beliefs and choices pro choice isnt pro abortion pro choice means i dont know what is going on in your life but you have the right to choose whats best for you yall made your bed now lay in it conservatives need to learn to worry more about themselves and less about everyone else i said it before and ill it again the abortion ban is only the start of unnecessary control and the start of us reverting back a couple hundred years look at florida perfect example and texas seems to keep following in their footsteps have fun with that
then you have these people that want to tell you how to live your life and when the tables get turned and they have to follow their own rules they call it unfair unjust and they dont want to follow their own laws
most not all only god knows doctors only predict
i believe that in some cases such as theirs is a compassionate option for both mother and baby
texas is so gross the other ohio
its sick to make a woman try and live a part of her life knowing there is a dead child inside her and having to still give birth
guess what yall  she is not in control  god is    if i can carry a sick child so can she    mine died in utero also  i ddnt kill my child because they were sick    still pro life  when evil is called good in this world thats when you know the world is mad
this is what happens when you vote for guns over people abbott rules texas
what a nightmare for this woman
no one uses it as birth control this is god showing you that
sounds like this is the outcome she voted for welcome to the consequences of your own actions
"they passed this law because of god 
also god now watch me make a baby without a brain"
is this what the texas govt wants
not fair for her or other women  you dont say now here it is theyre trying to travel from state to state for help for their situation why not get the help in the state in which you live oh thats right how you vote took that choice away
who did they vote for
pops has some pretty bad rosacea
this is why we need separation of church and state even in a cowardly state like texas
wheres the land of freedom and choices pushed by the repubs
"god gives us free will in every area of our life and lets us make choices but somehow these unborn fetuses are more precious than anything else hes ever created and better not be touched and the women he chose as the vessels for them do not have a say in anything regarding their pregnancy and they are the worst sinners on earth but not as bad as those gay people if they dare make a choice that harms that fetus even if it mean protecting her life by the way if you wanna own a gun and kill somebody thats alright 

conservative christian thinking be crazy"
i felt sorry for her but this should be a lesson to all of you trump supporters who try to take away womens rights when it happens to you now you understand your thought process was wrong
since texas took control of the outcome of the pregnancy forced her to carry it to term until delivery then the state must shoulder the financial burden of all medical procedures related to pregnancy
republicans listen tf up
this woman and her husband should be the only people who makes the decision what to do in this situation  what is wrong with people
not an advocate for birth control she says this show people only care about certain things only when something happens to them or effect them i had a lot of sympathy at the start but lost a little after she said that now she knows the pain other women are going through
"dont have sex 
thats how easy it is"
im not advocating abortion but all in all this should be a womens personal choice
this is what they voted for this is what they get
the party of family values folks
i feel for them but as youve heard from her at  252  she is clearly regurgitating one of those prolife reasons for being anti arbotion that abortion is being used by people as a form of birth control willynilly she clearly is anti abortion before all this happened to her she for sure is one of the people who celerated the overturning of roe now she sees the effect of the abortion ban first hand all fun and games until it personally affects you i hope she gets her abortion i hope she fights for that right now moving forward
just awful prayers for this family
unfortunately the people who are affected by this is quite small so the politicians wouldnt careless this happen because people believe in the bible
firstly i am sorry that you are having to go through this but as a liberal texan this is what happens when you vote with no compassion you made your views known in the video and now that this is happening to you youre shocked i swear the prolife people are the absolute least compassionate people i know no grasp on reality or personal decision making within the boundaries or established society
so she force to carry a baby thats doomed to die  well she wanted this
not the babies fault doctors always say theres 1 of living but that 1 can be a miracle baby
that is fk disgusting  we will not let them ruin women life like that  these are monster  a fk trauma
so grateful for these brave parents speaking out my story 24 years ago it takes past 20 weeks to figure everything out   i had to travel to another state please america come to your senses 
that is what religion does to society the american talibans will force others to hurt in the name of christianity
how traumatic added to a already stressful and traumatising time
they got what they voted for
they should sue the state of texas for mental stress  damages due to her having to give birth to an unviable pregnancy its not ok she should have full medical care  that does include aborting a fetus especially that the fetus is unviable its  ultimately her decision to make not the state of texas  not anyone elses decision no their body or life not their choice
creepy conservatives asserting themselves in your life never ends well
texas is sick
people so worried about abortions i wouldnt even have a kid in this society in the first placethey have nothing to aspire to anymore what to pay more have less credentials are meaningless work experience is irrelevant its just social economic hierarchy based on things that have zero tangible value truly embarrassing world we have created
