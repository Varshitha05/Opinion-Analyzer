for what its worth abortion was not just legalit was a safe condoned and practiced procedure in colonial america and common enough to appear in the legal and medical records of the period official abortion laws did not appear on the books in the united states until 1821 and abortion before quickening did not become illegal until the 1860s if a woman living in new england in the 17th or 18th centuries wanted an abortion no legal social or religious force would have stopped her when the constitution was written abortion was acceptablelegal and practiced,legal

why exactly did the republicans objecting to the clintonpushed roe v wade law the legal objection was to change the term from 9 months to a normal term around 24 weeks and then to allow each individual state to determine abortion laws based on local votes 

and why roe v wade allowed women to carry a baby to full term abort it in the last minute right before birth the truth was that in some states women for money became incubators for the clintonlegalized babyorgan trade carrying babies for 9 months simply so hospitals could profit from the organ trade in the millions the reps argued that this turned abortion into mu_der since the baby was fully conscious at 9 months baby organs were openly traded and sold for enormous profits by hospitals  a trade considered illegal in most countries",legal

"i just dont understand how can some of those people twist the idea that you are giving back something to people when you are in fact letting government remove rights remove freedoms and dictate what women can and cannot do with their own bodies treating them in such a discriminate way yet another step into theocracy
the brainwashing must be deep for people who cannot feel cognitive dissonance from such a logical contradiction

and again the problem with all of these people is that they are preaching rules that dont have the effect they idealize in their heads in reality because they purposefully remain ignorant and dont look at real life statistics data and refuse to listen to what the scientific community is saying

its trying to pass laws applies rules and see the world according to their uninformed idealistic and ignorant assumptions rather than working with science and years of recorded history to understand the problem in what they are proposing

the whole problem of trying to criminalize abortion is that you cannot stop abortion by criminalizing it we have centuries of history to prove that its exactly because no woman in the real world would ever consider an abortion if it wasnt her last choice no women will even enter an abortion procedure as if it was a choice about walking in the park or not this ridiculous demeaning and quite frankly sexist idea that women would go to an abortion clinic like they go to a tanning saloon is just plain idiotic

and so it doesnt matter what the law says if you have someone desperate for an abortion they will always go with whatever choice that is available legal illegal safe clinic back alley a scientific accredited procedure or a coat hanger we all know this or we should all know this and trying to turn an eye to this truth is just evil it seems to me like a trace of sociopathy
making abortion legal isnt about more abortions its about making the procedure safe its about regulating and supervising the procedure properly  its about saving lives of women who need this very basic access to healthcare that is being taken away from them by politics and extremism

a well regulated abortion clinic and practice actually protects women and in several cases ends up protecting babies too despite what radicals will say it creates a web of support that prevents women from being coerced into it by abusive spouses abusive parents abusive boyfriends and whatnot this is an entire whole point that is being lost there
illegal clinics wont care about that and wont have proper procedures to prevent those so not only you are removing choice from women you are also empowering abusive relationships to end up in abortion cases because you are removing the legality of it which forces the practice to go underground

the real problem with the prolife people is misinformation idealism and trying to fight an invisible enemy they dont comprehend on purpose",social

also the number of child abuse is far worse as some people only have children to get benefits and not love care and be a parent to a child that would love them until that uncaring and abusive parents kill them abortion actually saves lives and dying in their mothers arms is more worse because that is physical abuse to the woman

"if prolifers didnt want to be hypocrites making abortion illegal should have been their last priority 
 
making abortion illegal doesnt stop abortions from happening it only stops safe abortions from happening instead of women going to a doctor to undergo the procedure women will try to give themselves abortions through unsafe methods 

strong sex education classes and easy access to free birth control are the only effective ways of reducing the actual number of abortions people wont get abortions if you give them the tools to not get pregnant in the first place however conservative states routinely try to cut back on both of these while still condemning abortion 

prolifers go on and on about saving the life of the child but what about the quality of life for that child have prolifers improved americas poor foster care systems have they fought to provide financial aid to new mothers who cant afford the children that they didnt want because they couldnt afford them i havent heard prolifers mention anything about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted children 

the united states has poor sex education access to birth control is restricted in one way or another in many parts of the nation our foster care system has been neglected and having children will often financially ruin women who didnt want children 

yet despite all those issues prolifers continue to support keeping abortion illegal which only exacerbates those issues 

the actions of prolifers andor lack of actions show their true intentions prolifers dont really care about the children they only care about punishing women for being sexually active that is the outcome of making abortion illegal it will make women suffer 
they want women to suffer because those women arent conforming to their ideals and beliefs",social

i am very afraid that the ukrainian leadership in the coming days may take such actions and decide on a massive bombardment of a nuclear power plant using storm shadow missiles installed and tested on ukrainian air force aircraft as well as using m142 himars although the russian army has learned to easily intercept missiles from the m142 himars as well as the storm shadow but using a combined attack they can break through the russian shield because even the iron dome of israel cannot withstand a massive combined attack
during the hostilities in ukraine since 2022 it became clear that the ukrainian leadership and ukrainian troops could launch any inhuman attack they killed their own fellow citizens in bucha and hit point u at the station in kramatorsk into a crowd of refugees hits on a bus station in people who tried to leave zaporozhye for vasilyevka zaporozhye region controlled by the russian federation undermining the dams of the kyiv region and undermining the kakhovskaya hpp to blame russia for these attacks but the problem is that the military and officials initially publish in their networks how they shat russia and then erase their records and blame the russian federation for everything and also the united states transferred nuclear waste to ukraine to create dirty bombs and stored in the odessa region
