"she can leave texas to get an abortion and spare us the histrionics 
if she were really in desperate circumstances she would have not wasted any time on lawyers and court proceedings

"i have not seen anyone who has a true understanding of what the texas abortion kate cox case is really about  

what we need to understand is this is not about protecting unborn life aside from religion  it has everything to do with religion the belief in gods will is very strong in the new republican party  the belief that we must accept gods will is absolute for them  we are not supposed question gods decisions and we wont always understand his plan  

if you grew up in a baptist household like i did you understand this but this dogma is never spoken aloud in the political realm you can accept medical help to save the babys life or the mothers life but line is  you have to understand what is gods will because only god can decide who lives and who dies  there is no reasonable way for these extremist republicans to answer this question in a legal or sciencebased sense therefore republicans will continue struggle with this issue and look like sadists to the rest of us  we need to bring this to the forefront as their weakness  

my grandfather was a famous southern baptist preacher from texas so understanding this deeply held belief is important  it is the evangelists mantra that we cannot understand gods plan so we have to accept whatever happens as part of his plan and still accept what he does as somehow a good thing  

we need to make them admit that this is a religious issue not based on science  they are making the argument based on emotion and pseudoscience but it is not really the basis for their desire to control a womans body  it is all about gods will and his plan and that is impossible to define because we can never hope to understand gods plan

i wish someone would talk about this  thanks",legal

the problem with abortions in texas is the fact you can sue the doctor over it if i were to perform an abortion and considered it medically necessary for the mother to live and she comes out fine anyone could still legally sue me in a court i could still lose my medical license because she did fine and the jury didnt think her life was at risk at the time of the abortion therefore no doctor is willing to perform an abortion for any reason,legal

other than roberts the other 5 conservative justices are way more concerned with advancing conservative policy than being neutral arbiters of the constitution   to them overturning roe v wade is the main reason why they were appointed   that is what they truly believe was their job description  not to objectively interpret the constitution but to advance the conservative agenda  as an attorney and someone who cares deeply about the law i find that extremely sad   i dont even care one way or the other about abortion  i care about the constitution and what it means to this great country  stare decisis means more to me than any particular substantive issue  i get that if legal precedent is clearly erroneous it should be reversed as society becomes more enlightened and as certain past draconian views become obsoleteintolerable by society  the court in brown v board of education was right to overturn plessy v ferguson which by the way was a 9  0 unanimous decision which indicates the prior decision in plessy was clearly erroneous  but ignoring stare decisis should never be used to go backward like in this case   also ignoring stare decisis should only be done with a unanimous or near unanimous decision not a 63 split like in this case where the decision is made on partisan lines,legal

heres the thing  it has become obvious that these supreme court justices have their fingers in many pies  the corruption of quite a few of them has become public knowledge  after this piece of information regarding roe vs wade has now been revealed it is my opinion that the public trust has been even more damaged and possibly irrevocably so  at least for these far right justices  with that in mind i would think all of these justices should be painfully aware that their decision on whether trump or anyone else for that matter including themselves is above the law  their corrupt actions may have hidden for decades but the truth will always out  should trump be gifted  with the title above the law and he gets back into the oval office he will inevitable proclaim himself monarchking and with complete power have the ability to denouncedisband scotus if not for their redundancy alone then for their actions in dismissing his cases or their decisions on ruling against him  then they will have no cover at all against trumps vindictive hateful destructive decisions  for him throwing the judicial system into utter chaos would be just another day at the golf course for him  beware the easy path inclinations become slippery slopes that may lead to hungry alligators in a pit at the bottom,legal

this report is the first time i have heard why a supreme court leak is important and yet its importance had to be stressed by jodi kantor  granted chris hayes already gets it but for the rest of us i am thankful jodi kantor emphasized that a supreme court leak makes it very difficult for any of the justices to change how they would decide  as i understand this during the deliberation process of the justices as they tentatively state their positions assuming they will still be able to change their ultimate decisions an insider may leak an interim point wherein the leakers desired outcome would be met if this interim point were the final decision  thus by leaking this interim point the leaker makes it very difficult for any of the justices to change their interim position when making their final decision,legal

"as disgusting  reprehensible as this story shows the conservatives of the scotus to be im in no way shocked  especially about the revelation that it was kavanaugh who was responsible for scheming to take the case but move the date in order to deceive the public based on his actions in the w bush administration  his specific involvement in the ken starr investigationfishing expedition into bill clinton 
just on a basic human level the fact that ruth bader ginsberg  a colleague of many of them for decades  hadnt been deceased for more than a day before they began scheming to undermine her lifes work is a testament to the utter depravity of men like clarence thomas  samuel alito in particular 
i dont know how much more reporting  evidence could possibly be needed at this point to support the fact that these 2 obscenely corrupt political operatives need to be impeached from the sc then theres kavanaugh who needed multiple attempts to become a judge in the 1st place  has had more questions arise about his ethics since becoming a justice than any other person ever confirmed to the court  if he is to remain a justice then the sc needs to enact an ironclad code of ethics  the most scrupulous means of enforcement of any of the lower courts or the other 2 branches of govt combined
even then the scotus needs to be expanded to 13 justices  to match the number of circuit courts of appeals  have term limits imposed by congress the last thing this country needs is more bought  paid for political operatives w no reverence for the law or the rights of the american people who arent just protected by their lifetime appointments but are actively immeasurably emboldened by them  like thomas  alito",legal

"breach of trust is what these supreme court members did to the entirety of the american people to be exact their decision opens the legal door to declare all rights not written down in the constitution and amendments as not rights at all

to be crystal clear rights written into the constitution are legally called enumerated rights meaning theyve been written down in the constitution before this abortion decision there used to be rights called unenumerated rights meaning they are not written down anywhere in the constitution

unenumerated rights were ones like a right to travel a right to wear the cloths you want a right to eat the food you like madison pointed this out before the constitution was finished in the federalist papers and was deeply concerned because he believed a supreme court might nullify all unenemerated rights in a decision and this supreme court did just that with this abortion decision saying the constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion the constitution makes no express reference to a right to wear the clothes you want either see it now

what this supreme court has done with this abortion decision is say there are no unenumerated rights that you do not have a right to eat what you want you do not have a right to travel you do not have a right to wear the cloths you want and all similar things this because those are not written down in the constitution enumerated

this is what madison was terrified of that a supreme court would make such a decision and they just did so believe it or not americans no longer have a single right to do anything that isnt outlined specifically in the constitution theyve declared all unenemerated rights as unconstitutional with this abortion decision outlined in their opinions hows that for a wake up call bet you didnt know either did you",legal

"what is the purpose of the supreme court and how does it function

the purpose of the supreme court is to adjudicate conflicts and disputes between the states and to resolve petitions for redress of grievances when properly legislated laws are made by a properly assembled and operated legislature disproportionately affect or otherwise disenfranchise a state

this necessitates that the supreme court must be assembled by a consensus choice agreement between the states where every state participates by making a list fixed number of candidates from their own state and the aggregate list of candidates must be reduced to a pool of judges no less than 7 and no more than 9 for 5 judges to be selected by lot starting with the petitioner to hear and decide the dispute or grievance the states must be involved because they have agreed to abide by the decisions of the court for their grievances and those decisions are final not mutable meaning they cannot be changed or overturned by a later court

we tend to forget this fact today both in the assembly which is different than replacements for vacancies where the president is required to provide a list of nominees for the states to consider a number and required qualifications is determined by the states in the senate as part of their role of advice and consent and established by senate rules for their proceedings and the president too must be chosen by consensus choice with the same requirement for the states themselves to provide a list of all the candidates that will be considered for that purpose through their electors making the presidents lists of nominees also indirectly a choice of the states

here is where the supreme court was originally established by article ix clause 2 of the articles of confederation and the only difference established by the constitution of the united states is that the pool of judges will be continually seated during good behavior and the appointment of a chief justice to preside over the court proceedings but not participate in the those proceedings as one of the pool of justices everything else is the same including that all petitions must be made to congress as the last resort on appeal not directly to the court and congress is then required to ensure that the petition is properly adjudicated as required by the first amendment of the constitution of the united states

aixc2
the united states in congress assembled shall also be the last resort on appeal in all disputes and differences now subsisting or that hereafter may arise between two or more states concerning boundary jurisdiction or any other cause whatever which authority shall always be exercised in the manner following whenever the legislative or executive authority or lawful agent of any state in controversy with another shall present a petition to congress stating the matter in question and praying for a hearing notice thereof shall be given by order of congress to the legislative or executive authority of the other state in controversy and a day assigned for the appearance of the parties by their lawful agents who shall then be directed to appoint by joint consent commissioners or judges to constitute a court for hearing and determining the matter in question but if they cannot agree congress shall name three persons out of each of the united states and from the list of such persons each party shall alternately strike out one the petitioners beginning until the number shall be reduced to thirteen and from that number not less than seven nor more than nine names as congress shall direct shall in the presence of congress be drawn out by lot and the persons whose names shall be so drawn or any five of them shall be commissioners or judges to hear and finally determine the controversy so always as a major part of the judges who shall hear the cause shall agree in the determination and if either party shall neglect to attend at the day appointed without showing reasons which congress shall judge sufficient or being present shall refuse to strike the congress shall proceed to nominate three persons out of each state and the secretary of congress shall strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing and the judgment and sentence of the court to be appointed in the manner before prescribed shall be final and conclusive and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit to the authority of such court or to appear or defend their claim or cause the court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence or judgment which shall in like manner be final and decisive the judgment or sentence and other proceedings being in either case transmitted to congress and lodged among the acts of congress for the security of the parties concerned provided that every commissioner before he sits in judgment shall take an oath to be administered by one of the judges of the supreme or superior court of the state where the cause shall be tried well and truly to hear and determine the matter in question according to the best of his judgment without favour affection or hope of reward provided also that no state shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the united states",legal

everything to god in prayer

is there trouble anywhere
we should never be discouraged
take it to the lord in prayer
can we find a friend so faithful
who will all our sorrows share
jesus knows our every weakness
take it to the lord in prayer

are we weak and heavy laden
cumbered with a load of care
precious savior still our refuge
take it to the lord in prayer
do thy friends despise forsake thee
take it to the lord in prayer
in his arms hell take and shield thee
thou wilt find a solace there

"back when the first leak happened i said there were 13 more decisions than were written more than 3 years before acb was put on the sc
she wrote these decisions a decade ago to destroy rights in america

the person who leaked the 14 decisions installing a sharia law government and religious law they were very clear with the people that they gave copies

they told them when they could release the other decisions before they are handed out but there were other notes that she wrote about making sure they dont take away birth control before they have a majority in the house and senate and they have a republican president

the conspiracy is super clear in her notes that go back a decade

the big question is who got these files off her laptop

this has to be someone who had intimate access to her

most likely someone who was in her house a lot

i believe she knows for sure and i think the sc knows now who it is that got the files off her laptop
and it is a person in her inner circle and they did not know this person was not a true believer and they believe in freedom not religious law and is a traitor to her and the other half of the government who want sharia law and ban all birth control and make it a death penalty for anyone who is caught trying to get it

  50 of the story wasnt told  notice they have only the interpretation of 2 traumatized biased activist people with no legal or medical education 
    what do the doctors have to say they didnt ask the doctors any questions about the case   

no doctor is going to send her home and say whoops maybe youll live or maybe not  we dont know what to do with a pregnant woman or baby

 in the written article the woman claims they reasoned that it would be too dangerous to drive 8 hours to cross state the line to obtain a legal abortion in a neighboring state but waited 3 days at home wo using her prescribed antibiotics and developed sepsis   really   smart choice

this is extremely sad and my heart breaks for them and everything about this situation i hate saying because im nurse but i knew this during my clinical rotation in ob that after a woman has been in labor for too long after her waters break you give antibiotics its open surface and any organism loves them as well as if a woman that tests positive for strep b you automatically hang antibiotics as soon as they go into labor to protect the baby i dont care if she was about to miscarry she should have treated like anyone other women with a viable baby that waters broke too early this womanhusband might now be able to have a baby now it just goes to show how twisted some people can be in their own beliefs when they choose a living human over a baby they say wont survive i highly doubt this is a doctor mistake because they would be suing for malpractice too,ethical
"i dont underestandher water broke and they said there was nothing they could do why didnt they perform a c section or an induction and try to ssve the baby and if the baby died and she got an infection they still should have done a c section or an induced delivery

those doctors are idiots

as a doctor you took an oath to provide your patients with the best possible healthcare so they can live happy and healthy lives but her water broke too soon and these doctors just go damn that suckssorry umm sounds like a personal problem they should be charged",legal
if i were to become pregnant and see the baby had no brain stem and the doctor said this baby is not going to be viable or if they told me you and the baby could die from this and see the baby and i die my thoughts are one they can do medical research testing on me and my child learning from my child and my death we do not know gods plan if we are meant to die then we are meant to die for a certain cause maybe trust in god  not mankind,ethical
the difference is an abortion kills a living developing baby this is very different this is a situation where a baby has died but was not expelled which is bizarre because if your water breaks you usually start labor and deliver very shortly afterwards if anything she should have been given oxytocin if labour didnt start it seems to me like something is missing here,legal

"when pregnant the cells of the baby migrate into the mothers bloodstream and then circle back into the baby its called fetalmaternal microchimerism

for 41 weeks the cells circulate and merge backwards and forwards and after the baby is born many of these cells stay in the mothers body leaving a permanent imprint in the mothers tissues bones brain and skin and often stay there for decades every single child a mother has afterwards will leave a similar imprint on her body too

even if a pregnancy doesnt go to full term or if you have an abortion these cells still migrate into your bloodstream

research has shown that if a mothers heart is injured fetal cells will rush to the site of the injury and change into different types of cells that specialize in mending the heart

the baby helps repair the mother while the mother builds the baby

how cool is that

this is often why certain illnesses vanish while pregnant

its incredible how mothers bodies protect the baby at all costs and the baby protects  rebuilds the mother back  so that the baby can develop safely and survive

think about crazy cravings for a moment what was the mother deficient in that the baby made them crave

studies have also shown cells from a fetus in a mothers brain 18 years after she gave birth how amazing is that

if youre a mom you know how you can intuitively feel your child even when they are not therewell now there is scientific proof that moms carry them for years and years even after they have given birth to them

"1 abortion bans do nothing women will always have the option of abortion whether its banned or not 
2 abortion bans actually increase the number of abortions ironically so i guess you people really arent about saving fetal lives so much as virtue signaling
3 fetuses now have a right that no other human being has and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another persons body to stay alive no other human has ever been granted that right even if you stab someone and theyre bleeding out and you have matching blood types the government cannot force you to give them your blood to keep them alive or if you use a mask gloves etc but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organs start shutting down the government cannot forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organs you used protection so the chances of giving this person the disease that youre a carrier for were very low but it still happened and now theyre dying because of you guess whatthe government does not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive thats exactly what an abortion ban attempts to do however so im not sure why fetuses should have that right when no one else does",legal
this story is concerning regarding kylies health and the precedent that texas law sets here regarding the rights to a fetus in babies with alobar holoprosencephaly many are stillborn and if they do survive the birthing process only 50 of patients survive by 45 months of age and 20 of these cases survive by 12 months of age 1 they also have major physical deformities including a single eye cyclopia epilepsy and seizures intellectual disability and problems regulating their own body temperature heart rate and breathing which requires them to spend their entire life in a hospital 3 this is a severe economic burden to the family and to the state and could be a major emotional burden to the family involved this is also without taking into consideration the dangers that come with childbirth especially when compared to the abortion that kylie was seeking the pregnancyassociated mortality rate among women who delivered live neonates was 88 deaths per 100000 live births the mortality rate related to induced abortion was 06 deaths per 100000 abortions 2 with that in mind i believe the laws in texas endangered kylies life and encroached on her medical autonomy and her ability to make a medical decision that was in her best interest and safety it could be said that kylie could just go out of state to get an abortion but this places undo financial hardship on a family when there are capable medical facilities much closer i understand that people might not agree that the risks to kylie here outweighed the fetuses right to life however i think one needs to consider the quality of life here i think the laws in texas as they stand could cause undo morbidity and mortality to mothers in kylies situation and encroach on ethical principles that are generally agreed upon in the medical community,legal

its important to remember that abortion is healthcare and there are many reasons why somebody may need or want to have an abortion regardless of the reason pregnancy even the most uncomplicated ones can cause adverse health effects and no one should be forced to make a healthcare decision they dont want to i also want to address that the vast majority of people receiving abortions are not using it as birth control the bronx abortion clinic reported that about fifty percent of the women who receive abortion used some time of birth control in addition more than fifty percent of the women receiving abortions had never had one before while i want to emphasize that not all abortions are because of unplanned pregnancies this should not limit abortions to only those cases some people who have unplanned pregnancies may want to continue with it but if they do not it is unethical to make someone continue a pregnancy this will violate many peoples autonomy if they have no choice in what changes occur to their body,ethical

"i couldnt watch this bc i immediately started to tear up
10 years ago my boyfriend and i decided we wanted to have a baby well i schedueled an apointtment they did a test said it was positive and sent me to a different hospital i thought it was normal bc this hospital was basically for sick and emergencies well the second apointment they told me there were two heart beats and i would have to go to a high risk hospital after my next visit with them my next visit was a glucose test and after that we were sent to a hospital about 1hr away from where we lived this is where we found out just how high risk our twin pregnancy was they told us from the jump that this would go week by week we had weekly visists and each visit theyd say next week we might have both we might have one or well loose both but lets hope for the best i lost one at 22 weeks my body went into labor and i had the second twin living he lived for about 1 hr and the other was still born their names are elijah  gabriel i had no option to have the still born twin i had to carry him as long as my body would let me and that was less than 24hrs had i made it 24 weeks i would have been admitted into the hospital for the ramainder of my pregnancy

i can research twin pregnancy all day long and figure out a game plan but you never know what will happen nothing can stop what is to come if your doing everything right to care for your unborn child not drinking not doing drugs taking your vitamins eating
they said one of my twins wasnt getting what he needed the living twin weighed more than he did i took my vitamins and ate as my dr directed and still one passed away no one could have controlled how much went to which twin

so i think its ignorant for people in the comments to say nobody cares about what shes going through or she should have thought about this before
to the people who dont want to abort their child they dont think about the abortion laws bc its not something they want to do however if you are in a situation like this there should be an option to do so if the baby has passed on and your body isnt going into labor maybe the doctor can induce you idk if that is apart of the law that the dr cant induce a pregnancy but if the baby 

ok i stopped typing and watched the video
this is very sad
how does a baby or person live with no brain
maybe this ultrasounds is wrong it has happened
ive been there where i was only able to hold my baby for an hour until he took his last breath he wasnt developed enough and the hospital didnt have any supplies  this was supposed to be the high risk pregnancy hospital this was the place they sent people for high risk pregnancies if st jude and leboner can save a baby at 20 weeks then why couldnt this high risk pregnancy hosptial try to save mine at 22 weeks
i didnt fight because i felt in my heart it was time to let him go he went to heaven with his twin brother i knew it was time in that moment to say goodbye i love both of them 3
two months later i found out i was having another baby and her name is lailah shes 8 now 3
i can only imagine trying to care for a baby that is possibly be none responsive
knowing at any moment he or she could be gone

idk what i would do in that situation having been through something not so the same before but right now i would say id carry the baby and enjoy what time i did have with him or her hold them snuggle them bc either way that is your baby it sounds so awful to say i dont want my baby bc he doesnt have a brain saying it that way does sound bad but listen to them they wanted a baby they dont want to abort their child but now they are preprocessing the loss of their unborn child their child wont live past a year based off of statistics and the baby will essentially be lifeless its sad either way you go about it but the baby is developing hes growing he just doesnt have a brian so i understand that he is living and you cant terminate a living baby so id say carry the baby to term and enjoy the time you do have with him hold your baby and love him bc any second he could pass away",legal
"she knows that i have a hard time controlling it its just she wasnt expecting it to stop no  but she just wanted me to learn that behaviour is not ok you know

like sometimes people with mental disorders have behaviours and violent behaviours that they cant control sometimes  but even if you know that you still should put a consequence on that behavior

even though he might or she might not be able to control it she or he can at least learn that ok yes this behaviour isnt ok and i need help you know

yes i still had violent outburst but thats not the point the point is that i knew it was wrong i eventually learned that  yes i cant control it but instead of hitting i could do you know get a counsellor or do you something you know so that i dont act that way in the future


thats why she created a consequence because she was hoping that i would acknowledge that and try to get somebody to help me deal with it you know  and it worked i havent been violent for quite a few years you know because im not in a situation where i feel like i have to pound the life out of somebody you know im not in that situation so as long as i dont get put in that situation

you should never see me get physically andor emotionally violent again because thats a problem if i do end up living in a place where somebodys screaming or yelling you know when they get mad or upset and its also why theyre getting upset too thats what ticks me off

right like i had a roommate that used to get mad and hed yell and swear at the support staff for trying to help him do his laundry

he would get very rude and belligerent if somebody tried to help him with some thing sometimes i dont even think he was angry sometimes i think he just like to behave like that i know sometimes i think he liked the idea of looking tougher you know

instead of just saying no i dont need any help with that thank you very much though you were very very very kind to try to help me

you know that wouldve been the proper way you know and most people do get ticked off and yeah they do they can get physically violent  but most people choose not to do that right

but with me it isnt a choice you may ask ok if you cant control getting violent then why havent you done that for a few years now

well let me explain that its because i know i cant help it and because im so scared that i will end up in serious trouble you know that i just try to avoid those situations you know

because i know i cant i might be not able to control my actions in the moment so i always like somebody to go with me so that if that happens i can just tell them

ok lets get the heck out of here you know that if i were to be on my own you know it would be much harder because yes i could leave and i have before too as well

but it wasnt as quick thinking i was actually thinking should i get involved or should i just walk away  because i really wanted to do you know if somebody was being mean to somebody i really want to step in there and save them

but you know my counsellor that i have now says that you know if they were to be like that its better off that wait until they leave and

then go up and see if the person is ok and offer them support because if i went to that person and i started it all yelling and screaming in his face or her face

then i would be just as bad as he is or she is you know and i dont want to look that way i dont want to look like an idiot i dont want that person that is being treated badly to look at me and

i think i am being a bully and not the other person you know because thats exactly what they would think you know  they would think im pulling the bully and then all the attention will be on me and

i would be in big trouble i would be being a bully not the other person so its just good to wait until theyre done and left and then you go up to the person

and ask them if theyre ok and offer support and say to the person that you didnt deserve what happened you know that was completely rude you know

i mean theres people that dont want to have kids and dont wanna give birth because they just cant handle probably what they hear on a daily basis like they dont want their child to end up a school shooter or you know a person who kills more than more people add an event on 

like sometimes in barrie they would have fairs and that they usually have a fair that goes on in the summer at the waterfront  and people just like to ruin that for kids and their families and friends to

like lots of teenagers go there with their friends and have fun and have a ball no just a bunch of innocent people just going to have fun thats all  but people like to use that opportunity you know to kill them at that fair you know

thank god that hasnt happened yet thank the lord  but youre starting to hear more and more and more that now you know would like the july 4 shooting that one was bad i think a little boy like five or six years old maybe even younger had lost his parents you know

i think his dad i think the boy and his mom and dad are watching the parade and just like everybody else you know they were killed lotta people were killed that day you know

so yeah its very very very scary you know so im disgusted that doctors cant do anything to stop a baby from growing in your belly  because i know in canada abortion is legal

and i dont know why in the states people dont have the option of abortion  because i dont think itll change the fact that lots and lots and lots of people will still have kids you know i think theres so so so many people that would at least adopt do you know kids from other countries  so it doesnt make sense to me that abortion is banned because you know

theres lotta kids for adoption do you know nobody hass to give birth you know  i mean when you adopt a child youre basically signing lots and lots and lots of paperwork and signing documents saying that that child is now yours you know

its exact same thing if you were to give birth because  you have to sign papers in that too you know theres a lot that goes into pregnancy probably just the same amount as you were to adopt

do you know what you need to have a room toys depending on how young the child is you have to buy clothing you know so its still as much work as it is to you know get pregnant you know

and plus i think youre allowed to have some say thats the only difference is that youre allowed you know youre allowed to have the same as to what personality of the child youre looking for and you know how friendly you want them to be

like if youre a mother and a father who likes to go out and enjoy boat rides and traveling you would want to adopt a child that would enjoy that too you know

yeah giving birth you dont always have that choice you know you got like a 5050 chance that you know youre taking your chances and

when you give birth sometimes children grow up and they arent very nice and did you get into lots of trouble sometimes they dont care about how their parents feel like half of the school shooters or mass murders probably have a very loving family and that will never never never except violence in their house i know my parents dont you know they never agreed with violence of any kind 

i mean if i had to leave from school because of my violent behavior  then she will have consequences for me and she sure did you know she didnt put up with any of that

even though she knows i cant help it right",social
