"26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; --HOLY BIBLE"
abortion yes üëçüëçüëç
No state has made abortion illegal
gather around men and don't sleep with ugly women
the majority of women are against killing the unborn.
why do women scream like banshees to kill their own?
RIP to the 65+million babies aborted since 1973
I want abortion/murder to be illegal in all 50 states. The only case where it would be considered would be if the mother and baby were both gonna die guaranteed in childbirth. But it would be an emergency thing and not something anyone could do.

Good from trump
I would ban abortion in the UK unless it‚Äôs extreme circumstances
Im having 5 children Im transforming my life
Italy should ban abortion and Japan should
Don‚Äôt complain about fertility
"This reporter is so ignorant, there is no Constitutional right to abortion, never was!"
How can women be so damn stupid!!! Giving up their own rights as WOMEN!!  This is a woman's right!!
This moment will go down in history ‚ù§
"I'm adamantly in favor of legal abortion at anytime for any reason. However, I'll make a deal with you all. Pass laws that make vasectomies mandatory for *ALL* men and boys of puberty age nation wide, and have it enforced to the letter. No exceptions. He can have his vasectomy reversed when him and his partner are *both* ready to have children and will be legally obligated to get a vasectomy again once his partner gets pregnant. Then, and only then will I co-sign banning abortion with acceptions for minors and health complications of the woman or fetus. To be clear; When I say health complications I mean right when the problem is dected, and not waiting until the woman is on death's doorstep.

That person in the thumbnail nial needs to thin those thick, ugly eyebrows!"
"it is not freedom to kill a child, it is murder."
The pro choice supporters are unhinged and embarrassing. The liberals get worse and worse every year.

Abortion is not a constitutional right.
Great win!   Babies can live.  Like all the abortion rights folks can live
"Bruh, imagine crying because you can't kill your unborn child anymore. üòÇ"
Women do abortion for the health of themselves and they will only be killing something not even resembling a human. It‚Äôs not like that kid is going to be the next Albert Einstein or Alan Turing. You call this progressing? I call this one step into a dystopian country.
"I believe abortion should be banned except in last resort emergencies and there should be no government funding of abortions. Getting rid of Roe V Wade actually secured women‚Äôs right by giving women the right to be born. 

And of course the pro choice and pro abortionists are angry they are always angry about one thing or another"
Blessed be God
"The idiots who said ""my body my choice"" failed to uphold that principle across the board and only doing so when it suited them, and now their hypocrisy has come back to haunt them. No mistake, this is a bad move, but ultimately for the worthless and inept feminist movement is their chickens coming home to roost."

"Fortunately, the re-criminalisation of abortion in Canada through legislative and/or judicial means will never see the light of day.  Evidently, abortion has long remained a 'proverbial' third-rail of Canadian politics."
Lady are you nuts? The unborn are separate people from the mother. Unborn human lives matter.
Imagine being mad because you can‚Äôt kill a baby
Thank God! This is the greatest news of my generation!!!
"4:43.  Well, of course people who kill babies ought to go to jail.  They ought to get the death penalty.  ‚ò†Ô∏è"
"Since when is it a right to kill a baby in the womb: where is the baby's right?  ""the right to choose is the right to murder a baby - a living human life in the womb"".  All of these people even the reporters will have to give an account to God."

"""WOMEN ARE ****ED!!!!"" - No, LEFTISTS are ****ed. REAL women don't care because they're not the immoral, baby-murdering SCUM that you are!!!! REAL women are sickened by abortion."
Never have I seen people SO despondent about not being able to murder innocent children. The immorality of the modern American Left is beyond anything I've ever seen in my ample study of history. Genghis Khan slaughtered children without hesitation nor remorse. Is there a difference here?
"Look at all those women protesting against ""women's rights"""
"""I should be able to f*ck with zero fear of responsibility! If that means killing an inconvenient child then so be it! It cant be wrong if its legal!!!""

These fools would have been spitting on slavery abolitionists. Non-christian post-abortive here. So my perspective kind of trumps so many of their pro-abortion talking points.

Thank God for this step in the right direction. I disagree with 99.9% of abortions, but can at least concede to debate it for the extreme outliers that they love to tout as the reasons it should be legal."
Where them ladies husbands at. They need to grab them and settle them down. Aint no way my wife be embarrassing me like that in public without getting a spankin.
"These people are possessed!
They want to satisfy their sexual desires without facing any consequences. There is no argument to support abortion."
Someone best tell these women about condoms or the fact he can pull out üòÇ. If they hadn‚Äôt treat abortion like a contraceptive and wanting to do it in the 3rd trimester then it might not have been overturned. My body my choice üòÇ. Where was that with covid jab üòÇüòÇ

"LETS END THIS STUPID DEBATE BY MAKING IT AN ISSUE FOR ONLY WOMEN TO VOTE ON, THEN LIVE BY THE OUTCOME !"
W. Pro life. Finally atleast some babies will be saved from these murderous monsters
"Would you agree, that without one's ""health, Safety and Welfare"" that The right of the people to be secure in their ""persons"" cannot be assured? 

Would you also agree that the basic foundation of Healthcare is about ones 'Health, Safety and Welfare"" and therefore it is implicit in Amendment 4 Persons. 

Would you further agree, that being that Abortion has been an accepted medical practice for over 50 years in us history, that Thomas's assertion that it is unconstitutional can be outflanked by those who actually know the US Constitution?

To outflank Thomas, According to Amendment 10, Amendment 4 and the Bill of rights is superior law to the States adhoc that were post Thomas assertion, for persecuting people. 

Hence these state laws would have no traction - if the Dems had the MOJO to USE THE US CONSTITUTION IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE!"
"POV: ""Constitutional right to abortion"" Where does it exactly say that killing babies is a right?"
‚ÄúFundamental right‚Äù says Biden. How can anyone stand with a straight face saying that killing a baby is in any way a ‚Äúright‚Äù?
Murdering babies shouldn‚Äôt have ever been legal.
"Poor liberals, now they  cant murder babies anymore."
"It's a bit bias. I honestly came to listen and not have an opinion but it's so bias. I just can't. Sure pro life person didn't completely answer the question, but she did put down her standing. It seems non negotiable. Her stance is similar to make sure gender are equal we should kill the other gender. I'm not saying that's what she's saying, just an example of what I think of her stance. Now she did bring up a point abortion is mainly a social problem of what society might have become and social issues shouldn't be paid in the children's lives. She should have asked the pro choice about that"
"Human sacrifice has been there for thousands of years, the length of existence doesn't make it right."
"I was never more proud to be a conservative than I was the day the Dobbs ruling was handed down. What a glorious day that was. I‚Äôm a young guy. I‚Äôm not a lawyer or a judge or a politician. But if my vote and my yearly donations to pro-life organizations played even a small role in making this possible, I am content."
this is good now people have to be responsable
KIDS THEN WHY DO YOU NOT RALLY TO SUE ALL ORGANIZED RELIGION THEN WHY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU WHEN YOU DO NOT RALLY TO STOP COPS AND POLICE UNIONS FOR THE FACT SO MANY HAVE DIED BY POLICE SHERIFF FBI STATE TROOPERS CROSSFIRE BUT ITS A STANDARD OF DISARM EVERYTHING THAT IS DUMB SUE AND PETITION TO STOP CENTURIES OF CHILD ABUSE THAT IS THE REAL ONES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT OWNS ALL THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OWNS ALL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ITS THE ONE THAT THINK THEY HAVE A RIGHT STILL TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO WHILE IF YOU DONT LISTEN AND REALIZE DISARMING THE ORDINARY CITIZENS IS SO STUPID GET READY WHEN USA ENDS UP BOMBED THEN WHAT WILL ALL OF YOU DO OH THATS RIGHT YOU ALL RALLIED UP FOR NO MORE 2 AMENDMENT RIGHTS ALL OF YOU IDIOTS RALLY FOR ABORTIONS INSTEAD OF ADOPTIONS AND OR SENDING THE FETUSES TO LABS TO HELP TRY AND GIVE THEM TO MOTHERS NEEDING AND WANTING CHILDREN
All fine and dandy until the courts are dealing with more children than they can support because parents didn't want the kid and had to decide keep or give uo for adoption.   until there are more parents in jail due to child abuse. Until all these unwanted kids become the problem of our country.  Don't agree or disagree with abortion.  It's a sad reality that noone is going to win.
Weird to see women out in the streets squealing for the right to rip their unborn babies apart limb by limb.
It was never constitutional to begin with.
The united states government can't stop killed they killed people everyday even americans and non-americans
"Right you can be executed but can't get an abortion?

Bunch of baby killers on the lib side.
"God formed us in the womb, as we read in Psalm 139. It should be a protected place, as God designed us. If people claim to be Christian and also say they are pro-abortion (substitute their euphemistic term) then that is a massive contradiction. Exodus 20 - don't kill. God bless you Americans who have realised that, and we need more here in Europe!"
"the will of the people is to have abortions?
then why are so many states banning it?"
"These woman‚Äôs minds are so warped. They put the emphasis of choice and rights at a wrong juncture. Their right is to choose a proper mate and to choose a proper person to take their panties off for NOT to take their panties off for random multiple men and then kill an innocent infant because they were immoral in their decision making. That is NOT woman power. Woman‚Äôs power is in creation not destruction. Woman - love your self! Males you are not manly because you have tones of notches on your belt! It is not manly to string multiple woman along, its gross. Males respect your selves, respect your seed!"
"Wow, women now will have to think twice before laying up with CHAD or TYRONE without birth control."

"Here we go, have you guys ever heard of the book called Freakonomics? I'II cut to the chase when Roe v. Wade got institutionalized. There was an economic study done on the amount of criminals in incarceration, 20 years later, after Roe v. Wade got implemented the crime rate suddenly dropped/the people incarcerated. This means that if those parents would've been forced to have those children, they would've grown up poor and neglected, the most important parts when making a criminal. But 20 years later they weren't there. What does a good mother to for their child? They do what's best, and maybe what's best for some children is wiping them off the face of the fucking earth before they have chances to lead miserable lives with the rest of us!"
"The left: ‚ÄúMen shouldn‚Äôt have a say concerning an abortion!‚Äù

Oh, so now men can get pregnant but can‚Äôt make laws concerning what happens while they are pregnant!? 
The left: ‚Äústop using our own words to show how stupid we are!‚Äù"
"Truly unbiased reporting right here, award worthy."
Let The Foetus Killers PerishüîÖ
Abortion is not a right Channel 4.
Murder should never be a freedom.  How   would the left feel if abortion was only accepted if a women can prove she was raped with DNA evidence of the male who got her pregnant?  And also only in the case where a Dr can scribe that she will be in a horrible medical situation if she does not get one.  No other exceptions.  That will still be less than 1 percent.  Something tells me they would protest even more.
Great day
"You can over turn those rights, the difference is women can make themselves abort however they want to or need to.
You can't stop women from doing it causing an abortion onto themselves."
"What's an effective way to get Texas Lawmakers to change their view on abortion law?
Get their wives pregnant, if they have any."
If they want a abortion it should be just like cosmetic surgery if you want it you pay cash no free money or insurance accepted
Is abortion still allowed in the first trimester? If yes then what's the issue?

How can and girl scream abortion is a human right...so sad
"3:40 if the majority of people wanted to bring back slavery, should USA bring it back? Obviously not. I don't care if even all America wanted to kill children, it still should be illegal. And praise the Lord Jesus, it now is."
"Women will just abort with pills. What is trump going to do, break into their houses? Lol."
I love that American women like killing babies.
I'll pay for any woman who want a abortion to travel to a legal state to get it done.  So FU all you states that made it illegal....guess I found a way around your state laws and a big SCREW YOU!!! LOL
Don't we want leftist woke liberal women to be first in line to end future voter's ? I say yes please. Hurry down there right now...
Now we can call it a Fetus shower instead of a baby shower. Congrats

Is the only appropriate response to pro-lifers"
Scotus Based?
Still kinda insane seeing so many people upset over not being able to murder infants
"For crying out loud, you screaming pro-aborts. Women's rights are not just about abortion.  In fact, Women's rights didn't even begin with abortion in the conversation. If you really care about Women's rights, then start caring about the little women in the womb. Hey..., bald guy. 'a right that has existed for 50 yrs'... Think about the thousands of years previous when it wasn't legal..., and why it wasn't."
FJB..fool
God please save us for the world has been corrupted by Satan. If I become president I'll make a point just by banning anything with abortion and even condoms for a year. Can you live without lustful desires or will you take the chance to have a child?
"Scream, baby-killers, scream! üòÇ"
Abortion is not a right. It‚Äôs a medical service. You do however have a right to do whatever you want at home with a coat hanger. Good luck.
I could watch this all day lol
Abortion was never a constitutional right. And now it is up to what the citizens of each state vote to keep abortion legal or to make it illegal. Lefty overractionists
Liberal Americans are Brain washed Americans
"This is why women shouldn't be leaders in anything, when emotions take over they lose all logic and common sense. Show your emotions in the comments liberals. I know you can't help it after reading this LOL .... PS abortion is murder you psychopaths."
To the idiot reporter abortion is not a constitutional right no where in the constitution does it say that is a right what an idiot statement
"Channel 4 is known for its poor, biased reporting.
Nobody with any intelligence takes it seriously"
It wasn't ever a constitutional right you fucking lying retard
So wait please tell me why it is wrong to kill a child out side the womb but it's ok to kill one inside the womb thelifeof the 1 week old child is nodiffrent from a kid In the womb please explain to me all u pro abortionist
Bad reporting
why is women rights more important then a babies rights they should be the same
pro life for life
"Abortion gives women the ability to determine whether or not a man becomes a father, that's a lot of power to loose!"
"Roe v Wade passed 5 months ago and yet  women riots who think abortion should stay alive is so pathetic, it makes me laugh every time. Abortion is not a constitutional right. Never has, never will"
"Some of those women claim my body my choice,  it's your body but not your life you're taking and first of all they shouldn't blame the unborn baby for the irresponsible decision they made to get pregnant."
what if it was one of the supreme court people had a child that got pregnant by  force they would think differant about it
Which states made abortion illegal? The dems are fos only late term should and is illegal in some states. You can even cut your boys parts off if you wanted a girl.
Most of these woman should be ashamed there not using abortions  because they got took advantage of there partying sleeping around getting pregnant  then casually Aborting a human life after a long weekend making bad choices  or lying about it  people don‚Äôt take responsibility anymore they can all stand around yelling my body my choice but most of the time abortions are murder from a bad decisions.
Abortion is the death of an unborn baby. End of story
"They're gonna have to use birth control now and be accountable. üò•
What's the world coming to"
"They talk about women's rights, women's right to choose, what about the rights for the unborn babies? So sad that too many babies did not live because of their mother's decision to abort them."
Jippy it is a win for poor baby's
I drink your feminist tears. *SHHLURRRRP!* I drink them up!
"Whenever I hear people talk about this case it's always about what they think should be allowed morally, rather than looking at what the Dobs v Jackson is actually about. The decision wasn't based around what is right or wrong, but instead it's the question of ""should the government be allowed to tell states what laws to hold on abortion?"" To prevent the government from having too much power, states tend to make most of their own laws apart from the federal government, and abortion laws vary greatly from one state to another. Most states allow abortion up to 24 weeks, and in New York it can be at full term. Personally, I'm fine with abortion being legal, but not at full term. But that's just my opinion, and my opinion isn't the issue here. The issue is about who should decide what all the definitive laws on abortion should be in each state. Should the individual states be forced to adopt laws based on the bigger government's desires?"
The Biggest Rally in the World is from the Pro Life Movement.. therefore the Supreme Court speaks for the Majority of the American people.
Just because you put rights in front of something it doesn‚Äôt make it right
"Oh no...my state made abortion illegal,  I guess they win and I'm going to have to have this baby. Oh wait...I know..I'll just travel to a state to where it's legal to get it done....ROFLMAO"
I love all the comments here by anti abortion people who completely ignore the fact that the only thing this did was make people who want it travel to a state where it's legal to get it done..

"Why is the punishment only on the women? Some men lie, some are married and creating single parent homes elsewhere circumstances are different for everyone."
Look how they portray the pro lifers as the crazy ones ü§£ and the baby killers as oppressed victims.
I see  on one hand with a lot of women are happy that this is gone only the crazy little women who wants to kill babies are mad he probably want to sacrifice the babies that they killed to the devil I'm not surprised if they do
She shouldn‚Äôt really worry about abortion not with those eyebrows.
The hypocrisy of baby killers.

Kind of like forcing women to wear a burka and only travel in the company of a male relative.If the anti-abortion people really cared about reducing abortions rather than forcing people to abide by their rules, they would work to make family planning and contraception free to all women in the United States (and vasectomies for men).

Make a short story short for those who think murdering gods kids is ok.  They should be worried god doesn‚Äôt abort them. There are women who have had an abortion and know what they did is wrong under their father in heaven and pray for forgiveness and have a relationship with him. Then there is monsters who who have an abortion/murder gods children and spit on their father in heaven. You say God or Jesus and the demons come out of the wood work.
"abortion=murdered unless it is for medical reasons. 
those young zygotes or features also deserve the right to come to society even if it is just one minute and a taste of life.
and I promise you this, the supporters of this crime that, regret in the future is an understatement.
if the baby suffers because of coming to the wrong person, what do you think you will suffer. go and read about the consequence of abortion before you suffer from what you jump around the street and beg for  coming back to you in the harsh way possible.
this is my advice from a women to women."

The Word of The Lord Spoken to Timothy
For All Those Who Have Ears to Hear


Thus says The Lord:¬†

Peoples of the earth, you have hated life, you have polluted My garden! Diseased and awful generation, you have destroyed the garden! And so I am come to cleanse, and to wipe away! I am come down, My face is very near! Do you feel the heat of My wrath, O ignorant and vain peoples?! You retain no knowledge at all! Only greed and wickedness, wickedness upon wickedness, passes before your eyes without ceasing, and oh how you love to have it so!
DEAD GENERATION, YOUR HEARTS ARE STONE! Day after day you build up wrath, the vessels overflow! Day by day, the bodies are stacked up in heaps! Day by day, the unborn are slaughtered, whole generations of people murdered without cause, multitudes of innocent cast off as refuse! Yet you think Me too harsh, and My punishments too severe, My judgments unfair.

I AM THE LORD, AND THIS IS MY EARTH!
THESE ARE MY CHILDREN!...
All you see, from the ground beneath your feet
To the farthest reaches of the universe, is MINE,
And I shall do as I please!...
I shall do according to the counsel
Of My own will,[2]¬†for I am God!

Therefore, O peoples of the earth, because you have slaughtered the innocent and murdered your neighbor, lo, you have even made for yourselves laws that all may do their pleasure in unrighteousness and perform evil at their leisure, so then shall I also declare MY Law, and it shall fall hard upon the backs of all nations! Yea, I have put forth the decree and hasten to carry out your sentences, O peoples of the earth!
And what is the sentence, you ask?...¬†Look upon the slaughtered innocent! Look upon their torn and broken bodies; behold how they are torn in pieces! See how their blood pours down and their limbs are strewn about! LOOK! Look how they are scraped out of their mother‚Äôs womb! Look upon the works of your hands, you evil and most wicked generation! LOOK UPON YOUR WICKEDNESS! LOOK UPON ALL YOU HAVE DONE!
Thus says The Lord God, Creator of Heaven and Earth:¬†Because of this blood which remains on your hands, because of all the multitudes of slain you have piled up in heaps, because of the evil works of your hands in where you have agreed together, to both do and allow them, to make them law, THUS SHALL I IN LIKE MANNER DO UNTO YOU! IN LIKE MANNER SHALL YOU RECEIVE AT MY HAND!
Lo, even double shall you receive at My hand, and double again, until there is no place found that is not laid waste, until every land is polluted by the stink of rotting corpses! Both man and beast shall lie down in death together; they shall be as refuse upon the land! I shall tear down your cities and break apart all your dwelling places! I shall tear your leaders in pieces and pour out the blood of your mighty men upon the ground, until it reaches unto the neck![3]
Behold, all mighty and evil men shall be torn in pieces, with their limbs strewn about in the open fields and in the waste places![4]¬†Behold, the great army, the astonishing company, the assemblage of nations who have come together to fight against The Holy One of Israel,[5]¬†shall be broken in pieces without hand! For strong is The Lord, and sharp is the sword which proceeds from His mouth![6]¬†Behold I, even I, The Lord of Hosts, shall scrape every last vestige of man and his inventions from the earth at the last day! For I am God, and the glory of My strength is revealed in My Holy One!

The glory of men must die!
Declares The Lord of Hosts,

"Too many pro abortion people, other than me prove their hypocrisy over the issue. Waaa waaa Roe was overturned they cry! How dare you politicians put bans on abortion! But they're hypocrits! I keep shouting there should be NO restrictions. Restrictions for abortion are stupidly  fine by most pro abortion people! I'm outraged and have said it at the time heartbeat laws are wrong! Other pro abortion people are silent! Waiting periods, forced sonograms are wrong! Where were the protests about those? Non existent! The LGBTQ people are getting into the fray saying our rights will come next because Roe was overturned but NOT ONE OF THEM cared about abortion restrictions during Roe! NOT ONE of them while demanding Roe and the years after have joined or started protests demanding no abortion restrictions! They never cared because most women who get abortions are straight! But when their rights are infringed the world must stop spinning! In these protests now over the abortion bans where are there any LGBTQ people holding up protests signs decrying the overturn of Roe? NONE! They're just mad that they'll be next for rights removal! And men? Sure they're all for abortion so they don't have to pay child support! Where were the men marching with women in the 70's demanding with them the right to abortion! The namby pamby pro lifers certainly won't take pregnant women and young girls into their home while they're pregnant paying their medical bills and being there at birth and helping to raise that unwanted kid! If you say life is so precious then where are you when that life is growing in utero! And the namby pamby well I donate to charities who help single mothers with kids people won't even donate unless they get a tax deduction because they have to personally benefit! I'm fed up with the hypocrisy on both sides! I'm all for abortion! I had one! But in 1987 there were NO waiting periods, NO forced sonograms, NO heartbeat laws and the minute those came out years later I was yelling about those while other pro abortion people were silent! Abortion will NOT stop! It'll go back to back ally butchers!"

"Technically speaking, they didn‚Äôt take any constitutional right away. That‚Äôs just a talking point used by one side to try and state that it was inalienable. 

What they did was reverse what they found to be a mistaken decision from 49-50 years ago. 

That is to say, people were operating for those years under a mistaken premise. 

Whether you agree with the court or not, that‚Äôs the objective facts of what occurred.

They didn‚Äôt strip you of some explicit entrenched right."
What I'd like for them to do is get a copy of the constitution and read it all front to back and they will find there is no abortion rights in there to begin with
"These ""women"" that are cryingü§£üíÄü§°ü§°"

When men abandons the kid they are seemed as evil and they should pay child support no matter what.but for a women she could kill the kid too.

I think it‚Äôs good. Women shouldn‚Äôt have the choice. Men haven‚Äôt had a choice when it comes to child support or getting any kind of assistance. I call this equality
"Nobody has the fundamental right to end a human life. Yes it was legal for 50 years but what about the 200 years before that? Women can still get abortions but they may have to drive to a different state. Women still have the right to choose abstinence, birth control, common sense, self control and in the worst situation ( rape or incest) the morning after pill which doesn‚Äôt kill anyone, it prevents conception from taking place. I don‚Äôt understand what is wrong with these women who are crying over a hypothetical baby and their right to murder it at any point in time."
They didn‚Äôt take away a constitutional right to abortion they stated that it was never a constitutional right to abortion in the first place. PERIOD.
"I never realized just how insane some women really can be until you take their ""murder"" away"
"The movie 2001 a space odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion. A space odyssey is a fetus in the womb. The Clint Eastwood dirty Harry movies was angry calm. It seems nasty but it's a good police officer. Angry calm is how a women chooses abortion.

It's intelligently designed that if you try killing God you will always make one error. A movie is in motion so you have to park the errors where it doesn't matter. 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind. That why HAL computer eye is colored red so it still has artistic integrity. 2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made. It only has one error to park. You can't do better than that."

no one has the right to take a life. you know babies have constitutional rights.
Iam a woman to me pregnancy is the most beautiful feeling in the world in all stages of pregnancy. Going through the labour stages i felt the  pain but it wasn't the pain i thought about it was hoping the baby would be ok that is what is on every womans mind who is ready to give birth. Those who abort their beautiful babies will never get to feel that.
A sad day‚Ä¶for baby killers.

"We are focusing on the wrong problem here. Only 14 of 100,000 women of chilbearing age chose to have an abortion, while god sits over in the corner, being completely ignored as he rubs his dirty little hands together thinking about how to take out the next BABY.

In 15% of pregnancies God chooses to kill babies, and that is just the miscarriages. This doesn't account for the countless times he gets it wrong and plants the egg outside of the uterus or tries to strangle the poor thing to death with its own umbilical cord as a last ditch attempt to prevent it from seeing the light of day. Forget all the deadly birthdefects where the poor creature, designed in HIS IMAGE, is born without a brain, kidneys, fully developed lungs. At least these abominations give us a good clue as to the kind of ""higher being"" we are working with here. Add these in and GOD is by far the most prolific ""baby killer"" on the planet! 

Not to mention, the US has the highest rate of murder of women by god just for trying to give birth to a HUMAN in HIS IMAGE out of any developed country in the world. You think with all these laws being passed to hinder the doctors who are actually trying to save the lives of babies and mothers on a daily basis, he would cut us some slack, but it seems like his blood lust continues. 

Just based on these FACTS, if you really want to stop all these murders of babies and pregnant women it would make so much more sense to get to the root cause of these MURDERS. Logically we should ban god from all forms of government, because he obviously could care less about the LIFE of a baby and it's mom. More god is definitely not the answer."

There will never be a constitutional right to end a pregnancy.

So, until someone can show how ending a pregnancy is an unalienable right, then there‚Äôs no reason for the people to think that it‚Äôs a right, and not a privilege.

Ok let's try a different logic and see who really is against abortion.  The age of abortion starts at 15 and goes to 18 then till adults 44.  Let's just take a look at 15.  A child may have an abortion at the age of 15 no parental consent.  They can't drive a car.  They can't smoke a cigarette.  They can't have alcohol.  They can't vote.  They can't join the military but there old enough to decide all by themselves if they want to end a life!   If your a parent I want you to look into the eyes of your child and see if that's a good idea to you.  Since the parent is responsible for the decisions till 18yrs old!  The parents body and choice it really is!  Most of all another lie told by the devil the truth is it's God's body and not your choice!  But I digress how many children have made this decision alone and then had to live with it's consequence for life?

The lie that ""it's just a mass of cells; it's not a baby"" was EXPOSED by seeing our baby's image on the screen!
Some time later, I saw a video showing the remains of an aborted baby.  I learned that after an abortionist cuts & slices up the baby inside the Mommy, they have to reassemble the baby's body parts on a tray to ensure none of the cut-up pieces are left inside the Mom.
Now, WHY do pro-abortion people go into a rage when responding to proposals that women see their baby's image in an ultrasound before going through with aborting their baby?  Why do they oppose transparency and full-disclosure?  Why do they oppose letting women see the truth?
Why do people lie about abortion being a constitutional right when it is never even mentioned in the US Constitution?

"26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; --HOLY BIBLE"
"HOLY BIBLE- 18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 19 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. 20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. 21 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
"HOLY BIBLE--- 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."

"protect civil liberties.amazing grace or more disgrace.....the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness...the right of a woman to take a sacred life even if she chooses only to take male unborn childrens lifes...it is not a civil liberty...it is the worship of bal in child sacrifice for ones own pleasure...freedom of choice begins and ends with the choice to sleep with a male out of marriage...for money or even more foolishly for free."
All the women who want to sin and not be accountable.
"The supreme court overturned a universal fake unconstitutional ""right"" to kill a child that hasn't fully gestated and left it to the states. 8 of which now have banned killing babies at any stage. Isn't it great? It is and you should be happy and not slant your titles to call it anything else than what it is. It's not her body therefore it's not her choice."
"For anyone that's unsure about this issue please think about this: what about the babies that are fertilized in the fallopian tube instead of the womb? That's fatal for baby and mother. Or what if a mother has a miscarriage and it's incomplete and she needs an abortion to remove the rest so she doesn't die from infection? It doesnt matter that its uncomfortable to talk about, a woman should have the right to lifesaving medical treatment and sometimes abortion is that treatment. Imagine being a doctor and knowing this and being told that you're not allowed to save your patient's life because other people decided for her that it's IMMORAL. None of that has ever occurred to most voters yet the lives of women are now in the hands of ignorant people. It could happen to any woman. I hope that the people who decided this for us eventually feel shame for what they did to all those women who died because they forgot abnormal pregnancies happen and there wasnt proper treatment to save them."
Go somewhere else then if you want to kill babies

"Pro-abortionists never actually address the concerns of pro-life activists in their arguments. Saying, ""My body, my choice"" will inevitably fall on deaf ears because pro-life activists fundamentally believe that it's the fetus's body. They are trying so valiantly to shove a square peg into a round hole."

"I guess women would rather have 9 judges in black robes tell them when and if they can have an abortion, and what they can and can't do with their own bodies, instead of putting it back to the states, where they can actually have a say in it! They would rather have the federal government tell them what they can and can't do with their own bodies, and have no say in it whatsoever. Regardless of who it is, the government is going to be telling them what they can and can't do with their bodies. I guess they would rather have no say in it at all."

Channel 4 news is trash. I only watch this video to hear the good news of the end for roe v wade.
"This truly was a great moment for America, it's so rare for good, truth, and common sense to prevail in this day & age .Personally I celebrated & rejoiced in my spirit over Roe vs Wade being overturned.  Abortion for one is not a constitutional right, I'm tired of women claiming 'their body, their choice' that is not a valid argument. Women need to practice responsibility in their personal lives and avoid pregnancy like a responsible adult instead of using abortion as a catch-all & eraser. That's not how life works, if you as an adult choose to be intimate & become pregnant that is now your responsibility. You don't get to slaughter the innocent soul now attached to your body simply for convenience! By liberal logic I as a man should be able to 'abort' my responsibilities as a father should I get a woman pregnant and she carry it to term. By their logic men can say My body my choice, I don't want to be a father to my seed shes on her own. But they only use logic when it's convenient and liberal women especially hold men to ridiculous double standards. Then to claim infant health will also be affected by this decision as if the infants well being has ever been a priority to a pro abortionist is an other example of them using emotional vomit in place of facts, rational arguments, and empirical evidence. If they're so concerned about infants then they should be appalled that almost 70,000,000 innocent human beings were murdered in their mother's womb. A place that was once the safest place in the world for a child.  There is no logical, scientific, or moral argument for abortion. I hope this country stays on the right track"

We should all be against anything bad that happens with any human remains. What was done to us here is wrong.
"This isn't reported as news. First of all, it was NEVER Constitutional. This is an opinion piece."
"The problem with journalism today, they're all activist not a news reporter among them."
"Why don‚Äôt we ever talk about what this procedure does to women?
It‚Äôs incredibly damaging to a woman‚Äôs body, mind and soul.
Idk any women who aren‚Äôt emotionally damaged after having one. 
Addict1on, depression, se1f harm, being unable to have children, instability and on and on.
Do you know who doesn‚Äôt suffer from any of this? 
Men. 
We always debate whether it‚Äôs a baby or a clump or cells, but I don‚Äôt ever hear what is done to educate and help women from the damage this leaves emotionally and spiritually."
"Honestly, reading many of the comments makes me feel like there isn‚Äôt much hope for the future. Why do these anti-abortion people want to criminalize and take away womens right to choose how they live their own lives so badly? It‚Äôs hard to believe that many of the anti-choice activists and supporters have mothers, sisters, dauthers or even more unbelievably, are women themselves. What is the next step? Criminalizing women for every time they DONT get pregnant because tecnically, the egg is an unborn baby?"
""" I'm absolutely terrified, I'm so terrified. Your terrified about not having the ability to kill an innocent child. We have bigger things to be terrified about"
"Why do some people think it's ok to kill an innocent child. Like seriously that's not just a fertilized egg. When the sperm and egg come together, it becomes a human. I don't agree that if you get pregnant in any circumstance, you can just kill that baby because it's your body. That baby has its own body. When the man and woman do it, they know the risk. Yes sometimes a baby gets conceived from a horrible situation (like rape) but that dose not mean the baby will grow up to be bad person. Also you can give the child up for adoption. Everyone deserves a chance at life even if it's an unborn baby."

"I like how they say ""my body my choice"" yet fail to use the required steps to prevent ""accidentally"" creating life while sleeping around.
Its just mind boggling how they think, after being promiscuous and lustful, then getting pregnant, that abortion it's the best solution.
IMO make condoms more accessible than they are, give extensive sexual ed for teenagers *and* adults, and those who think they are better than everybody else and ""screw around"" like a bunch of rabbits, then that's their problem"

Abortion rights are not illegal yet unless your state gov says so."
I‚Äôm so happy it was overturned. Hopefully people understand how wrong abortion is now.
When will people shut up about this stupid law? All it does is shift the law from a federal level to a state level. That's no reason for sjws to start rioting and acting like literal cultists.

Tired of all these man-boys shouting they're not ready to be fathers but want to play house. Vasectomies for all. That would eliminate the need for 90% of the need for abortions. Fact!
"Literally the entire issue baffles me! First why would you get yourself in the position of needing an abortion? Besides the less than 0.5% of rapes, most heathens killing there children are healthy 20 yr olds who act irresponsibly, are self entitled, have blue hair, don't value life, or don't know who the father is because there riding the pony express well past common sense! While I have had my wild years, it was rarely an issue that I got the ho pregnant and didn't know what to do! I knew the gun was loaded so when I fired away, my aim never hit bullseye! Why because I wasn't always ready myself, but would have NEVER wanted the female to torture the BABY to death! After seeing abortion survivors on youtube, I am glad I never felt the need for this procedure to exist!"
"Since males are so intent on ending abortion rights and taking away a woman's right to privacy and control over her own body, I say take all these newborns to their daddies to care for and feed."

Imagine breaking down in tears and going into a fury of rage because you can't kill babies.
love how its a very non american woman doing the voiceover talking about the american government
Let those babies grow. Stop abortion rights. If you lived. Why can't others live as well. It's not there fault you didn't use anything for protection. Girls first open there legs without thinking the consequences then they end up having an abortion. No you open the legs because you wanted that to happen. Now the baby has to grow.
I have had a horrible week and I needed a laugh today . Thank you silly feminist. Tell me you know nothing about us politics because your a foreigner without tell me. Roe VS wade was severely outdated .

What are the liberals so upset about. I have seen most of Bidens appointed people and they cannot even define what a woman is.
"I remember the first time I worked at grade school. This tiny little girl who was missing her two front teeth looked at me and she said, ""Hey misthta, come here. "" I went over to her. She said, ""let me see your finga."" I extended it. She took her little fingernail and gently dug it into my skin a little, and she started laugh and she said, ""say ough ough ough ough."" Like that. That was a precious kid. I said, ""ough ough ough ough,"" and we were hysterically laughing. It was one of the cutest things I've ever seen in my entire life. Later, I covered for the Gym Teacher. We were going to race. I said, ""Okay kids. Don't go until I say GO!"" I said, ""line up!"" They lined up. I said, ""On your mark! Get set! Do you like squirrels?"" They said, ""What?"" I said, ""okay okay this time this time!"" They started laughing. I said, ""On your mark! Get set! Squirrels are so cute aren't they?"" They started laughing. Finally, after several goof offs, I said go. LOL Kids are beautiful. I love kids. You mean SELFISH people! You should be ashamed of yourselves. You've turned into complete MONSTERS! I HATE YOU!"
Awwwww. Have you ever worked in a grade school with children? Aw! I love those kids! Aw! Come on! Aw! They want to go to SCHOOL LA. They want a chance to LIVE UH. Come ON UH. What are you people doing? You should be ashamed of your selfish selves!

In fact, in the latest scientific studies most women, do this many times before a pregnancy takes. Almost zero women get pregnant on the first go. So, this change of law has criminalized being a woman, go America."
"I think they should overturn Abortions, and make it very clear. By over turning to legally allow abortions, the woman will be sterilized after her abortion. You aren‚Äôt ready to have kids now, than you won‚Äôt be later!"
"What we have to get across to abortionists is the baby's body is not the woman's body.
And The Supreme Court simply gave the Choice back to the people where it always belonged, as the left got everybody to believe it was part of the constitution oer the years..., and it never was part of the Constitution."
It‚Äôs still a baby. I don‚Äôt care if you were rapped. Name me one other crime where we punish the perpetrator‚Äôs child and not the perpetrator? What‚Äôs that? There are none?

I genuinely believe abortion is wrong. I don't really see why that's a controversial opinion.
This video is truely abhorrent...Perhaps the pro life supporters should be charged with impersonating human beings and having grandiose delusions that they have the right to decide what a woman does with her body. Personally I think they are the ones who should be sterilized so they can't reproduce and  take away any more of our freedoms which the constitution guarantees us.

"Correction on the title, they didn't overturn a ""right"" because it never was one. Abortion isn't mentioned in the constitution, and it isn't mentioned because our forefathers were God fearing men and they never would've allowed abortion. It being a constitutional right makes no sense. This country was founded on Christian values and still is. If the Scotus did anything they admitted a mistake, that Roe vs. Wade was a decision they (previous Scotus) never should've made, that it should be up to the states to decide what is allowed. Funny thing, these same women wouldn't like the Vatican telling them what's allowed but they're OK with the SCOTUS telling them but yet they scream no one has the right to tell them what they do with their bodies. Hmmm??? Sounds to me like they're OK with the Scotus so long as they do what they say. They seem a little selfish and vigilante to me."

Those raped children are now dead
"We are all so worried about our rights and lives. But who is protecting the liberty and lives of our most precious? Unborn babies that can‚Äôt speak for themselves. Why doesn't the unborn have the right to live?
Children are a gift from God. The Bible says in Psalm 127:3 KJV, ‚ÄúLo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.‚Äù
We kill our unborn. God's most sacred creation! We pluck it out like it‚Äôs cancer. We should be ashamed! Who gave us the right to play God? We don't have that right. It's a sin, so how can it be alright? We have no right to kill. It is one of the Ten Great Commandments that God said that we must obey. The sixth commandment in the Bible says in Exodus 12:13, ‚ÄúThou shalt not kill.‚Äù Why is that so hard to understand?
A mother that has just given birth can be charged with murder if she kills her baby, but a Doctor can do the same while God‚Äôs Child is safe and sound in the womb. They are then called heroes. They are not heroes. What they are is murders. What they do is absolutely a sin in the eyes of our God. How can we expect to have God's grace? I believe God turned away from the United States when Roe versus Wade became law.
God knows all those children. The Bible says in Jeremiah 1:5 KJV, ‚ÄúBefore I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.‚Äù
This means that God has already given that baby a name!
I want to ask all the lawmakers and Judges in our country. Since you‚Äôve failed to protect the next generation, how can we trust you to protect our generation? You have the blood of millions of babies on your hands. It is the worst genocide in history! You will have to answer for your position on abortion when you stand in front of the highest court in existence. God‚Äôs heavenly court. I hope you have a good answer because you can‚Äôt use the ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know‚Äù excuse because you know it‚Äôs wrong.
You have been warned!

My body my choice.. what about my choice to not take the covid shots. Or loose my job. I was told I would loose my 16 year career. If I didn't comply to Joe Biden.
"It is murder- plain and simple. Would you remove the unborn puppies, kittens, etc from the mama? 
Cutting them
Dissecting them 
Poisoning them. 
Drowning them

Almost 8 billion people on earth‚Ä¶
Abortion is definitely murder. Sugar coat it all you want. You Demon-Crats are always up to no good.

These idiots need to realize that they don't have the right to kill a baby baby if they do maybe it should be legal for us to kill the women who kill babies

"I love the ""Future is anti abortion"" sign. When the rest of the first world is looking at us like a bunch of ignorant, white trash morons."
Now all these rich white idiots are gonna go out and expand Medicaid and adopt foster kids...right?
So I'm not from America but I just wanted to know what if a minor gets pregnant because she was rap*d? Or if the mother or the child have fatal condition? Abortion is through and through illegal?
"Lets be civilized, killing another human for your own mistakes is not how our future generation should be taught and be normalized into. Respect all living being and start taking responsibility for our own actions, what if your partner killed you because he doesn't want you anymore, does that sound like the world you wanna be living into ?"

My friend's wife is five and half months pregnant. At least she was until a recent ultrasound revealed the baby's kidneys hadn't formed properly and there was little to no amniotic fluid. The baby did not form lungs and is now a non viable pregnancy. You people would rather force her to mourn this baby twice. Now and again when she delivers a stillborn. Quit pretending this is about Christian beliefs when half the people that support this are the furthest from that.
That woman is an idiot. She never answered one of those questions.
Women are NOT discriminilized men are

Abortion is also legal here.
We may not be as developed as ""THE GREAT AMERICA"" but i actually feel safe here."
Roe v Wade started because a woman who wanted an abortion didn‚Äôt have her life threatened by her pregnancy. Yet most of these pro choice protesters talk about how it saves women‚Äôs lives. You can still get an abortion in pretty much every state if it risks your life.
"Womans rights do NOT include murder! Baby killers screaming because they cant kill babies. Unbelievable, the vile creatures!"
If you crazy leftist want to abort babies because they don't fit in your life don't complain when a man don't pay child support or take care of the kid because it doesn't fit in his plans or he just don't want it don't be hypocrites
The nose on the thumbnail speaks for itself.

Woman‚Äôs right to kill their babies. Sounds insidious
Seeing trans women crying over abortions is crazy ngl.
Hehe
"Hey get it through your head people. Abortion is not a state choice but a individual choice, based on personal circumstances that differ from person to person. If you're not the one to question ""should I keep a pregnancy to term or abort ASAP?"" then it is not your place, nor the state or any law to decide. What America did banning it will just lead to deaths, depression, poverty, trauma and only troubles but I guess that's the goal."
Im democrat and i support the ruling
"Where are all my Pro choice people at for my right to choose?

Legalize safe and convenient Suicides!!!
I should have the right not to live amongst you baby murderers."
"Can someone explain to me like a 5 year old why is abortion good? I mean I can understand medically if the doctor determines the mother could die or if it was a miscarriage or something like that but man other than that i find it to be unnatural, grotesque, cruel and selfish. Plain evil to summarize. None of us should have the right to decide if someone should be born or not‚Ä¶ We are not God. I agree people have the right do whatever they want to their body, but a fetus or baby is not an organ or a part of the body, it‚Äôs a separate living organism, and it has the right to live. If the parents don‚Äôt want him, there are always options more sensible than killing."

Ok so 15 years of illegal abortion and 5 years in prison for raping‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs fucked up.
IF YOU DONT WANT A BABY THEN STOP FUCKING AROUND
So my question is.. if there's a rape victim in a hostage situation we're she's not able to get a plan B or any such pills to prevent the pregnancy to go for longer .. then she finds a way to escape but she's already about 5 months pregnant.. does she have to keep the baby? Will you have to let .. let's say a 13 yr old hold on to her baby aka rapist father .. or is that OK for an abortion.

HOWEVER the right to privacy (which abortion was previously protected under) is not explicitly stated in the constitution either, it is INFERRED and this a right that every American holds near and dear. Just because it is not stated explicitly does not mean it isn't inferred. Bear in mind this Constitution was written in the 1700s."
pro tip if u seem to be getting drunk and fucking ppl go on the pill. if u support abortion then where u ok with ppl in China doing it if it was a girl?
Build More Prisons. Parents will kill more babies after they are born stupid Fu**s. They probably will abuse them for a year or two. An innocent helpless baby will be in DANGER ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
"NO ONE THINK about the BABY‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó IF a person is NOT RESPONSIBLE enough to take a birth control pill how in the FU** will they be able to take care of a baby. There is SO MUCH CHILD ABUSERS, CHILD PORN. I don't care about the women I Care about the Misery, abuse, and murder AFTER the BABY IS BORN dumb Mother Fuc----s."
There should be a nation wide memorial for all the babies that have killed.
It is never a right to kill a baby. There is severe mental illness involved in the killing of babies. Straight up insanity in every sense of the word.
Ah yes then people ask why does a child have to keep someone's baby if she was forced and r###
Everyone is crying but hey guess what you can still go murder your babies in other states congrats. I for one cannot wait for it to be illegal in all 50 states.

Sucks when the shoe is on the other foot, doesn‚Äôt it?"
üò≠
it‚Äôs correct that there never a ‚Äúright to abortion‚Äù or a constitutional right to abortion so literally we only made abortion a right because we felt like it. And then there is just pure ignorance. The overturning of roe v wade only now gave the states the power to set terms of abortion and didn‚Äôt completely outlaw abortion I mean people should take a history lesson all this commotion is totally unnecessary if we all knew what roe v wade was and what it did.
"The ruling that abortion is legal was based on a right to privacy. This was a misapplication of the right to privacy. Your right to privacy does not include the right to plan murder. Laws are not based on the opinion of the people in the country. They are based on the exact wording of each law. If every person in the country decided that taxes are bad, they would still have to pay taxes until and unless Congress repealed the tax law s
    All the court did was say abortion is subject to legislative revue. Each state can allow or ban abortions, or Congress can enact laws either for or against abortion.
      The real question is: Why are the current justices right? How did all the other Supreme Court justices get it wrong? Is the current SCOTUS correct, or just religiously biased?"
I like how people think the majority opinion matters. This isn't a democracy it's a republic. Babies have rights too and it doesn't matter what the majority thinks
"Amy is such a pick me. ""I'm one of the boys... ü§§"""
"American is filled with cancellable-cucks. Don't matter how much money you have,  not the life for me thank you"
We need abortion. Or there is going to be so many single black moms. And all those black babies are going to cost the tax payers so much money. Democrats and the left are correct we need population control.
How is this any different than medical marijuana patients who live in states that criminalize marijuana use and possession? They usually have to move to California to get the access to the  medicine they need to live?

"I think when a minor gets raped they should implement law with death penalty for rapists. Other methods should be castration, or injection for infertility for the rapists. If the woman is adult she should decide what to do with the rapist s life  since her free will was taken by force from her I think he should no longer have free will. If she decides she wants to marry him, he should comply with her demands and be forced to work and be a provider for her and the baby."
"It‚Äôs not in the constitution that you have the right to kill your unborn babies. These are some sick feminist who want to be like men.

"HOLY BIBLE- 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."
"26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; --HOLY BIBLE"

"Logically, lets look at several things that influence how the law makers decide things. The goal for the creation of Row V Wade decision was to initiate a slow down in the population of the US.

"As always the truth is painful and somewhere in the middle. I am old enough to remember deaths from back yard abortions. I am also old enough to be disgusted with how many women use abortion numerous times as a form of contraception.
As always abuse of any system in place which intentionally was there with good intentions leads to the chaos and hysteria we are now witnessing.
Is it a good idea to bring unwanted, unloved children in the world? No
Is it right to tear apart a baby limb from limb after the first 12 weeks? No
If people were rational, reasonable, and had some order in their lives these options would not be an issue.
I feel sadness for the unwanted, unloved children born to ferals. 
And I feel sadness for the babies torn to pieces.

"I wanna know how many of you out there crying over a persons right to an abortion have taken the time to help out or adopt at least one of the 34 million children in foster care to date since this ruling? None of you I'll bet because that's not something you can protest and whine about and it would actually help out a child or teenager in the foster system so you won't do that, it's not your problem. Why should you help a child if you can't whine about it? The government winds up paying foster parents every month for a child none of you want so don't call this a success for you or the children, the foster parents are being paid to take unwanted children in for you so you haven't accomplished anything by raising protest signs and marching down streets. The children that my wife defends as a CASA volunteer are still left in foster care since none of you have done anything to help their becoming part of a real family and someones child. A 10 year old child impregnated by her father has no way of supporting a child, legally too young to work and provide for that child but that's okay for you I guess? After all it's not your problem it's someone elses problem but you've won? Not hardly."

But the difference is that people at school can call for help, hide, fight back, or run away. At least you have a chance. A baby can't do that. Is it enough to simply see a baby in the womb as not a human being to legalize murder of him? I can imagine that these people are also against the death penalty in people who are guilty, but in a child who has done nothing they find it is women's rights."
Am I missing something.. all the supreme Court did was say its up to each state to decide.. sort it out yourselves..

"About 39 years ago I was close to 13 weeks pregnant and had an abortion. Near the end of the abortion the nurse said 'Oh My God' and stared for about a minute then left the room. The doctor continued staring for about a minute or two longer. I saw they were in shock and knew they watched my baby die. My legs were draped so I could not see. Please read below of the extremely fast speed of fetal development. 
Heart pumping blood day 21, brain waves day 40. see ""Baby Center- Fetal Development Week By Week""
 which states on WEEK 11 the baby can FEEL if the belly is gently poked on mom, is KICKING and STRETCHING, almost fully developed. Look at the pictures - the fetus looks like a developed baby. I was told at the appointment the fetus was just tissue - the same lie told today despite the advanced technology showing the truth. Many women do not discover they are pregnant until 6 weeks have already passed. - heartbeat and brain waves are present. The babys have bodies and rights also. Murder is not a right.

It‚Äôs not moral to  get  pregnant out of plan, abort the baby and then claimed it as your moral right. , it should be women get protected  and policy in guiding them to become   Morally future mothers."
"50 years of abortion and killing of innocent babies. How many babies killed per day? Per week? Or the entire time. If those babies  were given chance to live, American could have millions of  genius people.  It‚Äôs not issue to help this kids, as Americans help other country problems. Yes, abortion can be avoided if women inform how to avoid unwanted pregnancies, and men will understand on this aspect. You cannot make law  or policy  which means of killing, as human being we value each life no matter how ugly and poor that human life is."
A win for LIFE!
"LIFE BEGINS THE MOMENT IT IS CONCEIVED, LIFE BEGINS TO FORM ITSELF INTO A CHILD ... GOD IS AGAINST MURDER , NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO KILL ANOTHER... NOT EVEN IN WAR ...."
This once fetus is very happy for my fellow unborn fetuses!!!   Yay!!!!

"You women couldn't tell Biden is the ""pied Piper""?  Leading the masses with his plastic appearance, deceptively dragging you to an Abby's.  You had a chance to be saved by the outsider Donald Trump, but you were tricked by the flute of the trap in a suit.  Trump may be raucous, vile, and insulting but he has your rights in mind.  He believes in human rights, he sanctifies them.  Read between his lines, he's standing up for the little person.  Biden has not lived up to any of his promises, he just grins. Stop supporting Muslim arab women rights, and gay rights, and stand behind your body's rights.  Biden is the corporate trickster whose only job is to simulate you into a factory product to produce future soldiers to fight abroad.   Why do you think they want so many babies born.  Trump doesn't want to fight eats, he wants to increase the economy and get America out of foreign situations of war and occupation.  Remember he withdrew

Trump the outsider is the real genuine person. Biden the smiling puppet was the trap to suck ugly into losing your rights.  Biden is perfect, smiling clean looking, - Never Judge A Book By It's cover

Arab Muslim women in college are probably the culprit Benning this anti abortion movement to steal your body from underneath you.  Remember Arab islanics hate human rights, so stop standing by them.  duh. Stand up for Asian Americans instead."
"Very simple, a baby is a human being whether in the womb or out the womb. 'abortion' is a code word for baby murder and its disgusting. Most women actually have severe mental health disorders from killing their baby because of the dreadful decision they have made."

Praise god
women's rights is not getting stripped away by this decision.  Please look at the real enemy - transgender competing in women's sport - that scares me!  The lack of common sense in this country scares me.
Great video. We really have returned to medieval England...
Some of these shouldn‚Äôt worry about abortions ü§£ no sane person would sleep with them
I feel sorry for your country and your all just twisting and moulding your amendments to fit the monthly narratives  your country is a mess
This report is such a joke. The Supreme Court is not there to ‚Äúprotect civil liberties‚Äù. It‚Äôs purpose is to ensure laws passed are constitutional. More propaganda.
Oh yea lets protest bc we have lust
Making abortions illegal doesn't stop abortions...it just makes them unsafe. Women's rights over their bodies should never be questioned. This is terrifying
That‚Äôs what y‚Äôall get! Lol it turned on all y‚Äôall low key racists women and supposedly non racist women all y‚Äôall who voted for him y‚Äôall thought he had y‚Äôall back??? NOPE!! üòÇ I don‚Äôt feel bad and I won‚Äôt be standing with y‚Äôall on this‚Ä¶
Is it just me or is the pro life representitive jusr pouring water there. I just can' t understand her argumentation. It' s empty drivle. She can't  even deffend her opinion in an argument then how can she stand behinde it?
If you go into a Pharmacy and ask for a Plan B pill guess what you can buy one for around 20$ and the best part of this is you don‚Äôt need a fuckin prescription!!!!!!!!!whooooo
Ex leftist from Texas here. No applause please. You'll embarrass me. Pro abortion women are skanks with that not-so-fresh-feeling and the men are womanizers. I'm sorry. I mean birthing people izer nizers. Good times. Blackmailed Biden to the shuffle board. Away!!!!
I guess the ‚Äúfestering‚Äù part isn‚Äôt referring to democrats
Just remember that we warned all those people who either didn't vote or voted for the rebublic that it would destroy the USA. You understand that this was Donald Trump. You chose Donald Trump... Blame all those morons who voted for Trump and helped this happen.
"This news sucks! Yea, all ya‚Äôll are ‚Äúpro life‚Äù until u have an unplanned pregnancy! Dont get all happy when u know you‚Äôd be terrified if u HAD to have a baby u cannot take care of!"
God forbid those who wanted it to be illegal go trough a situation where they got themselves into and can‚Äôt get out.  so many situations that can happen and unfortunately the help won‚Äôt be there. Shame
"Let me get this straight. So the media calls people activists when it‚Äôs convenient and fits the narrative right? And the Supreme Court just gave the states back their individual lawmaking capability correct? So people in California are protesting and throwing temper tantrum‚Äòs because other states don‚Äôt want to do what Nazifornia wants to do? And they are upset because they feel their personal freedom is being taken away , which it‚Äôs not in California, so they think it‚Äôs OK to take away my personal freedom to drive on the expressway without being impeded? Or are liberals so driven by their emotions they can‚Äôt understand logic? Or are they so open minded their brains are falling out of their heads so they can‚Äôt process facts and laws? For anyone proabortion/murder, have you considered how fortunate you are that your mom had different beliefs than you? Otherwise, you wouldn't be here to harass others (who might actually have similar beliefs as you) and throw temper tantrums and complain. Mother Teresa said, ""I will never attend an anti-war rally. If you have a peace rally, invite me."" She understood the difference in what is in the hearts of protestors. Pure anger and evil. Bye Felicia"

Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh
"I‚Äôm sorry, but to have abortions when most countries aren‚Äôt having enough babies to replace their own populations seems insane. It‚Äôs not a human right to kill babies - that‚Äôs insane."

This dude is confusing rights with privileges
"Anyone ever read the publicly available Roe v Wade ruling? 
Left leaning people seem to think that they're not allowed to have an abortion any more... fucking idiots"
"In 2020, over 6,100,000 babies were born in the US.  Of the millions of women who gave birth successfully, about 861 died in childbirth.  So the For the Mothers Health stat is verrrry low.  Source: CDC"
"People who are happy about other people being forced to birth a child they don‚Äôt want, could kill them, and will ruin their body/lives are evil. They like to hide behind their religion, they just want to control women like cattle. I will not breed for you! If you want kids have them! Don‚Äôt force others to!"
It is disheartening to see how people are vocal about having a right to kill a human being who is unborn. Their rights demand tearing off a living heart by ruthlessness of forceps in a place where it should have been its safest place. Those sissy tears of pro-murderers should meet the real tragedies of life that brings those genuine droplets.
are the new born children not Americans with rights?
"The women are pissed? Firstly, you are murderers and not women. Understand that."
"unfortunately the new ‚ÄúRepublican supreme court‚Äù are doing their damnedest to, destroy this country ! 
If thinking about how many shootings and mass killings of innocent people we have had bothers you. Then just wait! 
From the date of the supreme courts irresponsible ruling, Of Roe v. Wade. 
in as little as 8 to 10 years, youth gun violence , will have increased 10 fold !    No one will be safe ! I dread to think about the impact this irresponsible decision. will have on society ! Especially in a country that lacks necessary and even the most basic, and common sense laws, when it comes to Gun control !!! 
guns are too easy to obtain! anyone can get one! 
Yet a womens autonomy is no longer her own! the right to choose what‚Äôs best for one‚Äôs own self. will now be decided by the state in which she resides!?!? WTF???
Bringing another life into this world. Is now chosen by state laws, that vary state to state! 
   Due to the huge number of unwanted pregnancies that so many women with be forced to birth! 
  Its going to be huge!
And the majority of these children will be born into poverty.  
  Take into account the statistics and The number of children that are currently neglected and suffer some kind of abuse , in America?!
 Then Try to imagine the huge increase in that number, and imagine how many children will be neglected , and or abused! be it mentally physically or sexually! one year from now! 
  The increase in the number of children effected, will start to become noticeable , literally ONE year from NOW!!!!
 It makes me sick and incredibly sad that The Crime rate and mortality rate will continue to increase in America ,due to the lack of gun control laws!
 In addition to that , we will start to see the crime rate and mortality rate  increase greatly in less then 6 months time, among American women.  Due to STRESS , PANIC HOPELESSNESS and pure DESPERATION ! 
  Everything has a ‚ÄúCAUSE & EFFECT‚Äù
 These are just some of the devastating ‚ÄúEFFECTS‚Äù that are to come. 
All ‚ÄúCAUSED‚Äù by the supreme court‚Äôs decision, to taking away a women‚Äôs lawful right to choose what‚Äôs best for herself!"
if they want to kill a child they should also be charged with murder üòí
"if yes to abortion ,no to child support that will be equal rights . If she has a child without the man‚Äôs agreement no child support and that‚Äôs the equal rights"
watching ugly women cry about not being able to kill babies is def a new low
Wow americans seriously need to change their Constitution... Or else anything that wasn't in the sphere of public life in 1776 gets to be seen as anticonstitutional haha losers. Vote Trump again see what happens this time
"I‚Äôm not strong either way but the reaction on the left leads me to celebrate this ruling with extreme vigor.  Cry more left wing nut jobs, it motivates me even more to vote Red and encourage those around to do likewise üòÇ"

"Both sides, a sea of fools."
"I cant lie, I love to see these feminist crying. Also this news channel is trash."
"Contrary to popular opinion the vast majority of women who get abortions dont do so because of rape, incest or the possibility of passing on a deadly disease to the child.

Here are some Examples of the main reasons women get abortions.

1. I Had a Abortion because the baby father don't want me no more. 

2. I had a Abortion because the baby father is not financially stable.

3. I had a Abortion because I found out the baby father has other kids and I wanted to be the first babymama. 

4. I had a Abortion because he is married with a whole other üë™

5. I had a Abortion because I got too many kids already. 

6. I had a Abortion because my parents say they not gonna help me raise my child.

7. I had a Abortion because the baby father hurt me so in turn I killed his baby. 

8. I had a Abortion because I dont know who the baby father is. 

9. I had a Abortion because I don't want to be tied down with a child.

10. I had a Abortion a few times already and I'm not keeping no child if the father not gonna help take care of it.

These women constantly screaming my body, my choice but judging from these examples they not not making very good choices so its due time someone take the responsibility of having some checks and balances on this irresponsible and reckless behavior."
Where is this so-called right in the Constitution???
"If I can't kill them , I just won't have them."
"Make sure if you get arrested to take it to trial. Only 7% of criminal cases go to trial. If everyone goes to trial, it screws the system. That should prevent these people from getting too crazy with arrests. Important- Do not waive your rights to a 90 day speedy trial!

Along with that, make sure to record everything and livestream when possible. If you don't want to be recorded, wear a mask. 

Also green laser pointers that spread out are only 10 bucks free shipping when they use tear gas and rubber bullets like they did in Los Angeles and Arizona."
"So now our foster care and orphanages are gonna be crowded, with more families in poverty, more single mothers in need, and many deaths from at-home abortions. Nice going Supreme Court, who's going to support all these new lives, the states? Not to mention if a woman has an ectopic pregnancy, do we just leave the woman to die because her only option is abortion to live. Rape victims... need I say more. No one gets to control other people's bodies and you definitely do not have the right to force a woman to go through with a pregnancy she is not ready for or wants. The right to privacy extends to personal items, well my body is my most personal item and the government has no right to infringe on it."
"FYI for all these room temperature IQ‚Äôd, liberals making fools of themselves (per usual)-
As long as you continue to reside in your high crime, high homeless, democrat managed crappers abortion isn‚Äôt going anywhere.  But, ya might want rethink any possible moves to the greener pastures of Arizona, Florida, & Texas‚Ä¶Or, anywhere else for that matter."
"Who would have thought America in some states would go backwards 50yrs & take away civil rights from a women to have the choice about her own body & life.
Without medical intervention a premature baby wouldn‚Äôt usually survive, without medical intervention a woman who can‚Äôt get pregnant wouldn‚Äôt become a mother, without medical intervention after a miscarriage a woman might die from poisoning, it‚Äôs ludicrous in this day & age to deny medical help for terminating a unwanted pregnancy.
Most unplanned pregnancies the woman has the baby, termination is a difficult decision but it needs to be a women‚Äôs right.
Best thing to do is get a termination within a state where it‚Äôs legal & in those states that it‚Äôs not legal a ongoing ‚Äògo fund me‚Äô could be set up for disadvantaged woman to pay for fares & accomodation.
Don‚Äôt let the rats that use religion to take a woman‚Äôs rights away, some priests have been known to impregnate nuns, the church gives her the choice to either have the baby or they organise the abortion & the nun can continue with her vocation."
These protests never solve anything
"Don't like Abortion?
Then don't kill your baby."
"I think it's up to the baby to decide if it wants to be aborted. At least wait for baby to grow up, then ask if he or she wanted to be killed."
look at all the skank *ss bitches complaining that they cannot murder an infant. That‚Äôs pretty sick.
"Look at history, Satan has been throwing ideas into the minds of powerful people for children to be killed since years before Christ and after. Children were sacrificed to idols, and it seems that to this day he throws this devilish idea into the minds of many people."

"The bootlickers suprised the boot is now firmly on their throats. They were acting as cheerleaders during covid for mandatory/coerced vax, now they're suprised they are the ones being treated like livestock. Funny and sad in equal measure."

that 1k-6k ratio give me a lil bit of joy
Abortion is NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT!
Half of these women identify as men loll
Men can have abortions
This also takes away medical privacy
"I get sad when I see women happy about this, and sick when I see the men. You don't get to say what happens with my body. A separation of state and church, that is what our country is built on."
"Roe vs. Wade, God please don't lead the way"
"Jesus Christ, not even trying to hide your bias here Channel 4."
"The reporter says ""The tribunal took away the constitutional right to abortion""
It was overturned bc it's NOT on the constitution. How are these ppl supposed to be journalists? Don't they feel disgusted w themselvs lying like that?"
Well pro Choice can sit in jail and prison if they want to abort a baby
I'm so happy that these sluts are angry yay
YAY I'm so happy
60% of abortions are white women
Remember when the vax was not ur body and choice
"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13)
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. (Proverbs 28:13)
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. (Psalms 51:1-4)"
Remember when you satanists said Trump was dumb? Hang tight üòÅ
The notion that abortion is a constitutional right is patently absurd. Being born is a constitutional right because the constitution clearly states everyone has the right to pursue liberty and happiness. Being aborted pretty much exempts that now doesn't it?
"Where were all these women when governments were making covid vaccines mandatory and they just went along with it?, my body my choice üòê??"
NEW JERSEY IS PRO CHOICE SUPPORTING ABORTION SINCE THE  1940S! COME TO NJ ALL THOSE WHO NEED REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM
I hope all the ANTI CHOICE WOMEN GET UNPLANNED PREGNANCIES AND THE PRO LIFE MEN HAVE UNPLANNED PREGNANCIES. Let's see what choice they make behind closed doors
"Love how they make it female vs male, when there is towns of women who support abortion. Also funny how quickly they remembered what a woman actually is, haha."
I love watching ugly feminists have a meltdown.  And baby killers too.
That‚Äôll put a halt to their gallop üëåüèº

Sore losers!
Less murdered kids. A good thing. 100% of the time. Disagree? Move to an island of supervillains.
"YEAH! Take that, women who get raped!
Now you must keep that baby, how dare you want to have an abortion!!!"
Now they'll have less rights than before- serves ya right
"""Conservatives want live babies so they can train them to be dead soldiers"" - George Carlin about ""pro-life"" conservatives"
"If you step back for a moment and look at this, it seems pretty gruesome... people crying and angry because they can no longer KILL a baby in any state they choose.  Of course there are states which welcome you to go and KILL your baby in their state.  I read that many large corporations will pay your travel expenses to a KILL state for an abortion.  Unless a person was raped or something horrific like that, if we choose to not be responsible in the use of contraceptives and consent to being with a partner which turns into pregnancy, then buck up and be responsible on what your next step will be.  Stop blaming the supreme court for their decision.  They made a responsible decision.  Your turn to make a responsible decision in your life.  I am a proponent of choice.  It's my body and I will do whatever I want to my body, including getting a Covid shot or not.  Do not separate these things, it's all about my body my choice.  However, in my opinion people protesting, etc., is stupid.  You can still KILL a baby in your womb if you made a dumb mistake, just go to the states who will facilitate this for you."
4:25 why ask a bald guy about abortion. Why are men involved in abortion issues? None or you morons get it both the left and right are just idiots

I hope this will happens in all Latin America I mean the end of ab0rti0n
Once you know you‚Äôre pregnant it‚Äôs already a human being a month old f≈ìtus is human being Im sorry to say that getting rid of him no matter how you put it it‚Äôs murder  they‚Äôre actually fighting to have the right to murder or keep their babies  this is sickening.  There are always mitigating circumstances  like if a doctor can establish that the mothers life is at stake  but even in that case  of the baby has a chance to live some women would rather die and give the baby a chance to live .  When I was a kid I learned woman was synonymous to love and tenderness  these senseless reactions just break my heart
We are dancing on the grave of roe v Wade what a chad
1:06 to 1:27 no one cares there should be no right to kill a baby u it so dumb and God say it murder to kill and look what u are doing what the heck. this is a great day for the US no more abortion
Hoes mad

"As a previously unborn fetus, it is hard to be outraged"
Hiring someone to kill your children should be very illegal because it‚Äôs illegal for anyone else..Your child isn‚Äôt a choice at all.. You had a right to create the child and you did it..Do you want to legalize killing a human being because of the inconvenience of your actions. If so will we next target the disabled?
They should only make abortion legal for trans-women üòÇ
"For all those baby killhas out there, just keep ya'll legs closed! Problem solved."
Yay it‚Äôs illegal too kill Undeveloped humans
The choice to kill babies is devil
Lol
There never was a Constitutional Right to begin with. Thankfully the adults are now in charge of the court.
"The court has over ruled  opinion 75% of the American public . Abortion is a fundamental right  for women. There‚Äôs gonna be a huge network of  people who will  take women to  pro choice States.  We will fight and  we will  object to  this ruling.   This woman is spewing BS, with no care for the  health and welfare of women.  Women will die  without abortion care, they will die for what most religions don‚Äôt consider a life worthy of funeral services. 
This horrible woman thinks he values, feelings and religious thought need  out rule legally those of all other women."
"Such misinformed individuals to the point were they are being manipulated into thinking and acting in this way. Abortion kills a million babies a year which is insane to me. Before all of you liberals come at me, most abortions occur because of the woman‚Äôs choice and not for a valid reason like assault or the woman‚Äôs life being in danger"
"Dude I'm pro-life and choice. Pro life with myself and partner and pro choice for everyone else. I'm religious but at the same time how am I suppose to parent everyone else from committing sin, it's impossible."
Has anyone else noticed that most if not all of the crazy woke freakouts over Roe v Wade are middle aged white liberal men and middle aged white liberal women? From the video footage neither demographic seem capable of scoring a date much less get pregnant.

"Channel 4 News = propaganda machine pretending to ""news""."
Cultural Brainwashing .
64 million babies dead since 1973 the killing babies business has slowed a bit.
Abortions were never a constitutional right to the Idiot woman speaking in this news segment.
Liberals now migrate to Sodom and gamora states leaving free states to prosper amen!!!
Channel 4s comment section passed the vibe check.  America still has the most liberal abortion laws compared to ALL of Europe.  NY and CA you can abort up to birth.  It‚Äôs not right.
For anyone who doesn't know they where trying to push abortion up to the third trimester.. basically before the babies are born... i don't care about a blob of cells but that is fucked up!!
"""The Supreme Court whose very purpose is to protect civil liberties"" That's categorically false. It's also false that the Court follows public opinion. The SCOTUS's job is to interpret and apply the law to cases before it, which it just did. SMH. Channel 4 is a joke. ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"0:32 This ""news organization"" just told a blatant lie to all viewers. Abortion was never a constitutional right. Leave it to the British to not know a damn thing about our country!"

Anyone see where blantifa assaulted that pastor on the streets in la and got away with it?
"hahaha. i don't care one way or another about this issue. it's a female thing and women have always treated me like slime.
Still, it's nice to see feminists and their simps running around like a bunch of rabid psychopaths. great entertainment"
"All the women standing up for womens rights were not aborted women. We don‚Äôt give half the population the ability to kill the next generation. 
Thank your Mom for not believing in abortion. You wouldn‚Äôt be here if she agreed with you."
"Dear God, how many abortions are these women getting? Do their vaginas even still function at this point?"
What an asshole president!!!!
These women aren't technically women though.. they are angry entitled shits.
Biased channel 4 news
"as a woman, ‚Äúmurdering an unborn child‚Äù is absurd. its not a child, and its not murder if its smaller than a heart and doesn‚Äôt even have a heartbeat yet. what if someone with a uterus is raped? without the right to abortion, she would be stuck with her rapist‚Äôs child. but just because abortion can be made illegal now, doesn‚Äôt mean that people will stop having abortions. they would just stop having safe abortions. i have another question. if a 16 year old is raped and can‚Äôt financially support the child, if they want to keep it, what are they going to do? they know they will not be able to fend for their child without any support or money. would the pro-lifers be there for the mother when the child is born?"
If woman have the right of abortion then men should have the right to do a financial abortion.
"Men are necessary!! 
The world we all live in is build and maintained by men."
I read the constitution and I can‚Äôt find anything on the right to have a abortion. So you might want to print a correction as the report is wrong. If you‚Äôre a reporter facts should take first place or in my mind.
"No one has freedom to kill, either it is a life or it is not, determine that line, and only then seek a legislation."
Sheeesh 99 years in prison?
I love how the entire narrative is built around the idea that women are destined to have tons of abortions due to letting tons of strangers bust inside them
"I'm a Brit and apparently I know more about the constitution than Americans.
The constitution says Americans have the right to ""Privacy"" not Abortion. Ffs take responsibility."
"There are two rules created in error by our government in its early days that have been a disaster. 1. The fillibuster, a clerical error in the Senate. 2. Power of judicial review by SCOTUS which was the result of an error in the Judicial act of 1789 that allowed Marshal to use the Marbury vs Madison case as an excuse to appropriate the power he wasn't given in the constitution."

Roe v wade was never a constitutional right. It was a majority opinion of 7 justices on the supreme court. Only the legislative branch can make laws. The constitution does not give the right to abort.

"Do fetuses have the right to life?

The argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong.
I will simply assume, instead of proving, that your murder is seriously wrong.
I will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder.
Finally, I will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issues to which this analysis of abortion ethics may lead.
The symmetries arising from the analysis of the main arguments on both sides of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult.
Consider the following standard argument against abortion: Fetuses are both human and alive. People have the right to life.
Therefore, fetuses have the right to life. Of course, women have the right to control their own body, but the right to life goes beyond a woman's right to control her own body.
Therefore, abortion is wrong.
The fetus' right to life does not include his right to use someone else's body to preserve his life.
However, an opponent of abortion may point out that a woman's right to use her body does not include her right to end someone else's life in order to do what she wants with her body.
In response, one might argue that a pregnant woman's right to control her body is not much, if it is wrong, to take any action that ends the life of the fetus within her.
However, an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus' right to life does not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses.
The consequence of all these symmetries seems to be a stalemate.
But if we have an attitude, then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of rights, a fetal right to life versus a woman's right to control her body.
One could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control one's own body in the case of abortion, because the loss of one's life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control one's own body, a respect for nine months.
Therefore, the right to life prevails over the right to control one's own body and abortion is wrong."
The right to privacy only extended to pregnant women. It was never a right .It was a ruling.

"THEIR ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICA ALREADY, IT GONNA BE WORST"
"I remember when the pro-abortion side was so virulently opposed that they wouldn't even allow a PAMPHLET to be given to woman that explained abortion, and also gave her other options prior to a procedure. That was absolutely ridiculous so I don't feel bad for their side right now. They refused to meet pro-life people anywhere in the middle and even advocated for partial birth abortions."
"Honestly just have your partner wear protection or have a hysterectomy or vasectomy. It's not that difficult. I do think exceptions need to be made for rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger, or the baby has major quality of life issues due to medical reasons NOT financial issues."

"When Roe v Wade was passed in 1973, women had their husband to support them and the children that they created in their marriage, so what‚Äôs wrong with that model?
The children will have their biological father and mother as well as their biological grandparents for a lifetime. And the cycle repeats for the next generation and because husbands supported their families, less people should not be a burden to society in the form of welfare.
Furthermore, marriage is good for every economic class of women, especially, for poor women."

"In the guise of ‚Äúequality,‚Äù evil cannot and must not have equality with good.

"This British woman reporting is so ignorant it's frustrating. The Supreme Court didn't overturn the right to abortion, they simply said ""Abortion should have remained a state decision, this should have never been involved with the US constitution""."
Killing babies is wrong and immoral
"Satan's minions really make themselves evident when you make it harder for them to kill the unborn. I'm appalled at the ladies who should be old enough to know exactly who Margaret Sanger was. I mean, even if you're pro choice, after researching that woman you'd think more people would be at least thinking ""ummm, maybe we need to revisit this whole planned parenthood thing"". It's kinda the same as the ""gender fluid"" stuff, where the pioneers were sick men like Alfred Kinsey and John Money. If you read about those men and still think this ""gender fluid"" ideology is good, there's definitely something wrong with you. It's unfortunate how many people are so easily brainwashed by evil people and terrible ideologies."
"Those who advocate for abortion should stand by their convictions, step up and abort themselves. Problem solved."
Damn imagine being one of these anti choice women and being brainwashed by the Patriarchy. üòµ‚Äçüí´ dumb motherfuckers
Abortion is a huge sin killing babies  is something they proudly encourage and support if they're saying it's their bodies they can't do what they want then those doctors who are mostly men have the freewill go not perform these abortions too matter of fact any person with morals will not condone this

"üí•üî•üî•Last Wed (6/22/22), I was touched by God to pray for overturning Roe v Wade or abortion by US Supreme Court and two or three weeks before with Ps Ruben and our church during prayer meeting.  Praise God for the victory ! üëç‚òùü§¥‚úå  That is why the more you come against God for being wild, the more you would lose.  Do not wrestle with the most high God! The two young women protesters at Lakewood church should have never despised God's churches, His Bible, and His Prophetic Voice and Word.  If I were Joel, I would rebuke them harshly to stop them.  God has sovereignty and power above all.   It is no joke. I am a major prophet of God. I saw the harsh judgment of God towards the rebellious and prideful people after the grace period.  Abortion is an abomination to God (Romans 1); it is murdering.  It means you both brought God's wrath on yourselves.  Very dangerous situation!  STOP!  You women are foolish.  God created them; their bodies belong to Jesus, not them.   I am here to warn and protect you abortionists and protestors from going to Lakewood church to protest again but the Lake of Fire!  Got it.  That is Love of God to tell you all truth.  When you do not know something and the negative consequences of it,  keep quiet and be humbly pray.  That is my advice.  üôèCall on Jesus, our Final Judge!  He ‚ù§may forgive you."
"It‚Äôs a sad reflection on humanity to see such a pathetic rabble get so upset about the killing of unborn children.

"""pro lifers"" are worse than the Taliban. They hate real freedom and women. Pure evil"
The reporter is an evil clown liar. She is a demon.
It's not a constitutional right to kill a human. All these angry people are alive killers. It's not a woman's right to kill mass murder.
"Are Americans... dumb? If we completely ignore the discrimination against women's rights and only focus on the child's aspect, this is still a catastrophe. Many of these children will be the result of incest or rape, or even rape against a minor. Who do you think is going to love these children? Most of them will end up in foster care, and we all know what that's like in the US. Plenty of physical abuse, sexual abuse and so on (not everywhere of course, but it's overwhelmingly common). The mothers who decide to keep and love them will probably struggle with trauma and have a hard time taking care of their children. People who have grown up with parents struggling with mental health know it can have huge consequences on their own mental wellbeing. 

Then we have the children who are the results of a faulty condom or two young people not being informed about protection. They might grow up with parents who love them above all. In most cases though, the father won't be present considering most women opting for abortion are single. In addition, it's very likely that the mother won't be able to provide for her child since she didn't even have the money to travel to another state for an abortion. In other words, the child will have a pretty rough childhood. 

But hey, as long as the child survives birth, it doesn't really matter if they suffer the rest of their lives. Right? 

I hope all of you who are pro-life are ready to open your wallets, hearts and homes for all the children you have forced into the world."

Free school lunches example small example. Now is the time that we stand up and show what it means to really be pro life.

"MANDATED COST OF PRO-LIFE LEGISLATION

Any state that rules against women's rights to abortion services MUST provide free maternity healthcare for all it's resident pregnant women in all hospitals (private or public of their choosing) in the state, plus five years of mandated support services for the child and mother (for daycare, food, health and pediatric care) for the child/children born in the state. 

As the government and the law are being used to deny women these rights, so MUST the government and the law be used to create MANDATORY oversight to ensure the women are not discriminated against in any hospital based on their minority status. In addition, there must be comprehensive scrutiny laws enacted in the state to guard any discrimination and hate crime in general.

The decision to deny women the rights of their bodily autonomy must be paid for by the states that deny those rights.

There was never a Constitutional right to abortion
Yikes! He literally said many women had enjoyed killing their babies.... Satan actually does enjoy it and the sacrifice of children is at the heart if Satanism abd always has been...google it!

GOOD.  You should be.  Now you know how we‚Äôve felt for years living under your vile left-wing hellscape.  We are coming for your vomitous non-traditional ‚Äúmarriages‚Äù next.  So be afraid.  Be scared.  I don‚Äôt care.  You didn‚Äôt seem to care at all when it was us on the receiving end of your politicised aggression.   You evil sons of devils are finished.  You won‚Äôt even be a footnote in our history."

"As a woman, no one can deprive me of the right to abortion.. The United States is so bad. I feel honored to be a Chinese. You may not know that the US government slanders China every day and uses the Chinese people to slander China. The ultimate victims are the American people. Yes, they have been brainwashed. Come out and see the world. Marry a loyal, conservative and responsible Chinese man. There are many such men in China. The best husband to his wife in the world is a Chinese man. He buys a house, a car and takes care of his children
...... Mature women only need an honest, reliable and loyal husband, which can only be understood after experiencing pain
Girls, come to China, you will live like a princess"
Now ban riots and protest make that the death penalty

"Oh.

A bunch of women scream and cry because they didn't get their way 100% anymore.

Color me surprised."
"It is okay if women are denied abortion. They can now give a nice gift to their government. They can drink, smoke and do drugs during their unwanted pregnancies and abandon their defective babies to be the responsibility of the state which banned them from having an abortion. The state may ban abortion, but women can still drink and smoke like they are not pregnant and gift the state a baby which is addicted to alcohol, nicotine and drugs."
These women sure want to be able to sleep around and kill whomever they want. Glad they were stopped
"I'm a woman (for context) & I'm befuddled as to how there's women literally shrieking, shaking & crying because they'll no longer be able to yeet their own offspring. 

Also, where was this energy while this admin wanted to force COVID vaccination ""or else"" you risked your schooling, your job, etc. The apoplectic brainlets today are the same who wanted people like me fired & ostracized for refusing to be coerced, manipulated & jabbed. I guess ""my body, my choice"" is selective & only applies to those w/certain opinions.
I don't empathize w/those who wouldn't do it for those like me. So cope & seethe."

Meanwhile Russia is on the brink of causing world war 3 and a nuclear holocausts and the Middle East is re arming. There are hundreds of millions of slaves in Asia TODAY but THIS is what gets people crying and losing their minds ? Get a grip with a side of responsibility.
Yes court protected the unborn child from murderer and killers
There never was a constitutional right to abortion.
The left are truly evil and demonic.
It won't last when thousands of kids end up in care which will cost a fortune for the government and the dollar will drop dramatically

Why are they crying..lol..it's easy just close your legs and make better choices.

"The dangerous part is the media‚Äôs roll in this. It‚Äôs the states right to decide. It puts the power back to the states. 
In many cases I‚Äôve seen is abortions after 6 weeks will be illegal in many states. Not illegal across the board as the media wants you to believe. 
Also having members of congress here is a violation of their oath of office. Because you don‚Äôt like the decision doesn‚Äôt mean you protest the action as Maxine Waters and others have done."
I've never seen someone cry because they can't kill any more children.
Feminists are just screaming prostitutes who should be killed immediately before they kill more children.
"Onlyfans, instagram, ticktock, twiter """" models """" and cheating wifes are not longer able to hide their irresponsible acts aborting innocent lives. What a shame...

Wonder how these people who are for abortions would feel if they were asked  if their mothers had a late term abortion with them  and they were survivors of that abortion  ended up having mental or physical repercussions of that decision their mothers made would feel!!! Don't think they'd like it too much if they did have the mental or physical abnormalities to live with for the rest of their lives!!!
Abortion is Murder!!

"I love your saying that roe v Wade abolishes the right to privacy essentially. First of all that right has been established in quite a few Court presidents second, reasonably if abortion is a right it is so far disconnected from the right to privacy that when I had a college professor who is himself a former Democratic candidate for political office and I brought up that roe v Wade was decided on that basis he didn't know that. It makes no sense whatsoever to say that you have a right to abortion because you have the right to privacy."
Hoes mad
Need to pass more laws in Texas that makes it unbearable for these sub-humans to live here so they'll leave.

So this means if someone rapes me I have to keep their baby WOW F U Trumptards That‚Äôs why your Supreme Court justices passed another law that they and their immediate family can use your tax dollars to provide security detail which they will need 24/7 ofcourse nice win Trumptards
üëçüëç... The Democratic party loves to encourage violence... They're pretty much encouraging abortion..ü§î such a sad party to be in ..

It's all and always about race. 1ST time in America history, whites are the minority race and that is what they always feared. That's why abortions are illegal in Red states and Abortions are legal in Blue states (with Minorities). This was all planned for obvious reasons. THAT'S IT!!!"
"They aren't pro-life. They are pro-zygote. When women have tubular pregnancies, or a zygote dies in the womb etc. Do they care if that woman dies from not getting life saving surgery? That's why in no way are they pro-life. So quit calling them that."

Yall was real quiet when they forced a vaccine on yall
Why not abort all the pro abortion people from life right now.  Would sure be a lot more peaceful right now
This reporter is big mad. She‚Äôs also not good at hiding her bias. Terrible journalism.
All of these idiots that support abortion should be forced to answer what an actual woman is - a biological woman - bc we‚Äôve seen time & time again that they can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt do that.
"It is mind-boggling to see women crying because they do not have the right to kill their baby.

What kind of society do we live in where we make it normal to have the right to kill a newborn inside a mother's womb?

There is no right to abortion in the constitution. All the news outlets are frigging liars.

No constitution right to abortion you baby killers...

So you can't have an abortion but you can carry a gun and shoot at children. Glad to be Canadian
"What, you mean we will have to take responsibility."
Where does it talk about how abortion is a Constitutional Right? It's NOT!!
"I understand the fetus could be a potential life. But as soon as a child is born, all care leaves this world. How does that make sense?

Instead of saving a life (the mother‚Äôs) it will most likely ruin the life of two, the unwanted child and the non-consenting mother.

I see that people write that when a fetus appears the woman‚Äôs body is no longer her own.

But it is. The foetus is IN her body. It doesn‚Äôt own it, just by existing.
No one should own somebody else‚Äôs body, in any way. 

I‚Äôm not a slave to a fetus.

I refuse to be."
America is the land of the free? Lol women don't even get a say so over their own body.

As a woman it‚Äôs my choice to use contraception and not have to rely on an abortion to correct my own irresponsible decisions regarding my body. 

There are very few other cases that abortions would even be for."
Oh so terrible.. we can‚Äôt murder babies anymore by the millions. The horror. If a woman‚Äôs life is at risk due to the pregnancy then I understand abortion in that case. But there‚Äôs no other compelling argument for it that‚Äôs actually justifiable
70million babies .if they had a voice what would they say .this people are evil
"There are many women  crying and completely upset  because they do not know how to prevent unwanted pregnancies! The older ones obviously know who Is going to take care of those babies.......

"Abortion isn't the solution. Providing care for the baby AND the full needs of the mother goes hand-in-hand. 

The left's idea of caring for the life of a woman is by promoting abortion for ""any reason,"" like this so-called reporter said. The right's idea of caring for the life of a woman is by offering baby products, mental health counseling, childcare, adoption resources, etc. for FREE via nonprofit ""life clinics"" which primarily serve the needs of young, impoverished soon-to-be-mothers in the inner city.

Why is that so hard for the left to grasp?"

"Killing a baby isn't a constitutional right, it goes against everything the constitution stands for."
Why now? Something ain‚Äôt right
"Dear women, dear feminists, for your information, men have always been in danger to be made a father against their will. In those cases, there is hardly any personal autonomy left, since you have to pay and care for a child although you did not want to.

Women have benefited from the privilege to be able to undo their mistakes/accidents after the fact, whereas men always have only had the option of contraception.

Also, plan B, the application of which is only the woman's chioce, continues to exist.

How could it ever have been fair that a potential father has 0% authority in the decision about plan B/abortion, but 50% responsibility for the child? How have women been able to infringe men's right of personal autonomy and not care at all for decades but, now, thes are going nuts, because some of them lose one of two undo options? 

This now is the perfect example to show that women are extremely privileged regarding the societal empathy they receive. Where were all the protesters fighting for men's rights of family planning/life planning/personal autonomy? Also, it shows that women hardly care about or empathise with men like they care about/empathise with each other. They are equally egoistic as men."
Lost a beloved grandchild through abortion does it give me rights to overturn abortion? Certainly not
"Very biased. Very, very biased."
Horrible reporting fake news like this is why so many British people have misconceptions about the US
The Supreme courts didn't and can't take away anyone's rights. All the rights you have as Americans is in the constitution. They are just there to say you can't interpret the constitution in any way to fit your narrative and say it's your constitutional right so the Supreme Court has to do what you demand. That's not how it works. Until you put a bill through the house this might be the trend of America on abortions one moment its a federal law the next it's not based on politics. The constitution shouldn't be a political game or tool. It's in there or it's not that's it.
God is good. Abortion is not.
Not a constitutional right. Fake news.

On the plus side, this crisis could be used as the impetus to rally enough sane Americans to finally end the Electoral College, and/or make the Senate reflect the will of the people instead of a radical minority that live in red states. These institutions were created solely to get slave states to join the fledgling union. Any excuse that is made to keep them has now been proven to be outweighed by the negative effects."
"Yes as a mother I do not think abortion is a way to fix sexual irresponsible actions. But the getting  rid of something that Yes is the personal choice is absolutely wrong.  No one is talking about the background of Roe versus Wade. They  forget about all the back alley abortions  a woman would get when it was not legal and died from. Or having to carry then give birth to an abusers child or pregnancies the are so unwanted that the child will end up thrown out like trash a found dead or barely alive. I remember all the news reports. I am a 56 year old woman, mother,  grandmother, wife and daughter. A choice is  your own if it doesn't do harm to others. Yes a fetus will not live but no others have the right to tell no one what they should do.  I had an abortion and also chose life."

"what a lie!   Look, the fight isn't against women's rights.  Its against the RIGHT to FORNICATE & MURDER.   It's that simple whorish people.  The Right to Fornicate without consequences is what the liberal wicked folks want.  They want to sin without being held accountable & responsible for the consequences it brings.  Most abortions (99.9 percent) are based on purposes of 'convenience'.  There's no reason to penalize the baby for the crime of the father (for those who've been raped and impregnated..  Just do your child a favor, spare his/her life and deliver him/her and offer him/her to adoption.   There's plenty of families that cannot bare children of their own who desire to be father and mother to them."

"these people are just a bunch of baby killers, we need the sacrifice instead of common sense and resposibility.  What about the civil liberties of the life you created....I understand why you say my body my choice...but why dont you say my body my responsibility....so how about its your responsibility to not have a child if you dont want one.  How about we promote responsibility instead of a quick fix by killing a baby.   See the thing is its not about taking away womens rights, its about not killing babies you fucking crazy women."

"If there was ever a moment that truly showed our public school systems failed our youth, let this be a shining example.  I have to constantly remind myself that not everyone has a brain capable of logical analysis, and that some are indeed slow and/or special ed.  These people seem to fail to read the fine print of what has transpired.  The Supreme Court didn't ban abortions, they merely gave the power back to the states to decide.  Even then, most aren't banning them outright, but banning them after a certain time frame.  A lot of these people are demonstrating a condition known as ""blind by emotion"" or BBE.  Where they are so emotionally invested, that they lose all sense of logic and reason.  It's sad."

There is no constitutional right to abortion that is a LIE.  Truth is Americans forced to pay for these abortions are illegal and now they are no longer force to pay for this slaughter of the innocents.
What the suprem court did with Roe V. Wade was sent it back to the states. It is up to each state to decide if abortion will be legal or not. Hopefully We the People will be the ones to decide in our state by vote. I wonder if people are so bad inform or uninformed. Base in what I hearing in the liberal media people are bad inform!!
"Roe v wade wasn't a ruling on abortion.

It was a ruling on privacy that assumed abortion was a legitimate medical procedure.

All the courts sid was say ""woah wait a second we don't have any laws about this,  we can't enshrine it because we don't have the laws to act upon"" which is their duty

"I don't know if people are disinformation or bad inform in the suprem court justice overturn on Roe V. Wade. Base on what I have been seeing and hearing on CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC news and even what I listen Biden said as he was trying to read the teleprompter. It is a  combination of disinformation with bad information. And a clear show of brain washing to protest about something that didn't happen and a insensitivity to violence to push a narrative that fit their agenda instead of information."

"Dear reporter, its not taking away a freedom to kill a baby. Its taking away the perverse right to legally kill a child. If a person can be charged with with double homicide like Scott Peterson was, then the killing of a baby in the womb should matter if the woman lives. A great day for children, its their fight, its their right.

Why not report on Margaret Sanger and her desire to kill off the black population through the means of abortion? I'll be waiting reporter lady."
I had one night stand with a woman who had abortions.
"You know, your body, your choice includes body responsibility, and if you are a woman and aren't intimately familiar with your CYCLE, then do you truly love and respect yourself??
The easiest thing to do in this world is to take responsibility for ourselves, and ladies, this includes knowing your cycle and acting accordingly. The chances of getting pregnant are ZERO if you simply use logic, know your cycle, and live accordingly. Include your man also wearing a condom every time, regardless of cycle!

One easy step to body freedom!!!

Question is, do you love yourselves enough to take responsibility, or do you need to continue making bad choices?!?"
Stop calling it women‚Äôs rights. It‚Äôs not your body it‚Äôs not your choice it is textbook murder.

Jesus hates abortion... EXCEPT when he carries them out in Rev 2:23!! ü§òüòà‚ö∞Ô∏èüòà
"Jesus is indeed Lucifer the Morning Star, which is why Isaiah 14:12 lists Lucifer as the Morning Star and then Jesus calls himself the Morning Star in Rev 22:16.  The reason Christians fail to see the obvious is because they are brainwashed by their churches into reading the Bible BACKWARDS and reading the New Testament BEFORE the Old Testament.  We read books from FRONT TO BACK for a reason, and that is because you can't possibly understand the end of a book that you don't understand the beginning of.  And it is not even possible to fully understand a book from reading the LAST QUARTER of it.  With that being said...---->  Adam and Eve were NOT first, and the 2 stories of Creation in Genesis are NOT about the same Creation as the Christian church teaches.  GOD makes people on the 6th day of Creation in Genesis 1:26.  Then in Genesis chapter 2 God rests, God sanctifies the 7th day, and then the LORD God of Israel creates Adam and Eve on the 7th day of Creation.  To work on the 7th day that God has blessed and sanctified is BLASPHEMY, which is what makes the LORD God SATAN the LORD of this world.  That also makes clear that Adam and Eve were NOT FIRST, they were made second.  Doesn't the 6th day of Creation come BEFORE the 7th day of Creation?---->  The family lineage that begins with Adam and ends with Jesus is the family lineage made by SATAN the LORD God, not God.  That's why Isaiah 14:12 lists Lucifer as the Morning Star, and then Jesus calls himself the Morning Star in Rev 22:16.  Jesus was Lucifer in the flesh, not God in the flesh.  Jesus is Lucifer the Morning Star!  Go to my channel for more details...

That NEW WORLD Order that Alex Jones and other GOP Christians pretend to fight is really the goal of Christianity otherwise known as the NEW EARTH (Isaiah 65:17, Isaiah 66:22, 2 Peter 3:13, Rev 21:1) to be ruled by the New Jerusalem.  The New Earth is where the nations are destroyed and massed together for a world government that will be on the shoulders of Jesus.  Well, isn't the New World Order a world government as well?  And gee, New Earth even sounds exactly like New World, doesn't it?  That is not a coincidence, the New Earth is indeed the New World Order.  It's all right there in your NEW WORLD Translation Bible if you actually bothered to read it...  <-)

The GOP already used their NRA lobbying dollars to REWRITE THE 2ND AMENDMENT in 2008.  The GOP and the Koch brothers REWROTE THE CONSTITUTION with the Citizens United ruling.  Now the GOP has FIVE MORE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS planned.  That makes SEVEN Constitutional Amendments in 9 YEARS for the GOP.  Anyone who cares for the CONSTITUTION would NEVER vote for the GOP EVER...Ôªø

The media in the country is corrupt, it is all right wing Fascist MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX run pro-Christian pro-Israel PROPAGANDA, plain and simple.  When has ANY media channel EVER allowed someone like myself to BIBLICALLY challenge the Christian religion?  NEVER, because if someone like me had access to major media channels, very few people would be Christian. CBS was founded by Westinghouse, a major DEFENSE contractor.  NBC was formerly owned by General Electric, another huge DEFENSE contractor.  And this is the LIBERAL media, huh??  Pfftt, hardly.Ôªø

"Hey foreign journalist,

There is no Constitutional right to abortion, there never has been. That was the entire point of the U.S. Supreme Court decision. Roe was always based in bad law, even Liberal legal scholars concede this. The SC‚Äôs job is NOT to legislate policy, but ONLY to interpret the Constitution. Try educating yourself. Also, there is no violation of women‚Äôs rights here. This has always been about the essential human right of the right to life, to not be killed in the womb, but be born. An unborn child is not part of a woman‚Äôs body, it is a distinct human being with it‚Äôs own unique genetic blueprint. No one lost any natural rights with this correct ruling, but countless millions of people over many future generations just gained the right to life."

Same people that are against murdering babies are the same people that will skin an animal and eat it. Except humans are animals too. Peoples hypocrisy really blows my mind.
"Never forget, Trump is responsible for this!"
It's going to cause back-alley abortions
We should not be stripping away a woman's rights
I'm a republican but this right here really does not sit well with me
"You are all sick people if you think killing a beating heart in mid-term late term or wtv is OKAY, and that the baby's body is yours choice. I'm sorry to disappoint, but your body is carrying the life you want to kill. If you wanted to do that, you should have done it in early stages."
Womens rights or child rights?
You know accidents do happen and sometimes people might accidentally take a certain antibiotic that cancels out the birth control or they may have been raped. But they should not be forced to give birth to a child that they're not financially able to take care of or that they never wanted. Number one in overpopulates the country and number two it puts too many kids into the system that don't even have a family. Remember that child will grow up one day and it could possibly be a murderer stop looking at them like their children. We have got to control population
Abortion is not a contraceptive‚Ä¶ You have Plan B.. you also have contraceptives to not have a baby‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs also tubal ligation‚Ä¶ You have more things today than you had in the 70s don‚Äôt be stupid!
If you want abortion‚Ä¶ Just take your female innards out and then you won‚Äôt have to worry about having a baby!! Because if you don‚Äôt want one then.. you surely are not gonna be a worthy mother now!!
just vote in your state why is that so difficult to understand
Abortion is not a constitutional right... CHANNEL 4. I have a question to you. How much have you been paid to say bs like that?
"I‚Äôm crying, laughing not tears."
This channel isn‚Äôt even trying to fake impartiality
Woman vs woman‚Ä¶üçø
"What about the grey areas? Women who may die if they go through with the pregnancy, women who were raped and dont want the child. The possibility that a very sick or disabled child will be born if the pregnancy proceeds. These are reasons that put things in a completely different light, it is not a black and white issue. Its really not."
Left should have worked with the right but once you say a women has a right to have a abortion all the way up to birth just turned too many people off.
I'm sorry you have to do a better job of shutting your legs after a drunk night at the bar
Stupid libtards
i'm excited to see the efflux of people with substandard morals exit my state. ‚úå‚úå
it's a good thing this happened. I'm glad it happened in my life time and i got to see it. No one has the right to murder another human being.
"Boy, they really want to torture and murder babies."
Woman against woman. It's nothing about woman rights it's about human rights
Channel 4 thinks Not killing babies is taking away freedoms?! Sick
Hopefully we can get Trump back in office ü•∞
Now we are finally bringing God back to the states ü§ó
im a democrate but i will never vote again democrate. women in the usa are the most organized mafia. more powerful the police mafia. women have made the democrate party the femanazi party. all the laws today are antimale antnatural. men are being destroyed in this country. even fathers day is a joke. these antimale laws must end.
"For all you depressed winey liberals relax. You will still be able to kill your babies since you live in blue states . In fact please do since we don‚Äôt need future liberal woke people .
On the other hand red states will increase voters because we are not having abortions 
A baby heartbeat starts after 15 weeks . This is a fact for all you baby killers"
gay marriage is next!
They should survey Orphans if they would rather be killed or have their lives. Imagine fighting to kill your kid
"Trumps choices don't want you to be able to kill a baby.
Bidens choice doesn't even know what a women is, and thinks we're to hard on paedophiles and Trumps the bad guy???"
How a woman could get two abortions herself and then take that very right away from other women is disgusting.
"Such balanced, unbiased reporting ü§î"
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
We live in a society where the the Supreme Court believe anyone and everyone  that purchase  a gun will make the right decision  but a woman don't have enough  sense to make the right decision when it comes to a pregnancy.
My :God!! The thought that a baby about to be delivered can no longer be subject to having a pair of forceps thrust into its skull and its brain sucked out is unconscionable!!!  We demand partial abortion!!!!!  Too bad the protesters' mothers didnt about them.
You body your choice.? well abort your body stop killing babies . God's abomination the shed of innocent blood.. remember religion don't save only Jesus Christ saves
And let's not talk about the dad's that want to keep the baby. If they don't wanna have a chance of getting pregnant then don't lay in the bed it's that simple stop getting in bed with every man that u see............ duh.........
"As a news channel, please report the news, not express your own opinion !"

"i cant believe they went through with it... you republicans are sick, go shoot yourselves"
I guess this means they actually have to be responsible now.
"The ‚ÄúPro-Life‚Äù movement is Pro-Death, and more people need to recognize this important fact.

The same justices and politicians who weep crocodile tears for embryos are the ones who sentence thousands of the elderly and children to die.  How ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù are they really when they refuse to protect people from COVID and guns?  The blood of thousands stain their hands, disproving their rhetoric about caring for life.

We need to vocally label conservatives as the pro-death party, and directly call out people like Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas as the heartless, treacherous wretches they truly are.  Don‚Äôt let these hypocrites claim the higher ground on the cause of saving lives; challenge them and ask how many people died from their other actions."
They way to fix this.. is make a law no one is allowed to have kids unless a licence.  If welfare you are not allowed..only if you have money.  Lets see if they like this law instead. I a have a funny feeling they would scream no more welfare entitlements.
I see nothing but cry babies crying over not being able to kill babies
"Hilarious how only conservatives comment and watch I am conservative, I love god and ya and I think that killing children is horrible"
No such thing as constitutional right to kill your own child
Yeah NUGGA
The complete evisceration of Roe v. Wade by the reactionary justices on the Supreme-(ly Political) Court of the United States clearly validates the sad reality that the United States is no longer 'the land of the free & the home of the brave.'
People are crying over not being able to kill babies
There are 1000‚Äôs of forms of birth control abortion is so archaic and barbaric
Until one of these women's children get pregnant after being rapped then they won't be so happy!!! Women's rights being taken away certain people NEED to be voted out of office  I'm going to fight until I die.
"There never was a 'Constitutional Right' to an abortion. It's not in the Constitution, and the Judiciary cannot make law. The decision ha been returned to the states where it should be. Democrats are just enraged they cannot murder and dismember babies freely anywhere."
"All you have to do id's go to vegas if you want abortion, the ruling is a joke it's like putting a fence on the Mexican border they still can cross by the millions."
"Hahaha great news, all these emotional crybaby liberals balling their eyes out!! Cry babies Hahaha!!"
‚Äúeveryone who is for abortion has already been born‚Äù.
Seriously these people need to all be deported to the rock from which they crawled out from under. There are literally no bigger losers on the planet
Good üëç the Supreme Court don't want yall womens babies blood on their hands u keep that on your own #judgementdayiscoming
There is simply nothing more satisfying than seeing the liberal left angry and upset‚Ä¶ i just love it !

"Terrified that they have to be responsible. Amazing.
Now they can force the ja6.

I would expect another pla9ue soon."
Hoes mad
woman shouldn't have a voice
What good is bodily autonomy if you can't stop your body from getting pregnant in the first place
If they band birth control they should also band vasectomy for men
I hope that all those woman celebrating this decision adopt at least five kids from those abusive orphanage
"Abortion is not a constitutional right, why would you say that? The first and second amendment are rights protected by the Constitution, which is why they fail every time they try to take them, abortion is not a right. The majority of this country was okay with abortion when it was safe, legal and rare. The minute they started celebrating abortion, pushing abortion up until the moment of birth, wearing it as a badge of honor and demanding taxpayers foot the bill, they lost. You did this to yourselves"
long live president trump.
its the supreme pleasure to watch this snowflakes. meltdown. oh thanks GOD.

"Women protest and want everything banned now, but won't protest against their favorite Hollywood celebrities who are p*dos,  r*pe kids AND women."
Wow. This reporting is completely neutral. Said no one ever.
the fact that channel 4 excluded the fact that a majority of Americans oppose 2nd and 3rd trimester abortions (and democrats advocate up to birth) shows everything you need to know about media
"Roe v Wade overturned. Every supporter of killing unborn babies loses their mind and acts like a hysterical toddler.

"No matter how you cut it , abortion is an abomination!"
Yes pro life
"Women do have a right to choose, but that choice should begin in the bedroom not in the clinic. Maybe now men and women will be a bit more cautious about who they sleep around with."
"As someone who is both 'pro life‚Äô and 'pro choice‚Äô I am totally disgusted by the ‚Äòpro life‚Äô campaigners still out on the streets celebrating their ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô. If they were truly motivated by their ‚Äòfaith‚Äô rather than their right-wing political views, they would - if they were true ‚ÄòChristians‚Äô -  be spending time in quiet contemplation giving ‚Äòthanks‚Äô for their perceived ‚Äòvictory‚Äô Conversely, ‚Äòpro choice‚Äô campaigners have a legitimate right to demonstrate after this retrogressive SCOTUS Decision!"

"Gotta keep those babies so the repubes can have them shot in schools, and complain about them being freeloaders. What a joke that country is."
"what I don't understand is why women are fighting Roe v Wade, no one is forcing them to have abortions---"
Guys don't worry you can still get a abortion you'll just go to jail if you do it. It's still your choice though. Don't you think this goes past your right to choose?
"Channel 4 are so dishonest I feel I have to right this - Just so people know - the supreme court did not ban abortion. Abortion has not now become illegal in the states. All that has happened is the Supreme court decided it is not a constitutional right (obviously it's not) and that state governments are best placed to determine their own laws when it comes to abortion. My ""liberal"" friends, don't worry LA, NY, DC, and all the other blue states will still continue to kills baby right up to the point of birth. I know this will disappoint you but Republican States will most likely put a time limit on abortive to the end of the first trimester. You know .... Like here in the UK. That's what really happened."
I love how these crazies say that men are the ones pushing for this...but the pro-life women in this video were the most excited. üòÇ
"The crazy thing is that the right to bear arms is in the constitution and the right to murder unborn babies is not, let that sink in"
It was NEVER been a Constitutional right. Read the Constitution for pity sake
"You don't need me to tell you that an unborn child is too small, too poor, too weak, too innocent for a Liberal  to acknowledge it's existence as you already know all this.  Considering God created the Heavens, the Universe, everything and  owns everything, can you just imagine how small, how weak,  how poor, how wimpy, how pathetic  a Liberal must appear to God?I assure you God loves the weakest, poorest, youngest, oldest people on earth every bit as much as he loves you and I."
It's all about choice? Why not choose to close your legs or choose birth control before you get pregnant? Why not choose to be responsible?  Dogs breed indiscriminately.  Are you no more than a dog?
"It all boils down to, liberals want to kill babies out of convience of a woman.  The only reason this was even an issue,  is because the left comapigned for abortions on demand, up to birth. If you want to blame anyone , blame the, shout your abortion crowd. The Lina Dunims of the world saying they wish they could have had the opportunity to have an abortion. The fact is, the decision is now at the state level. If you want to kill babies, move to democrat sanctuaries. If you want to skip that nuisance,  where a condom. At the state level their can be discussions about when abortions are permissible. Likely they will deem it ok in the case of health of mother, incest and rape. If you think they wont, you are being disenguous.  Just imagine the campaign slogans of people competing in a primary. Do you really think that someone will win, or hold their seat if their opponent paints them as someone that will now fight for an abortion for a mother if she will die if the baby is borb. Wake up people."
Horseshit. Forced birth is evil.
While showing women celebrating that it is gone.
"God, their breaking down in tears because they no long have the right to end a life???"
To all those fking liberals this is what happen when you play stupid and forget what women is .
"They are so dumb they report it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúConstitutional right‚Äù. No. Remember it was 5 unelected justices who gave you federal abortion law 50 years ago...if you don't like the fact that 6 unelected justices returned the law to the states remember that we put up with it for 50 years. Now it's back where it belongs. The Dems say they love democracy so much but they argue against this very democratic process. Now, the people in each state will decide."

Next they will be protesting that they can't murder school children. No difference liberals murder is murder.
God's gonna nuke this place

Two words: the pill.  It works and has for decades.
This is amazing
If the woman has the right to choose and wants a abortion the man should have the right to choose to get full custody and the woman pay child support!
A woman has never been allowed to do whatever they want with their bodies. You can swing your arm around all you want. The second it strikes and kills another you have crossed the line.
Pro life men are fucking sick mother fuckers but what is worse is another woman who thinks it is okay to force other women to have fucking babies.  The post roe idiots make me fucking sick.  it is not okay to force your religious beliefs onto others.
Are these women crying because they can no longer murder their unborn children?
"The fact there are women crying over this only leads me to believe they had goals of killing a fetus in their future, and now they can't and they hate it."
Wonder how many of these anti abortionists are in favour of the death penalty for children and against school lunches.
"Not to sound petty!!! Why do the people who are for life seem normal, then you go over to the pro abortion side and you see green hair, blue hair, red hair, goofy clothes, just goofy looking people in general.... they look like Barnum and Bailey circus, a big giant busted bag of skittles. ABORTION is MURDER!!!! Im happy about all this"
"America be like :

French people :

Same people that wanna put your child in a mask at school for seven hours a day can‚Äôt put a condom on for three minutes think about that .
It's not constitutional. It never was. This was a proper decision.
You have no right to an abortion. And no there is no majority that supports abortion. Those polls are taken in strict liberal states.
Forced birth is what we're talking about & it's going to kill many thousands of women and destroy far more lives than it will supposedly save. Let's call it what it is. Forced birth. It will be a disaster for our country. We already have one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world. This is the opposite of pro life. It's pro death. Forced birth is wrong on every level. Many states have zero exceptions for rape or incest. This is a literal death sentence for thousands of women.
"They overturn Roe v Wade because states rights.  Then they over turn a New York gun law, overturning a state right.  Now they have suspended your Miranda rights.  What rights are they going to take next?"

"How would you anti-abortionists  sleep at night if YOU had to put in the forceps and pull the innocent baby out limb by limb, crush it's skull with the forceps and pull out the skull and brain piece by piece."
Yeah 99 years for abortion!!!! Right desicion!!!
And i hope trump will desmantly evry news channels for ever!!! and create new news!!
And evry men whit these liberalist cunts are SIMPS AND LOSERS
They should let the babies decide if they want to be aborted or not..
And these liberalist people shoud be put to camps for re-education for normality
I would like to ask this man how many times has he paid for a woman's health care and how many times has he babysitted a child for free.
Nice job supreme court!!!!. Evry woemen who make abortion shoud be jailed for 50years for killing child
What are the rights of men? What are the reproductive rights of men and fathers?

I laugh at all you women who want to kill babies.... I feel sorry for the innocent unborn not women who want to kill their children..
this is so biased.  Yeah for America and the rights of the unborn... woo hooo
The United States is a federal system. This means if an issue is not covered in the U.S. Constitution then it defers back to the individual sates. That's all this ruling corrected... that abortion is not a centralized  government decision. Duh.

"Oppose the Withdrawal of Women‚Äôs Abortion Rights in the USA through an Order of the Supreme Court.
All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) strongly condemns the recent order of the Supreme Court of the USA which reverses the right of abortion available to American women for the last five decades through the judgment in the Roe versus Wade case. This judgment which had allowed women to opt for an abortion in the first trimester, and under certain circumstances even in the second trimester of pregnancy has now been overturned by a majority decision of the Supreme Court allowing the states to impose their own restrictions depriving women of their right in the matter.

It is feared that strong anti-abortionist lobbies will prevail in many of the American states and push through harsh laws making all abortions beyond 15 weeks illegal and punishable and imposing severe restrictions even on that. The moot point in the matter is that the power to decide in the matter is being transferred from the woman concerned to the state authorities.

AIDWA sees this as a dangerous turn towards anti-woman anti-poor right-wing reaction within American society which will particularly hurt women from the more vulnerable sections in the US and young adults among them who are anyway denied health and reproductive rights and rights to safe contraception; now they will be deprived of the right to safe abortion as well and may be pushed into taking recourse to illegal clinics jeopardizing their health and even their lives.

AIDWA expresses solidarity with activists within American society opposing this reactionary judgment and asserting the right of women over their bodies."
"Jose Vela does not seem to grasp that under the Constitution, it is perfectly acceptable for one state to declare certain acts to be criminal, while other states do not. It is the STATES, primarily, that pass criminal laws, and these laws presumedly reflect the will of the people in that State. That's precisely what the Constitution provides. In order for a crime to be federal, there usually has to be some nexus with interstate commerce. So the primary authority for defining what is a crime and what isn't is the State legislature. That Vela doesn't know this is amazing."
"How about allowing the father of the child to actually have a say when it comes to the future of that unborn baby?

Until you are able to conceive a child without the help of a man (and I will point out a man born as a man not a transgender man) then a man has a say in what happens to the future of that unborn baby. Now granted a lot of men may not care and will decline having any input. But at the very least a woman should talk with the father of that unborn baby and get his input. Allow him to express his decision and she needs to take his thoughts and feelings into account while making that decision. I would say that he should even have legal grounds to give input on the future of that unborn child. So tired of this bullshit. So tired of women screaming about how it's their decision and their bodies. Girl, you didn't get pregnant without that man. He DOES have a say in what happens to that child. At the very least if you make a decision to allow that baby to be born and if a man DOESN'T want it to be born and wanted an abortion? Then he should not be liable to pay child support for 18 years. It's only fair. It's all about you ladies? Then stop being disingenuous and keep it ALL about you! The father of the child doesn't get to be part of the decision? Then the father of the child should be absolved of child support. You can't have it both ways..."
"BS‚Ä¶ it is not three justices.  Given the opportunity, the left would install three appointees with their ideology.  The issue was that Roe v Wade was unconstitutional and scholars on both sides of the isle have acknowledged this fact."
You are the father!
Lol! All these crazy libs weeping! Love it! Of course they never shed a tear for the killing of unborn babies. Oh well! You have plenty of options to have that baby murdered so no worries. Just go to the state next door...
''my body my choice'' except when its about the covid vac then u either take it or lose your job
Why some women crying and some cheering‚Ä¶
finally accountablity for baby killers
Congress shall make NO LAW respecting an establishment of religion
"""Fifty years of women's rights in America overturned in an instant.""  What shamelessly biased reporting. The court decided that  the legal reasoning of the Roe vs Wade case was based on weak and spurious arguments. As a result, it is up to the US states to legislate on abortion because it is not a subject mentioned in the US Constitution."
These people are fuc&ing lunatics. Their mad they cant kill babies.
"What baffles me is they talk abt women's right to kill babies bcz they couldn't keep there little cats to themselves  or be reckless .
Talk abt freedom to murder many young innocents lol."
The Supreme Court has effectively divided the nation further pushing people Balkanizing the American landscape.  America is on its way out of a unified nation.
And now foetuses have more rights than actual humans. Society has just got 100 times dumber.
Liberal demonstrations across the United States protesting the overturning of Roe V Wade are quite hilarious and entertaining to watch.
It's like people don't realize condoms exist.
Killing babies is not the solution to any problem
But women don't like or need men. So they won't be getting pregnant anyway
Provides more targets for school shooters
Right to LIFE!
Now let‚Äôs see how many lives are lost by women going underground to find an abortion clinic
Abortion was never in the constitution you lieing bastards
It‚Äôs June and the snowflakes are melting‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs not from the heat.
Is the creature in the thumbnail with the bushy caterpillar eyebrows male or female? Hard to tell.
"345 thousand babies killed each year by Abortions and selling their body parts Plan Parenthood.
Any one think its strange that all the signs were already made??"
That shoud've happend 49 years ago.
Say goodbye to RoevWade‚Ä¶And justice for all unborn children
"Aww, poor woman crying in the thumb nail, ‚Äúoh no now I can‚Äôt kill babies, I can‚Äôt be a real woman any more!‚Äù"
"Here lies the problem.

One side believes abortion is about killing babes. The other believes its about women rights.

Both have a point. 

I agree 1000% on my body my choice. If any woman wants to get a boob job or butt implants; I support that (it's your body your choice).

However, you can do anything with your body as long as it doesn't kill a born or unborn member of society. 

I believe this is a fair compromise."
Hoes mad. Hoes mad. Hoes mad. Hoes mad. Hoes mad. Hoes mad. üòé
I've got news for these idiots who are anti-choice... abortion will NEVER end... all it means is more women will die in back alley abortions.  I hope that once these anti-choice women (and their husbands or boyfriends) get raped or are a victim of incest enjoy watching their rapist's baby being born.
"Liberal meltdown, lol"
Lol imagine being devastated that the right to kill children was taken away haha
is it so hard to use contraception. everyone wants to go bareback.
abortion is murder
"he Bible says ""Love Thy Neighbor,"" but Trump's far-right homegrown terrorist new motto is ""Hate They Neighbor."" There will no longer be any peace and love as long as those fanatic hooligans' control our once loved America before Donald Trump. Our nation is so divided that it will never be a leader of the free world. Fight back against those hooligans destroying America. Jan. 6, 2011 gives video proof to that Donald Trump wanted a coup that nearly happen. If it hadn't of been for people up holding their oath of office (True Americans), Donald Trump's evil plan would have worked. A dictator would have taken over America as he wanted. He won't give up with the continued lies as he learned from criminal Roger Stone as he pardoned like so many others. He wants that power back as the Republican Party wants. Donald Trump's Supreme Court is just the beginning. Do we want a Russian America or America as it was before Donald Trump? Jan. 6, 2011 was worse then Pearl Harbor or 9/11 because it came from within. Don't let the so-called religious creeps tell you differently. They are NOT OF GOD. Those people follow the devil like Donald Trump. He never represented all of the people because he never lived up to the oath of office he swore upon to represent ALL OF THE PEOPLE.  He lied as he does today to keep his power. It was all about him. No one else. He knew people were stupid enough to believe him because of criminal Roger Stone. Only criminals get pardoned. Listen to the facts, not a dictator."
I wonder how many of these woman really read what the rights are?
"It's that time of year again when democRATS start looting, vandalizing and burning down their communities. HAHAHAHAHA"
‚ÄúPolls show most Americans support abortion‚Äù were those polls done by the same clown who said Joe Biden will win by a landslide.
I think states should pass a law that if you are prolife you now have to adopt a child and take responsibility of telling others what they can do with their bodies. I'm so sick of people telling others what to do and talking zero responsibility in that action.
Watching these deranged satanic mobs having a meltdown makes me so happy!!
If abortion is legal then men should have the right not to pay child support..MY WALLET MY CHOICE
Killing unborn babies is a right?
"PRO ABORTION ALWAYS WILL BE.  I HATE KAMALA HARRIS, BUT I GUESS I'M STUCK VOTING FOR HER.  WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A JILL STEIN??  WHERE IS CAMILLE PAGLIA?  WHY CAN'T PENNSYLVANIA MAKE UP ITS MIND ON ABORTION?  WHY CAN'T IT MAKE UP IT'S MIND UP ON MARIJUANA WHILE CHILDREN OVERDOSE ON HEROIN IN THE STREETS?  WHERE IS BILL MAHER????

Good News ‚úÖüëçüëè
If I'm forced to have a kid I'm going to make that child's life miserable I'm going to take pills to make a die!!!!!!
Nobody is talking about the rights of trans women to have safe abortions.
These violent abortionist monsters are the vilest form of hypocrite. In one breath they claim to be humanitarian humanists. In another they fight to cruely and violently kill off the human race.
Abortion is murder.
Satan lives in these protest.
"Why don‚Äôt the radical women just get hysterectomies?  They don‚Äôt have any problem with men getting vasectomies or with even giving ‚Äúgender reassignment surgery‚Äù (if there even is such a thing) to children.   Apparently, there are people who are incapable of understanding that constitutional rights apply to all, born and unborn."
"You are biased trash! Nowhere in the constitution does it say that ""Americans are entitled to hoover out fetuses for convenience"". FFS-- anyone that pounds their chest in support of this practice are repugnant!"
Whaa....I have to drive a bit to murder my child.. what a dark day.....the protesters do make a good argument for retroactive abortion
"maths time: 
under 1000 women die in childbirth each year 
this is consistent a with only a slight change if abortion allowed or disallowed.
 since abortion allowed about 1 million babies aborted each year in America 
if america allows abortion for 100 years they will kill  the same as 1/3rd of their population  
abortion is not a contraceptive option ladies thats what this is really about"
IF YOU DOMT LIKE IT MOVE TO A MURDER AND EVIL STATE !
A woman still have their rights . They have a right to keep their clothes on
A massive shortage of baby formula in the US and the Supreme Court says ‚ÄúMAKE MORE BABIES!‚Äù‚Ä¶ America is INSANE! So many starving babies on the horizon.
Thank God for Donald J Trump
Abortion is not a constitutional right.. it is mentioned 0 times in the constitution.
"Abortion isn‚Äôt an constitutional right, end of story. Marxists, go home."
Nothing worse than seeing young teens of this new sensitive generation Protest against abortion pathing the way for a Dark future for themselves
Democrats are free to move back to abortion states. Please do. Thank you
"There is no such thing as ""Constitutional Right to Abortion"".  Get your facts right.  And the Supreme Court did not totally ban abortion.  They only reverted back to the States Legislatures, as representatives of the people, to legislate reasonable and justified abortion (which is actually terminating a life of an unborn child, that also have a right to life as bestowed to all human beings by our Creator).  These people should understand and respect the states that don't support wanton abortion."
No where in the constitution does it say we have the right to kill children
channel  4 news is just another left wing outlet. don't expect any objective journalism on this channel.  but as a man i believe i also have a right to have a say in this debate seeing as men  can get pregnant too according to the left.
This overruling is absolutely outrageous! Shame on Supreme Court!
A truly historical day for helpless children brilliant great news.
We‚Äôre putting the life of women against future leaders. This is sick.. women want tooo much of everything.
Baby murderer‚Äôs have a big ego don‚Äôt they! They wanna fight for their right to murder babies. What a sickening thought which they want to make it a right! Disgracefully satanic
"Taking away a women's right to choose..
Oh great!  So you can define woman now?"
What‚Äôs sad about all this. Is there will likely be another rittenhouse case by the time all this is over. Does no one ever look back at history and learn?
It wasn‚Äôt turned over in an instant. U can still get an abortion!
"God bless America üá∫üá∏ TRUMP 2024!!!!! 
Enough with these SNOWFLAKES"
Disgusting. Poor women
"This was recently posted and is something for the
Supreme Court to consider:
Can a 13-year old girl adopt a baby if she wants to?
No. Obviously not, are you nuts?
What about a 15-year old girl? Can she adopt a baby if
she feels like it?
Absolutely not!
How about an 18-year old girl? Surely SHE could adopt a
baby, right?
Still, no. No way.
What if she's 20? No longer a teenager. A 20-year old
can definitely adopt a baby if she feels like it, right?
Actually, no.
Hm. Weird. Why not? There are 400,000+ children in
foster care, why can't she adopt at least one of them?
She just can't. You have to qualify to adopt a child.
Rigorous background checks, home visits, proof of
financial and mental stability, etc. it's a whole thing.
Cool.
But if she, at 14, gets impregnated by an abusive ex-
boyfriend (who shoved her out of his moving car and left
her for dead), she must carry to term, give birth and just,
figure it out somehow?
Yes. That is correct.
But, she's only 14 ...
SHE WILL FIGURE IT OUT. She should have been more
careful. Made better choices.
So, to ""punish"" her for her poor choices, we force her
into motherhood, which we've established she's totally
unqualified for? And now, we are suddenly comfortable
with a young, traumatized girl, caring for a vulnerable
little screaming human being that is wholly reliant on her
for survival?
Yes. Absolutely. Such an unexpected blessing"
Being a woman is the hardest thing to be in today‚Äôs society

"So Americans can have guns as a constitutional right, but they don‚Äôt have the right to deciding what happens to their bodies??"
How can people be ok with killing babies
Proof that the US is a country full of who.res who can't keep their legs shut
There was never a constitutional right to abortion
"They be like,
""I AM SO PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW! I CAN'T GET PREGNANT JUST TO KILL THE BABY ANYMORE!! HOW ELSE WILL I FEEL POWERFUL? KILLING KITTENS AND PUPPIES BECAUSE THEY GET MORE ATTENTION THAN ME IS SO 2ND THRU 12TH GRADE!! AAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHH!! I NEED MY NARCISSISTIC SUPPLY!!!"""
"This supposed pro life crowd is not pro life, they're pro forced birth and control of women. This isn't your life, it's not your choice and quite frankly you all don't care what happens to mother and baby afterwards. The poorest women in society from deprived backgrounds will be most effected by this disgusting ruling. Quite frankly why would any young girl want to be born into a world where she has no say? The lack of shame from the anti abortion crowd is disgusting."
"Good job America....
This is bright day of America....
America become vergin from this law..."
"Americans are so far behind the rest of the world its so sad. In debt, misinformed, and living like its 150 years ago. America as I know it won't be around for much longer I think. Someone will overturn these people and take that land back and I wish I could have been there to see that"
It‚Äôs just about control and oppression of women
Surely if Americans cared about life they would have a proper health system like every other developed country in the world and stop people running around with automatic weapons! The richest third world country on Earth.
Stop being a bunch of hoes then
I like how the interviewer was scoffing and talking over the pro-life advocate but she wasn‚Äôt saying anything to the pro-choice advocate.
If she comes to Britain she will get her abortion on the N. H. S. free. R. A.
Point to where the Constitution of the United States says that we can murder unborn children to excuse sexual depravity.
"Outside of Rape, Sexual Abuse and the life of the mother being under threat, I don't believe abortion should be legal. Keep your legs closed."
Womens bodies are their own not their country's
US is not more free country unfortunately
"This is scary

""home of the free"" what a fucking joke."
In many countries they abort only female embryos.Maybe that is why there are born 107 boys to 100 girls.
"Wow, I was told the BBC is garbage now, but actually worse. This news channel is leftist scum."
"On this morning ten years from now, there will be thousands of American children making there way to school who only exist because President Trump decided to protect them."
She is on video admitting she lied and nothing happened but an agenda‚ù§Ô∏è
Cope and seethe!
"No women from RED states should be allowed into Blue States to get an abortion. NO registered Republicon women should be allowed to get an abortion in any Blue States. NO evangelical christian women (of which there are many) should be allowed into Blue States for an abortion. We all know conservative women have the bulk of abortions but until they come out of the closet, stand up for themselves and vote appropriately they need to take their pregnancies to term. Those born should then be required to be placed into conservative and Republicon households to raise. If the mothers are unmarried then any one of the Supreme Court Justices who voted for this ban should be listed as the father on the birth certificates. They should then be sued for child support."
"You dont have a right when you have a baby in the womb,its not your body your choice anymore when you have a baby growing inside you,abortion rips out the baby in pieces and it suffers ,it is murder...shut your legs that's your choice ....."
Baby killers are despicable. How can you reason with such serial killers?
Happiest day of my life .
The best news in fourty years.  These millenial  feminists are nuts . Murdering babies .
It‚Äôs so sad and unthinkable that this would happen in 2022. So many delusional zealots out there. If god existed he wouldn‚Äôt want a world where people idolise him to their own suffering and the planet is essentially his baby factory in absence of people caring  for moral standing of the people who already live here.
Unborn babys lives matter
Why are media so focused on pro-life supporters? These people are a mass minority. And why are they so focused on the hypothetical situation where other rights are repealed. Women will suffer and die as a result of these ruling. Babies will suffer and die as a result of this ruling. THAT SHOULD BE THE STORY.
"Welcome to the British media where they are eternally Committed to Bias, Partiality, Prejudice and a complete lack of objectivity."
A bunch of lunatics crying for the camera!
"I guess these abortion guys don't know the meaning of ""not"" in ""thou shalt not kill."""
Lol! Cry me a handful! Bunch of losers!
So... murdering a baby is a womans right??? Evil people.. evil
"COPY AND PASTED, please share.

I'm not pro-murdering babies.

I'm pro-Becky who found out at her 20 week anatomy scan that the infant she had been so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organs.

I'm pro-Susan who was sexually assaulted on her way home from work, only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later.

I'm pro-Theresa who hemorrhaged due to a placental abruption, causing her parents, spouse, and children to have to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or her unborn child.

I'm pro-little Cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11 year old body isn't mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal.

I'm pro-Melissa who's working two jobs just to make ends meet and has to choose between bringing another child into poverty or feeding the children she already has because her spouse walked out on her.

I'm pro-Brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially, emotionally, or physically able to raise a child.

I'm pro-Emily who went through IVF, ending up with SIX viable implanted eggs requiring selective reduction in order to ensure the safety of her and a SAFE amount of fetuses.

I'm pro-Christina who doesn't want to be a mother, but birth control methods sometimes fail.

I'm pro-Jessica who is FINALLY getting the strength to get away from her physically abusive spouse only to find out that she is carrying the monster's child.

I'm pro-Vanessa who went into her confirmation appointment after YEARS of trying to conceive only to hear silence where there should be a heartbeat.

I'm pro-Lindsay who lost her virginity in her sophomore year with a broken condom and now has to choose whether to be a teenage mom or just a teenager.

I'm pro-Courtney who just found out she's already 13 weeks along, but the egg never made it out of her fallopian tube so either she terminates the pregnancy or risks dying from internal bleeding.

You can argue and say that I'm pro-choice all you want, but the truth is:
I'm pro-life.
Their lives.
Women's lives.

You don't get to pick and choose which scenarios should be accepted.

Women's rights are meant to protect ALL women, regardless of their situation!

"This does NOT violate women's rights. Abortion violates babies lives, by KILLING their life. Do women have a right to kill babies? NO That's like saying a gunman has the right to shoot up a school!!  QUIT playing game using misleading words!  Perhaps all you baby killers secretly applaud school shootings.  Abortions and school shootings results in the same atrocity."
"Sustainable communities? Are you kidding me? The right want to be pro-life for a clump of cells but not pro-baby or child to ensure children don't go hungry. Not pro-family, because they shoot down family leave. No access to affordable housing. All you are doing is making more kuds born in poverty and a rise in child abuse and neglect when parents are stressed and can't afford to care for them. Not only that, but parents who never wanted them to begin with. That breeds abuse as well.

It‚Äôs not in the Constitution of the USA Abortion.
For all the toddlers watching this video the justices on the Supreme Court are supposed to act by the constitution not by there political views. So most likely if the scotus is not BS than there was something wrong with row v wade when it was introduced in 1973.
their very PURPOSE is NOT to protect Civil Liberties. The SCOTUS is there to PROTECT the Constitution  against ALL

I`m sure that there must be much more to it, but essentially Pro Life relies upon ethics whilst Pro - abortion relies upon the Law. Suppose the Law were changed tomorrow and demands that a person only achieves the status of a human being on reaching the age of 1 year and 1 day ?

"There was never a Constitutional right to abortion. That's what this entire case is about. It has nothing to do with religion, or reducing the amount of abortions. The original decision was not the legally correct one. Abortion regulation belongs in the States, not the federal government.

Vote wisely for the people making the laws in your State."

"The Silent Scream

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This Documentary Is Not Recommended For Sensitive People!

The documentary, 'The Silent Scream' released in 1984 contributed to the abortion debate in the 1980s.

Dr. Bernard Nathanson's classic video shocked the world. He explains the procedure of a suction abortion, followed by an actual first-trimester abortion as seen through ultrasound. The viewer can see the child's pathetic attempts to escape the suction curette as her heart rate doubles, and the fetus (girl) opened its mouth in what Nathanson calls a ""Silent Scream"" as her body is torn apart.

The clip begins with an ultrasound of the fetus (girl) who is about to be aborted. The girl is moving in the womb; displays a heartbeat of 140 per minute; and is at times sucking her thumb. As the abortionist's suction tip begins to invade the womb, the child rears and moves violently in an attempt to avoid the instrument. Her mouth is visibly open in a ""Silent Scream."" the child's heart rate speeds up dramatically (to 200 beats per minute) as she senses aggression. She moves violently away in a pathetic attempt to escape the instrument. The abortionist's suction tip begins to rip the baby's limbs from its body, ultimately leaving only her head in the uterus (too large to be pulled from the uterus in one piece). The abortionist attempts to crush her head with his forceps, allowing it to be removed. To ""dehumanize"" the procedure, the abortionist and anesthesiologist refer to the baby's head as ""number 1."" the abortionist crushes ""number 1"" with the forceps and removes it from the uterus.

"I‚Äôm dying over the idea that this is the time to enact progressive legislation to assist pregnant women. The trigger laws have been lingering for some time and the agenda even longer. There‚Äôs been more than enough time to create the type of environment that encouraged women to avoid abortion. If you think some backwater state like Mo is killing themselves to put out paid maternity leave, increased min wage, low cost college, low cost daycare, early childhood education or even healthcare for these women then I have a really nice bridge to show you. If your pro-birth I expect you to start emptying your wallet in support. I‚Äôm f fetus‚Äô mean that much to you than show Jesus how much you love him by doing your duty as Christian‚Äôs. Otherwise you‚Äôre just another disgusting hypocrite who imposed their will on someone else without their consent."

"It is the right decision because it is not the role of judges to create and amend laws in a Democracy BUT the role of the Nations Democratically elected representatives in the Nations Parliament to create the Laws and Regulations the electorate voted for and remove the Laws and Regulations the electorate voted to repeal or amend.

In the USA it is not the duty of Judges to create Constitutional Rights BUT the elected representatives of the USA.

With the original Roe versus Wade Judgement the Supreme Court loaded with Left Wing activist judges usurped US Democracy laid out within the US Constitution - I recall the critical words of the 6 to 3 vote Judgement of the current Supreme Court to the effect that the Courts Judgement correctly returned the decision to the Nations Elected Representatives to legislate what was right for each State in the absence of National Legislation AND for the US Congress and Senate to Legislate a Nationwide Law - Something the Democrats holding the House, the Senate and the presidency can do AND should have done decades ago BUT didn't do because they like the fact that activist Left Wing Supreme Court Judges holding a majority on the Supreme Court can undermine US Democracy whereas the Right in the US believe in Judges that interpret and uphold the Law as it is defined US Congress and Senate and the congress and senates of the individual states.       The issue has been to the existing elected representatives of each state and the US Congress and Senate to decide AND for the electorate to use their votes to elect representatives that will implement the abortion laws the electorate want locally and nationally. 

In the UK it was the Nations elected representatives on a free vote in the Westminster parliament in 1967 on a Private Members Bill introduced by David Steele MP that created legalised consensual abortion in the UK - The time limit set for an abortion in 1967 was 28 weeks based on the age of a viable foetus because it was deemed unacceptable to terminate a viable foetus as killing a live aborted foetus outside the womb was murder.       Since the UK Abortion Law was passed in parliament medical advances mean the age of a viable foetus has decreased considerably and sooner or later the existing Law will be modified to reduce the time limit for an abortion to match the current age of a viable foetus.     In 1990 the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill (1990) reduced the Time Limit to 24 weeks in line with the then viability age for a human foetus combined with removing some restrictions on late abortions where there was a risk to life for the pregnant woman and severe fetal abnormality was identified.          In the 2008 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill (2008) debated reducing the the Time Limit for abortions from 24 weeks to 22 weeks or 20 weeks based upon medical advances reducing the age of a viable foetus BUT voted to retain the 24 week time limit.

The UK experience is that the National Parliament is the right place to openly and publically debate and decide on controversial issues like Abortion like it did in 1967 with the 1967 Abortion Act and openly and publically debate and decide on changes as it did with the 1990 and 2008 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Acts."
I'm divided on this issue and I respect both views and the rights of individuals to back one way or the other. If you are for abortion I'd ask you to contemplate 3 things. Then if you are still pro abortion fine. 1. Research and understand the medical process that occurs and the way in which a babies life is ended. 2. Accept the possibility that you could have been aborted had you been 'inconvenient' - how do you feel about that? 3. Accept that 50% of women who do abort their child are deeply troubled by what they did for the rest of their days. This issue is far more complex than it appears and politicising it is a very sad thing.

"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: ""The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses‚Äô seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy cumbersome loads and put them on other people‚Äôs shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‚ÄòRabbi‚Äô by others.

But you are not to be called ‚ÄòRabbi,‚Äô for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‚Äòfather,‚Äô for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".

YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them, or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents, up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me, and keep my commandments.

If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.

AND WHEN YOU PRAY DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
BUT WHEN YOU PRAY, GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need, before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you,
your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their sins,
your Father will not forgive your sins.

These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples;
then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

Yet a time is coming and has now come
when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
GOD IS SPIRIT, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.

In the New Heaven and the New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all."
LIBERAL COMMIES got WORTHLESS BIDEN AND REPUBLICANS GOT RIGHT TO LIFE!
"Get on the pill,  men use  a CONDOM!"
This British reporter should verse herself on the American Constitution.
"This was never a ‚Äúconstitutional right‚Äù
They‚Äôre just stirring up the crowd"
Nice to see c4 being neutral. Killing a baby is a womans right apparently.
"C4 is doing most of the festering. It was never a constitutional right.  Simply a correction. Late term abortions are evil, I hope they restrict them. The question is when is a baby a fetus? At what point are you saying that you can no longer kill it? At present its legal up to full term in some states which is abhorrent."
"""Ohhhh noooo, you mean i have to be careful about not getting pregnant now???  THIS IS OUTRAGEOUSSSSSS!!!"""
Great day for the US and the world
Want to get your rights back? Vote Democrat in November.
Chanel  4 obviously  have no  clue  about american constitution.
Beautifully bias reporting.
Hard to believe that killing kids was wrong...crazy right!
"Womens "" rights to abortion """
"WOW!!!! BIGGEST KLAN RALLY EVER!!!! So many  KKK LADIES there.
Over HALF of abortions are BLACK
since 1973 over 19,000,000 DEAD BLACK BABIES and these people want to KEEP THOSE BLACKS FROM EVEN BEING BORN!!!"
Women's right to do what exactly? ... Kill their baby. I swear USA is morally bankrupt
How can you defend killing a baby because you don't want to be a responsible adult.  Pure murder
This will only affect poor women and girls who have the misfortune to live in the ''wrong'' states.
Oo boo you can't kill your baby any more ....
There was never a right to abortion !! Give it up already !!
Looks like whole nations‚Äôs population on steroids ‚Ä¶
This is sad I wonder if many Americans will move away now
I believe we are witnessing the beginning of the break up of the union.
"Hoes mad. Abortion was never a constitutional right, nowhere in the constitution does it say someone has the right to end a child's life."
Let‚Äôs remember the case brought before the court was a state that had a 15 week ban 15 weeks is more than enough time to deal with a pregnancy but that wasn‚Äôt good enough it was the liberals who brought this to the Supreme Court
If a woman is raped should they not be allowed to have an abortion ?
"You say this ""Takes away rights""......no it has given them to unborn babies.

Great day for the unborn.....bad day for those that seek to murder them."
It's the same people advocating for disempowering women who are also pro-guns. Interesting isn't it?
Cringe watching liberals.
"It's not a right! Keep your legs crossed and you'll have nothing to protest.
SEE HOW SIMPLE? It's called responsibility but of course you don't want to hear that. 
It makes too much sense."
NEWS FLASH Roe vs Wade has been obsolete since the 80's  .... Do your own research Casey  vs Planned Parenthood.  BTW - RBG thought Row vs Wade was a bad law and said so many times.  Stop believing what you are told and learn how to think for yourself.
The nose looks kinda sus
They say abortion is murdering a human but then they are happy for everyone to have a gun!! Backwards country. Horrific. Abortions are a right for every woman and it's disgusting to take that away from them.
"Two sides of the story, women's rights VS the Unborn baby's rights to life. Remember, only the women can express themselves here, the unborn babies who may well have a bright future cannot."
"For every pro-lifer hand them a child unwanted that wasn't terminated by abortion. They won't take the unwanted child and yet they will tell others they must. Just what we need, more unwanted kids roaming the streets. If we think the Jihadists in the Middle East were a threat to the world these right to lifers are worse. Pro-lifers have bombed and killed people in their quest to control others. Trump strikes again with the support of majority in the Supreme Court which has fallen from grace."
time to learn to swallow ladies
"It's great news to hear üëÇ that ROE V WADE is being over turned.
It's about time you stop the killing¬† of the innocent. 
I here a lot of women and girls say it's my body my choice yes that sounds just about right from a sinner who doesn't know the real truth about what they are doing. 
It was the Almighty God that gave you the opportunity to be born and to inter his world üåé but you can't see beyond your self-centered wicked heart ‚ô• üíî to show mercy to the unborned.
Woman has always wanted to choose what is not right for the family üòï it started in the garden of eden the great rebellion yes I know you don't believe it but it is true even if you die not believing any of it.It still will go on with are with out you. 

There are many women and girls who have chosen to do the right thing and show mercy to unborn.But there are still many spiritual blinded daughters of the Almighty God who have chosen rebellion your rewards will come faster than the wind and in that day you will call for mercy ü•∫ but because you have not chosen wisely there will not be any for you in your time of troubles.
ROE V WADE is a tool used by the devil to kill as many unborn as possible to stop the plans of the Almighty God but it have never worked. 
He the devil tried to stop the Almighty God in the days of old Egypt üá™üá¨ üò™ when the¬† Pharaoh's of Egypt was killing the first born of the children of Israel to stop the Almighty God's plans but it did not work. 
So if you are one of those who wants ü§î abortion you're working for the devil.Even if you do not believe ü§î this devil exist he the devil is working in you every time you decide to kill the unborned child.your murderer by the Almighty God standards"
"Y'all so pro-life but don't think about
the lives of the mothers. Or orphans.
Or foster children. Or the poor. Or the
abused kids whose parents didn't
want them. Y'all just care about the
fetuses you didn't help make, won't
raise, and won't think about once
they're born. Save it."
Ban Abortion Ban it ban it stop killing babies.
"I can't understand why women want to kill their tiny, helpless babies. Stop humping everything in sight and your problem might go away."
Um. All they said was this was a legislative issue. Not a judicial one
Same people screaming my body my choice had a different opinion when it came to the vaccines.. Feckin hypocrites.. Just use contraception.. Abortion is not birth control! It's that simple!
I had a coke bottle stuck in my rear and my father found a man who removed it in a dusty storefront take that sc.
"You notice these protesters (women mainly) are speaking in terms of themselves, and not defending the aborted lives. It's not about the aborted lives...it's about their decision making and no longer having the ability to clean up their reckless actions that led to legalized murder."
women rights what about babies rights
I have Boxes of coat hangers 18%off today.
"I mean, not killing people sounds pretty constitutional to me. Sound pretty unconstitutional to be able to choose to kill people."
"This is all Donald Trumps and that turtle Mitch McDonnell fault. Packing the court with these underwhelming and underqualified justices just to take away rights. Prolife and proguns & assault weapons, lack of universal health care for poor people all at the same time.  This law is going to significantly increase the amount of poor abuses children in foster care system for sure."
How did I guess left wing channel 4 would be against this ruling .... they are literally killing a baby. Its not right.
"@0:28 No, the purpose of the SCOTUS is not to protect civil liberties. That is a lie. The purpose of the SCOTUS is to determine what laws are and are not constitutional."
"Our country's people is too damn focused on other peoples lives instead of their own. live your own life worry about your own life. stop trying to run someone else's does my decisions affect your household NO. cause u don't know me.. you don't pay my bills, you don't raise my kids, I don't ask you for a handout or help. SO EVERYONE NEEDS TO MIND THEIR BUSINESS. STAY OUT OF A WOMANS DECISION!! Goverment trying to tell parents that if their child is trans it's abuse on what they decide for their child but when it comes to schools and education parents have the right to decide.. with covid it's your body to decide but abortion it's not your body.. STOP BEING HYPOCRITES"
"The sexual revolution has failed. It's failed everyone, men, women and children. We need a counter-revolution. A revolution of love, life, truth, peace, non-violence and hope."
"my body, my choice. really?
then why do you force everyone to get the covid vaccine?"
"Could we PLEASE stop saying this is about ""women's rights"" and ""women's bodies""! It's not! Men can get pregnant too!"
Protect yourselves at these protests. Proud boys and the like will be there to push some buttons. I trust the protesters will behaves. Not so much the other side. Don't despair. This is going to backfire on the court.  More republican woman are on Row Wade side and red states will turn blue for the next three elections. Our only issue now is the alt right will take by force what they can not win. We may need to arm/train ourselves or be run down.
Uneducated and the left media and the leftist states just dont want to do any reserch to find out the truth. It was never a constitunal right it was never backed by more Americans. More Americans do not want killing babies legal. Its simple just do some reserch. The media MUST stop lieing and dividing America more than it is...
"Take responsibility baby killers , women's rights to sleep around without consequences or contraception taken away . 
Cry me a salty river ...."
So happy!!
Why is a white man talking about abortion? It has nothing to do with him -so he needs to shut up!
My body my choice? Nah not really. The man should have a say since he is 50% why there is a baby in a woman‚Äôs womb! Also THE BABY HAS RIGHTS
Why is there a jewess ... blubbing on the thumbnail?  Does this affect that sect at all?
I am enjoying their pain so much. Hopefully we can take everything democrats value from them.
Why should YOUR religion decide what women do with THEIR bodies? This shouldn't even be up for debate. America is going backwards.
Abortion is not addressed in the Constitution therefore it falls in the category of states rights. Each state can decide their abortion laws independent of the heavy hand of the federal government deciding what are the rules and regulations
The right to choose is freedom.

Winner winner chicken dinner baby!!!üéäüéâüéà‚ú®Ô∏è Their tears fuel my powers.
Channel 4 is fake news
Look at all the indoctrinated idiots. Look at the guy comparing this to the Normandy landings. These people are delusional and without common sense. They've allowed themselves to be fooled by politics and religion.
An old-fashioned constitution that does not really care for equality and freedom sucks. I feel so sick. Incest and rape are no longer treated as something worse than a woman deciding about her life. Wtf is this country doing. Justices who were not elected by the people are now enforcing their will on said people ->women
How is abortions a woman‚Äôs right and child has not even the right to life
Watching these murderers cry brings so much joy!
There is no constitutional right to abortion.
"‚ÄòThere will be no functioning society without women‚Äô
So stop killing them in the wombs!"
Privatize abortion in all cases except for cases for rape and danger to mother‚Äôs health. Problem solved.
This is disturbing. Women crying that they may not be able to murder babies anymore in their state. Degenerate democrats.
What do you mean by woman?
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£I LOVE IT!!!!!
"It was never a constitutional right. It violates the constitution's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
Only the crazy women are pissed. The rest of us are good with the decision.
Democracy - 1 Roe Vs Wade - 0. üòÇ
"RELIGIOUS PEOPLE ARE RLLY SOMETHING ELSE, shoving their beliefs down our throats!"
Abortion is murder go throw a temper tantrum because you can't kill an innocent life .
Abortion was never in the constitution...
Great day for America! Go Supreme Court!
How dare people have accountability for their actions .
I‚Äôm pretty sure God wouldn‚Äôt be ok with killing a baby. Bible says he hand formed us in the womb. But he allows freedom which can sometimes suck like when it comes to killing a baby in the womb
travel to California.  Get your abortion and visit Disneyland before going home.
They go on about woman's right yet they don't give a toss about their rights when  allowing  biological men in their sports and locker room's
The face on that thumbnail is some bulletproof contraception.
6:44 that many women had enjoyed there you said thats why its gone because
Women taking away other women's rights fir self determination. Sad day in America!
These people don't realise if their parents had an abortion they wouldn't be here to protest
"This is disgusting & it is such a step backwards. I could understand the views of pro-life if they focused on the existing children that are suffering and need help. On top of this, many women have been abused,raped or subject to abusive relationships where the child would be at a detriment‚Ä¶ what about them? This negatively impacts poor women & the most marginalised women. This is not progressive at all. Sorry this is just ridiculous"
Abortion Lives fucking matter in the name of the 6 religions and blacks and whites.
This reporter is a pandering idiot.
you can see a massive split in America right now that country is prime to explode
Finally something good in America!
"THIS IS A A VERY WELCOME AND HUMANE DECISION!!!  THE MASS SLAUGHTER OF BABIES MUST STOP!!!
Roe v Wade was an EVIL, ANTI-HUMAN, PRO-NAZI, PRO-INFANTACIDE, PRO-GENOCIDE and SATANIC DECISION!!!
To See FEMIN-NAZI'S Crying in our Streets Because  The Courts have RESTRICTED THEIR RIGHT TO MURDER!!!  Is a Sickening Sight!!!  Their Monstrocity and Mendacity  Is Incredible!!!"
Abortion is not murder.  In most cases it is an act of mercy for the woman as lots of things can go wrong with contraception and mental illness.  All you are doing is making women go through pregnancies they do not want.  There will be suicides over this.  What about rape?
"Can we just sweep aside the overly emotive language about foetuses? A cluster of cells entirely dependent on the woman is not a human being. It is not a child. Gun violence is the number one killer of actual children in America, and the Trumpists are as we speak, still expanding gun rights. 

The U.S. is a country that, like Saudi and Pakistan, still practices the death penalty, mosty on poor, people of colour who could not afford decent legal representation. Hundreds of people who later turned out to be innocent, were tortured and killed. Trump oversaw more executions in his final days of office than any other president.

So please, don't pretend that America's protracted, violent display of religious fanatism resulting in this Supreme Court debacle is ""pro life."""
Thank God Men have gained basic human rights. Now they dont have to let the women dispose of their baby they also helped make.
Abortion was never a Constitutional right. Get a grip idiots.
What completely biased garbage reporting
"What a backwards nation America is, I could leave a Muller corner outside in the sun for half a day and it will materialise into a more civilised culture than the USA."
"The ONLY reason why this has happened is so the alphabet people can have more children to adopt 

Trust me the rich will still get abortion"
"You‚Äôd think the news would have a better understanding of Constitutional Law. Don‚Äôt you idiots have legal experts. Please point out the Amendment or something in the Bill of Rights, that guarantees the right to have an abortion. I‚Äôm for common sense abortion laws so why doesn‚Äôt congress pass one‚Ä¶"
"The woman are pissed - not all of them evidently, most notably those who don't believe you have the automatic right to kill another human being."
Back in her country where things aren‚Äôt so easy my mom had an illegal abortion that could‚Äôve cost her life. You guys are only stopping legal abortions and putting women in distress in great danger. But I guess life or death situations only matter when we‚Äôre talking about a little cluster of cells
Abortion is the contraception for slappers. Anyone with a brain would use a condom or birth control pill.

The women chanting for abortion have no chance of getting pregnant. They have natural contraceptive ingrained into their DNA called coyote ugly gene.
"Hey you retards ABORTION is Still Legal it just changed from Federal Control to State Control.
Stop the DISINFORMATION."
Literally hoes mad
Change is coming liberals need to suck it up and accept their own advice
"Ultimately this discussion is actually about unborn rights, not women's rights. Spoiler alert, in a free and fair society with equal protection under the law, there are no rights specific to women. Period. Especially not at the expense of other people's rights, in this case mens, and babies."
"Abortions are not women‚Äôs rights, and it‚Äôs also not a constitutional right."

"Use Condoms   How stupid are you people not, Women want the right to kill a child but the Unborn Child got no rights  Remember if your mother used her right to kill you before you were born, you would not be there to want your rights.  Wake up.  It is against the intention of the world."
What amendment in the constitution has anything to do with abortion? Its not a constitutional right
"00:32 ""the supreme court whos very purpose is to protect civil liberties, took away the constitutional right to get an abortion"" it was never a constitutional right! that's what this WHOLE thing was about! If it was then it would have gone the complete opposite way"

Its not a constitutional right for abortion read the constitution

Does she really believe that what was holding America back from universal healthcare, higher minimum wages, statutory sick pay or paid family leave was abortion?
In what universe does the Republican-dominated pro-life movement now go ahead and pass those laws? They co-opted abortion rights because it was an emotional issue. It‚Äôs way easier to stand up for the rights of an unborn baby, they can‚Äôt demand anything from you. Actually doing something for living, breathing woman is not on their agenda."

"The news commentator should go do her homework. There is no constitutional right to abortion. If it was, it would have been upheld in the supreme court!

"Well all seems to be going well...gun laws, race, abortion. Thank god we have politicians that look to implement laws and rights that make a better society rather than popularist, career promoting policies."
Taking away the liberty to kill unborn children. A very good thing. The report is very biased in favour of abortion in the way it was worded.
"You know, and I think that I can speak for everyone, including the Worthless Cowardly Democrats, Women no longer have the ability to Kill a Baby.  If the  Freeloading Deadbeat Cowards need someone to blame keep the past Virginia Governor Ralph ""Blackface"" Northam on the top of your list.  He fueled the Anti Abortion movement when he allowed Virginian's to abort a BABY up to 20 minutes after birth as part of a sensible birth control plan.  A Racist Fool !  When you look up the word Backfire in the dictionary you will see a photo of Ralph Blackface."
Ooo America what a backward and dystopian shithole you're slowly becoming...shame to watch this
"phenomenal news

millions of children won't be murdered with impunity

hoping it doesn't stay here and it continues into a full federal ban on murdering unborn babies"
Roe vs wade would've been left untouched if the Democrats have not started demanding the right to abort babies up till the moment of birth and to kill them after
"Breaking news:  To counteract the loss of great numbers of children shot and killed in high school, the US has banned abortion in the hope this action maintains a sufficient prison workforce."
"Whilst the World takes two steps forward, America takes three steps back."
The rights of women but trans in women sports haha the left is full of it!
I truly can‚Äôt believe people scream and cry for the right to kill unborn children!? The west truly has lost it.
It was never a constitutional right! That is incorrect.
Ladies - all this means is that you're going to have to actually get to know a guy before you let him bust in you.
"5:36 delay , question not answered"
"Have you heard the saying ""keep it in your pants""?"

a load of bible bashing hypocrites forcing their views and will on American women!
The same bible bashers who conveniently overlook the ""Thou Shalt Not Kill""
commandment when it comes to the Death Penalty 
SHAME ON EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM!"
Could America become anymore shitty  than it already is?? Shootings every week and now abortion is abolished
How popular is RBG now? She should have retired earlier but these justices are so selfish.
Ladies dealing with male entitlement in the dating world now have a very good reason to tell him to keep it in his pants and treat you with respect.
Can we just take a moment to think of the people who are going to have to consider the attributes of a potential sexual partner as a mother or father and life long partner before barebacking with them? That's the real issue here.

I am fucking 16 years old and having to fight for my rights so if anything happens to me, I'm okay. At this point I rather get my tubes tied and not give birth at all in life"
"""unborn child-killing"" - jeezzz"
It‚Äôs amazing to me that people are mad that they can‚Äôt kill kids anymore! Imagine that .. mad because they can‚Äôt murder their own kids. Pure evil
Praise the Lord.

"If it's your body and your choice, and your choice was to get pregnant, why would you want to get rid of it?"
Abortion it should be illegal.In some cases should be legal.
Oh no! Think of how many children won't die! Oh the inhumanity! Would someone think about a woman's ability to casually kill!
UK AND USA ARE ABOMINABLE NATIONS!!!! DO NOT TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST (VACCINE) JESUS IS COMING SOON!!! REAL REAL TALK
50 years of killing babies was enough!

"Women know they rely on relationships for men for their survival.  It takes allot of character to parent.  With fewer countermeasures in those relationships to paternity, the demand for women to improve their character is going to increase.  It's not easy for a person with a poor character to hear a demand they improve."
Its not a constitutional right. show me in the constitution where it says abortion is a right?
what are these protesters mad about? they can still kill their babies in over half the country. how about abstinence? just using it for birth control is barbaric.
Abortion is murder..
"Maga King... life wins. Salty Army we are legion. Birth control, cross your legs."
What at the root of all this - does it stem from fundamentalist Christians?
Arms heads feet ripped out this is GENOCIDE!

"Thus is just the beginning...
https://youtu.be/iJcS44CzfuM"
">>""A constitutional right that has been in place for half a century.""
Quite untrue. The whole point of the ruling is that abortion is _not_ a constitutional right - that is, it is not a right that is guaranteed in the constitution - and in consequence Roe v Wade was wrong in (constitutional) law to hold otherwise.
All the ruling says is that the US constitution, which of course does not mention ""abortion"" and says nothing about it explicitly, likewise does not say anything about it implicitly either, and so in consequence abortion law is a matter for the democratically elected legislatures of the individual states to decide.
As such, it is a victory for democracy. It is not for unelected judges to be imposing laws on US citizens. That is the role of elected politicians.
The US left, which has done nothing but bleat about ""democracy"" these past 18 months, is exposed as hypocritical in the extreme. As soon as democracy (anywhere in the world for that matter) yields a result it doesn't like, it starts rioting - or worse."
interesting that Republicans want to protect unborn babies which they're happy to have die while attending school through mass shootings....
A country where a woman can't make her own mind up and have an abortion and the same country that allows a minor to buy a gun! really need to think again! USA home of the brave land of the stupid. The supreme court is dictating to the electorate.
Glad to see that season 5 of handmaid‚Äôs tale has been released
President Biden has the lowest approval rate of any president by the way...
Pro-life women always look beautiful and peaceful. I'm not here to talk about the baby killers with their coloured hair.
"Do you know that the majority of women didn't want the vote, because it would make them eligible for the draft... But Men voted to let them vote against their will because it was what was right... Just cuz the majority wants something doesnt make it right..."
"Trump did his damage. Back to the Middle Ages. Actually back to the Dark Ages. Keep women in chains. Let women be ruled, instead of being equal. Now women will be unable to run their own lives, make their own decisions, and be in control of their own bodies."
Ummm. That's not what the supreme court does. It interprets laws. It only upholds civil rights insofar as the laws and constitution do
Im happy it doesnt go their way ... they have to use condoms now ü§£üëäüèΩ .. if they think babies are  worse than HiV they should use condoms or prevention pills üíä ... even their famous tantra technics can help them
"What funny is, is that if you asked one of these leftist protestors - who are fighting for womens rights- what a woman is, they would probably be unable to answer‚Ä¶and also if you are that against having children there are many medical ways not to have one"
"Something to think about. Don't abortion clinics and Guns do the same thing? How can we complaining and get all butt hurt when a school shooting like Sand Hook and Texas KILLS OUR LITTLE FUTURE, THEN WE THEN WE GO TO PIECES WHEN THE COURTS STRIKE DOWN A PLAN THAT GOES IN AND KILLS OUR KIDS? ARE GUNS AND CLINICS NOT THE SAME THING?"
Oh no I might have to be careful and responsible with my own body üò≠üòÇ
Imagine if all those protesters were aborted by their mothers.
Abortion is wrong! Case closed!
This is a failure of successive generations of education in America. I see it happening in the UK too.
1:10 I am terrified......Then 5 seconds later showing a video of her acting like an aggressive chav....
I really don't get it. How do you dehumanise a fully formed person with experiences and thoughts but humanise a foetus?
Garbage. Inaccurate. Partisan propaganda. I don't know what else I expected from the comrades over at Channel 4
After 50 years now America has a conscious. They don't care about fetuses. Why now? What could it be?
"Hot girl summer cancelled!! Haha. Seriously, might make people more conscious of who they lay with."
"Abortion is not now, or ever has been a Constitutional right, so STOP saying it is!"
"DJT deliberately appointed three conservative justices? Seriously? He was the president and it was his constitutional duty to appoint conservative, constitutional justices, not liberal justices."
Finally the constitution being upheld. Next is the unconstitutional gun laws on the books. Give us back the rights our forefathers fought for.
Build foster homes rn
This worries me because the rest of the western leaders looks up to America . It might be a possibility that other countries will try and follow America‚Äôs lead. I‚Äôm pro life and pro choice .I think woman should have a choice but I think killing the child is bad but it‚Äôs not my business what other women choose to do. If American governments focused on preventing rape and incest and bridge the gap from wealthy to poor and make contraception easily available then abortions rate will fall without having to make it illegal. Its all linked
"Americans are deeply divided over values such as gun control, abortion rights, LGBT rights, health care and other social and political issues... Sometimes it seems this is not a real nation, just people with different cultural, racial, religious backgrounds. California and NYC share much more values with Europe than with Alabama or Oklahoma."
I actually agree with the decision. Life over Death
Never seen women cry so much for the right to kill babies
Women's rights are being taken back 100 years women need to.mobilise but last night in Arizona police threw tear gas at protestors the US is becoming a right wing fundamentalist fascist regime thank you Trump
"Well done America, more kids to shoot !"
"The thing is women having the right to control their uterus wasn't the thing stopping people passing any sort of utopian laws making society a safe and well supported place  to choose to have and raise children. 
Nor does removing women's right make them any closer ( unless you think it'll galvinise women to kick out and lock up the greedy, corrupt misogynists who would rather remove rights from women than give them.)
If you want to pass free quality pregancy and birth care for all, affordable housing garaunteed, full child support payments covering all costs till gratution. Compulsory reversable (with a partners consent) vasectomies for all men. Equal pay for women etc. Then get those laws passed. Then indeed many of the valid reasons for choosing abortion will no longer be an issue."
"don't worry libtards, you'll still be able to kill your baby in a blue state, this just removes the law at the federal level... 

actually it should never have been a law in the first place, federal law must be legislated, not dreamed up by justices."
"""You must have that baby, and when you do, you're on your own. Oh.......and we'll help more sickos get assault weapons to massacre it in school in afew years time""

Lol. At least theyre solving the migration crisis too. What sane person would want to live in this place."
"So America happily takes away the right to a safe abortion, but doesn‚Äôt bother to ensure that children can go to school without fearing that they‚Äôll be shot into a million pieces? Am I missing something here?"
"These are the people that were demanding mandates for vaccines, how ironic. 65,000,000 babies killed since 1973."
I hate the people cheering for the elimination of abortion (especially the woman who are cheering) because they won't be cheering if there right or laws that effect tme become REVOKED. IS AMERICA JUST GOING TO BECOME A HANDSMAID TALE
"This is taking the choice away FROM WOMAN, jesus shouldn't make that decision it should be the woman herself"
The United States moves closer to merging with the Taliban every day
"Indian Constitution gave women right to choose since 1970.Indian Supreme court and Indian Government have raised the ceiling of abortions from 20 weeks to 24 weeks.Indian Judiciary and Government is working towards safer abortions,family planning and women healthcare.Ironically Western countries still feel the need to lecture India and South Asian countries on Liberalism and Human Rights."
"Cost to have a baby in US: $10,800 (provided no aftercare is needed). 

All this does is put people into poverty. And the kids you have forced them to have. 

Well done, idiots."
libtards are angry they can't murder their baby.
but what is a woman?
Pass a law making it illegal not to wear a condom see how the men like that
"LOL, sorry guys, you can't murder your baby anymore."
Give choice to women.
A woman has the right of ownership over her own body
"No woman may be allowed to kill. Exceptions are obviously acceptable  in case of rapes or serious health problems. Nevertheless, every human being must be respected while, on the other hand, pussies may never be faced as a ""green card"" to murder innocent human beings because responsibility inheres to women's liberty."
Live from Austin Texas tells you all you need to know from Jose.
"This people kill each other, they are extremely discriminating poor people that end up on bad shape on life in bad conditions. Those people that hate so much immigrants and love conservative hypocritical ideas. Are the people that is trying to obligates people to carry pregnancy not desired.

Those things are outrageous..."
And just like that libtards can all of a sudden define what a women is...until the subject changes
Aaah forcing women to bare children they have no support for. Very cool America.
Pro life woman did well to stay calm and logical when she was clearly the one under attack

Hope that his same will happening in my country üá´üáÆüá´üáÆüá´üáÆüòä This is miracle from Heaven! Thank You Trump also.
"Abortion has killed more people than all the wars in history combined together from the time of ancient Egypt to today. 
If abortion was registered as a cause of death it would top the charts above everything every year.
At this point in many countries it's an issue of maintaining population numbers without having to resort to mass immigration to compensate for it. Most countries can't replace dwindling population numbers with immigrants."
Crazy when you see these girls annoyed when all they need to do was keep there legs shut
Same liberal morons can't even define what a women is.

good
A fight for the unborn accomplished.
So now its a state issue and not federal.
Land of the free ey
Time to put them legs together pReeeeeeeeeeee reeee
"They haven't made abortions illegal... dumb fucks. States get to decide their own laws, its not federally mandated. 
The overturning of roe v wade does not mean no one can get abortion in the US. The media are just making out that it is for clicks and rile people up. As usual"
Well....this is going to end well
This thing is the best thing to do so it will go back to state and the people in it to decide so if you like democracy you should be happy today

"The republicans are going to push very hard to make abortion illegal nationwide. 
Where do they stop?"
I‚Äôm vegan. We have people kill baby animals behind closed doors. I find this obviously hypocritical. And lacking self awareness. Because ultimately we are a very selfish species.
All news on planet Earth is stupid all the time
"the leftist screams in despair as their ""right"" to murder unborn infants is threatened."
OLD WHITE BABY BOOMERS STILL THINKING THEY CONTROL THE LEGAL KILLING OF BABIES
Make it a crime to kill a baby!!!!!! Bingo!!!!!
"SCOTUS isn't beholden to public opinion, they are beholden to the Constitution. Polls don't decide the constitutionality of a given case, only the Constitution and legal precedent."
"Killing babies is a lazy contraceptive
For the guiltless."
This is what they don't think about more  Homeless  more abuses kids that are not wanted the state  We'll have to open welfare offices   for sure... There's no opportunity for a lot of these kids that are being forced to come live in life without even able to have a home... Most of them will have drug addict mother... Will the state better have a nice bill for them They have to pay them once a month.
"Americans will regret this decision. It's idiotic and the only reason people want it is just because the Republicans want it not because they are ""pro-life"". Well, it's a sh*t show and we outside are enjoying it."
No greater evil than abortion.
its actually kind of easy to not get pregnant.

wtf is that thumbnail rofl
the ho's are mad they can't get a monthly abortion anymore ü§£ü§£ü§£
This is a godsend for the Biden regime  this is their only redeeming feature

Women shout my body my choice what about the babys body babys choice to want to live.
I celebrate this with the pro- lifers"
The fetus is the hostage of the mother. It depends on the mother's choice whether to save or kill.
Abortion should be available but not easy to do
You gone keep my dam babyüéÅ ü¶¶üëÄüòÇüòÇüòÇ
A clear lie. Most women in the US fo not support abortion
"If Republicans were doing this, over any issue, Democrats would call it an insurrection."
"In my opinion, in this day and more enlightened age, commonplace abortion should not be necessary, except in special circumstances of rape and confirmed extreme deformity, where the mother decides that she cannot continue to carry the baby. Abortion for social reasons, or for convenience, disposes of a life (that of the unborn baby) in the most casual, cruel and dismissive way. We cannot justify spending millions saving a premature baby who‚Äôs wanted, while placing a premature baby, who‚Äôs not wanted, in an incinerator. We can‚Äôt offer bereavement support to parents who have lost a baby through stillbirth, while turning a blind eye to the traumatic extraction of a developing little human. Education is the key, so that men and women engage in considerate sexual intercourse, respecting each other and being mindful of the possibility of creating a new life. This new life must not be dismissed because it is too tiny to defend itself against annihilation. This is my opinion"
"So to confirm, a tiny percentage of abortions are due to medical reasons.

We need to protect life, that‚Äôs the unborn. If you care about lives of women. Then you should be anti abortion, for more women die then will die in childbirth"
The anchors sound just as stupid as the protesters. There never has been a ‚Äúconstitutional right‚Äù to abortions.
Bimbos Lies Matter
Thank you Lucifer
Well... this is how fascism enters America. Just wait and see what other rights they are gonna take away next.
Babies lives matter get over it
I think women should have free will to do what they want and what they do not with their life. If they get and abortion that is their business. We don‚Äôt need laws put up just because of peoples opinions.
Why tf are women fighting so hard to kill a baby? You hose cry over a dying dog but kill a baby.
"How embarrassing! The passage of this law is part of the war of religions against each other. They pass a law to protect the fetus. Women are seen as a bag in which future soldiers should grow. But, in the case of the hundreds of thousands of children who fall victim to violence and war every year, children who go to war by force, children who work on the streets, children who are trafficked for sexual purposes and organs, and dozens Another catastrophe, The legislators and men of God are dumb and blind. Sorry! I forgot! Children victims of sexual harassment in the church. More than 300,000 victims a year, in France alone. Church leaders may need more children to meet their sexual needs. Maybe ‚ÄúHandmade‚Äôs tale‚Äù has already started."
‚ÄúMy body my choice‚Äù huh??? they weren‚Äôt as inspired with such statement when we were talking about covid vaccine üòÇ what a circus ü§°
"I was adopted at the age of two weeks. I could have been aborted. Perhaps the pro-abortion harridans might care to explain to me why the life I now have should have been dependent on the whim, agency, and convenience of the woman in whose womb I was conceived."
"You pro life hipocrites make me sick.. You care so much about a fetus that isn't even human but don't give too shits about the women and her choices.. I thought you idiots care about all lives.. So what about the women's lives.. The facist, UNAMERICAN, traitor low life piece of trash supreme court makes me sick.. They should All be ashamed of themselves.. I hop karma gets them and all you facist selfish scum who support this.. We as a democracy is over.. Good job scumbags..."
makes me so sad to see young women being anti choice
Woman think killing a baby is part of womens rights?
Two wins for the right in a week. Thank you President Trump! The rule of the left is coming to an end!!
"The interviewer is a fool.she cares about the women..who goes to be to have fun .and wants to violate the right if an innocent being who never called.

Wow. What a primitive country USA is. Im so glad i dont live there.
Wow people you're angry that you're not allowed to murder children... And then you still think you're good people
"A lot of corporations have said that they will help a woman get an out of state abortion if necessary, which is great. However, if that isn't an invasion of privacy, I don't know what is."
Pro choice are not pro women but pro destruction and chaos.
Good.
"I was in college 50 years ago when Roe V Wade was decided by the Supreme  Court. There is one HUGE difference between then and now that I have observed. Now BOTH sides are speaking up. There were a lot of people against abortion outside the Supreme Court today and supporting the decision. I noticed many of them were women. And there was a large crowd supporting abortion too. The HUGE difference is 50 years ago I never heard one single anti abortion woman dare to speak up. In fact on my college campus or anywhere else did I ever see ANY anti abortion people speaking up. They existed back then but because they were such a tiny fraction of the population they kept quiet. Back then the pro abortion women were a lot more militant and violent than now. They would have attacked and probably killed any woman who was vocal on my campus who spoke up against abortion. Those against abortion back then actually feared for their lives. I knew a girl in my college who was a very religious Christian and very against abortion. I asked her why she didn‚Äôt protest the Roe V Wade decision. She told me, ‚ÄúAre you nuts, if I protested the decision I would be killed by some crazy pro abortion woman.‚Äù Back 50 years ago anyone who was anti abortion did not dare speak up or they would have been killed by crazy nuts pro abortion women. Times have changed and the anti abortion people are vocal now and don‚Äôt keep quiet in fear of their lives."
Thank you TRUMP!!!
Thank you God üôè
Why is Biden giving Trump credit for this? Doesn‚Äôt Biden know that is what Trump wants? üôÑ
This just in: ugly fat women that no one wants to have a kid with are outraged that baby killing is no longer allowed
Beware Britain‚Ä¶..We have a Govt. that openly attacks our independent judiciary and is full of Catholics !
God's will is done. Let the people of the states decide on it. Not the federal level. There's a reason the US is called a Constitutional Republic.
"We are going back into the dark Ages. Women's rights are getting taken away. This is so terrifying and so messed up! And they say there's freedom in America, that's total bullshit!!"
This is a democracy though lol. What a joke America is.
We care about liberties so much that we impose you to have your baby. We just don't care  what will happen to you and him after those 9 months.
"Why is not upto someone what they do with there body, why is it even a question? The states got no right to tell you what to do."
June 24 will always be remembered as the day the unborn got their civil rights. Sexually Irresponsible degenerates will no longer use the law to legally murder the unborn.

What about the baby's choice?  Save the babies!
"Yeah, rally the left right before the midterms. What a joke. Our entire political system is corrupt, our politicians do not care about us or our views. They are bought by the highest bidder, and legislate with bills that are literally written by their lobbyists.

"As a pregnant man, I find this attack on men‚Äôs rights very disturbing"
Women might finally have to take responsibility for their actions for a change. Good news. If women want to be promiscuous and sleep around they will have to ensure they use effective contraceptives - quite simple really.  But hang on a minute  - what is a woman?

Two things a women can do if they don't want a baby one get fixed two take out your urtus. Yes a women should have a right but if the problem is you don't want kids well just think because stress is just going to make you lose your mind.
"Why the dramatic over reaction? It hasn‚Äôt been completely banned, it‚Äôs simply been moved to individual states to decide. So if you‚Äôre in Texas you wouldn‚Äôt have liberal beliefs forced on you, and if you a liberal living in California they still give you the right to murder your unborn child."
Why isn't there ever any attractive females at abortion rallies! ü§î
Wonder how they would feel if they got raped and pregnant. Truly a tragic day in America. That's what happens when you let religion deside human rights.

"This is disinformation, you don't understand Constitutional law. It's called ""democracy "" and the Supreme Court is following the law. You're welcome."
Women's rights have not been overturned.
No rights were overturned at all.  Man these crazy politicians and the media outlets they own need to STOP with the hate and divisiveness just to win elections.      :-/
"The supreme court if doing very little for kid dying of guns viloence at schools, but they go in do this. Do they realize we are those ones growing up in this generation, not them."

Terrissa is a blooming idiot.
Isnt it wonderful that this barbaric awful law is now gone forever. Now females will need to face their responsibility for promiscuous behaviour head on. No more baby murder for convenience. Thank you Donald Trump for setting this up. Wonderful
"WELL DONE SCOTUS!!!
MAKE ABORTION ILLEGAL AGAIN
MAKE MAN AND WOMAN RESPONSIBLE AGAIN!!!
ABORTION SHOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED IF MOTHERS LIFE IS AT RISK AND IN CASE OF RAPE!!"
Sluts should keep their legs closed. These rats will get what they deserve.
"I thought unelected officials without term limits governing over masses without representation was tyranny. Now these unelected officials (Supreme Court) give power to legislate abortion laws to the states, to elected officials who represent people, and suddenly all of these so called ‚Äúdemocrats‚Äù are against it. People have the right to self determination. The right to self governance. If you don‚Äôt like the laws, vote, don‚Äôt support tyranny as long as it‚Äôs tyranny in favor of your political beliefs."

It was never a Constitutional right!
"Republicans/Conservatives/Pro-Lifers/Deplorables/Evil-Folks (acc to MSM) are the ones taking care of these unwanted children. They are mostly the ones donating, volunteering, and to be frank, are also the ones who are mostly burdened by the taxes (and it is not even close). I used to be Pro Choice but it went from a just cause to downright insane genocide preventing folks to be fully responsible with their decisions/actions. It used to be mothers in stable marriages who are having problems supporting their large families. The occasional health prone and victims of crime (which won't even crack the thousands). Nowadays, it is mostly HS and college students. More than 50 million babies killed every year (and this is just a super mild estimate because the actual numbers are not reported because it will definitely paint a dystopian-like and/or very grim picture). It is crazy that FOR SO LOOOONG, we allowed millions and millions of babies to be flushed down the toilet, burned, and left to rot in the ground/sewers ready for the rats and worms to eat. There should be limits to all these madness."
You guys can't fix the gun laws. But can take away woman rights ?
"Wow, genuinely shocked by this. What a sad day for Americans. I can't even imagine the negative consequences that will arise from this."
"This makes me sick. I'm am only fourteen I don't know what could happen to me in the future. what if a baby is forced upon me, and I'm am forced to give birth to a child that I didn't want. I hate this generation, it sucks. I get abortions can be sad, because your getting rid of a baby. But ur taking away a woman right. Some people make me sick to my stomach, this Is not the world I wanted to grow up in."
America regardless was made through murder rape & slavery‚Ä¶.you reap what you sow‚Ä¶ the crows have come home to roost.
Noooooo! Don‚Äôt you guys how many more black and brown kids will be brought into the world now? The glorious White Race will soon become extinct if the lesser races can‚Äôt quell their own numbers!

Why not sterilise the inferior and economically worthless working class men? That would eliminate the need for abortions.
"Erectile dysfunction is God telling men they have no right to have children.

Men who don't earn enough to raise a child should be forcefully sterilised.

Sterilising men would make abortion unnecessary."
"Bravo to those God fearing SCOTUS Judges. Abortion is forbidden in Christianity, Thank you to SCOTUS judges for standing up to those baby killers."

all because people dont wanna wear condoms america goes into a riot as if they live in China
"I have a serious question. If a mother is carrying a baby. But through testing they find out the baby has brain defects. Is a mother allowed to get an abortion because of that, eventhough this law passed?"

"Some really disingenuous and blatantly false reporting going on here.  The purpose of the Supreme Court is to interpret the constitution, not protect civil liberties.  Second, abortion was never a constitutional right as you put it, you will not find it mentioned at all."
"Every child in America should be armed with an AR15 so they can protect themselves.

But US Conservatives oppose arming children because they are hypocritical elitists."

THE SUPREME COURT MADE THE RIGHT DECISION IT'S NOT THE WOMEN'S CHOICE ITS JUST PLAIN MURDER BABIES HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE
"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. And unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD. 2Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even made cast images of the Baals.

3Moreover, Ahaz burned incense in the Valley of Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. 2nd Chronicles 28"
your modern western whorish women that want to keep their whorish lifestyles and make babies and have convenient ways to get rid of them instead of being responsible and taking care of their babies
"I am a Christian woman and NOT an advocate for abortion. But, I do believe that there should be some instances where it is allowed. For example, children getting pregnant as a result of sexual abuse, rape, if a pregnancy is too dangerous for someone to continue with- in which case you would need medical clearnace, and so on. But, I will not agree with women using abortion to get rid of a child just because it doesn't fit into her life. That part is a no for me."
"This is not talking  away any freedoms , its giving a little fragile baby a chance at life. Why is that so difficult to understand. Dont sleep around folks"
"Haha ha 63,000,000 dead babies.  Shame on you."

Abortion was never protected in the Constitution. Roe v Wade in 1973 was the incorrect ruling.

Abortion is relegated down to the States where women can still organize and vote in pro-choice candidates"

"It's sadistic to for force a baby to be born to a childhood of abuse. The amount of parents who are addicts, alcoholics and druggies, trying to makes money for their drugs by prostituting their own baby out to pedophiles.

Are going going to personally raise that baby?? And NO, it's not Gods will for a baby to be shared around be the local pedophiles!!!!!!!!!"
So democratic that a tiny group of unelected officials have rhe power to strip freedom from millions of Americans

i'm 14 and i know a lot about life and abotion is wrong babys don't need to die smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"here are some reasons a woman would want to get an abortion.
1. Health. In some cases if a woman gives birth, she can die to due health issues.

2. Money and expenses. Not everyone is in the middle/upper middle class. Baby supplies are very expensive. Diapers, clothes, formula, medicine, even the hospital stay. Not everyone can support both themselves and their child.

3. They just don‚Äôt want to. Not everyone is fit to be a parent. And when someone who isn‚Äôt fit for parenting becomes a parent, that can just lead to problems with the child. They may be neglected.

Now, you may be saying, ‚Äúwell you can just put the child for adoption.‚Äù The foster care system is extremely flawed. More than 70-80% of the children in the system either don‚Äôt get adopted or never find a permanent home. And by the time they turn 18, they can no longer be supported. In California alone, there are 60,000 children in the system right now.

4. Rape and trauma. If a woman gets raped, and is impregnated by their rapist, it would just be extremely traumatizing. Rape alone is traumatizing enough but if someone gives birth to that child then It would be even worse. Child birth and Motherhood should be an amazing moment, life being created from a loving relationship. But when a baby is born from something so horrible, the child can be a reminder of that traumatizing experience.

Would you force a woman to give birth even if it costs her life? Would you force a woman to give birth even though they wouldn‚Äôt be able to provide for the child? Would you force a woman to give birth even if that child was the result of rape? Would you force a woman to give birth then put the baby in a flawed system? 

Abortion isn‚Äôt about killing babies for funsies."
Freaking liars. Half the population is against it and you know it.
"YOU CANT EVEN DEFINE WHAT A WOMAN IS !!!
Now you are complaining about women‚Äôs rights !"
"how fucking dare you take my city's name in your disgusting creed. berlin is, was, and always will be a city fighting for freedom and in flux in moments of oppression. but we know what's what. and taking away a human's right to make decisions about their own body and their future opportunities has NOTHING to do with that. berlin spits on you, sir. and this decision. pthh. wtf, united states. in case you didn't know, your country is OVER. O+V+E+R. you are no longer the ""leaders of the free world"". you're not even close. and hopefully never will be again."

This does not end abortion you morons! It goes to the individual states to vote on.
"There‚Äôs nothing in the constitution for abortion, SCOTHUS acted properly. And with so many screamers complaining about woman‚Äôs rights, where are the rights of the unborn child?"
Thank you Jesus.
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe."
"Blah blah, you know Roe v Wade states that that an Abortion needs to be done before ‚ÄúViable Life.‚Äù  For example, California that is now 24 weeks. That Bill the Evil, Servants of Satan, the Democrats voted for in the House and Senate would have allowed Abortion up to the moment of Birth.  Disgusting, Evil people!"
Rights? You mean right to murder babies?
We can‚Äôt kill our kids now!? Dang‚Ä¶ smh lol
"There‚Äôs a few different aspects of this that deeply disturbs me, there are others which I‚Äôm happy to discuss, but the one aspect that does chill me is how we can take away freedoms of what women can do with their own bodies. The other aspect I find deeply disturbing is that 61% of women in the US agree with abortion. Thus the dismantling of Roe v Wade isn‚Äôt just eliminating freedom of choice for the individual but also undemocratic. 
Choose to have an abortion or don‚Äôt it‚Äôs not my choice and shouldn‚Äôt be anyone else is choice other than that individual."
Why do all of you pro-death people look like cows with purple hair. I doubt you'll ever have the need for an abortion.
"The United States Supreme Court does not write the laws, it only interprets the constitution.  Nowhere in the Constitution is abortion mentioned as ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs‚Äù rights. It is guaranteed in the Constitution that everyone has the Right To Life (Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness).  That means ALL LIFE!!!"

"What is everybody fighting about, you're letting the babies grow up to join gangs anyway so both sides win, and everybody should be happy.                    ................GRIM"
"The Roman Catholic Church has consistently condemned abortion ‚Äî the direct and purposeful taking of the life of the unborn child. In principle, Catholic Christians believe that all life is sacred from conception until natural death, and the taking of innocent human life, whether born or unborn, is morally wrong. The Church teaches, ""Human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the creative action of God and it remains for ever in a special relationship with the Creator, who is its sole end. God alone is the Lord of life from its beginning until its end: no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being"" (""Donum vitae,"" 5)."

Always entertaining to see libs cry!
"God this is obnoxious reporting. In Mississippi it is legal to have an abortion up to 15 weeks (although this may be banned now), but in other states like Florida it is 12 weeks. In France it is 14 weeks, in Portugal it is 10 weeks, in Germany it is illegal but still allowed with a loophole until 12 weeks."
Reeeeee
"No one actually understands what this decision is. It is an excellent legal decision.

The whole point is that the SCOTUS is NOT a political institution: Roe v Wade gave people a right that was not legislated. If you want a law, such as ""legalized abortion"" then the proper path is to ask you law maker to pass a law, that involves due process.

Roe v Wade had no due process and yet it performed the function of law making.

the decision simply deemed it improper and ask that if the public wants that right, go and ask your law maker to do it, because the function of SCOTUS is to interpret the law and not making them.

And here are people throwing a big tantrum simply because they heard some people saying they ""overturned the abortion right"" when it is nowhere near that case.

If you want abortion, vote for it, don't ask judges to do a politicians work."
"I find it very difficult to side with a healthy adult women, who has the choice, the power and agency. The unborn has zero choice, has no power, no agency and is totally at the mercy of its mother.."
"it's not your body
 it's a child inside
your womb...  that body is not yours you don't have the right to murder that tender voiceless helpless child!"
Killing someone was never constitutional.
"BIG VICTORY! The baby murderers have been stopped!! Every life is sacred and shall be protected, love prevails!! Praise the Lord!"
Oh well
About time we stop the baby killers
"Between 2010 and 2019 625,346 abortions happened yet 400 children have been killed in school shootings.... I don't see the level of outrage for 1,570 times more children dying in abortion clinics than schools."
These are the same people that say our democracy is in peril. The Supreme Court is our democracy in action and now they don‚Äôt like it?
That‚Äôs good stop abortion. That‚Äôs murder !!! Wake up. It‚Äôs your body but the baby is not your body that‚Äôs a separate body you have no right to kill it !!!!
In Colorado you can kill your child at 9 months!  You might as well give birth and  strangle your child to death!!
SHUT UP Poopy Pants!!!
Maybe these Vaginas should consider Contraceptives?
Yay trump 2024!!!!
Abortion is not a Constitutional Right!!!
"Your body, your choice ... YOUR RESPONSABILITY."
"Women don‚Äôt have the constitutional right to kill their children, time to have some responsibility folks !"
It is time to save life because some of the best people we've ever had in the United States from rape even though rape is wrong and it should never happen don't murder the baby don't murder the mother go after the rapist
When the judge got smart and said well I'm just going to give you choice just like God did you got the choice to be right or you got the choice to kill and you don't have to have a baby to kill birth control is murder each one of us were predestined aided by God read your King James Bible look up this verse he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him
Women rights arnt being stripped away!!!!just the baby rights is being heard.!! Cowards cant see that!! It‚Äôs crazy to see elder woman think it‚Äôs okay to take a child‚Äôs life!!! It‚Äôs just crazy to see
At 2:31 That woman is speaking what I‚Äôm feeling. This goes beyond abortion this is about women‚Äôs rights.
This will be so fun to visit in a year. This is nothing more than fear mongering. Abortions will still be legal in over 90% of all states
God said they'll shall not kill that he wasn't the god of the dead but he was the god of the living that all babies are a miracle from Heaven no matter if it was rape or not
Praise God for Donald Trump and the SCOTUS!
choose what????????? say it!!! choose to kill babies?????
"The scumbags in the media twisting these diluted minds by saying abortion is a constitutional right which it isn't,  they can still murder babies in states that allow it ,this more reason to bring God back in school."
channel 4 news promotes baby killing
the nonsense from this news anchors is incredible. Nobody should have the right to kill babies.
Don't be a Cry Baby. ( Pun intended )
"It's so funny her saying we will not dismember children, em how many kids are dead this year alone due to ur precious guns."
"the baby is not your body, therefore not your choice!!!"
Lol!! More tears than when Trump won!!
"Almost everyone is talking about the right of the woman to terminate her unborn child ""its her body"" and this is the most absurd thing when the child she has managed to conceive deserves  the right to live. If you have ever entered abortion room, and have seen the deadly equipments used to end an innocent life you'll shiver if you have a heart. Abortion is murder."
If you agree with this. I hope you get pregnant against your will. Idc.
This is garbage. There was not Constitutional Right to abortion! This news is deceiving or misleading at best!!
We can barely educate the children we do have
killing babies is not a woman's right. today is a good day!!!
I‚Äôm pro life so is god! Why do u think he has given us everlasting life as a free gift? (U must accept it) Because our god is pro life!!
"Oh no ! No more killing babies !
Monkey pox infecting the gays !
Guns are legal ! Thank you Jesus !!!!"
"You pushed it too far you wanted to still kill after  birth 
That's when things went south for you baby killers

 finally common sense is being used 
Liberal tears are like sweet tea 
I can't wait to see a river of tears when we start to abort the women with 3 abortions 
3 strikes your aborted useless to society"
Serious question for pro-choicers- How do you feel about fetal homicide laws?
Why is everyone talking about women again? Where have all the pregnant men gone?
That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm joining the Cascadian Independence movement. Washington and Oregon be like: f*ck this sh*t I‚Äôm out!
Most of those women have zero danger of ever getting pregnant.
Placards do nothing. Molotovs through their windows create change.
THIS ANCHORWOMAN IS A C You Next Tuesday
I support unborn women rights to life.
Let's keep it real abortion was really made legal because was targeted females of color and  planparenthood was started by a woman who was in the kkk
Biased Channel 4 baby killers. Teach women not to kill babies.
"This is what abortion leads to:  its 2055: ''Artificial Intelligence analyzing the Baby's DNA:....BRRR...BRRRR...analyzing probability of the baby being over 6 feet tall, looking like Johnny Depp and not being bald nor over-weight as an adult....BRRR.....probability: 23%. Woman: ''DAMN! well, i guess i'll abort this one. Maybe i'll have better luck with the next guy''....there MUST be responsibility, otherwise we will be heading towards a society we wouldn't want to live in."
"If abortion is moved to the state we can pick the best president to run USA & not an abortion president like Bill. This has the DEMs TERRIFIED, one of the few things DEMs have is playing abortion card to distract from destroying USA"
A lot of upset baby killers being put out of business a great day in American history indeed.
This gay guy wants to kill babies
Let the accountability start :-)
Imagine wanting rights over other women‚Äôs wombs and rights to choose if they want to procreate or not.
"Babies should say ""Goo"".. Not become it! üòÅ"
"Legalizing abortion is like saying, ‚ÄúI have such strong emotions, that you get to die.‚Äù Putting feelings above life itself. A win for the sanctity of life, not the sanctity of your feelings! 06/24/22"
"*_Abortion is murder_*
Simple as that."
"THIS NARRATOR IS SO BIASED!   TAKE YOUR ""POLLS"" AND STICK EM UP YOUR TUNNEL OF A COBWEBBED WOMB."
THANK YOU TRUMP!
America is tweaking
DEMONCRATIC STATES LOVE TO MURDER BABIES.
PRAISE THE LORD!!!!!!!!!!!!
HALLELUJAH!!!!!   MURDER AIN'T A RIGHT!!!!!!
"So let me get this straight:
They ban abortions claiming life is precious and that the unborn babies are innocent, but then won‚Äôt change or restrict gun laws that lead to the deaths of innocent school children?
So basically once the child is out the womb it‚Äôs fair game. Until then it must be preserved . Have I got that right? Do not claim to value human life if you are willing to let mothers die because they cannot terminate a pregnancy. Why is the mother‚Äôs life worth less than her unwanted and undeveloped foetus?"
"this decision was perfect , following the constituion to the T

and that's EXACTLY what they did . case closed."
Hold it increasing minimum wage creates inflation and devalues skilled workers. Shes off on that part. Women need to gain skills to make more money.
Isn‚Äôt it ironic that all the protestors are people that have been born.
"It's just sad. Poor American women, poor America. More oppression from the 'freest country in the world'"
Pro choice in the name of womens rights is counter intuitive. 50 percent of the time they are killing other women.
Dam these losers because they can't kill babies anymore
I haven‚Äôt seen Democrats this mad since we took their slaves!
Seeing these monsters cry is outstanding.  No more killing helpless babies
"Alright, it‚Äôs official now, Damn women in China actually have more rights for once. It was a right, it‚Äôs not like abortion law force everyone to do abortion, if you don‚Äôt want to abort then you don‚Äôt, let someone else have that choice. You can argue this is a step towards life, but this is definitely a step away from FREEDOM"
"Now women and female children who are r@ped will have to give birth to unwanted babies. It will add to the other many children in systems that are unable to be placed. This will also lead to more maternal deaths.  This is going to create many problems with women going back to using coat hangers to abort pregnancies. Now it has been stated that contraception is next to get stopped. So, if you are a married woman forty and up who still has a menstrual cycle face the risk of getting pregnant or just refusing to be touched by her spouse for fear of getting pregnant. I guess if the men want to be intimate with their wives they will just r@pe her and take the risk of getting her pregnant like they were doing before the 60s. This is just the beginning of taking many rights away from Americans. They took the right for woman to choose without considering the things I just mentioned. They just say any woman who gets pregnant, which is completely wrong. Mostly men made this decision when they are not women and cannot get pregnant even if they are r@ped."
1:29 LOL what's that reaction. It's beyond my comprehension
"please i need to see more liberal tears,   they FUEL MY JOY   =-D"
So all this just so women can travel and get an abortion elsewhere. Or those that can‚Äôt afford it get a backstreet operation and put there life at risk? I‚Äôm sure that makes all the pro lifers feel better smh. Why force that upon anyone else if your against abortion that‚Äôs fine don‚Äôt get one but others shouldn‚Äôt have that right taken away from them you don‚Äôt know the scenario they are in regarding their life!
"What a beautiful day!

DING DONG! Roe v. Wade is dead!

Happy Junetyfourth."
"I like the fight for preservation of life and all. What I don‚Äôt like is that their support only extends as far as the baby is born, after that it‚Äôs all your problem. This will never work. People who have the means to raise a child but don‚Äôt want to for whatever reason, won‚Äôt be stopped from terminating the pregnancy. This will only hurt poor people and if ends up succeeding, in a few years time you‚Äôll find yourselves in a very unpleasant situation."
They have the choice to give away to adoption or orphanages. Better yet take birth control seriously. Abortion is murder. Its clear cut.
This is a women's issue!  Only women should be allowed to vote on it.  It was a majority of men who voted to overturn it.  How dare they!!!!
There will be no functioning society if women kill babies for convenience
you all baby killers should stop and listen for a moment.
The women that disagree shouldve been aborted them selves.
"Wow, you mean women will now have to be responsible  accountable for their sexual decisions?!?! 
 No more getting abortions at the last second just so you can continue club hopping instead of taking care of your baby. Lol üòÇ"
Thank god some women have a body count over ten. They use it as birth control.
This is actually good clearly they haven't been shown what happens to the babies or fetus later . . . #experimentationüßüüë©‚Äçüî¨üß´
No way the thumbnail has to worry about getting pregnant
Damn he got 3 justices up there?? My guy lol
"If these people had an anthem, it would be this. Also this is a huge overreaction. The right to abortion hasn't been taken away, those powers have simply been handed back to the states. It actually probably works out better that way for them as it now means that it's no longer possible for their precious abortions to be outlawed across the board in the future. 
https://youtu.be/QWE_M0CX9So"
great day!
Why do all the libs look like freaks from the Star Wars Cantina Bar?
Victory for future babies!
"I understand why abortion is wrong and it is, BUT what this means now is that young women who get pregnant will now start killing themselves (either by accident or on purpose)

This overturn will eventually be overturned... 
After a few hundred thousand girls die trying to perform a self given abortion....... Yeah it will again Be a right"
EVIL women killing babies so sad
lol that monster ruth vader is rolling in her grave
And I'm sick of these people saying what if a woman is raped? Yes that's bad but it's worse to kill that baby! Put it up for adoption to a loving family.
WAh!!!!!  üò≠ I can‚Äôt use abortion as birth control!!!!

"My body my choice? Wtf! I'm SO SICK of women only thinking about how being pregnant ""inconveniences"" THEM! Thank God it's finally ILLEGAL for women to stop murdering babies."
It wasn't their choice or my choice when it came to the jab and something being stuck inside of me but yet now all of a sudden it's a big deal. F*** you people in your hypocrisy
"""PLEASE LET ME MURDER MY BABY PLEASEEEEE"" lol"

I am absolutely convinced liberals were deprived of oxygen at birth and then dropped on their heads. I have never seen a group of individuals so delusional and susceptible to coercion in my life."
Disgraceful that the reporter keeps scoffing at the pro-life campaigner.... Bias reporting at its finest
A majority of those women seen crying here probably don‚Äôt have any intention of having children. They are just a bunch of radical authoritarian NWO feminazis

Don't be a fool...Wrap your tool!

"If such a majority of people was against the overturning, why so many states banned abortion right after? Is this news or just another media attempt to shadow the true positions of the majority?"
This isn‚Äôt going to stop abortions it‚Äôs just going to stop the safe ones so many women are going to die from abortions in alley ways
"I don‚Äôt understand,doesn‚Äôt just mean that right leaning state will ban it and left leaning state it will be allowed and maybe subside it .Is it just political Theatre?"
"Yet Biden won‚Äôt end the filibuster. Democrats are feckless. Obama could‚Äôve codified Row v Wade when he had a mandate.

"Women have the right to do what they want with their body !!
WRONG ‚ùå !

I don‚Äôt really care about rights and all that but I don‚Äôt understand how people wanna protest abortion was illegal while consuming animals are not.

LET ABORTION BE LEGAL DONT FORGET THE UNDERAGED RAPED WOMAN. HAVE YOU IMBECILES LOST IT? HAVE YOU FUCKING LOST IT? HAVE YOU LET TEXAS BECOME A BREEDING HOME FOR RAPISTS AND PEDOPHILES?
But killing to protect yourself is OK - self defense is OK. Carrying a gun is OK. But abortion is murder? The math isn't mathing. The USA is a mess.
#voteblue #VoteBlueToSaveDemocracy #VoteBlueToProtectAllOfOurRights #VoteBlueToProtectWomen
It good. no to evil messed up people who kill there own kids
Say no to abortions
A lot of states want to ban abortion. The majority of the U.S. population are in populated cities where they are going let abortion continue like California and New York. Places like Texas and Florida want to ban abortion because the Majority of the population want to outlaw it. So it was a good job by the majority of justices in the SCOTUS to give the rights to the states.
Donald Trump ! Praise God for him ‚Ä¶..
Just think twice before you sleep around .
If you think this only affects abortion you are naive my friend. This is so much bigger than that it goes into right of privacy. Just read the damn case!!!
Unwanted pregnancy ? Safe haven laws dumbass !

Its going to backfired pro life warriors!!!

"Roe v Wade was a bad legal decision. This does not mean abortions are not illegal they are determined by the local communities. This is a win for civil rights. The Dems just want power at the federal level, like good socialists.

They can't afford to drive to another state but can afford repeated abortions?"
liberal tears keep em coming ü§£ü§£
In india and china women are aborted 100 to 1 is that ok?
Who needs ISIS or the Taliban if you got home brew ayatollah's from the US supreme court
They can just go to dem states to kill their babies. The presenter is almost suggesting that women will be using coat hangers to abort. That's not the case at all
"Refuse to restrict gun control to save the lives of children being murdered in schools. Yet, happy to restrict women's rights over thier own body to apparently ""save children's lives""..what a joke of a country, the backbone of this policy is on religious grounds...a fictional book written over 2000 years ago. The self proclaimed "" land of the free""..the USA is nothing more than a social experiment gone badly wrong."
If all the pro choic protesters were aborted...there would be no problem
Pro-life fatso is pulling the wool over the viewers‚Äô eyes.Conservatives care a hoot about people and her suggesting that there will be redeemable work done to help families and women out is hot and stale air.
"To all celebrating and flooding the comments with this trolling BS, you‚Äôre genuinely disgusting.

This has nothing to do with any serious  legal thinking it has all to do with the justices personal opinion guised in legal opinion. abortion has a lot more elements to it than just a straight abortion. But I won‚Äôt even sit here and explain them because you all don‚Äôt care, you just want to control women and since you‚Äôve won you can stop acting like it‚Äôs about anything other than that."
"they should use all contraception instead of just  aborting , it will make the women think more.... the state may be  trying to increase there child population as the numbers must  be low due to all the abortions."

baby rights now!!
why do they scream to kill babies?
"I‚Äôm appalled at horrific transphobic slurs being yelled in the streets by masses of bigoted transphobes.  Men can give birth too and being a woman is a constellation.   They are erasing the existence of a horribly marginalized community.  Why can‚Äôt they be outraged over the rights of ‚Äúbirth giving persons‚Äù?  This is transphobia on a level we have never seen before.  This hate should not be left unchecked.  Arrest these protestors for mass bigotry.  The hate just cannot be left unchecked or be allowed in any way, shape or form!  I‚Äôm so F‚ÄôING outraged at the hate that I have found myself in an uncontrollable rage!"

killing babies is liberty?
"Ahh yes, further proof murica is a theocracy masquerading as a democracy, moving into a full blown totalitarian theocracy. This is about NOTHING but control of women in society by implementing a minority bullsht ideology onto society, spitting on the first ammendment itself! 
Soon it will be ban all contraception, ban all LGBT relationships and then ban all mixed race kids. If they can force a ban on abortions then they can also force abortions on mixed race kids.
Also, want to know how these ""christians"" have NEVER read their evil book or know NOTHING about their religion? 
Going against their imaginary sky daddys ORDERS while claiming they ""know"" what saod sky daddy wants: ""god"" is the most aborticidal monster in all of fiction lol.

Life begins at birth with the FIRST BREATH (gen 2:7).
Fetuses are not persons (ex 21::22-25).
Fetuses should be aborted as proof of aldultery (numbers 5:11-31).
Life is not sacred ( Deuteronomy 28: 18-24).
God will rip open pregnant mothers (2 kings 8:12)
God will kill unborn fetuses (isaiah 13:18).
God will dash infants to pieces and rip open pregnant women(Hosea 13:16)"
"Abortions in states with trigger laws aren't going to stop by the way. Well done for endangering the lives of so many women who will now be forced to resort to dangerous methods - the women who can't afford to travel to other states are more likely to be minority ethnic. So much for the ""first black"" Supreme Court Justice who has now made a grossly damaging decision for his own community."
"My body, my choice...when it comes to anything related to COVID-19, right!"
Great day for democracy.  Let the will of the people in individual states decide what is appropriate.

Perform your own abortion then. Poor doctors.
I wish Biden didn't call himself RC.
Killing babies are not a right
"man is not intangible by the fact that he lives. An animal would also be entitled to such a right, insofar as it, too, is living [...] Man's life remains inviolable because he is a person [...] Being a person is not a psychological, but an existential datum: fundamentally, it depends neither on age, nor on the psychological condition, nor on the gifts of nature with which the subject is endowed [...]. Personality may remain below the threshold of consciousness -- as when one is asleep -- yet it remains and we must refer to it. Personality may not yet be as developed as when one is a child, yet from the beginning it demands moral respect. It is even possible that personality in general does not emerge in acts because the psycho-physical prerequisites are lacking, as happens to the mentally ill [...] And finally, personality may also remain hidden as in the embryo; but it is given from the beginning in him and has its rights. It is this personality that gives men their dignity. It distinguishes them from things and makes them subjects [...] one treats a thing as if it were a thing when one possesses it, uses it, and eventually destroys it-or said for human beings-kills it. the prohibition against killing human beings expresses in the most acute form the prohibition against treating them as if they were a thing.""

Romano Guardini"
Good day for America !!! If woman say their body their choice than make the right choices.
Stop lying about what this ruling means for women! This is being used to divide and segregate Americans more than they already are! It has not made abortion illegal period. It has never been illegal. Thus simply means women cannot use it as birth control on demand! Responsible women use birth control to prevent pregnancy. There is no need to have an abortion unless the mother's life is in danger or other serious things like incest or rape. Be responsible and stop making unwanted babies! Grow up! And it is a lie that the majority of Americans want abortion to remain used as birth control. The majority believe it is wrong to offer abortion on demand for any trivial reason. Why can't you be responsible?
STATE RIGHTS just got EXPANDED. And yes. Being Born is a Human Right.
Abortion was forced on states. They used the courts to circumvent the people. The court simply gave the people the power back. Leftist are only screeching because they used a legal loophole instead of doing things correctly.
"PRAISE God Almighty!!!!!!!  Exodus 20:13 - Thou shalt not kill.....Proverbs 6:16-19 These six  the Lord hates, Yes, seven  an abomination to Him:  A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil, A false witness  speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren....Psalm 127:3 Behold, children  a heritage from the Lord, The fruit of the womb  a reward."

The Taliban won.
"The SCOTUS is not intended to back the will of the majority. Their job is to uphold the constitution, which what they did with this decision."
"Such dishonest framing. The Supreme Court didn‚Äôt take away a right here, unless you think brown v board took away the right to attend segregated schools or to ride on segregated public transportation. If anything the court expanded the right to not be brutally murdered in the womb"
That‚Äôs not right there‚Äôs women that get raped an now there saying they have to keep the baby what a terrible day in America women deserve that choice
"3:24 - A constitutional right that's been in place for half a century.

It was *never* a constitutional right. That's precisely why the SC ruling was overturned. The tenth amendment is quite clear on this issue."
Murder is not a fundamental right sorry try again you people are absolutely out of your f****** minds this has nothing to do with women's health just about spreading your false narratives we've had enough and it's going to stop trust me on that! You are all absolutely wicked
President Trump is a great man. He is the author of this great progress. A pillar of hope in the fight against degeneracy. Absolutely wonderful!
Check out all the irresponsible chicks that think it‚Äôs oppression to wear a condom or keep your legs close who also think they are the ONLY women. Dirt bags always think they are the only true humans. Did they see all those other women rejoicing?
"There's nothing in the constitution about abortion, its the correct ruling.    Now individual states can make their own laws, there's nothing wrong with that, everyone needs to chill out."
I know American media sucks but sounds like it‚Äôs worse in Britain. More than half the country supports a 15 week abortion ban and 45-50% support a 6 week ban. The United States was a huge outlier in allowing elective abortions for 24 weeks
Good news!
"Right honey, you want a bunch of old men in your state legislature to have control of womens' bodies. I think you may need to be placed in a highly structured enviornment."

"The best thing america has done in a long time. However you put it, regardless the circumstances  scientifically, abortion is murder. As simple as that. Everyone is here to defend women but no one wants to defend a foetus who will do everything to survive. Watch some videos by Ben Shapiro on abortion and listen to some ex abortion doctors."
Thank you President Trump and SCOTUS!! 63 million aborted babies salute you!!
TRUMP STILL WINNING!!!!!!!!
Cry yourselves to sleep libs
"Great day for ProLifers, White women have the highest number of abortions in America. In a declining white population this measure will increase their numbers, I‚Äôm sure the SC is aware of this."
So who is going to tell the reporter that abortion is not a constitutional right?
We need to help the pregnant women get thru the pregnancy and be able to make the choice wether or not she can care for the child instead of taking the easy out of murder...
"Why is she so afraid? All she has o do is:

A. Keep her legs closed
B. Use correct and effective contraception

Sarah told her partner to cum inside her in the heat of passion and is 5 month‚Äôs pregnant. Sarah was hoping to get an abortion when she got around to it despite her partner‚Äôs objections. But now thanks to row v Wade being over turned she must now travel 2 hours interstate to kill the fetus."

"The USA is not a single huge state, we are 50 states where each state makes its own laws.  I'm sure liberal states will approve unrestricted abortion while conservative states make it for medical reasons only.  R vs W infringed on fathers' rights never taking into consideration the fathers' right to a child that is half his.  This decision returns the power to the states where it belongs."

This ruling doesn't make abortion illegal just goes back to the states now if you're state makes it illegal there's a problem
Just look at this pro-abortion crowd. What are they woried about? The only way that these hags will get pregnant is by artificial insemination.
How will the forced births be enforced?
Abortion is not a right. Period
"So let me know if I‚Äôm wrong (English btw) but has the court made it ok for states to make abortion illegal basically?

What about the baby's right to a life?
"Seems reasonable. Instead of judges in robes issuing laws and decrees from on high, pass laws back to the states and let the people decide for themselves through their elected politicians. I'm sure you'd rather that than a SCOTUS that decided it was going to be illegal across the nation to have abortions... It's the most democratic way of doing it. Face it; it's just not a constitutional right. It never was. Roe V Wade got smashed through on shaky grounds, even RBG agreed. Leftists have been panicking for 50 years about this because they knew full well as soon as the SCOTUS was dominated by Constitutionalists rather than activists Roe v Wade would be overturned. That's why they've frothed at the mouth over Trump - they've been looking over their shoulders getting away with it for decades.

It's the same as if you wrote a garbage essay at school. The noob teacher without a mark scheme gave you an A thinking it was brilliant. Then there was an audit of the essays and an experienced teacher with the mark scheme gave you a C. It's a mere correction.

People need to chill out about what it is to have 'rights'. You don't have a right to someone else's resources or services. You don't have an inherent right to a doctor's time, expertise, drugs or treatments. I find it funny the exact same crowd who were, a couple of months ago (and even now) have been literally forcing people on pain of losing their livelihoods to take unproven vaccines are now all about bodily autonomy. The hypocrisy stinks to high heaven."

"Norma mccorvey alias roe v wade she was roe, she no longer living. Abortions clinic were only in low income area why is that because women in low income more likely get pregnant more due to protection. How sad to abort babies up to time of birth that is under the case of murder babies in the womb know and feel the death and then they sale the baby parts for money. That evil
God forgive all sin except rejection of his son Jesus. Having aboration is not the answer God is the answer. We as women won't go threw the full term because of having a big belly cant afford  the child its not the baby fault it we as women who just dont care. Remember God loves all."

"All this behavior is still illegal, and will work the opposite way to what you deranged people plan. Your version of ""democracy"" is that whenever you get what you want it works and all is well, whenever not you riot like animals. Well, not anymore. You're losing, in case you hadn't noticed. Riot away, you filthy animals. 50 years of murdering babies and dehumanizing anyone who disagrees with your insane views like champs, all up in smoke."
"This is an example of the outrageous harms which religions can achieve.  
If your someone rapes you,. how do you explain that to a child which you are now legally bound to have.? what if it's a familly member who rapes you ?
what if having a child kills the mother?
It's is a persons right to determine what happens to their person. 
Religions are blind to the logic and have no concerns for life when they are supporting warfare between nations."

Abortion was never constitutional. It was simply a federal guarantee.
Oh no lefties can't murder babies
"Don't these pro-abortionists wonder why there's not an issue with plastic surgeons, hair stylists, etc.? That's changing your body...The reason is those acts don't involve another human life. A woman still has the right to choose a condom, birth control, abstinence, adoption, etc.... Abortion is not birth control."

"We Missed Our On-Ramp

In 2016 we missed our on-ramp - the one that would have taken us onto a new plateau of democracy.
Imagine if, after the election, we had been watching a gathering of the likes of Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, and Hillary Clinton. Imagine if we had no Brexit, no Donald Trump, and a gagged and hog-tied Vladimir Putin. Imagine how most of us would have felt with the Trumpians, Putinites, and an assortment of other white and Christian nationalists and petty dictators left to lick their wounds and complain about the American political system.
But instead, we picked a side road that took us down dark and dirty paths where no self-respecting human being and no proud American should want to go. And even though the election of Joe Biden gave us new hope, a world of corruption is still laughing in its beer at us and plotting to take us down the road to perdition as fast as it can, and no one seems to be doing what we need to do to stop it.
Perhaps the whirlpool we are swirling in now is one we deserve. Maybe it was our karmic fate that we should make such a grave error in judgment. But when a large portion of the nation does not vote and a third of the country votes to sink the ship of state and then attacks our Capitol building, what can the rest of us do but wring our hands, pull our hair, and weep for the folly of our fellow Americans and what we know we may have lost?
Hillary, oh Hillary, we left you twisting in the wind, and all that many of us could do was blame you for our sins.
Woe is a people who do not recognize what is good for them or see the path they should take to an open road of freedom and wellbeing for all, and instead follows a path to anger, resentment, hate, and possibly the ultimate death of their republic.
Hillary Clinton said that we are stronger together. Trump said that we need a wall to be safe. Walls do not make us safe, they divide us and make us cowards. Walls do not make us great, they make us weak. Walls do not protect us, they make shadows for us to hide in until the walls come tumbling down and we‚Äôre exposed for who we are.
And who are we? Is Donald Trump who we are? Or was he just an aberration? If he was just an aberration and doesn‚Äôt represent who we are, and if, as Hillary said, we're stronger together, then it is past time for us to show who we are.
If the true vision of America and what it means to be an American does not include the likes of Donald Trump, then we had better straighten up our backbones and do what we need to do to permanently ban this imposter and interloper from the People‚Äôs House and send him and his ilk to the exits, before the infestation he brought to it returns to destroy us all.
Then we will be back on the road that will take us to the on-ramp that leads to where we belong as a free people in a truly democratic republic.

When the woman is raped
When the foetus is severely disabled 
When the women my die

"The right and privilege of driving have to be licensed to certify eligible and competent drivers for the safety of others. The institution of marriage has a very similar function: a commitment to posterity that should not be degraded.
The primal instincts of procreation are a very powerful force. Otherwise, the species won't survive. And there needs to be an enormous amount of direct responsibility and personal investment, by every generation, to socialize and develop those little new barbarians to join the civilized society.
Another way around the abortion issue:  
Alternate enforcement of personal responsibility is done with the implantation of long-term contraceptives at puberty of both sexes unless a bond is posted that pays for an ""accident."" This performance bond insurance would provide financial support in the event of a divorce which would be costly for high-risk people. There would be a provision of parental liability for serious parental malpractice: substance abuse during pregnancy, liability for deciding the gender of the progeny that later feel enormous regret.
No need to kill proto-humans."

There‚Äôs plenty of people out their who are not only ready, but can die giving birth. You say adoption saves lives yet you haven‚Äôt adopted. You say put them in foster care yet you have no idea how hard and cruel the system is to childern. There are KIDS KIDS who have been sexually abused and assaulted and who are being forced FORCED to undergo the pain of child birth. Ya know this is just all ok until it comes to you. Until all this happens to YOU. And you would look back and want to change your decision about Abortion. But you can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not about the baby.

Yes United States üá∫üá∏ is returning to the 70 s

Your point??"
Something unites all those protesting on both sides of the argument.  They weren‚Äôt aborted.

"Religion should not play a part in politics. Too many people use it as justification without actually thinking about it properly. Abortions should be a choice.

LOL the pro choice person is a dude.......
Another sick backward step !  A woman‚Äôs right to choose !!!!  Evil religious right   Believing in God is beyond Delusional üôèüôè
Increase in backstreet illegal abortions. Sad
I don't know why any of these historical pro choice women are even concerned. It's highly unlikely that any man would dare get anywhere close for them to be at risk of getting pregnant.
"Loudest voice is those who BORN

"Praise Jesus!!! 

All those who support abortion shoul'd repent before the wrath of God fall on them."
"Yes this is the same as segregation, you all are delusional. Segregation is bad, so is killing a baby."
Get y‚Äôall‚Äôs tubes tied God bless the unborn innocent
"Typical humanity in a nutshell. 

Youngsters taking part in a protest where they find it trendy to go along with opinions on a matter they have never experienced for themselves.

Highly religious comments about how God's word has been spoken in its truest form. A victory for the will of Christ himself. 

Idiots declaring the decision as a modern day Normandy landing...

People saying that amongst Putins wrath, Coronavirus, war in the Middle East, going further back to 2 world wars, slavery, murderous caliphates, concentration camps. Disease, auctions and serial mass murders.

And they are actually saying Abortion rights overshadow it all as the single worst thing to ever happen or exist.

Really? Is that the collective intelligence of the primary species on planet earth?

OK. Sure. We should be happy actually. Happy that one day soon it will be a life sentence for a young violated teenage girl to refuse the prospect of putting herself through suicidal terror, fear and haunted memory just to bring an offenders child to term, thus gifting humanity with a deviants prodigy...

Wow. 
As if I need any more proof that humanity needs a reset."
Gods in charge
"I love the joy on everyone's face that knows how evil the past 50 years have been.
No more sacrifices to Luciferian secret societies!"
that thumbnail is just pure gold lol and got to say ch4 have out done themselves for bias reporting in this video
"Shame on all who support abortion.
We live in a wicked and delusional generation.

"America should balkanise. The Left and Democrats hate everything that is American, it would be better if they just formed their own country."
9 supreme legislators with lifetime appointment. Mental system.
"That's it. Back to the stone age. I hope every single one of these women protesting on the side of the overturn suffers, REALLY suffers"
"The USA must be the most fucked up society on the planet, horrid place."
Why is no one addressing the fact that science is very clear on this: a fetus is not a person. Period.
"A dark day for sure. While it's ideal to create laws based on religious ideals, the truth is usually not a good idea. People have different perspective on things. And not only laws have to be fair, there's usually a good reason not create a law based on religious beliefs. While Roe vs. Wade started on rather selfish note, it turned to a critical law in the constitution of women rights. The other laws the Supreme court are going after just as important. These laws were put in place for good reason. Without them there would be consequences affecting everyone. The Supreme court needs to be taken aside and talked to about these laws. Or replace with people who are at least willing to listen."
Crazy god followers again ruining everything.
Can u imagine being distraught that you can‚Äôt kill babies?
This is a very bad decision.
"I've never really understood why anti-abortionists think they should have jurisdiction over somebody else's body? What has it got to do with them? I mean, fine, if they don't want an abortion, then great, don't have one. I am in favour of abortion, but I don't try to insist that anti-abortionists should have abortions, even though I think it would probably be for the greater good of society."
All life matters!
Clarence Thomas just said that contraception is an ‚Äúerror‚Äù that the Supreme Court has a ‚Äúduty‚Äù to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù now that Roe is overturned.
You know how common postpartum depression is even with women who wanted a baby? People who would've gotten abortions may end up taking their own lives or the babies life anyway. People barely know what they want until they are almost in their 30s it'll end up forcing people to wreck their mental health and in turn the babies. If anything restrict the amount of time they can have an abortion. But fundamentally the right should remain
"""Constitutional right"" - the Constitution makes no reference to abortion. Typical C4 misinfo..."
"Oh no the girl on the thumbnail is crying because she was told that being able to kill a child is her human right... oh but no, sorry, you've been mistaken.  We all have a right to life, in fact, and a human being's life beings in the womb - it's where we all started - so we have a right to life and a right not to have our personal autonomy infringed upon, that's our own bodies inside a womb there.  So, no, nice try at propaganda though Channel 4."
"People really, Ming your own uterus. As a man you shouldn‚Äôt try to control our‚Äôs."
"distributing free fire extinguishers does not prevent fires.  people should learn how to use matches.  when a woman undergoes an abortion, she suffers both psychosocially and physically.  Abortion shows boys that they can continue to have fun without feeling the slightest responsibility.  girls and boys need the right education.  girls can choose to have an abortion but they can not force the doctors to commit murder and throw the 6 month old human being in the trash."
This is awesome news Praise God forever. So sad people crying to be able to have the right to have their baby chopped up into pieces and put into a freezer. Democrats have brainwashed people and turned them into a fornicating generation with no respect for themselves or for their children. Pray the states have the votes to ban it nation wide.
"The correspondent is so abundantly biased in her reporting, that it is laughable.ü§£"
"When 50% of caucasian women get their tubes tied lets see how fast they reverse the decision. But on a serious note, since they say it should be left up to states and citizens, why not then require that states put it up to a vote. This would allow citizens to have a right to vote on the individual issue Instead of living under dictatorship by having a governor tell a woman or couple what they have to do with their bodies. If the voters of each state sign a petition in large numbers then it will have to be voted on as a ballot initiative/amendments. If not vote them all out. So they just overturned Roe but then will do nothing to ensure safer streets via gun violence for those same embryos. What a schizophrenic set of decisions!"
No. This is the right Decision. No person women or man should have the ability to kill their child life starts at conception
Puts that whole Trans ‚ÄúWoman‚Äù thing in perspective now huh?? ü¶óü¶óü¶óü¶ó
Can we finally call liberals domestic terrorists when they start looting & burning cities this weekend or is that term reserved for only conservatives still?
"Now who has to make sure that a condom is in use before intercourse ?

At last a Supreme Court that respects the Constitution.

Now ban channel 4!!!
"So unborn human beings can‚Äôt be murdered on the whims of the irresponsible ??
Excellent ‚Ä¶ !!"
"You cant argue with experts CH4, that's what you told us over Covid, this was the Supreme Court, they understand the law far better than you.
Congratulations to all the progressives that got this old fashioned law changed."
Ah! i feel so sad that they are not allowed to kill babies anymore..........NOTTTT
A sad day for the USA. But on the bright side more kids may lead to more school shooters.
"""my body my choice"" also applies to the baby."
It‚Äôs a complicated issue.
"‚Äã2021: if it saves just one life.....

These pro choice people are baby murderers
"Very biased ""pro-murder""reporting from the channel 4 here."
"Wonderful praise God may God bless america for a small step in turni g back to him .
They may by Gods Grace learn to keep there legs closed and stop murdering babies
Well done supreme court God continue to lead you

Ban whores then you fkn dribblers

Buenas noticias
It wasn't a right to begin with. Classic lying media
"Reporter: ""The view is that you can't ban abortions, you just ban safe abortions"". Strange how the left is never using the same line of reasoning when it comes to banning guns."
America is not a first world country.
C4 satanists
"My wife is not pissed, she happy it was overturned@"
i feel sick.
No judge should have a lifetime position for obvious reasons. Retirement is there for a reason .
3:30 Bias much? Terrible reporter
Seems like America brought a piece of the Taliban home with them. They‚Äôll be stopping girls from going to school next.
To all pro life Americans now you know what propaganda news against you looks like huh?
Hilarious
"This is a great day for humanity. It's bizarre that the people who are pro choice for children to go through severe operations to change from male to female or female to male. Are probably the ones who would take away other children's right to life, through abortion. One thing both of these actions have in common, are that they are an attack on children."
"Reporter: ""The supreme court has gone against the will of the people"". No, actually the opposite has happened. Now people can vote and have exactly the kind of abortion laws they want in each state."
"I've noticed that those who are for abortion have already been born.
Now let the salt flow."
America just turned itself into a Christian caliphate.
"This Bristish reporter needs to stick to covering the Royal Family stuff....
and stop giving out phoney info. !!!
  Read the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of rights."
"Seeing as it goes to the states what about the states committing and trying to legalise infanticide???
What are they doing with baby parts???"
Abortion is an abomination and a sin.Long live Father God.Giving life is no joke.Let God decide who lives or dies.Abortion is child sacrifice.Repent Jesus Christ is coming back now.
I am pretty sure that passing the progressive policies first would have been the correct order. All  the republicans are going to do is vote down everything that the lady mentioned anyway.
this Biaches screaming with joy don't even realize a constitutional right is taken away which is very sad shame on  you woman shame on you
American Civil War 2.0 incoming.
They are screeching like harpies
Close your legs or use protection! Stop using abortion as contraception!
They are going to protest expecting the same results as 2020 but this time around all the shop owners got guns now.
What liberties or rights does the unborn child have.
Literally millions of lives saved due to this decision.
Channel 4 stop with the lies...have u no shame? The right to abortion DOES NOT EXIST in the American constitution...thats why Roe V Wade was overturn...right to abortion it os not a constotutional right...they send tje power back to the states
There never was a constitutional right for an abortion!!!!
These pro life people are the most ignorant Karen's you'll ever see. No point in getting their point of view on this because it's pure ignorance  and pettiness!
"Holy moly, god help American woman.. unbelievable üò≤"
"""It's like taking Normandy beach.""

Bruh."
We need progress we need Michelle O in there right now!!
RIP TINDER APP
I hope Channel 4 give such bias in favour of all murderers in their future reports.
This report is such BS and biased!!!
They talk as if they are banning completely when they are actually just letting their own states decide instead of the government getting involved. That is in nature with the whole point of the American experiment.
This is ridiculous - America is supposedly founded on ‚Äúindividual freedom and liberty‚Äù - come again?
I just love seeing sad Karens!  love it
This a fantastic step forward for American democracy! Now the states themselves get the chance to set their own laws for their own women on this issue.
"Britain next please, maybe we can have replacement levels of reproduction if women can‚Äôt use murder as a contraception."
"I'm one of those babies who was meant to be aborted, but my mom was too far along. I was never meant to exist. And I wish I hadn't. Taking abortion rights away from women doesn't save babies. It just makes life harder for the mother and the unwanted child, especially in countries where socio-economic safety nets are non exist (i.e. USA). If you don't want an abortion, don't have one."
"Who has more rights,,,,does the right to life(a baby) have more right and the already alive female pregnant,,,,,,to freedom of choice,,,it‚Äôs a terrible legal craziness,,,I am not a justice,,I would hate to be these judges,,,,,,,,,,,,,I believe in life and a push to educate women and men on the need for good birth control,,,and really good state run nursery‚Äôs,,and child care,,,so the women on state income,,,get a chance to get an education,,,work,,training,,,,to get a feeling of accomplishment,,,to end the cycle of poverty,,,after school programs,,,,better schools in urban areas in general,,,,encouraging men to stay connected with their children,,,,get more men of color and ethnicity to be role models for the young men without dads,,,,,treat everyone with dignity,and respect,,,,"
Guess certain gals wont be able to sleep around so freely anymore or use actual protection. The amount that use it as contraception or to scam people e.t.c is most likely insane. One step closer to actual equality I guess.
"Abortion should be regulated, people need to be responsible for their actions."
Abortion isn't even in the constitution
LOL ü§£
7:48 Who‚Äôs this beast?
Being anti-abortion has to be the cheapest form of morality around - you don't have to pony up any money to help a kid have a decent start in life. You can just sit back in your easy chair and self-righteously condemn others for difficult life choices. It's really the perfect Republican issue. No skin in the game.
I bet the Taliban are happy with this.
Utterly sad and disgusting
3rd wave of feminism is a cancer
"Unbelievable , women stand up."

"60 years ago our Congress Hid like rats rather than make a Law regarding this.   Obama had a majority in Both houses and was too afraid to make a law regarding it. Now the Left wants to blame the supreme court?   It is not their job to make laws, blame your lazy congress whichever way you believe."
The false balance in this report is disappointing.
"GET YOUR FACTS STRIGHT !
ABORTION WAS   NEVER  A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT !!!üòé"
Love the meltdowns  ü§£ü§£ü§£
The correct decision. Anything not covered in the constitution is left up the states or the people
"This is literally democracy in action. People can now VOTE to make it legal, or illegal, and put whatever restrictions they want on abortion on a state by state basis. OR get abortion passed at the federal level... of course that won‚Äôt work, because as of now at least half the country either doesn‚Äôt want it to be legal at all (minority), or wants severe restrictions on it (majority). 

Most people have no clue what Roe V Wade was about or why it made zero sense constitutionally. Now it‚Äôll actually be up to the PEOPLE. That‚Äôs called democracy."
all women who support abortion in the US need to imidiately withhold conjugal rights for all their men and maybe a mass hunger strike will change the minds of these far right bible bashing men when they see their own daughters and grandaughters starving to death women in the USA need to show these crackpots that belief in a made up god that enforces their idelology on all the women of the USA
"Wow.  ""America, the land of gun care and health control"""
"America, land of the free (as long as the religious nuts allow it)"
There was never a ‚Äòconstitutional right‚Äô to abortion in the first place.
A great day for humanity. A bad day for irresponsible women and adrenechrome consumers.
Americans... *eyeroll*
How can anyone force a woman accept a baby she doesn't want? Babies would end up abandoned
"Funny how they one minute care so much for a fetus but just loosened the gun  laws where you can carry a combat weapon to a school  and shoot everyone .
The woman should have the right to choose its her body"
This will divide America further. I wonder if there will be huge protests
"This is the will of God.
No more murdering babies!
Other countries will follow I pray."
I feel like my milk's coming in. Fifty years' worth
RIP American dream
Mmmm..... It's sad to see a modern country cave to religion.
Are you kidding me? This will not stand
Belo e moral
VOTE these radical judges must be gone
They have gone against the will of the people?? I am not sure this dumb woman understands the role of the supreme court.  Hardly surprising as it is garbage for bird brains.
Baby murders unite
what screaming banshees..
"UK: Tories ""Bill Of Rights"" will allow them to rewrite Human Rights too.
- The Lords can't stop it because they never block these actions if it was part of an Election Manifesto."
"I wonder why all those obsessed lesbo-feminists are so frustrated, there is no chance any of them would get pregnant anyways"
Go babies!!!!!!  :) ... Mine that Channel 4 salt... haha
So a woman can die and that's just fine?
And men continue to be free of responsibility while women suffer more and more. So messed up!!!
The inaccuracies in this piece is unbelievable
Lol..I would like to remind AmeriKKKa that 53% of white women voted for trump. Good luck with the fallout.
"When you rely on man made laws, values change over time and are not stable."

They will continue to oppress women.
"The women are pissed, lady? (1:23) Well, not in my  name. I'm üòÄ, really üòÄ"
I'm not against the overturning - it but it is slippy slope because if it is a crime - there are going to be more 'back alley clinics' which might be more dangerous for women
The Republicans are very similar to the Taliban's in they way they approach the rights for women!
"No to vaccine passports, mandates or lockdowns"
This is outrageous.
This is not about pro-life; it‚Äôs about anti-woman.
RWV was bad law in the first place. Rights don't come from the government. They come from our humanity and our creator. Read our constitution.
Shouldn't this have a 'Triggered' warning? ü§£
"Supreme court did no such thing, all it literally did was look at the constitution and nowhere could they see a right to abortion mentioned anywhere so referred abortion back to individual states to decide on their own abortion laws.  For instance Oregan still has the right to abort up to 9 months, as sickening as that is."
USA government evil dictator sales guns too killing each other Europe laugh at USA
