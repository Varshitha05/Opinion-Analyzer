The Republican judges in the Republican majority “Politics”of our Biased Supreme Court.
"Why can we not have stuff done for justices that lied to us on T>V> live, then turn on roe/wade"
A woman DOES NOT have the right to terminate a life that she was only a co-creator of.  There is a father with equal rights to that life inside of her. Just because women carry that life inside of them for 9 months DOES NOT give them a right to terminate it. Your body does not equate to your choice when there is another co-creator of that life... a father!
Watch next they will jail you for having a miscarriage…. As of now I’m Texas if someone suspect you caused your miscarriage they can sue you and get 10k in damages!!!!!! Imagine any disgruntled ex boyfriend or anyone who wants to cause you problems. The power they hold
There is no good reason there votes be secret we need to know who is voting for these radical changes.
The Supreme Court needs to have a make over. The senate in power shouldn’t have the power to select the justices we the people should elect the justices.
Planned Parenthood 😮
oh and that little fact that during their hearings for the job they lied to our faces on live TV.
Oh I was surprised about Amy. Thought she is a traitor to women kind
"In essence, the Supreme Court is inherently a political entity where considerations such as logic, reason, and the protection of citizens often take a back seat to political dynamics."
best court money can buy
What a surprise. Conservatives LIE! They hide how horrible even they know they are until they can destroy from within! Just like any other cancer!
Abortion is a privilege.
People with seven children have no right to decide the fate of others. They have proved themselves completely irresponsible.
They all should be going to jail for perjury they all lied on their confirmation hearings
Milk carton collectables.
"so, according to Kantor, ALL Judicial compromise efforts become irrevocably ""hopeless"" based solely on things happening in the media.  but the deceptive media they put out to the American public ""we don't know if we're going to take the case"" despite all evidence and facts represents a window of judicial ""persuasion"" that literally does not occur in any real or symbolic way?  why does she feel she has license to invent these reporting narratives out of thin air?"
Oh I shouldve looked whos reporting kn this..
Clarence Thomas should recuse himself.  Period.
"DONALD TRUMP IS A TRAITOR TO THE NATION AND HE DESERVE TO BE ON JAIL FOR A LONG TIME . 
 NOBODY IS ABOVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RULES OF THIS COUNTRY, NOBODY , PERIOD .   IF THEY, SUPREME COURT JUDGES ; IF THEY DON’T GIVE A BIG PUNISHMENT TO DONALD TRUMP ; THEY DESERVE TO BE REMOVED FROM THE CHAIRS . PERIOD."
"The judges on this court are corrupt and biden should appoint more judges to ballance it out and change the job from a lifetime job to a 5 year appointment , they can be removed if they are using their position to push a political agenda instead of looking at legal arguments . Funny how they are promoting states rights when it benifits the republican party but if you change states right to gun reform it suddenly becomes a constitutional  one ."
Just look at the smug smiles of these people
"When they promised not to do it and did it anyway, why were they not ejected from the bench?"

The best supreme court that Putin could buy.
"I always suspect that the Supreme court is corrupt to the bone, did we notice that trump never criticize the supreme court trump pack the court we with his supporters because hebwant them to rule in his favour,that,s why why trump want to go to the suprime court to declare him over the law .total immunity over the constitution of the the USA."
They know you all won't do anything but angrily post online about it
"They say that Trump will still on the ballot. Does that mean that we don't follow the constitution anymore? He not only was involved in the insurrection, he is to blame for the whole thing. I just don't get it. No man is above the law and yet Trump is. How is this possible and why isn't he in prison where he belongs? The Supreme court swore an oath to uphold the constitution, why don't they in this case?"
"Justices don't ""change"" law. They judge cases based on the law which is based on interpretation of the context of a case as the law applies.. Congress is the only ones who can change or make law. However, the court can rule on it as they deem fit per the letter of the law and the Constitution."
"The feds never should have been involved in this to begin with. Up until a child is viable outside of the womb, it is part of the person."
These judges are as honest as Trump.
Abortion never was a Constitutional Right. It should be an issue left to the individual states. I am not for a national ban.  It should be decided by the States.
The SCOTUS is compromised
"If i had to look at Ginny naked my face would look like Thomas 's too,,"
"I love this, but didn’t Steve Colbert mention all of this in a monologue a year ago?"
Yes let's ignore millions of women. The real outrage is the leak itself *eyeroll*
"Hey anti-choice idiots. By killing Roe, you killed the Republican Party."
You can't convince us it's ok to do .
"Baby parts are sold for money , for profit ,from late term abortion s it's a known fact it's a big money making business too.😂😂😂😂"
RBG was the GOAT for women's rights.
"Congress should impeach the (3) Justices (names I will not say). Any other person in this country lies during an interview and they find out you lied after getting the job, you are fired immediately. I have seen valuable team members get fired because they lied on their application, in the background documents or during their interview. But, when politicians (Congress, White House and Supreme Court, yes they are bias politicians) lie, nothing happens to them. They keep their jobs, salary and benefits. And, in the case of Supreme Court, they get to keep their jobs, salaries and benefits for life. For anyone who really thinks the US Supreme Court justices are not bias and side with a political party, than please check yourself into a mental hospital because you are insane. Justice Alito, Thomas and the 3 new justices wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade. This is why the U.S. Supreme Court should have term limits. They are more politicians than justices. They use their religious belief to make rulings."
Who Keeps leaking these things? Or is it part of the news story to say it got leaked
Alice Cooper is looking great these days.
The U.S. is going downhill.  Its Supreme Court is for sale for the right price and is also highly politicized.  Not much room for sober interpretation of laws in this country.
Roberts being disappointed about breach of trust?! That's rich!
MSDNC is the establishment employee of the Month
SC is run by federalist cult members bent on destroying democracy and peoples rights
"I have very little doubt that the anti-choice extremism by the Trumper party will cost them dearly in 2024. Every dark cloud has a silver lining. Nice to see the terminally inept forced birthers are so willing to help AMERICA VOTE BLUE! 

Republicans: Freedom!  (*EXCEPT over your body, speech, books, and who you may love) Republican HYPOCRISY. Sounds more like FreeDumb! 

When FASCISM comes to America it will be wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross   - Sinclair Lewis"
"Anti Vaxxers and Conspiracy Theorists argue about governments are taking over our lives but they are wrong, as nobody is trying to control the bodies through vaxxinations but these judges and the whole RepubliTRAITOR party are who they should vent their anger at"
"media turns political as well, what should u expect from a radical liberal media, these are expected comments"
Just a bunch of crooked judges.
Same goes for voting. It is state's issue until Russian Donnie got kicked off the ballot.
this is going to win a pulitzer
Hypocrite opposing other hypocrites because hypocrisy looks bad😢
"Here we see how a few devoutly religious individuals get placed in powerful positions to change laws, pure political manipulation. The minority forcing their rules & beliefs on the majority. Democracy sold to the highest bidder by either bribing them or offering the position to an individual with the same religious beliefs."
"What rhymes with Supreme? Extreme. The Supreme Court justices are corrupt. Supporting DATrump because he loaded the court, the justices seem to be untrustworthy. 
We miss you RBG!"
"My bible read when jesus was questioned by Pharacees from the communist synagogues followed him areoud semt out by Abbotts distance relative probebly 
To follow him around quoting the 10 commandments accusec of working on Sabbath day

What  do your learn reading your bibles just skipped and set in org bible studies with political motivre getting manipulated around 

How many of your cities euthanized dogs and cats

The churches havent address the issue they want their churches full 
And folk pro creating like bunnies 
And want to threaten doctors 
That same concept of saying folks let dogs run around and procreat and will make laws to punish the city workers ethinizing animals fine them and charge them murder"
more and more nonsense RBG stated roe was too broad and weak which would be overturned some day
Hahaha!!! Joe is loosing so the fake news brain washing machine has to work 24/7 trying to make up false allegations. We know how you cheat. Trump 2024!!!
honestly i feel like we are moving backwards not forwards
"Set Law means something entirely different from the time you’re nominated to the time you are selected to sit on the court. In other words, they LIED !"
These people have destroyed the integrity of the Supreme Court
"SCOTUS is obviously infected with MAGGOTS and is proving allegiance to the insurrectionists and their far-right anti-democratic agenda. Watch out Americans, your will soon live in a dictatorship if you don’t pay attention."
"To be pro-life is to recognize the inherent value of every human being, regardless of their stage of development."
"I hate this idea that we should read anything in Justice CB taking any kind of stand means we should evaluate her character. Maybe warm up a seat on The Resistance High Council like we did for Megan Kelley.
No. Absolutely not."
"What the justices seems to have forgotten is that as a justice, they need 
to leave their personal feelings at the door. Their job has nothing to do with
how they personally feel about a case they are weighing in on. They are
suppose to be deciding whats right or wrong according to our constitution. 
If they cant leave their personal feelings at the door, they need to find another 
line of work. Same for cops, its not about you.

!"
I want to tell you again for the second time or third time there is someone who is hijacking your NS and BC podcasts and putting them on her site. We cannot find them on the regular site please look into this!
This is appalling! If Trump gets immunity in his case that means immunity for Biden also and we must rally for him to stay in office!
How much did  the supreme corrupt judges get paid off to reverse the will of the people?
"If Biden wins 11/24 (dear god PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE) and has a majority House and Senate- He should add 4 Justices to the court. We have 13 districts, we should have 13 Justices... then pass a law stating you can only rise # of Justices when districts reach an odd #- 15/17, etc."
America is under attack from Christian sharia law
"It’s funny how mad corrupt people get at whistleblowers. The Supreme Court has a long, distinguished history of betraying the trust of the people."
"Conservatives: “We should execute whoever leaked that draft.”
Reporters: Looks like it was leaked by conservatives to try to solidify the vote. 
Conservatives: 🙄"
Idc where you stand on abortion but the supreme court should be impartial and fair to everyone.
"Chris Hayes alleges that something is a great piece. Translation: it's a moronic piece that wasn't worth the writing of it. I notice that the loyal loonies of the left are out in farce in the comment section. Quelle surprise.

Just to be clear on the issue of votes, they had the votes to both take an overturn Casey (Roe was already a dead letter by the work of Casey). As usual, Chris Hayes is working hard to be the head clown in the car, reading all sorts of idiotic things into the world. They weren't waiting for RBG to die to do anything; her vote was irrelevant. It takes 4 votes to hear a case and they had that. It takes 5 votes to overturn a precedent. Since Hayes isn't all that bright, and neither is this reporter he's interviewing; they had one extra vote than they needed.

Also, Kantor is attempting to sell people on the idea that she has inside information to the Justice's conference; she does not. No one does. She's just doing her job; her one an only job: sell copy. Fiction is a fantastic tool of journalists for the same reason it is for other folks who make bank off of making things up."
Abortion equals murder !!!!~!!!
Quit reading  in to this and your opinion is not needed. propaganda not needed! independent!!!
This 6 have to go
"Tell me again, how did RBG die?"
MSNBC is the last source I would trust on the issue.
"They gave her cover. She knew they didn’t need her vote. Smoke and mirrors. 3 justices are political activists, 2 of which are illegitimate justices."

"If we wanted a Supreme Court that's not politicized, we'd have devised a method of seclection that excluded bias.  The business of presidential selection ensures bias, and in disturbed times like ours, the wheel falls off completely and the whole process of going to the Supreme Court becomes a farce.  Why not make a list of all those who want to be on the Supreme Court and choose the winners using the Lotto selector?  The country is going to have to do something like that or continue down the path to a continuation of the Civil War.  How many more warnings do we need??!!"
I never understood why they did it because Roe was the Republican Golden Goose. They had a topic they could take to their supporters and fund raise off of endlessly. They could scream and yell and cry and shake hands and do nothing and ride that easy money wave.
"I had been holding it down for days, but thanks to this piece, I wasn’t able to hold back my gag reflex. 🤢 proving once again there’s no bottom, but only new lows"
SCOTIS is way broken and a prime example of the importance of term limits.
"it is utterly dillisional to think thwt the leak had any effect on the outcome of dobbs. covering the surpreme court must really make you think this institution is not utterly corrupted by politcal power. unfortunately, by any conceivable measure of the court there is no deliberation at all here, merely an exercising of power."
Remember them. They will enter history as one of the most corrupt and untrustworthy justices to have ruled america. We wont forget the likes of them. So we can put justices of higher intergrity into the Supreme Court. Someone worthy who is nothin like them ⚖️
"Oh, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer accountable. They are the corrupted people. If you do that, you hold the bright people responsible for it And you will start looking like a Are real smart person. Right now all your lunatic look like you all confused."
"Yeah, whatever it is, it’s not a bombshell……this Supreme Court is the fault of lazy “progressive” Democrats"
"Sorry Amy, your weak ‘but I didn’t want to hear the case’ died when you sided with the other judges to overturn it."
"The court corrected a bad decision. What's wrong with that?  Roe V Wade was based upon something that does not exist, the right to privacy."
"Kentucky voters are to blame for repeatedly voting for the monster. In my opinion, next to Hitler, McConnell is the worst human being…Ever."
"SCOTUS roles all need to have a term limit (as do all public offices), competent oversight, should be appointed by a committee of unbiased professionals (not a president), have minimum qualifications, be evaluated and investigated prior to assuming the role, be subject to the same benefits and laws as citizens (there should only be one set of benefits and laws), and more.  Some of these topics may seem to be covered, but they're not.  A majority of the present SCOTUS appointees are corrupt and/or incompetent."
"Dad, go to Meg Spearman two minute"
If Ruth actually retired while Obama was president that would have been incredibly helpful lol
"These 6 hold the future of US democracy in their hands. Unfortunately, there is not one honest or ethical person making up the 6."
Make no mistake SCOTUS is highly political and the power mongers have helped to tilt the scales of justice.
Ordinairy business and lobby club
"Who says we live in ""post-ironic"" times? The supreme court upset about the leak that exposed their secret decision to nullify Roe vs Wade? The SC lost all trust with me, not that I ever respected them, the FBI, or other actors in our government. The bubblican party is void of ethics."
"People worry about a Trump coup, and it already happened when he packed the Supreme court with corrupt minions."
"If she had just retired when Obama was President, this would never have happened."
Term LIMITS
"The leak was Alito, who was 100% playing politics and wanting to legislate from the bench."

"""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."" - John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton, 13th Marquess of Groppoli, better known as Lord Acton  
And thus we have the supreme justices drunk with absolute power"
"Over time, I simply think all this establishes is how corrupt and political the Supreme Court is, and the fact that there were no consequences for the *leaker* reinforces the idea that we have a Supreme Court that itself feels it is above the law.  Between this and all the payoffs and outright bribery we've learned about -- all with nothing being done -- it just shows what a ""Banana Republic"" the US has really become."
The Supreme Court Justices are more like Court Jesters! 🤡🤡🤡 for whoever takes care of them! $$$$$.
Thanks to Judgment to Supreme Court Justices To USA
the republican voted judges are against all freedom... all choice... and there all apart of the KKK... they work against the ppl. they dont work for the ppl. The KKK are in the supreme courts
We can always tell.
THEY ALL NEED TO BE FIRED FROM THOSE SEATS! WHY CAN'T WE VOTE FOR WHO'S IN THOSE POSITIONS??? I HATE OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM
"Kantor spends too much time making Coney-Barrett a hero in this article, when in fact, she ultimates decides to overturn Roe. I don't get her Kantor's nuance here?"
Look what Republican voters have to ignore. Look what Democrat voters can't ignore.
"SO,basically they are playing with our lives."
It's blatant and in our faces....MSNBC does the bidding of the WHite House
didnt this happen a long time ago
Not the alternate facts!
I wonder how many abortions they paid for in the past 🤔 I guess we will never know..
They should wear patches on their robes like NASCAR Drivers showing their financial backers.

--Dallas Cowboys super bowl ring
--Mothers house and properties
--Nephews University tuition paid in full
--Leo Lenard payments to Ginny's law firm
--Horatio Alger Association of the wealthy that he is now an idolized member. Yes, he receives gifts from this association 
--David Sokol is a helping hand
--Free flights on private jets, free super yacht trips and free stays at resorts. HE NEVER PAID FROM HIS SCOTUS salary

"Here's the latest news from the Supreme Court: 

FIRST: Orange Man's far-right MAGA majority issued rulings to overturn Roe v. Wade, weaken the EPA, end affirmative action, reaffirm college entitlements and push ALL their extremist MAGA agenda. 

THEN: They heard arguments on a case that would END Social Security and Medicare, programs that millions of Americans count on. 

NOW: They've agreed to rule on a case that could ban mifepristone, a commonly used, incredibly safe abortion medication, and lay the groundwork to OUTLAW birth control! 

These rulings will have DEVATATING consequences for Americans in the present and future."
"The party of trump (POT)
The MAGA are all high on POT😂🎉"
"When a supreme court judge takes a oath to our constitution pledges elegance to our flag.when questioned at interview they LIED!.

This is RGB fault. That hungry B hadn't retired we wouldn't be in this mess
"The breach of trust are the politicians mate-guarding SCOTUS nominees to preserve Roe v Wade.  Laws should be decided by the people, not 7 liberal justices in 1973!"
That's  the crooked games republicans play hi Allito top crook judge we see you.
TERM LIMITS!!
God   said do unto others as you have them do unto you 💗😅
Sounds like God removed her from the planet  and  than  he  replacde her with a pro life judge .
Whats with the attempts to white wash Coney Barrett? She voted to nix abortion in the end which is what matters
The will not stop at Roe.
Barret voted against knowing it would still be taken.  Red herring.
"I commend Jodi for keeping such a level head and stating the facts during this interview. This guy can be a bit leading. I'm liberal and all, but I really don't like his style in this interview like he's trying to rile people up into a frenzy. It's reminiscent of the crap they play on the right."
"Psh, this could have happened 10 years later and we would have known it was because she died. What's funny is these people don't have to worry about re-election or some crap.  The supreme court is too political."
Again I say - WTAF with lifetime appointments?!! 🙄 America... we can be so freaking stupid.
"This sounds like ""Let's forgive Barrett because she's a woman in power, and feminism exists."" What a joke."
"Justices which shouldnt follow political lines, complaining when theyre called out for pushing their political view."
"I love this liberal propaganda. ""The leak may have been inappropriate because the justices could have changed their vote."" Yeah right, and Trump can admit that he committed all the crimes he's done over the past five years."
4:18 come on lady this is your cue to say that thing we talked about you saying
If this angers you remember Trump is taking the credit for this.
American Christian Taliban.
Trying to insert reason and justice into a 50 year long political hatchet job is ludicrous.
Don't understand why its a question. ABORTION IS A HUMAN RIGHT...
"Reform is required. No lifetime appointments, more justices and a balance across all parties including independents all for starters! Having the ayatem as it is oppresses the majority of the population"
This is why we need to abolish the electoral college.  These religious nuts have an insane amount of power over us those are living in 2023.
"In 1953, my great-great uncle found four strangled newborns hidden in his fields. My aunt told me about a much older cousin who had three abortions in secret to avoid raising kids with a violent husband. 
This was in the days before Roe. And these are the days we’re going back to. When abortions happened in secret and when actual fresh living babies were killed silently when abortions were denied."
Don’t look at me-I voted for Hillary.
America holds itself as a moral paragon while being one of the most corrupt duplicity even the judiciary
I thought we all knew it was Saltamayor.
Being able to buy a Supreme Court justice is corruption by definition.
I can't say I have much confidence in the Supreme Court. I don't believe that the justices are primarily interested in the law. I don't believe the American people are foremost in the justices minds. They have become political animals who make law secondary to power politics.
"A whole ton of revisionist history in this. The fact remains: they had the votes before and after the leak, the took the case before the leak, they negated the will of the majority of people before the leak. The leak was never a problem for these people, they wanted to destroy the will of the majority of Americans, that's the sole reason they were put there."
Amy Coney Barret be smiling at SC portraits like she deserves to be there.
Beach of trust you crook
"...are we still complaining about having lost Roe v Wade? It's awful, genuinely, but there are so many other stories that the news should be tackling and refuse to. Obviously this is about politics and power, you'd be dumb to expect anything else. The fact this is still in the news cycle shows that it's not a pressing issue, but a distraction from what matters. What is our government doing RIGHT NOW?!"
So do Kantor and Liptak know who leaked the document and why and just can't say due to journalistic ethics or do they literally not know?
At this point there is no one who hates women than the hard Christian right!  We might as well live in Afghanistan and Iran
I have no respect for some of these justices…
"The Supreme Court should take cases regardless of how it appears. They shouldn't take politics into account, at all. This isn't at all like taking gifts."
"Correct me if I’m wrong, ACB pulled a RICO"
Bs
The reason Amy Coney Barret (or whatever her name is) voted against taking up the case so soon after RBG died was because she didn't want to look bad. It wasn't because of some great soul-searching moment she had or anything like that. She didn't want to look like a tacky person plowing into one of RBG's most fiercely protected topics while her chair was still warm.
Abortion is wrong in our eyes as Christians from conception but if not in others and it's legal it should have limits on the age .
Developed feeling pain in a awful degree .
"It's sounds like you want to unsurp God's job. As  which He does a  good 👍   enough job at being😉that  he can have a miscarriage happened or help save both lives if possibe at least   ,  still born rok yes but they do saline abortions up to 21 24 weeks  burning a baby alive in the womb it's wrong morally ."
WHO LEAKED IT THOUGH!? That is the big question that was just kind of dropped by the investigation. Was it a Justive? Was it a staffer? Were there any conaequences whatsoever?
I have very little trust in the US. How many more steps until the country will turn into a religious extremist dictatorship? What is the next step after this -  Remove voting rights for woman as it is against gods will for woman to have rights?
"no one is entitled to anyone else's body, period."
"That is a huge pile of male bovine fecal matter. 
Talk to a Lady named Anita Hill! 
Yet the so called justice got approved to the Supreme Court. 
Money Talks..... Lady Justice is supposed to be blind but Lady Justice can here money talking!"
"What does it matter if she voted against hearing it? 6 minus 1 is still more than the 4 they needed. I don't care about symbolic actions that do nothing. She just wanted to protect her own optics and when push came to shove, she still voted to axe Roe v Wade."
Yeah not always true. I have electric heat in each room.
This conservative majority in the supreme court is an abomination and an embarassment. They're overtly political agents.
"The Supreme Court is a farce. Anytime they split party lines, we know it is politics. When that 5-4 vote wins, we know something is deeply wrong with the justices. Not always with the ruling, but with those who are on the bench. 

1) Term limits 
2) Unanimous decision rulings required
3) Only 3 justices ruling per case, selected unanimously by the other justices 
4) At year 5, a congressional review of the Justice or opportunity to step down"
So this entire decision was made on partisan buddy politics and not actually the word of the constitution. Nice to finally have confirmation the supreme court IS IN FACT PARTISAN
I'm for abortion up to the 240th trimester in certain cases.
For some reason I thought that the court wasn’t deciding the issue until they’ve heard all of the evidence from both sides.  Silly me!!!!
Who cares? Barrett voted to overturn Roe and that is what matters.
Democrats can’t tell you what a woman is. They think men can get pregnant.
Trumps judges all lied to get on the bench. They knew before they even got on the bench they were going to do what they could to over turn Roe. They have a lot of nerve to have a problem with the leak. They have no respect for the seat as liars don’t belong in the Supreme Court. The most honest people should be on its highest court.
Worst SCOTUS ever!   Impeach Alito and Thomas.   Amend constitution to install term limits for the justices.  Continually monitor their gifts (bribes).
"Besides Trump, our Supreme Court has become a group of crooks and liars and that should say alot about the right wingers taking control of our nation. 1 thing at a time."
"VOTE BLUE IN 2024! BIDEN, AND ALL DEMOCRATS!"
"It’s crystal clear that ramming these judges through was an agenda to overturn law and precedent. To rewrite laws based on religion, not law. It’s an attack on the court system from within."
"This leak shouldn't shock anyone, Supreme Court Justices are merely humans with their own individual opinions of right and wrong and stockholders with investments in a variety of corporations. Our socio-political landscape has always been a battle between theocratic and secular ideals. Add to that the intelligence/organized crime, corporation/government partnerships running our world's economies, and what we end up with are three branches of government (legislative, executive and judicial) focused solely on social baby sitting a population brought up with nonsensical beliefs in an invisible primate-deity. Our entire understanding of right and wrong in based in false dogmas and non-existent gods. We need a new plan."
Yeah more free gifts & vacations from trump for the Republican judges!!!
From the river to the sea
Could we not say “abortion leak”? Wordsmithing is a thing.
"I trusted SCOTUS but no more. It's bipartisan now , Not law. Thomas is on the take with all his freebees. He is own by the rich."
"Judges at Any level should not have a Personal Opinion on any legal review. Especially at the Highest level. I realize it’s not always realistic for personal opinions Not to influence a ruling. When a judge is at Any level of appeal, it should simply be was the original decision wrong Legally. Was something done wrong that would change the outcome?  When it comes to a person’s right, is the existing law or decision unconstitutional, nationally or locally?  The reversal of Roe didn’t say abortion is wrong, it simply stated that the law should be made Locally not nationally.  States are already making laws, but in My opinion, it should be made by a referendum Before the State congress makes decisions. Some states say no abortion for Any reason after 6 weeks, which is Ridiculous."
Your judicial system needs a complete reset; it appears to be corrupted by politics from top to bottom.
This is just wasting our time.
I find this to be a total abomination that one person one vote can affect tens if not a hundred millions of Americans That's just playing NUTZ!
The comment section is gonna be a place of civil discourse with no vitriol whatsoever.
"Trump, Kavenaugh and Thomas are the main reasons why abortion should be legal because cowards will never admit to taking advantage. A woman should always have the final say when it comes to her body regardless. The outcome is between the woman and GOD"
"All of this because RBG hubris refusing to retire while Obama was in the office and the Dem controlled both chambers of Congress.

Yea, the GOP packed the court and overturned the RvW but the Dem party also played with your life by thinking and assuming Clinton would win and she can name RBG's replacement. Instead of being responsible, they played with this and the people ended up paying for it"
It was a left wing democrat.
"these asswipes were hoping to publish their ruling and then skip off on vacation right after and hide until the firestorm blew over, but someone thankfully LEAKED the details out and they were caught red handed LOL!!!!"
"I mean... are they an objectively evil, immoral person? Or are they pro-choice?"
Hoping the overturning Roe v Wade means states mamdate you have to get vaccinated and must donate your organs at death
"To be fair we didn't need that leak. The GOP has made it their goal for half a century to overturn Roe v.  Wade whether it's Constitutional or not. The second there was a Republican majority made by Trump, I knew Roe v. Wade was dead."
CIA or NSA leak
This Court is a sham.  They lie to Americans.  They take money from foreign governments.  They have become so political it’s sad.
The supreme court. More like the S. court.
You can't trust fellow criminals chief Justice.
The Republican Supreme Court is a corrupt and dishonest body  - The idea that no one is above the law is up for sale and the conservertives have cornered the market.
It terrible that the majority of the SCOTUS is slimy.
Moscow Mitch. Creep.
Reps are nothing but Confederate trash.
Six criminal's.
I bet at least two Justices made a large bundle off this vote.
"gotta give them crazy Jesus Bible thumpers due credit, cause MAN can they get stuff done. they been plotting and scheming and got it done!!

unlike democrats who just lie out their buts about Healthcare for all, free tuition for public college, maternity and paternity leave, they've done absolutely nothing."
"This is what happens when you elect a bunch of unqualified conservative judges to the highest court in the nation.  They can't even make basic decisions about the law without letting their emotions, opinions, and the people that OWN them tell them what to do."
Corrupt Clarence Thomas needs to go. Let's start there.
The Supreme Court is full of frauds.
"We are so proud of our democracy here in the US. We shout our conviction that we live in the best country in the world. When we look at the facts, we see that our democracy is railroaded by neo conservatives who weaponize the supreme court. How can we allow a political party to own our freedom? How can we allow them to hold up a legal nomination of a moderate justice so that he can be replaced with an ultra right politician? I fought and bled for our country, I thought. But now I realize I lost my youth and my health for no reason but the political aims of a morally bankrupt President. My country is sliding into third world status and nobody seems aware of it."
The conservative Supreme Court with their black robes is a corrupt court.
Free American people need to rise up most other countries in Europe fight for their rights and we need to do that
"Not exactly a bombshell. She still voted to restrict abortion rights to women. There's nudging to think about. She's the Trump of SCOTUS justices, compared with the Washington, General of Equality, RBG"
Call it what it is -- a conspiracy of parties on the Supreme Court that actively worked to overthrow settled law.
"We knew. We saw it coming. I hope the clerks, who do actually have enormous sway over the rights of US citizens,  will be vetted beyond their political attractiveness to Leo, Federalist or Heritage going forward. Congress could and should enact auditing or IG for SCOTUS staff, who are paid by tax dollars."
Total lie.
He gave us moral  absolutes that are  what our court systems agree with do not murder don't steal etc it's a crime punishable by law .
"And hope they do not decide your life is worthless too . ,God bless."
We decl care that all men are created  equal   and given  inalienable  rights the right to life  the right to Liberty  and the right  to happiness  by God .
"The Supreme Court consists of a Christian conservative majority (thanks to pressure from ex President Trump and the Christian Right Wing) now making Christian conservative decisions and opinions.
As an atheist that does not recognize the existence of the Christian god Yahweh/Jesus, I find their ruling that overturned legal abortion irrelevant."
What I'm hearing is the final decision on abortion was made long before the Court even heard the case.
It does not mean she is against repeal only it would look bad for her...
"Other than Roberts, the other 5 conservative justices are way more concerned with advancing conservative policy than being neutral arbiters of the Constitution.   To them, overturning Roe v Wade is the main reason why they were appointed.   That is what they truly believe was their job description.  Not to objectively interpret the Constitution, but to advance the conservative agenda.  As an attorney (and someone who cares deeply about the law), I find that extremely sad.   I don't even care one way or the other about abortion.  I care about the Constitution and what it means to this great country.  Stare decisis means more to me than any particular substantive issue.  I get that if legal precedent is clearly erroneous, it should be reversed as society becomes more enlightened and as certain past draconian views become obsolete/intolerable by society.  The Court in Brown v. Board of Education was right to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson (which by the way was a 9 - 0 unanimous decision, which indicates the prior decision in Plessy was clearly erroneous).  But ignoring stare decisis should never be used to go backward like in this case.   Also, ignoring stare decisis should only be done with a unanimous or near unanimous decision, not a 6-3 split like in this case where the decision is made on partisan lines."
So constitution says judge serve based on good behavior so Clarence Thomas has not behaved good so he could be impeached!!
Scouts is a breach of trust
"Clearance wife is the one who leak it!,"
"Bombshell? No new information, just a bunch of speculation based on  ""anonymous sources"" that could easily not exist. I wonder why reporters expect total trust when they have shown many times that they don't hesitate to lie ann misled based on political, economical, and social inclinations. By the way I respect Kamtor's tone, it does not seems she is trying to blow the stuff out of proportion or building a narrative."
"The Supreme Court may think they are the Boss, but they aren't & everyday goes bye, they show their backside in the wind. But the day is coming, when they will be swept aside with the other trash & the good Lord will reign. Their unjust ways will be no more..."
Direct descendants of Spanish Inquisition!
"It was nothing more than pushing a religous agenda. That is all it ever was and they have tried to overturn it for years, but did not have the majority to do it. THIS is WHY the GOP wanted Trump in."
The first thing I want is for MEN to shut up your vote came when you impregnated the Woman who is in charge of childbirth.  The LAST thing I want is a Woman to have a child who does not want a child!  Any Questions?
"NO WONDER WE STOPPED HEARING ABOUT THE LEAK. It went from being a travesty against America to ""oh well""... once it became undeniable that it was a conservative who leaked it."
Sad our highest court is owned:-(
"Person 1 : *does backflip*
Person 2 : ( who cant do backflips)  We should ban backflips lol
America in a nut shell.."
Who wants to bet the leak was Justice Alito (again) and they’ll blame it on a staffer.
"Im thinking once Biden wins his second term he will add judges. We need to make our SCOTUS liberal bc the definition of being liberal is accepting and understanding ALL. Being Republican means you will judge and rule based on your religion, not for all Americans."
"The court’s decision was based on religious views, not the rights of women."
Who cares if Barrett was hesitant? In the end she did what she was picked to do; take rights away from women.
Superb work.  Great article.  I believe Alito lied and leaked so he could lock in the vote he knew he had risk of losing.
The leak came from the GOP appointed judges.
"This logic concerning Ruth and justices waiting for her death does not make sense.  She was NOT a legaly valid justice some time BEFORE her death. - requires siting for the bench , not at home where no one actualy knowes if its really even HER VOTES!!!!"
Amazing how they think more babies are going to be born. I see more birth control being used.
"Alito leaked it, clearly."
"so basically it was not a legal decision. They had already made up their minds and just wanted it to come before them so they could essentially stomp on it.
DISGUSTING!!!
I don't know how anyone could ever trust the supreme court ever again!!!"
They are all racist Crooks!!!!💯💯🤫🤫🤫🦉
HOW COULD 51%+ OF US CITIZENS NOT FEEL THAT SCOTUS IS A BREECH OF CONSTITUTIONAL TRUST?
"Personally, I believe that Originalism in Constitutional interpretation is as uninformed hermeneutically as Fundamentalism is in Islamic, Jewish and Christian doctrine, each is more about personal certainty and power than it is about genuine interaction with a text."
Congratulations America - you have a corrupt supreme court!
The justices should be disbanded for dishonest behavior and bribery
The conservatives supreme Court is a threat to American democracy now that they've been overturned roe v Wade they're coming for voting rights and then they're going to come for interracial marriage just you wait.  The evangelicals won't stop until we are living in a religious theocracy just like Iran.
"Notice Alito is the only one not looking at the Camera, weird."
Anybody know who the SCOTUS members are?
Wow another overhyped nothing Burger of a report from MSNBC
Sam Seder called it when it happened
"I would say vote blue but the Dems are ok with anything that's ""technically legal"" and will bend over backwards to ""reach across the isle"" no matter how many americans the republicans harm."
Abortion is manslaughter murder
Ban abortion
"SCOTIS has 6 greedy, corrupt, lying judges.   I hate those 6 judges with all my soul."
Thomas's wife was the leak - duh! I knew this within seconds of hearing happen. It is so painfully obvious.
"The right organizes.  There is a ""deep state"" of right-wing activists who have planned an end to abortion for decades.  Planned it while the left talked about ""bi-partisanship"" and ""reached across the aisle.""  It would be nice if the left recognized that it's in a fight between an open inclusive society and Christofascism."
Is anyone surprised that Kavanaugh would lie and deceive....completely consistent with his confirmation testimony.
The damage is done. Its always the people who suffer from currupt decisions ... which is politically all day every day. What says c and his besti. Please
"Prison cell for Trump, Putin, Clarence, and Rudy 2024"
"Since when under our Constitution does the SC make laws?  Oh, since we have the Roberts/Trump Court.  They don’t believe in our Constitution nor follow, their #1 job is to destroy it for a Trump dictatorship!"
Abortion is murder.
The overturning of Roe vs Wade was entirely politically and self serving.  To maintain profits the corporations need workers and consumers.  Handmaiden Tales has some truth to it.
"Laws made by men (or women) can't last forever, just like the men and women that enact them"
We should never forgive Ginsberg for not retiring under Obama.
"""Politics and power?""

No.  The politics and power grab involved the original 1970's Roe v. Wade SCOTUS decision.

The issue belongs with the states, period.  There's a big flippin' reason this is the United States of America and not the All Seeing, All Knowing, Knows what's Best for Everyone, Big Daddy switch-wielding federal government."
They have got make sure thier anti christ is born.
And this changes nothing 😢
Honestly most surprised that a women and a black man did that to their own
"Stutter, sputter. Can't they get a guy that can speak well?"
From day one of the death of RBG I did not trust that she died of her cancer. My information at that time was that she was just getting better after some therapy. At the same time all media discussed Russian interference in U.S. elections without identifying any action of them specifically. Her death came last second for a new nomination by Trump and a possible elector boost. That was just too convenient to a possible interference with infamous Russian poisoning. My mind made this all up and  I wondered that apparently nobody else considered it. Then again I also saw January 6 coming before most other people. Anyway I remain in my belief and would appreciate if someone could give me factual information which could change my belief.
"This is all just noise. 

Doesn't matter: RvW is overturned."
The Supreme Court was never supposed to be partisan! We need to  impeach criminals in the SCOUTUS.
"It`s broken the US supreme court, NO politician shoud apoint a judge, other judge`s do that else it`s not divided and not free of politic`s... 
That`s what a normal Democrcy work`s, in the 3 branches like it`s surposed to be..."
They are garbage!
Stupidity reigns supreme in America
The supreme court’s lost all respect from the people of America
"isnt it great that a reporter will dig for news but wont give source, no one will trust me again if i tell who it was, so i am guessing the reporter just like the judges, presidents, ex predidents, senators, congress persons put their careers above the people, in this case mostly women, the lives of the people of the usa"
"I do not understand how this Supreme Court thinks they have the right to stop a woman or anybody else from murdering a child......
 Its your child and you should have the choice to murder your child.
 What a bunch of sickos in this world."
"Amy has not real opinions nor does she have the skills needed to be on the court, she was picked just to vote with the boys, she is a traitor to women!! Feel sorry for her children especially her daughters!"
VILE bunch in that thumbnail.  VILE LYING and EVIL
Women are not property anymore. Get the courts to prove that definition. It sounds like women are still being oppressed. It needs to stop.
"This issue should never have been a court issue in the first place, never out of the doctor's office and patient. But, there were billions to be made for the agenda. It only went back to the states 10th Amendment.  It was about MONEY from the get go, not health, not women, but power and MONEY."
"Judge should not be political, only interpret,"
Even Ginsburg said Rowe wasn't a valid ruling! It just passes it back to the States.
"Now that we've seen the sadistic consequences of overturning Roe, was it worth dividing the nation by your dogmatic decision?"
"CONGRESS, Not the Supreme Court needed and still needs to make the proper laws codifying the right to abortion and specifying the limits and rules that are or are not needed.  In this interview, she talks about them considering a 15 week rule and such.  THAT's NOT their job.  They are supposed to INTERPRET the existing laws.  CONGRESS needs to do their job as usual."
This is the best court the republican party could buy??
Robert's breach of trust is a good way to put it . But who's trust are you saying ? The American people trust the court anymore ?
No wonder they gave the green light for police to lie as they did the same during their Senate interviews. how much does it cost for a vote as we now know at least some of them can be bought on vacation.
"The corruption and greed of Clarence Thomas are blatant and obvious he put his gavel on sale to the highest bidder this is illegal he has betrayed the trust of every citizen and he deserves to be prosecuted and held accountable for destroying the trust the world had for the highest court in America 
VOTE BLUE 🗳 SAVE AMERICA"
To think I have respected the supreme court’s ruling most my life. Now I am not even sure if they care how rule affects the people of our country. It makes me very sad for this country. And the future of this nation.
"The Protestants were right to fear a Papist Court when Kennedy won the Presidency. The Republican-appointed are all on the take and anti-American POS! They follow Pius XII, who thought Hitler's ""final solution"" was a swell idea. They even have their own blöd Führer in Trump.

"Is being a Supreme Court Justice about scholarship anymore? 

This is why people are foregoing University, they don't want to become sophists like these people."
I think what we need is more old white guys in the Supreme Court. Ugh!
Neither Kamala nor any of the other pro-abortionists can answer when a fetus is considered another human being.
Stop political appointments for the Supreme Court.  Vet canidates then use a lottery system to choose the canidate.  Remove the politics and the allegiances required for the nomination.  These people should be non political and only there for one thing.  To interpret the law without bias.
I just wonder do they ever go to bed at night thinking  how their SC will be remembered in history as one of the most corrupted SC in United States History. They are the worst of the worst of humans even if they don’t believe they are the world knows they are.
"this lady is too close in. take a step back. Barret had within a matter of months declared that Roe was settled law in front of the entire country. she was hoping to put distance between her and the lie before she'd have to admit it was a lie. once the cat was out of the bag, she voted exactly how she was intended to vote all along. ain't no mystery. just an attempt to save face.
     I think the leak was a good thing. it forced their hand in time to cost them every election since. and it's going to continue to cost them every election. purple states are going to turn blue over this one, and red states are going to turn purple. we already know what the women of ohio think of it. will be interesting to see what the women of Texas will do with their own personal ""gilead"""
Pure unadulterated corruption!
Republicans nothing like having your own court
"US SCOTUS is the New World Clown Show.  When things start going down hill, it runs away from you pretty quick - FAR quicker than you guys and gals figured, ya?  (Well, some of you at least.)  Now, HOW LONG will it be an embarrassment to be a SCOTUS Justice?  I THINK they are responsible for that.  My guess is it will be for some time."
"The supreme court is not an abortion. 
Scrotus rules ok.
And can someone stop judging amy.
The kicker. 
Hows this for a fun fact (roe) not her real name is a born again christian now and doesnt believe in abortion. 
Oh america youve done it again."
"We know who did it and so do they, there is not process for investigating these black robes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Tl;dr: It was Alito... Obviously.
Oh really you don't say???? Now that you see the real cost it's costing your party you are scrambling to do something abt it shame on you you liers and thieves....
"Their GARBAGE 🗑 I used to respect @SCOTUS more than anything but I say there's at least 4 that need to be impeached & have great reason to back it up. Their disgusting ❗️

Also, what's the value in doing anything as far as states' rights if SCOTUS can just come right behind, with this knucklehead group that lies under oath, & undo everything you've done."
"We do not believe them in the Supreme Court, nor do we trust them. Barrett lied Kavanaugh lied and I don’t even know what to say about Thomas I wish we would get more Supreme Court justices that are fair and follow the constitution."
"Yes Supreme Court bought, paid for corrupt judges bought and paid for by billionaires and instated on Court by trump.  So of course this corrupt government will rule FOR TRUMP.
We have NO JUSTICE IN AMERICA."
"Yeah but.  He DEFINITELY,,had to get,,,ELECTED,,,sooo,,,how’s,,that working for you????  Not so good. HUH????    Well,,,that’s EXACTLY what Happens,,,when you,,CHEAT!!!!"
States can do what they want. No one stopping them.
"Well,,,Once we gain Power,,over both,,the senate and the House of Representatives,,,all will be,,OK!!!"
EXACTLY!!!
Was this really four days old or an attempt to keep abortion top of mind for the elections?
"Why is she making excuses? This is the problem, people need to stop soft peddling this nonsense and just call it as it is. Conservative Republicans did what they said they were going to do. There was no nuanced discussion or debate on abortion......"
"That’s exactly what they did!!! And they wonder why the American people see them the way they do, because that’s who they are !!"
"When that putrid curtain is pulled back, that’s behind the supreme court it’s gonna show a scared little orange man just like in the Wizard of Oz all these people have been like the flying monkeys and melania will melt"
"The abndonment of reason and logical rationality in such high legal decieons, and replaced by political manouver means the U.S.Supreme Court is no longer  a defender of legal right and truth. It is a buyable political agent of others. It has undermined its high role and besmirched itself badly. It has also galvanised huge numbers of woemn who are very angry at this intrusion into their personal liberties."
"Reporting is disingenuous,  Barrett did not switch sides, she merely acted to withhold facts from the American people."
OMG I thought that was a guy 🤣
When does a law become a crime? Cruel and unusual punishment prohibition stated in state constitution?... Medical privacy between licenced medical proffessional provider and patient and legitament decisions... Pregnacies and medical risks are not created equal and one size fits all bans or laws of an abstract ideology cannot be regulated and force non medical and political interferences.... Political malpractice and medical imposters do not protect anyone!
"So now we are giving ACB credit for being reasonable? Really? All she did was play hardball in a futile attempt to avoid being vilified for the rest of her life as a republican political patsy...but we all know thats exactly what she is otherwise her monumentally hypocritical appointment in the last days of a failed republican presidency wouldnt have happened in the first place. She deserves credit for being politically savvy...not for being reasoned and impartial. Her placement on the court is as corrupt and illegitimate as Kavanagh and Gorsuch, even if she didnt exactly lie under oath as they did. She prevaricated better than they did because she is smarter than they are. So call her what she is ..an extreme maga political activist who will go down in history as a traitor to women and a lynchpin of the movement to destroy american democracy. Because lets face it..women are the canaries in the coal mine anywhere and any time authoritarianism is on the rise. Gimme a break."
ONE MAJOR PROBLEM  WE THE PEOPLE HAVE E-UH WE DO NOT HAVE ENUFF N WORDS AS JUDGES ON THE SCOTUS! ESPECIALLY FEMALE N WORDS!!
"A known billionaire is sucking up to these Republicans and they all know that eventually they will be rewarded for their actions in helping the ultra right wing dangerous morons. Not directly, as they know they can be traced, but it will happen...one, along with his wife, is already getting a lot of money just because he threatened to leave this phony court and be replaced by a Democrat...it's a strange justice department, this highest court, filled with quid pro quo people, all on the right."
If they want to complain about a breach of trust perhaps they should look at themselves and how the American people cannot trust them. It's time to change things up in that old lying supreme court.
How can a SC nominee tell Congress on their confirmation say RvW is settled law then turn around and and say RvW is unconstitutional?  Says a lot about lying justices and a lazy Congress.
Let me guess. It was Trump's fault in the end
Murder is bad
"There's no ""bombshell"" it's just a stupid who caresshell"
"Gosh, I thought that corruption was endemic only in African countries😂"
"Nevermind the fact that roe was decided far too broadly.  ""Roe ventured too far in the change it ordered and presented an incomplete justification for its action"". -RBG"
This edition of the supreme court is an abortion. A LEGAL ABORTION. Stare decisis be damned.
"I wonder who could have possibly leaked this opinion … 🤔

Schmarence Schmomas. 🤫

We first heard about how  SCOTUS planned to rule in a leak from Congress’ Hateful Eight. Everyone also knows which Justice has the strongest, or at least the most obvious, ties to MAGA."
Ginsburg did the country a disservice by not retiring when a Democrat was in The White House.
So why those justice can lie during confirmation and has no consequences???
Republikkkans hate Americans
Thank you to The New York Times! 💙💙💙
The breach of trust was them lying in their questioning at their vote to be a judge
"Psalm 139:13-16
Jeremiah 1:5
🙏🏻"
The coloured judge let all coloured people down by being absolutely brainless…😡
"Roberts was so interested in investigating the leak. And then nothing.

He found the leak and didn't want admit it was a conservative justice or staffer"
"Roberts was so interested in investigating the leak. And then nothing.

He found the leak and didn't want admit it was a conservative justice or staffer"
The way I see it a few of the SCOTUS lied under oath and set precedent for all to be able to lie under oath and face no consequences.
She was a worthless guest. She gave no meaningful information.
Such a surprise that Kavanaugh is playing fast and loose with his role.... said NOBODY🙄
"MSNBC: I continue to wish you were better. News speaks for itself, let influencers pretend the public needs to be emotionally charged to click on their videos. 'Bombshell' is opinion, the story is real.. let it be. When you stop sucking, I'll tune in."
This is the most corrupt & classless SC we've ever had
"Jodi Kanter seems to be trying very hard to make the story about Barrett's decision, but I'm with Chris Hayes here, the real story is that they tried to do this as quickly as possible after RGB's death while trying very hard to make it look like they weren't."
Lester Holt can you answer Vivek's question.  Why did you lie to America.  Why are you fake news. Vivek exposed msnbc and it has yet to defend itself from the allegations.
Judge dies and then they over turn Roe v. Wade? There's a movie they killed the judges they may want to watch - The Pelican Brief.
MSNBC IS THE ENEMY OF AMERICA
Gee ya suppose Gini Thomas had anything to do with that leak?
Oh it was settled alright. Should’ve dug a little deeper and asked them to explain more. Classic doublespeak.
"I don't care about the leak, I care about the decision to overturn roe v wade."
"You forgot to mention that Justice Ginsberg supported the relitigation of Roe because it was flawed and was not decided on the text of the Constitution. That was obviously true as many other recognized legal and constitutional experts had said the same thing for many years and decades. There is a strong case to be made that the issue should be legislated by congress and not 9 members of the court, but congress has still not passed a law on making abortion legal which shows that Roe was not ""settled law"". Why doesn't the legislature carry out their constutional role and responsibility to pass a law? This has caused a great deal of public unrest since Roe was decided."
"So I’ve noticed something.. all these people were worried about how they would look, but no one even considered how it would affect people."
"Alito is the chief person of interest, hands down! 
I, like many Americans, have lost confidence in the SCOTUS. I’ve always believed the SCOTUS was concerned about protecting the rights of our citizens… Sadly, I’m no longer of that opinion!"
Why is it saying this is 3 days old?
"There was never a ""right to abortion"", there was a right to privacy on the issue of abortion.   That was what Roe decided.    In another case, the Court decided to limit abortion on viable fetuses.     Now, they changed their mind - protecting a baby's life is indeed a function of the government and overruled Roe.

Bottom line, the liberals did it to themselves.   They just had to have later and later abortions for perfectly viable babies, then babies born alive then murdered on the operating table, then harvesting organs.   Despicable act after despicable act from abortion providers was the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back."
What happened to the Supreme Court not being anti-American? The breach of trust is the fact that the Supreme Court has been guilty of openly attacking Americans 24/7/365 since the decision to abolish Roe was announced. The leaker is the only person involved not guilty of attacking the American people.
"About Barrett: No it doesn’t, there is nothing profound or fascinating"
"Regardless of the excuses given, the reality is that this extremely conservative Supreme Court is poised to deprive women in this country of their inherent rights under the U.S. Constitution. This Supreme Court has unequivocally shown itself to be deeply corrupt, willfully negligent, and a threat to the nation. Period. When the highest court in the land engages in bribery and attempts to self-regulate its own corrupt ethics, the entire country will inevitably face the resultant consequences."
The most corrupt branch of government
"dred scott was once considered settled law.  it's horrible they overturned rvw, but nobody should consider any decision irreversible, especially now that dobbs is on the books."
"There is gun control. With gun control, nobody blames the target. So men have the bullets, (sperm), yet woman are controlled by “said bullet/gun holder”."
They fined the doctor that performed an abortion on a 10 year old r@pe victim. One of the politicians even going as far as to say she should have been forced to give birth. Are you really surprised. If that was your daughter would you force her to have the child? Would you stay home to care for the newborn as the 11 year old mother repeats 5th grade ?
Republicans thought overturning Roe would help them win elections. They were very wrong about that
So who leaked it?
"Playing with America based on their affiliation to the GOP Party! Without the Leak and this investigative reporting after the mess. We now see that someone interfered all along. So my remedy is to replace every justice that Trump appointed since it was illegal how he got into office and why he's sitting in a courtroom today. If the Founders of the Constitution didn't see this crap happening, then we need to Amend the Constitution to cross-correct these corrupt individuals. We have to put America back on track for the People, not these politicians or career-driven people like George Santos and Clarence Thomas are great examples."
"It’s intellectually disingenuous to say that news of a deliberation locks you into a position you weren’t already locked into.
I highly doubt the leak cemented anyone’s position."
"Old racist white supremacist judges are totally ignorant and DO NOT care about the reality of a woman who DOES NOT want to raise a child 18 years without financial support from the father just because of a one night stand of 5 minutes. They are bastardized in their 1950 view that all women seeking an abortion are happily married and have money to care for a baby. NO. Women/teenagers have UNWANTED pregnancies because there are NO women's clinics for low income women to get birth control. This causes a strain on foster homes. The adoption legal fees are $30-50,000."
In peoples eyes . God always shows mercy to the repentant  soul .
The other sometimes a unremorsefull person being served justice  .
"I don't understand why it's a problem that the trust of conservative SC justices has been breached when you consider that they've lied to us about their intention to not overturn Roe v Wade, and they've violated ethics standards like taking bribes from people whose cases they're presiding over.  The SC tried to hide the decision from the public.  and the leak breached THEIR trust.  No, our trust in the conservative justices has been breached, egregiously."
"The US doesn’t want to do anything to protect their kids from getting shot at schools, so they’ll just replace them with unwanted children. Great job."
RGBs legacy will always be colored for me by her inability to make the choice to step down during Obama's last term and keep us from being in this situation.
"Lester Holt uses ""bombshell"" as often I use ""hi"". He sure can read a teleprompter, he reads the 48 Hours script as if he were doing the Nightly News, same writers I bet."
What a disgraceful SCOTUS…
MSM bombshells are hilarious.
MERICA!
So most likely it was a Republican that leaked...
Why aren't more people talking about this new part of the story?
"imagine being so overly ""fair"" that you ignore and obfuscate the blatant truth. It was done for political reasons. There was no ""oh well this makes it look like it was possibly done for political reasons."" are you stupid or scared? Because it's like saying the earth ""could be round"""
My body! My Choice!
"The votes against Roe v. Wade were planned from the start, that's why this was kept hidden, not because of this woman's fantasy that maybe the conservatives would have voted against conservatism if they'd just been allowed to do their secret process in peace. It's insulting to all the people affected by the court's behavior to say that these judges might have done ANYTHING but stick to their plan"
"All of this being said, will the right of a woman to control her own body in the united states of america?"
The Shady Six are not law scholars. They're far right political activists holding two stolen seats hostage.
"Huh, how's that investigation going??  Will there be a report anytime soon?? It's been well over a year now. Or did they not like the answer."
"Barrett's gesture to vote to not take the case was just empty theatre.  She knew as well as anyone they had the votes to take it without her.  It gives her the opportunity to say that she ""did the right thing"".

She didn't recuse herself when they ended up taking it."
There was a big foardian slip right ther.
We need better ethics oversight of the court.
All of them are liers
"Say anything about it you want.
Everyone knows that it was a progressive person who leaked it.
Hoping they could force them to change their Decision.
And somehow you act like this is perfectly fine.
Shows everyone how little character this Network has 😂"
"every headline has to have bombshell, shocking, blasts in it - constant violent imagery, so American."
SCOTUS is CORRUPT
"The Supreme court wants us to respect them and trust them. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in my opinion the last of her kind. They waited until she passed away and then spit and peed all over her grave by overturning Roe vs Wade. So...were those lavish gifts that non of us could dream of affording, Kickbacks or bribes? I'm sure they were both. So now here we are, and they expect us to trust them with the integrity of democracy and the Constitution. You say it was only one supreme court judge that accepted these gifts for rulings or was her just the one who got caught. The people are watching"
"Poopaganda 💩
Enjoy"
Abolish Human Abortion!
"Republicans are the American version of the Taliban.

Women are things."
"All of this comes down to the 2016 election (and McConnell blocking Merrick Garland).  Had HRC just won, this wouldn't be a thing.  Hillary cost the country Roe.  I hope she realizes that.  Her utter failure as a candidate has had a decades long, negative impact to the country."
"What I don't understand, is why the Democrats don't apply the law to the Supreme Court justices. We know for a fact there is no doubt that these people lied to the United States congress in order to get these positions. The law says if they lie to the United States Senate and House of representatives, that they have committed perjury, and they should be impeached."
"The fact that they are appointed by the politicians means they are political. 
All supreme Court appointees should be hired and fired by their peers"
"It means nothing.  I hate that reporters try to romanticize this stuff.  They wanted to overturn it, so they did.  That's it, that's all.  It was a 40+ year long game they played and we let them win. 

I'm still side eyeing RBG because she should have retired when a Dem was president but she put her stock in Hillary and this is where we are."
At what point are enough white people without so much money hurt enough that they get fed up with this corrupt court and the corrupt GOP?😂
"An 'investigative reporter' thinks 'Publicans can be swayed.

I think she needs to go continue investigating."
Obama failed when he rolled-over on his nomination. Justice Ginsberg failed to retire at an appropriate time.
You mean the Supreme POTUS did something inappropriate and ethical? So what?
How sad is the legal profession as a whole when members of the SUPREME COURT are PROVEN LIARS....... just pathetic.
"""Inappropriate and intended to interfere in the process"" just when Justice Breyer was considering joining the liberal 15 week ban. This strengthens my point that Justice Alito was responsible for the leak. It ""cemented"" the votes to Alito's advantage."
The reason Democracy is difficult though is that there is so much corruption  here that occurs with the voting...and it opens every single one of you up to coups...so...I would get a feel from what a country needs and make sure their people like it and put them in there...also some regions need much stronger staying power in terms of leadership to prevent war and couping and conflict...so for those regions like the middle east I would have a different approach...for their own good.  Its not about oppressing their people its about securing their security so we don't everyone attacking and going after one another like its a hobby.  I really hate ongoing war.  Its horrific. This place doesn't spin on suffering.  The suffering and rampant abuse must stop.  It must stop.  Universal income is the quickest way to do that.  No social scores just give it out flat $3500/ month to everyone on the planet.  Take away from those with over a billion as no one needs that much and redistribute.  It's not that hard.  We start there.
why are these SC judges appointed for life ?
"They ( the court) w a super theocratic fascist majority representation  of ,in just the court….. represents the minority in of the American 
public opinion…. This is  the virtual end of trust in the SC."
"On the Supreme Court’s Dobbs leak, many of us floated the “he who smelt it dealt it” theory that Alito might’ve done it himself.
And the fact that SCOTUS dropped the investigation advocated by people who said the leak destroyed the Court and none of them have objected adds to that."
"Why are we paying more attention to the leak than we are to the fact that Kavanaugh and Barrett both said that Roe was settled law and they wouldn’t overturn it. 

They lied. How can you trust the integrity of a SC justice that lies to get their job?"
"What does Barrett's not wanting to take the case--but still voting with the majority--mean? It means that, far from giving a crap about the law, she cares only about her own optics, and she wanted to pretend, in line with her (and Kavanaugh's, and Gosuch's) fake Senate testimony that she considered Roe settled law, that she was objective on the issue."
"From this I draw the conclusion that SCOTUS had already come to a decision before hearing the facts. In effect, the justices were governing rather than arbitrating. Clearly the SCOTUS needs to be saddled with the SJOTUS: Supreme Jury Of The United States to prevent them from governing and restrict them to arbitration."
"The Supreme Court has a problem. Their name, I believe it has gone to their heads. They need more defined rules and term limits. And I never understood why Ruth didn't step down. Maybe Supreme went to her head."
The confirmation hearings are a joke - what is the legal purpose of the confirmation hearings if the nominated (and approved) judges cannot be held accountable to their sworn statements?
"""Breach of trust"": Funny, coming from right-wing members of SCOTUS."
That branch of government is disgraceful. Zero ethics and zero accountability.
"So, politically speaking, the three levels of government are the house, the senate, and the supreme court.
That’s what happens when law takes a back seat to politics."
"SCOTUS, the highest judges money can buy."
The leak shows the deceiving
They waited for ruth to die.  No woman is safe with those judges
I understand 😼
"What are MSNBC, CNN, and other left wing outlets trying to do to our country. The Roe law was sent back to the states for people to vote on rather than have the federal gov't telling us what to do. The left still believe in Korematsu v. United States 1944 and other destruction of civil liberties like DEI. Why is it that the left wants to have the federal gov't dictate our lives, I believe in freedom not fascism."
Possibly the last sitting Supreme Court. It’s no wonder this country turned naxi.
No surprise here.
Need babies for the army
"50 states=50 countries Get over it, Libs."
"Amy worried she might get become a pawn but she is clearly a crazy god extremist person, she believes in Santa too"

This never would have happened 
Republicans cheat to win"
"Tired of men making choices about our body, health & reproduction."
Another ‘bombshell’ headline. Just reporting the news. Not being hyperbolic (and hackneyed).
What I also find concerning is that the anti abortion justices make a decision against abortion before debate and thoughtful consideration of the will of the public. In the end it clearly is a political decision.
"I'm appalled, among many many others across the civilised world,  at aspects of this whole issue and how it is dealt with in your country. On both sides of it. First of all the way women in favour of it as a necessary part of certain aspects of women's  improved medical care and also choice of whether they should be pregnant or not, in often very appalling circumstances. are pirtrayed, and behave, with frankly OTTcheering etc undignifies and trivialises the whole scenario. It does wo m en no service bbc whatsoever.Also the business of the unbalanced political bias of SCOTUS which defies commmon sense. Surely it should always be a balanced set up? Especially as the appointments are for life. How is this never sorted out? Mass public hysteria seems to rule the roost across the justice board on so many issues that require clear, non- emotiional responses at every level. Deplorable , all round."
the supreme court is corrupt and owned by the super wealthy and maga republicans. term limits for the corrupt court six years limit and can not run again.
they already made the decision amongst themselves to overturn RVW before they case was before the court. that is proof that the court is corrupt and the judges involved in overturning RVW should be impeached and disbarred and most likely criminally charged with conspiracy and corruption. they already sold their votes and accepted bribes. but congress will defend the american people from these criminals. this is what the criminals in congress wanted and they support these criminals on the bench.
Republican rats
2:16 - It may look that this is about politics and power. Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat? It MAY? They are appointed by politicians who listen to lobbyists. It's all political!
1:55 lol. The passing of justices helps refresh the law. Like 4 times a century?
Jive bull crap! Trump is trying to be Dictator of the Greatest Democratic Government Ever! The Reick publicant party is DEAD !
"Iti is their bodies. You self-righteous fools have no say! If we wat to be controlled by ignorance & fear, we will go to a church of our choice!  Dose Not belong in Government!"
The ignorance of most of the lefty replies is breathtaking.
SCOTUS is corrupt and illegitimate until all that lied during their confirmation hearing are removed from the bench.
Don’t count on these Trump shills to hold the line when it comes to putting the orange cancer in prison.
"Justice Roberts, do your job!  Alito and his three stooges and both Thomas's are liar's and cheater's taking our rights away and country backwards! Church and State must be separate once and for all or tax churches now!"
Barrett is the same backstabbing gal as in the show Ozark.
Imagine taking away rights and and the people that are always saying their rights are being taken away cheer for it.....
The female justices are the only ones with any backbone and morals.
"If the gallows sat outside each home of SCOTUS… maybe then they would stop leaning over to the side of white Isis /MAGA….

If you’re reminded every day of what your blind support of maga will bring…."
It's not exactly a bombshell if it is so predictable! 💩💩
"When a document that was going to be released anyway gets leaked: This is a breach of trust! We must investigate!
When Clarence Thomas has been accepting very expensive gifts from a Mein Kampf-loving billionaire for many years: *crickets*"
"Root out the Federalist Supreme Court Justices.  We will never have a balanced court with them on the bench. In addition, there have been, for example, so many times when Clarence Thomas should have recused himself when having a conflict of interest, and he did not. They operate at their own will and ideology and even if we are able to purge Trrump, we will still have remnants of his appointees left making the rulings. To give life-time appointments seems not the way to go because you get stuck in their ideological rigidity and resistance."
Today's supreme Court does not represent Even .:0000001 percent of the American people it is no more than a political cult. A  right wing political cult elected by less than 1% of temporary and career politicians who are also on their way to become billionaires through mysterious means?
Whoever the leaker is needs to be charged.
"I’m sorry but I don’t buy that the leak cemented a position. That’s a very convenient excuse, but the deliberative process cannot change bad faith. 
The second the US SC decided to relitigate a closed decision with 85+% public support, they lost all credibility. 

And to say “the leak forced us to double down” is like saying “well it’s ok that my kid lied to my face; I busted them and maybe they’d have changed their mind and come clean”. 

Why are we expecting honesty from the corrupt?"
Thomas is a crooked crimal and he should not cover cing  any thing
They're a bunch of corrupt rightwing liars in this court!
"Blah blah blah
Decision was reversed
Deal with it"
This is what you get for keeping unencrypted memos laying around on their Windows 10 desktops. They make for great influence tools to use. Especially when you hack the judges by weaponizing their individual beliefs against them to plant a trojan.
"The last 3 scj should be removed. 

They lied to get the jobs."
all these old corrupt people deciding a woman's rights is fricken nuts.  non are without sins
"Isn't it pritty disturbing to think the highest court in the land,  can't be trusted."
"I’ve heard this journalist on NPR and now MSNBC. I’m left more irritated each time. It appears as if she’s suggesting the leak potentially caused this outcome or that the justices had no other choice but to stop negotiating. Can we do a deeper dive and ask why they took up this case in the first place? What superficial and lazy investigating. Blaming the leak, even suggesting it, for their ultimate choices? Give me a break."
"Term limits and appointed by national popular vote of 60% or better. A president should still be allowed to appoint these judges, but the nation should be allowed the final vote. It's wrong that a tiny handful of individuals are allowed to determine national law for all. They effectively have more power than any other branch of government as well as the populace. It creates an institution dedicated to upholding corruption."
It will come out that one of Conservative justices leaked the case themselves to cement the votes against Roe. However I have lost all confidence in SCOTUS.
Get your sports equipment armor and face paint ready. The man made apocalypse is coming.
This is what happens when Dems take their eye off the ball on the long game. Biden is up for reelection and the team is wringing their hands about him when they know the alternative will be Trump. Show up and vote or see what else you lose.
Supreme CLOWN COURT     Impeach Thomas  and the three  clowns that lied under oath saying they wouldn’t over turn ROE V WADE
I have even less respect for Barrett now. She cares even more about political optics than taking away women’s rights. Wow!
Everyone knows it was one of the left wing justices
If Trump never got elected. None of this BS would never have happened.. disgusting.
Roberts calls a breach of trust. The whole Supreme Court has been a breach of trust to the American people.
Refuse for what? She knew what her opinion was going to be. Sounds like grandstanding to me.
"""Conservatives"" is now the most disgusting word in English language."
It's simpler than all this.  Trump stacked the court. Case closed. (It all goes back to the votes)
It was Ginni Thomas and it was deliberate
These people clearly bad ! Why are they elected for life that is insane. We all know now Anita Hill was right and Thomas is a freak. Then you got lying Amy and black face judge really?  Laughable
Clarginia Thomas do the right thing and recuse.
Disgusting supreme court’s justices SHAME SHAME
End of an Empire… corruption at our Supreme Court 😢
To the supreme Court
Why would it be OK for the justices to discuss cases outside of deliberations when jurors are told to never do that while a matter was pending?
"I don’t get it; you have more guns in the USA than citizens— men, women and children— yet no one is prepared to “take  arms against a sea of troubles”?"
This is appalling 😢.  Is there no branch of government with honor and integrity 😢
"SC = Supremely Corrupt, Roberts has sold the US democracy to the Highest bidder with ""Citizens United"" and sat around knowing all the while his colleagues are taking bribes from billionaires. He should be tried for treason and corruption. It's only a matter of time before we find out what he's been taking under the table and his false indignation is sickening"
"Happened so methodically that I I even suggested on Fb that could Justice G's death have been... hastened? It's enough that Thomas is still on the bench as crooked, greedy, and bought that he is. SCOTUS is sadly political and sloppy. I can't respect it anymore."
"Yes , there's the root cause of all our problems
They fail to understand that Abortion is a medical procedure
They fail to understand what privacy is
They all collect a paycheck on violating our rights 
If You American soldiers were telling the truth about protecting us you do something about them now"
OK I'm gonna guess that Alito leaked the draft opinion and that the Republican justices were all in on overturning Roe v Wade and were searching around for a vehicle to do it. Now I'm going to listen to the clip.
"This is why other countries no longer look up to the US as a role model, it's politics has become trash."
"They are all deceitful duplicitous, disingenuous, and despicable."
"Hopefully, the Democrats can take power in Congress, then they can draft a bill, that makes Supreme Court justices accountable as other non-justices are.  What applies to normal judges should apply to Supreme Court justices.  It should include that any Supreme Court justice found to be corrupt will automatically be removed from his position and indicted for corruption and have a minimum mandatory jail term of 10 years, with assets ceased in remuneration of their corruption."
There was a good chance that RGB would have voted to overturn it anyway. She was on record saying she would have never voted in favor of Roe and she thought it was a bad ruling.
Was Alito or someone affiliated with him the leaker?
The leak was only inappropriate when they got caught
"In Canada, there is a requirement that all judges, at whatever level, must retire at age 75. That may not be the right age, perhaps could be older, but it makes for way more rejuvenation of the judiciary that in the US, where judges, whether liberal or conservative, can hang on until they become a bit senile. That results in a much less politically perceived judiciary than in the US."
"Why are those for abortion parents didn't believe in abortion.   At least, in their case."
Trump found three judges willing to lie under oath.
In what imagination of the universe is it correct for the minority to dictate the right of the majority?
Who else was thinking jodie was a dude till she started talking?????
Were they waiting till she died?
A puff piece on Justice Barrett? Wow. Why? I am going to say this is allegedly the truth. Allegedly.
Get these judges out of my doctor's office! Get this government out of my pharmacy!
"Kavanagh and others, during their confirmation hearings, all said that Roe V Wade was ""settled law"" and that that was that. Turns out they were all full of crap."
"""Abortion Leak""😄... I'm sorry, that sounds terrible 🤣"
"The breach of trust was the Supreme Court overturning, roe v wade itself like excuse me 😮"
"To me, the most obvious and important point that is constantly overlooked is how blatantly the last 3 'justices' flat-out lied to Congress.  They all swore that they had no predetermined intent to overturn Roe, Swore up and down that ""if"" given the case, they would make their decision solely on the case presented.  They all gave this impression under oath to Congress.    If lying to Congress to get past the required screening process so you can do exactly what you truly were intent on doing, if that isn't an impeachable offense, I can't imagine what else would be.  
Then there's the other two prize-winners; clearly in the pockets of rich special interests that they then sit in judgement on cases involving them.  How is THIS not impeachable?    
I'm not pointing a finger at them because they are on one particular political party or the other.  Only in that their actions are, at minimum, a disgrace to the office of SUPREME Court.  ""Supreme"" suggests that these should be the best-of-the-best.  Turns out their just corrupt politicians just like the rest."
Get the government out of my doctor’s office!
"So much for believing in the court ever again

"This just goes to show you how critical elections are. NEVER skip voting. If you don't use that privilege, you will lose it and you will find you are living under a government that doesn't respect the ideals of the people or the Constitution.

Abort the Court ! ! !
"Was it a death . Or a Murder, I'm perceiving the latter."
"We all know the drunk judge Kavanaugh is a liar. Why do we have to have a drunk judge anyway? I always wondered about that. Aren't there some sober judges around? I have no problem with drunks, as long as their not making decisions that effect my life!"

"I suppose the next thing to bring women under control  is to send them to jail to protect them from gender based violence, like the Taliban is doing in Afghanistan"
Who said Trump never got anything done.
This is a pointless story. Once they made their ruling we knew how they felt.
"@MSNBC This story would be MUCH easier to understand if they would quit using future tense while talking about the past. ""What happens next,"" means it hasn't happened yet. Other times they were using present-tense verbs. That is confusing, and I am well educated. If this usage is mildly, momentarily distracting to me, it will likely make it hard for others to understand at all. Use past tense verbs, please."
Bruh she is placing blame on the leak instead of allowing SUPREME COURT JUSTICES OF THE UNITED STATES to be accountable adults
Don’t we have a system or checks and balances? Why aren’t these judges being punished?
"I think it is political.  Thomas needs to be kicked off the court, he is a crook.  Kavanaugh  is a liar and a pos.  These men need to have their viagra taken away."
Thank God I can't get pregnant. Good luck women! But seriously if that old bat would've retired years ago this wouldn't be an issue.
"more national enquirer reporting from msnbc, time waisted here."
Abortion is murder and needs to be banned.
isn't the removal of roe vs. wade a breach of trust as well?
"Bottom line all is that all of them need to be removed from the court, totally corrupt court without doubt!"
"Here’s the thing.  It has become obvious that these Supreme Court justices have their fingers in many pies.  The corruption of quite a few of them has become public knowledge.  After this piece of information regarding Roe vs Wade has now been revealed it is my opinion that the public trust has been even more damaged, and possibly irrevocably so.  At least for these far right justices.  With that in mind I would think all of these justices should be painfully aware that their decision on whether trump, or anyone else for that matter, including themselves, is above the law.  Their corrupt actions may have hidden for decades, but the truth will always out.  Should trump be ‘gifted’  with the title, ‘above the law’, and he gets back into the Oval Office, he will inevitable proclaim himself Monarch/King and with complete power have the ability to denounce/disband SCOTUS, if not for their redundancy alone, then for their actions in dismissing his cases or their decisions on ruling against him.  Then they will have no cover at all against trump‘s vindictive, hateful, destructive decisions.  For him, throwing the judicial system into utter chaos would be just another day at the golf course for him.  Beware the easy path; inclinations become slippery slopes that may lead to hungry alligators in a pit at the bottom."
Decisions about reproduction should be made by people of reproductive age.
"This report is the first time I have heard why a Supreme Court leak is important and yet its importance had to be stressed by Jodi Kantor.  Granted, Chris Hayes already gets it, but for the rest of us, I am thankful Jodi Kantor emphasized that a Supreme Court leak makes it very difficult for any of the justices to change how they would decide.  As I understand this, during the deliberation process of the justices, as they tentatively state their positions, assuming they will still be able to change their ultimate decisions, an insider may leak an interim point wherein the leaker's desired outcome would be met if this interim point were the final decision.  Thus, by leaking this interim point, the leaker makes it very difficult for any of the justices to change their interim position when making their final decision."
Dear Supreme Court: Human biology and best medical practice don’t differ state to state.  Your Dobbs decision was ignorant and arrogant.
Liar liar robes on fire🤨😒
Why are they doing this again with election around the corner? This is definitely done on purpose
May I introduce Mrs Thomas
"None of this corrupt supreme court people cares about the people, they just want to get all the bribes they can, what a nerve. garbage"
They are horrible
"Corrupt Leader Trump !  Corrupt Adjudicators, courtesy of Trump !  Religion taking control of our democracy !  STOP the MADNESS in Congress. Remove the corruption from among the controllers in SCOTUS !  Doesn't this make sense ?"
"This is no longer the land of the FREE, now is the land ruled by the religionist cruel politicians."
ok So ids anyone going to be held accountable? I feel like these people talk in riddles. Is anyone going to jail or not?
"A politically appointed body with exceptional powers, no accountability and no oversight. What bunch of morons thought this was a good idea?"
Abortion is with the states where it belongs.
"lol ""It can look like politics and power instead of legal reasoning"" - yeah, no duh, Amy. You're an illegitimate court."
"The least legitimate, least informed, least morale Supreme Court in several generations of the United States of America. It's shameful. Hope Roberts is proud of his legacy leading the worst, most corrupt court - perhaps in history."
"lol John Roberts’ “breach of trust” comment is absurd, given it turned out to be a real trickster move and given the times John Roberts has breached trust with the American people, such as Citizens United and Rowe v. Wade."
"One of the Great Mistakes of this court! This is what happens when the Gop catches the car. There were reasons all the other courts upheld Roe v Wade, and they were wise enough to see what the fallout would be. Which shows just how Wise this present court is."
Republicans are evil
"Term limits.

How do we do this?"
Why on earth do judges on the SCOTUS have lifetime powers to shape America according to their own politics? Even a President can only serve 2 terms. It is plainly stupid and as the Judges age they will lose contact with the changes in culture that happen over decades. The law should adapt to the times not live in the past.
"I think we need to ignore political lines with this issue .  The first 40 years of my life I was comfortably pro-choice.  Birth control has come an extremely long way and options today make it very easy for the majority of people to never have an unwanted pregnancy. Minus risk to the mother or an extreme situation,  abortion in today’s day and age is just callous. Abortion is not birth control."
"Yeah. Johnny is going to conduct a THROUGH AND PAINSTAKING INVESTIGATON.

"I wonder how much the six made for selling out a woman's right to body autonomy and health care? Fortunately, the Roberts Court will go down in history as corrupt."
Great job of reporting.

"It's funny that pro life people also complain about social aid. If we dont have unwanted children in our society,  we won't have to spend as much on social aid. We should encouraged,  and sometimes mandate this for certain groups of people like chemically dependent people, those on state aid, and people who are here illegally."
"Every judge is a politician in black ropes, exercising their bias and prejudice !"
"This IS ALL about politics! This IS about timing! And after justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg's passing, Donald Trump and Republicans moved VERY fast! In getting their justice's ALL IN, with overturning Roe vs. Wade! I hope voters are seeing and understanding how Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans, can basically take away our rights! The voting rights sequence should hopefully be investigated! A vote for Donald Trump, is a vote for authoritarian, dictatorship! A vote for Donald Trump, is a vote for supporting Vladimir Putin!"
This shows what happens when a foreign entity ( Catholic Church dictatorship) theology is allowed to run our democracy...
Looks like someone did something really inappropriate (trying to influence members of the court). YA THINK?
A lot of this mischief could be prevented in the future by a law or amendment deciding that SCOTUS jurisprudence become part of the codex of laws of the US and can not be reversed by SCOTUS itself but only by a Law of Congress or an amendment to the Constitution. That would also diminish the political power of the court somewhat. It would have made Dobbs impossible if it had been in effect previously.
TERM LIMITS! ESPECIALLY THE SCOTUS!
The new ethical judicial behavioral code the Supreme Court wrote for themselves without any monitoring or enforcement  apparatus is such garbage. So incredibly bogus.
The Supreme Court talking about a breach of trust is hilarious!! Irony
FREE WILL  😇
What? I thought that they had already dismantled it.
The only breach of trust is that from the supreme court!!!! I trust them zero!
"Whooooo caaaares!

Just agree and move on.... to overturning Heller!

By the same wording on the ruling see you later Heller!"
"The Supreme Court should be the most transparent of all. It is literally our last line of justice, hiding things is inappropriate. It should be Supremely fair, open and right, not secret and questionable. People need to know why they are deciding the way they are. Everything should be based solely on the Constitution and what the public wants. (For the people by the people and of the people) Maybe we would be better off with AI deciding based on the Constitution, It wouldn't use feelings or beliefs to decide, just facts. It also couldn't be bought off!"
Also good that MSNBC is keeping this subject front and center. It will cripple Republicans in 2024.
"""Supreme"" Court? A contradiction in terms. These people are a medieval throwback."
"No different than royalty in olde Europe. Minute laws and punishments for the peasants, vague rules with little over sight for those up the candle."
"If thats true, Amy Berret has to be impeached and replaced by a real conservative justice."
The Supreme Court is POLITICAL.  Five justices owe their appointment to the ultra conservative Federalist Society.  They are all a disgrace in so many ways.
Barrett just wanted to delay the blowback of her lying in confirmation.
"Did Russia pay 24 million $$$$ to a biden shelf company ???

But hunter did end the gun debate
Bwahahahaha 
Whata disfunctional family
Hunter sums up the presidency to a tee

The supreme Court is all about partisan politics and Evangelical Christianity!! And let's not forget about bribery from billionaires!!
Sick party
Why do people care if a stranger gets an abortion or not? Like dude get a job. A hobby. Anything lol.
Sounds like damage control...
"It should be up to each woman if they  want an abortion. It's their body, their mind, and their heart.
  Too take away someone rights and free will is wrong. What will be next? Band birth control for  women. If you start taking away the free rights to control your life.
   Then we will lose in time all free rights to decide for ourselves. 
 We will  be under a government rule state."
I don’t like opinion in the news. Fix it minions.
Abortion is going to happen legal or not. Keep the squrty end out.
"listen ... plz to the last thing she mentions ... to me she almost reveals, what judge makes the leak. 100% sure thge lkeak come from a judge that got scared of the 15 week ban (that most of Europe have, but wanted Roe overturned, wanted the States to ban it.
I remember there was accusations of 'leftist judges was the ones who leaked' I bet to differ ... I would love to know more about this ..."
"What does that abortion rule do for a woman's first amendment, or don't they have one."
Reason???? Is there any reason on the Court?
The supreme court should have age and term limits.
Vote Marianne Williamson president 2024.  Give her a chance to debate.
All you woman. You gotta start really opening your mouth.  These idiots are trying to take out all woman’s rights!
… breach of trust … by ROBERTS … 🔥
Ending rvw was a gift to the dems. We're riding the blue wave towards a super majority and finally some rational governance in the us. t* is the gift that keeps on giving!
Supreme Court justices should have term limits and so should senators and any other political entity 8 years and no more than 8 years for any one of them.
Get rid of the courts
"The more I think about it,  chief Justice Roberts has lost control of ghe supreme court and is no chief Justice by any means."
It's dangerous you gamble with one .
No abortion is safe .
It's a matter of  being more morally sound and accountable to prevent them. Alot of women have died from botched abortions too most drs do th😢em for money only .
Our democracy is already gone  in this country . The corruption of this supreme court is disgusting !
Why are people not trying to get birth control to prevent unwanted  pregnancies .
"A breach of trust‽  @John Roberts: Just who do you think you can trust?  One thing is for sure, _you_ are not trusted.  In fact, your corrupt SCOTUS is held in well deserved contempt."
All I can say is Men fighting so hard to keep women pregnant is all we need to know and exactly why they have no business making medical and life decisions for us. 🤬
"Supreme Court political ideological GHOULS??? Hard to believe a person could reached the pinnacle of Judicial authority,  and not understand that judges are supposed to be unbiased by their own subjective leanings!!"
"Chris Hayes is a stuttering mess. Please MSNBC, invest in some speech classes for him. You could probably write it off on your taxes."
The women's rights have to be respected.
At this point of SCOUS could we even believe the leak investigation? They have shown their own ethics to be in question 😢
What happened to separation of church and state . Shame on them all abortion is healthcare not up for debate by religious zealots
Nice group portrait there-the Judicial Division of the Republican Party. Politicised and compromised
Christians are destroying America.
We need to have term limits for Supreme Court Justices... In my personal opinion we should have never given lifetime terms for any of our government positions with such power and magnitude over the people of our nation. DUH!!!
The ruling is that it is up to each individual state.
Opus Dei uber alles.
Women in Texas and Oklahoma now live under the same religious laws as women in Syria and Libya.  The GOP want all American women to live and die under those same laws.
It must be very hard for every woman to have an abortion. A decision that will have the effect of a lifetime. But is was her own right to do. To find peace and the power to continue.
"Justices are politicians too—corrupted politicians. You don’t change the devil, the devil changes you.  Money and favors grant access and access influences policy.   Internal accountability is not possible."
"The question is they all said at their conformation that they wouldn't overturn Roe.
Ethics seem to be a major problem for our Supreme Court Justices. 
They lied to get the seat and are being bought by the very people who are against Roe."
"Supremely corrupt. NO lifetime terms, self policing or secret anything! The whole setup is deeply flawed & ripe for going sideways. It did, so it's time for reform = least complicated fact."
So they did an entire story just to say they don’t know what happened?
"They need to stop the LIE'S they planned this a head of time, anyone that can't see them for what they are is blind. The people of the United States of America are in trouble big trouble this our COUNTRY and we been sold out. The whole world watching."
Maybe you'd be happier in a communist country try moving to one .
"Let’s stop kidding ourselves about the judiciary. It is about politics, not the law and reason. Kantor is covering for Barrett because she’s a woman. Not buying her story as a portrayal of The Court as a noble institution."
Rescue both to the best of ability .
"SO typical that the Gilead level not so ""Supreme"" Court would be upset by the leak rather than their crap ruling that completely ignores the law."
"Mr. Justice Gorsuch, thanks for spending 10 whole minutes reviewing Mr. Justice Alito's 69-page opinion of Dobbs. 6.9 pages per minute. That Elianor Woods speed-reading course you took at Yale really paid off for ya! Mr. Crow and Mr. Leo sure got their money's worth out of you!"
"Every time I hear ""Justice Kavanaugh"" I wonder Justice Kennedy stepping down and giving trump this liar."
SCROTUS
"If the American people wish to know the history of  little corrupt secrets of SCOTUS, then buy the Case Against the Supreme Court, by Law Professor Chereminsky. Especially, in the 1920, or at the turn of the 20th Century regarding Child Labor. I think even Charles Chaplin has a movie and took a stand regarding robing, stealing, thefting the childhood of little Americans to satiate the suply and demand of workers for big Corporations! Yes, Justice Robing Barons legalizing corruption!!!"
"This entire story is BS, clearly her sources are from Roberts office. Trying to paint him as trying to save Roe but the leak messed everything up. FOH, they had every intention of overturning roe and his descent was just symbolic because he doesn’t want the court to look partisan."
Sounds like politics as usual! I thought the supreme Court was not supposed to do that? I know I don't have enough knowledge to speak about this in depth. But all I can say is it seems like they're doing the same thing that Republicans and Democrats are doing. I thought they were supposed to be a neutral and just based on the Constitution? But it's really the same; it's all about power. I'm so sad
How dare Roberts make such a statement- he should be in prison right now with his wife for accepting bribes! We need to march on the court and demand the 6 Republicans resign as they're provably compromised.
It’s the best Court that money could buy…
Term limits! Term limits! Term limits!
"Three branches of government yet one branch consists of 9 individuals that were not voted in by the people and on top of that lifetime appointments. That's not balanced at all. The reason they do this is because they know they can't be removed or vote out, garbage."
"As a Christian, I'm ashamed. Jesus would never want someone to lie their way to the supreme Court to put up an abortion ban. This isn't righteousness. It's evil. Pure human greed."
Everyone with two brain cells to rub together know it was Alito and that he leaked it to force the conservatives to stick to stripping bodily autonomy from half the population. Republicans and conservatives will pay for this for decades.
A bunch of conservative snakes that can't be trusted. No wonder the court has a low approval rating because of these sell out corrupted judges
"They will not answer truthfully, if they answer at all."
"If anybody still believes that Supreme Court Justices aren't just politicians in robes, they haven't been paying attention."
No one gets to decide what surgery i will have.
"In other words, her reporting tells us nothing we didn't already know."
"It's soooooo true, these partisan Republicans justices are drunk on power and politics, and knowing they can get away with crimes is the reason why they need to be stopped."
I dont now wher too longer..
"All six of these corrupt conservative judges are maga politics . Moscow Mitch McConnell and Rrump conservative water carrying tools. Term limits would help but like Gun legislation and weak republicans excuses to do something , they offer only Mafia tactics and prayers and thoughts. Corruption at its best."
"So, who was paid off to get this decision? SCOTUS is Corrupt!"
It's wild how 6 people can decide the fates of 331 million people
Maybe they should be looking into Jan 6 being a inside job. The new video evidence is pointing to that being a real possibility. Trump 2024🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
The Supreme Court of Canada has a retirement age of 75. The Court works just fine.
"If Justice, Amy wants to have 7 or 10 kids, it doesn't mean everyone should or want to. They should have left roe v wade alone. And mind their business."
"Hmm,,why is she saying….. President Trump?, Biden is President. Just wondering. What’s the use, more Republican Supreme Court justices. Only time they voted correct, was when Trump took his case there to overturn the vote, to still be President. They said, NO."
"Quick reminder: our constitution *does not say* Court Justices get lifetime appointments. It says ""shall retain their offices under good behavior."" In the past, we had Justices who held to the standard of ""good behavior"" by not taking bribes, not committing perjury by lying in the job interview. They all held life-time posts *because* they refrained from bad behavior. Hence, we do not have a ""system of lifetime appointments"" we have a system where a justice who refrains from bad behavior shall retain their office until they choose to retire or they expire. Constitution *could have said* ""life appointment"" but chose not to because life appointments invite dictatorial tyranny. After some 200 years, America came to see justices as having ""life appointments"" because of lack of crime on the bench. But that is *not* what the constitution says. The ""originalists"" on the supreme court have never even noticed this phrase, or how it potentially limits their dictatorial powers."
Which constitutional right is next to be taken away as easily?
"Making unilateral decisions about people's healthcare from a bench is not only antithetical to Democracy, it's wrong."
"I don't understand why the supreme court judges have never been charged with perjury during their sworn testimony, at their Confirmation hearings, before Congress."
I've had tacos at Taco Bell more supreme than this court. What a stain on America.
Keep voting for GOP and continue to watch your rights vanish.  Doh!!!
So just blame Biden in the made up Impeachment…
“Elections have consequences…” remember that statement? Tough luck liberals…
Repukes turned US to a banana republikkk
"Coathanger-Barrett was _trying_ for plausible deniability, but this leak removes that plausibility."
What else can Boomers wreck in their limited time left.
conservatives are packing the court to force their will on society. Democrats need to stop play games and start packing to court no matter what because right isn't afraid to do the same. Abortion rights shouldve been codified a long time ago. Now we gotta deal with these morality policemen being in installed on federal benches.
The new justices had just went through lying about Roe and it being case law.
Or maybe.... (sound of getting canceled)... if the entirety of the Justices on the Supreme Court think that abortion is wrong.... MAYBE ITS BECAUSE<<<< IT IS WRONG!!!!!!
"It is way past time to dispense with the ""lifetime appointment"" rule. I have nothing but contempt for this court. Their ethical standards are a joke, some of them sit on seats that were stolen, some of them are patently unfit. Does ""what goes around comes around"" sound like a sentiment that a Supreme Court Justice should hold?"
Don’t forget to vote for Trump on November 13th!!!!
They did it
This is the evidence required to END lifetime rolls!!  Term limits we need to make mandatory and soon!
B.S. She pulled a Lisa Murkowski. She “performed” an ethical stance knowing full well her buddies would make sure she got to vote to wage war on women. She got to keep her hands clean while doing nasty.
"The thing that still bothers me is the fact that Justice Alito included the history of 16th century views and feelings on abortion by Sir Edward Coke in England claiming it as part of the US's history when this country is only 250+ years of being considered an entity in its own right. Our history AS A COUNTRY does not carry forward the beliefs and laws of England. Therefore quoting anything before 1776 from England as part of our history as a country is incorrect. 50 years of having the right to abortion means it was and is deeply embedded in our history. That is 1/5 of the years we have been an established county with our own laws, etc."
There own by the Republicans  party
"Context is EVERYTHING, and the crooks on the SCOTUS know that along with their corrupt, ignorant 'clerks' who are just religious and political fanatics in the Anti-Choice lagers and Waco-like compounds."
More traitors
This is sickening. Absolutely sickening. Vote blue. Insure women’s rights. Republicans are intent on making women second class citizens.
"Trump’s mob would even embarrass some corrupt African nation. The supreme court looks to be THE most crooked part of the USA, what a joke these clowns are, so unpatriotic and disgraceful"
"Gee, MSNBC needs phony made up BS to understand that the U.S.S.C decision sent it back to the states to decide.
Don't worry Democrats you can still extinguish human beings."
"Two men talking about abortion, interesting."
"Bravo, to the brave & patriotic person, who leaked these Supreme Court, back room dealings.

There clearly was a personal agenda, and a premeditated plan, concerning the timing of their actions.  This is so discouraging & so disappointing.  But sadly, not surprising or shocking in the least.  Many of us saw this type of behavior coming, when certain justices were appointed.

Their job, is to uphold the Constitution of the United States, and protect the rights of all citizens. 

They don't have to like abortion, and they certainly don't have to get one, but they do have to protect the rights of others, to make that choice for themselves.

The highest court in our land; we look to them to make decisions based on the Constitution, law, and the good of the nation.  This pearl clutching, because they got caught doing something they knew to be sneaky & wrong, is as silly as it is, insulting.

There should be term limits for Supreme Court Justices.  And the selection process needs to be improved, as well.

It will be interesting to see what else comes out, and what if any changes occur because of this."

"The current Supreme Court contains too many odious creatures. Dismiss the lot, create a High Code of Ethics (including oversight), require a political balance on the bench (ex. 3 Repubs, 3 Dems, 3 Indeps), and Term Limits. Any lying, cheating, or political stunts gets them dismissed from the bench permanently."
"As long as we respect religious beliefs and allow theocrats to be judges, this will never end. The three of them were put on the court to overturn roe. It’s what they did. Its political. It always has been. No judge is impartial or unbiased."

"Abortion ban is about work force not religion, the far right are extremely immoral and also tend to be business owners. They are struggling with having enough low level workers."

"100% bet that it wasn't the liberals who leaked it. The conservatives were the ones with a motive. I'll bet Chief Justice Roberts' ""investigation"" is just a red herring to deflect suspicion - just like OJ trying to find the real killer of his wife. Corrupt court indeed. This decision will go down in history like Dred Scott. The #1 position of women according to polls is abortion. Vote blue in '24! Then we need to pass a constitutional amendment for judge term limits across the board. Judgeships have become way to politicized."

Those six pics of the SC judges could be at a Carnival shooting gallery!
"Roe vs Wade was unconstitutional and needed to be overturn.  1.  There was no federal law in regards to abortions; therefore, the Supreme Court was making a law with the Roe v Wade ruling and the power belongs to Congress not the Supreme Court.  2.  There is nothing in the Constitution that gives the Federal Government the power to regulate abortions; therefore, according to the 10th Amendment that power belongs to the states"
"Seems like someone would have preferred to hold off the case until after the election, all for political reasons."
"It seems to me that the Supreme Court is no longer ""Supreme"" in brains."
"The Supreme Court has destroyed their credibility on their own. There are justices (Thomas, Alito for example) who should clearly be removed as they have been proven to be corrupt. Term limits and clear legal laws are needed for this court NOW!"
Ruth’s refusal to step down while she had the choice to do so while the political landscape (democratic president and Congress) is so incredibly selfish and SHE is the reason why Roe was overturned. That a selfish woman is THE reason that woman lost their rights. Classic.
Please stop repackaging the same information and start digging up new information like journalists. Please. We need the 4th of state
"They made a whole movie about “Spin”, it’s called “ Wag The Dog” Spin doctors need to be exposed, like the individuals making up the electoral college. Maybe that’s why the world is aiming for robots? Can’t we be real with ourselves, or do we need a war to make us come together as a country."
"I will never respect Barrett.  For her to accept the position under the ramrod they used to put her in place after McConnell derailed Obama's nomination ""because it is too close to an election"" says loudly that she is not concerned with fair play.  She cannot be trusted with her position.

Let's not forget that she and Kavanagh both testified under oath to not upset the precedence of RvW.

It is a political court."
Republicans are Orwellian. They talk about freedom while they are busy taking it from you.
So what ?
So fake Dem News says law is about which party has power to divided without any Constitutional argument that they are wrong. You see sheep how they lie.
"As disgusting & reprehensible as this story shows the “conservatives” of the SCOTUS to be, I’m in no way shocked … especially about the revelation that it was Kavanaugh who was responsible for scheming to take the case but move the date, in order to deceive the public, based on his actions in the W. Bush administration & his specific involvement in the Ken Starr investigation/fishing expedition into Bill Clinton. 
Just on a basic human level, the fact that Ruth Bader Ginsberg - a colleague of many of them for decades! - hadn’t been deceased for more than a day before they began scheming to undermine her life’s work, is a testament to the utter depravity of “men” like Clarence Thomas & Samuel Alito in particular. 
I don’t know how much more reporting & evidence could possibly be needed at this point, to support the fact that these 2 obscenely corrupt, political operatives need to be impeached from the SC! Then there’s Kavanaugh, who needed multiple attempts to become a judge in the 1st place, & has had more questions arise about his ethics since becoming a justice than any other person ever confirmed to the Court … if he is to remain a justice, then the SC needs to enact an ironclad code of ethics & the most scrupulous means of enforcement of any of the lower courts or the other 2 branches of gov’t combined!
Even then, the SCOTUS needs to be expanded to 13 justices - to match the number of Circuit Courts of Appeals, & have term limits imposed by Congress! The LAST thing this country needs is more bought & paid for, political operatives w no reverence for the law or the rights of the American people, who aren’t just protected by their lifetime appointments, but are actively, immeasurably emboldened by them - like Thomas & Alito!"
"Save your context, narrative crap. You ARE a utility. Like electric companies, or phone companies."
"This supreme court is corrupt. History will show that the extreme faction of the Catholic higher authority, fronted by Leonard Leo, the fascist OPUS DEI , a group of anti-democratic wealthy individuals, and the Federalist Society have had key roles in the corruption of the third branch of govt under the US Constitution. The vast majority of American Catholics oppose the efforts to destroy religious freedom in the USA."
😅
"This is absolute proof that the Supreme Court is purely political.  They want everyone to believe they actually consider the arguments on each side then rule.  Instead, they do whatever their backers want them to do.  We still need to know who paid off Kavanaugh's huge debts just before he got on the court."
"Maybe, they were hesitant to take up and overturn Roe, because Brett and Amy had so recently taken an Oath to uphold Roe.  They took all of that Dark Money from the Pro-Life Faction, they had to  pay to the Piper.  All of the rest of this is just smoke and mirrors.  They are stuck with their lousy decision and it makes them look like what they are:  Bought and Paid For."
"The Republicans are like the dog that loves chasing cars and finally caught one.
It does not end well for the dog."

This is what has me nervous about this bench looking at the DJT prosecution issues…….
"Every Dem running for Senate needs to run on expanding the court, voting rights, and preserving our Democracy.
Put the Insurrection, the Coup, the corruption of the GOP and their bought and sold SCOTUS justices on the ballot.
Do not allow a Republican a moment of peace in the public sphere, without being on the record about these issues.
Do not give the GOP a platform for ANY other issue. Shout them down, talk over them, control the god damned conversation.

And most of all, the DOJ needs to start arresting and convicting these criminals, including the bribed off SCOTUS judges [sic] Clarence Thomas"

  ONLY 5 People Rule Supreme!  (5 of 9)

Right & Wrong, Logic & Illogic, Fair & Unfair is not required by The Supreme Court.  They are allowed to interpret the Constitution however they wish.  
Just as ""THE POWERFUL"" have re-interpreted, and even rewritten the Bible, to suit ""their"" Laws of GOD.  These 5 people have that POWER, to over-ride whatever they ""wish."" 

Do YOU understand the unending reach of this?  5 people.

ONLY 5 of 9 Justices have the power to determine what is Law of the Land in this ridiculous country.   Not the 3 Branches of Government/Congress; Not individual States of this Country have the power to make the Law of the Land.   FIVE (5) people of The Supreme Court hold ALL THE POWER !"
Nothing changes what these conservatives have done and will do.
"Gotta say again - it’s unfortunate that the Democrats aren’t strategic or long range thinkers. They really had every reason for Ginsberg to step down and be replaced by Obama by a younger judge in the first place in the second place you know I don’t know if there would be a second chance or on this, but he had the opportunity to put Merrick Garland on the bench during a recess appointment and he chose not to. It’s such a patronizing mentality. So I’m not sure? Is it Obama‘s fault that were in this place? He did a lot for the GOP who won were another did a lot for him helping him get into office. he certainly failed to pass or even try to pass important legislation. And let’s not forget those pictures of children and dog cages were taken in 2014.
Part two of the short term stupid thinking of the Democrats was not having Joe Biden run for president in 2016. I supported Hillary Clinton for president in 1992. I thought she’d be way better than her husband. But, it’s a lot easier to get a successful vice president on the heels of the president. Currently the Democrats are trying to do that with Kamala Harris, and it won’t work because she does not have leader ship charisma at all. It’s not because she’s black, because she’s Indian, it’s not because she’s a woman, it’s because she’s a twinkly, a little too faced woman with no managerial authority and I don’t see her being a commander-in-chief. She just doesn’t have that leader ship vibe. I think she would’ve been a better AG, way better than Merrick Garland. And Hillary might’ve been an excellent vice president in that administration, forging a steppingstone for her to become the first female president of the United States. But as usual, the Democrats and leader ship back there and DC do not have any strategic foresight. They don’t seem to understand where people are at or how they look at things. They really seem to live in a bubble among themselves, as elitist clueless, patronizing, and phony people. I say this, even though I’m a Democrat. It’s grossly disappointing that we have all these horrible people on the Supreme Court, and half of them go back to the days when the Democrats were all agreeable and allowing horrible people like Clarence Thomas onto the bench. They were always being so collegial, while their colleagues across the aisle were always plotting the downfall of our democracy, and the rise of fascism and oligarchy. It was obvious to anybody paying attention since the Reagan and Bush administration."
"This is a separation of church and state issue.  Thinking that you are somehow killing children is a religion-specific dogma position, not even part of many religions, resulting primarily from a very common spiritual failure thinking that you must convert others to your beliefs rather than take responsibility for yourself.  It's a self-improvement avoidance pattern common among humans as they avoid their own spiritual issues while massaging their egos about how good they are being.  It is used by political propagandists to promote voting regardless of the clinic violence and violence to women they are winking at."
What an awful corrupt court.
This may be really off topic.....I thought the NYT journalist was a man until she spoke 🤯 like a glitch in the matrix.
America sure seems to be turning into a regressive hellhole.
You can thank Mitch McConnell and the GOP. Give them a thank you. Would you please. Have a great day. Take care and god bless. 🙏💙🙏
"The Jusitces didn't need to read the draft, it was written by the Federalist Society. The Society IS THE LAW"
The supreme Court overturning Roe versus Wade was unconstitutional and it is a violation of other laws. The HIPAA laws prevent anybody from using your medical information and no state has a right to stick their nose in your medical information. I wish these attorneys would actually utilize this information because it is accurate to the letter of the laws. You do not have to go to law school to understand the laws you simply just have to have the ability and the skill to read and comprehend.
SUPREME COURT JUSTICED NEED TO BE ELCTED BY THE PEOPLE WITH TERM LIMITS
"Oh good, the Supreme Court participates in political PR by playing the public as fools. Why am I not surprised that they’re just politicians in  black robes?"
Its time for Biden to pack the court
The Supreme court is just a bunch of liars and definitely not for women because it should be a federal right only s women should have a say over her body since men don’t have that baby in them that could only affect the rest of there life men don’t usually have an attachment until after the birth.  Remember who made all this happen! The right wing extremists and romp who it will never affect.
"funny that all these privileged people who went to the best schools couldn't understand the word, ""choice,"" in a case.   You don't like, don't believe or don't want an abortion:  you have the CHOICE to NOT get one!   Just like the peple who do need, or want an abortion have a CHOICE to not believe as you do or have their religion pushed onto you."
"Nothing changes. Set limits on Supreme Court,  no more life terms."
Oh No SC followed the constitution and Dem News trys to bandwagon with no constitution argument.
"The last four republican appointees said under oath that Roe was settled law in order to get on the bench.  THEY LIED UNDER OATH!  Let that sink in.  THEY LIED UNDER OATH.  Then the moment they have the votes to overturn it, suddenly it's no longer settled law.  They lied in order to get appointed to the bench so that they could do what their mega donors sent them there to do, which was to end Roe v Wade."
"The leak may have been ""inappropriate"", but the justices playing politics was even MORE inappropriate.  I am very concerned of our future with a supreme court that is seemingly for sale to the highest bidders."
"Access to the Justices of the Supreme Court   I heard today that it is very difficult to ask questions of the justices. It must be because we aren't billionaires who have personal access to justices. I won't use the word corrupt for SCOTUS, it is POLITICAL. We are a democracy, we didn't vote for them. Now people have no access to justices, in the beginning justices had a circuit to ride and they ate and boarded with the people. They were given their salary to aid them in the hardships they had to endure riding circuit and being away from home. These guys won't cancel lunch for any of us who are the people. They have pulled out the Bible, quote from the worst of it, and hammer the public with old testament vengeance because they see God as vengeful and they see themselves as God's surrogates. Worried about Trump wanting to be the king, we ended up with at least 6 in the court."
It appears that much of America's democratic directives were established based on a reliance that the directives would be discharged with a modicum of honorability and respect. Seems as if this approach is coming apart at the seams?
These corrupt judges make me sick.
"Time to reign the court in! I think they should be limited to 10 years - not life - in the position. They're obviously arrogant and disgustingly entitled. Alito and Thomas need to be impeached because they're blatant crooks, sucking off the teat of their privileged positions. It was a criminal move by McConnell when he denied Obama's choice for the court. Obama was a wimp. He should have fought tooth and nail to fight that, but he knew he was on his way out and just didn't want the hassle. For that alone, I think he was a failed president."
MSNBC is fake news. MSNBC is the enemy of the people.
The right has been planning to put these anti Roe in for years even though it goes against the majority of world opinion.
"I like MSNBC in general but I would like it more without Chris Hayes. He's a bit overboard--an extremist. He pushes ideas a little too far, beyond the facts, and tries to sensationalize the news. Tries to start fires. In other interviews of his I've seen, not so much this one, he's very hyper and often interrupts his guests too much. He needs to tone it down or find another outlet."
The Supreme Court sees what's happening to our country. Why aren't they doing something?
I hope Kavanaugh 💩 himself everytime he walks into his chambers.
Mississippi wanted to end abortion because that state is the highest in young black female mortality rate while giving birth or soon after. legalized murder of young black breeders is all it is.
"Hopefully, people remember that the judges involved stated that they would not overturn precedent law, without tacit changes to the circumstances. Only one of the many lies they told to get appointed."
Vote blue so that they can expand the court.
"A Republican led SCOTUS is corrupt. Yes, of course it is, that was the point."
I think it was Alito who leaked it.
"The World is watching! The U.S. cannot call themselves a country of democracy or law and order ever again. What a joke. The curtain has fallen and we all see you now for what you really are... corrupt, violent, anti-women, racist and fascist. Certainly not 100%, but just look at who is actually 'ruling your country' from your local school boards all the way to the top! All the while the people are playing with their toys and stuffing their faces with greasy heart-stopping burgers and fries."
A Handmaid’e Tale isn’t supposed to be an instructional booklet.
Biden needs to match the number of justices to the number of federal districts.
Not allowing women to make their own reproductive decisions makes them second class citizens. Lots of people are good with that.
"Cons and piracy; put them together and you get conspiracy. The court is the most corrupt in american history. Lock, them up. Throw away the keys."
"in an authoritarian country, usually the authoritarian ends bad. In USA we have at this point 6 authoritarians that are going to retire from their luxury lives despite how many American lives they destroy. And you the republicans call the democrats and some other countries, third countries and   authoritarian countries, communists or socialists?"
"A justice system that is so lost and broken, make their citizens have no respect for that institution. The Supreme Court should be abolished at this point."
"I don’t care about the leak. What concerns me is that millions of dollars were wasted during these confirmations that ultimately mean nothing! Kavanaugh and coney-Barrett said, in front of congress, that Roe v Wade was established law. And these people clearly lied and are on the supreme court FOR LIFE! That’s a problem"
Religion infused justices are EXACTLY THE WRONG THING when trying to maintain separation of church and state.
"It's okay with the justices violate ethics...but not their assistants.

""Do as we say, not as we do"" is not a good look for any judge or the rule of law."
you missed the entire point  of this story -- Why was the conservative  wing of the court so fixated on Roe?  Why were they so motivated to change the law?   It is so incredibly obvious that it was done for political reasons to serve their political overlords and the federalist society  .  This story strips the black robes  and reveals a bunch of political operatives.

"The Supreme Court, the easiest to buy, these days."
The justices released it on purpose.  That's my opinion.
No one is above the law not even the mega Republicans. The Supreme Court is the court that we depend on. The Supreme Court should not have block the views are the abortion right. Clarence Thomas and his wife should be fired. Do you know what they're coming into Supreme Court judges they were not here trying to make money what they are trying to do that's a bunch of BS
"The only incentive you need to be a model citizen in this country is have an intolerance for stupidity.

"Best ju$tice money can buy. So, you think Alito leaked, or was it Thomas? My money’s on Alito."
The corrupt states of America.....🤯🤯
"Probably leaked by Stephen Breyer, on his way out the door."
sounds like one of the conservative justices leaked it to force the other conservatives to vote in favor of overturning Roe...  Clarence Thomas and Sam Alito are more like politicians than justices..
Our Supreme Court cannot be trusted !!!!!!!!!
"Let's remember for all RBG is revered, she caused a shitshow by not retiring while a Democrat was President and could have named a successor.  They're all the same, their love of power and the prestige that comes with it is more important than anything else."
They didnt want to miss an opportunity to get paid to rule.
Treason...
To me it is all wrong. A tiny group of people (supreme court) decide on something that can affect a population of 300 million.  This should be decided by a referendum - people can vote for what THEY want not for what 5 people want (supreme court is 9 people but you only need 5).
"Traitor appointed corrupt judges, they are waiting for his commands."
"Who done it? This abusive Supreme Court! After 50yrs of a woman's right protected, this Supreme Court broke that trust for protection inside a patriarchal society!! The background of women ""oppression"" for ions...using oppression over women for power...power over! Here we are again...justices need to back to the drawing table and right their wrong...stop trying to control women and their bodies!!! Easy for you to pass viagra though! Sick."
"This whole affair makes the US Supreme Court come across as just another political arm of the far-right.  They show their theologic ties.  Someone needs to present the arguments that justified abortion.  It requires an understanding of the nature and science of reproduction.  The anti-abortion faction live in religious fantasies.   Every time a women menstruates, she is ""killing"" a human being.  The far-right feels no shame in diminishing the value of humans after birth.  They deny the value of funding humanitarian efforts."
THE NOT SO ‘SUPREME’ court
Am remembering the judges who lied about overturning Roe when they were being interviewed. Crooks and liars on the Court..
Thanks MSNBC news
They’re coming after birth control next.
Republicans contradict themselves in word and deed daily. More so than some dirty Democrats
OBVIOUS from the Beginning... CONSERVATIVES Leaked to lock in Votes. We CHEER these dumbasses for their induced consequences that are demolishing the GOP.
United States Supreme Court is simply the upper house of the Republican Party.
"The other Conservatives might have giving cover to Amy Comey Barrett during the early stages through her initial vote to not take up the case.  Because of the inappropriate look, much as a legislators are given cover on votes that damage their political position in getting re-elected. When their vote is not needed to pass the legislation."
I think Alito or Thomas definitely were behind the leak.
"Is it possible that people on the left could consider that may be the people who are against abortion truly believe it is wrong just like you might believe killing puppies is wrong, and you might want that outlawed. I'm pro-choice but I understand the argument on the other side and I don't think the people are evil"
"We NEED so much more transparency from the Supreme Court bc if this is true, then they didn't really ""lie"" to Congress in their approval hearings to get their seats, after all...but, my strong sense and from all we know now of all the  Trump's appointees he picked for top positions throughout America's institutions during his term is that everyone was made to sign NDA's and promises of lip locked loyalty to him, without questions and it may be that he's got the Rs on the bench, divided for a reason...not his but whatever HIS puppetmaster tells him to do...he does!  He's not to dumb to know that he's clueless when it comes to politics but he's taking his orders from our staunchest foreign enemies!  I've been consistent on this point from the very beginning, no matter how he ""acted""...that's not part of my decision that he's on the side of every one of our adversaries and treats our allies like dirt...he does this in plain sight, why is that ok with some American's?  I've ALWAYS been on the side of the underdogs but this is NOT that...watch how the leader of China and the likes use these mind control techniques...it's fascinating when it's happening to others way over there...that's all I can say...thank God ppl here are saying
..lol sorry so long! 🤐🤯"
"She was just using smoke and mirrors.  IF she was serious , she would have voted NO in the final saying.
However there is also an element of control ....she is still a lower being, being a woman.

So much corruption."
All they're doing is kicking the ruling back to the states which is where it's supposed to actually be
"The US Constitution specifically forbids any attempt to establish a state religion.
It follows, then, that any evidence that relies on the supposed words of some invisible, unseen entity, the evidence for whom relies entirely on the words in a single, ancient, unreliable, self-contradicting book which few of its self-professed adherents have ever actually read, should play absolutely no part in law-making.
In other words, if you want the USA to follow the laws of a god, then he/she/it should be ready to appear in court to justify and explain those laws.
You know the sort of thing - why slavery is good, genocide encouraged, as are stoning naughty toddlers to death and banning women from holding ""holy office"".
The silliest thing is that the organisations that claim to believe these things are not US taxpayers - but they still bleat and whine about tax dollars being ""wasted"" on things that the supposed founder of their religion commanded they do.
The really funny thing is just how few of them seem able even to spell ""hypocrisy..."
"So, if this Investigative Reporter delved deep into the situation with the Supreme Court and the ""alleged leak"" of the draft decision, then why didn't her investigation reveal the culprit who leaked the draft?...."
"And USA justice system is corrupt,  what is going on in this country,  is it just the beginning of a total collapse as it sure seems so everyone is just in it for themselves,  what a corrupt corrupt country"
"RBG was good, but should have retired during Obama administration."
"These people want you to believe their conclusions are valid, even though the evidence of the corruption of SCOTUS is obvious. The duplicitousness is of a trumpian scale."
REMOVE THE ENTIRE SCOTUS AND START OVER
Term limits and accountability for the supreme court now!
"2:00 in, nothing! When Chris says I forgot about the details, I have not!"
"If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's a duck."
The 1973 SC decision said that women had the right to bodily autonomy & the male justices on the present SC said NO they don't!!!
This makes me upset! The fact that people have the power to harm people! Women are being treated like second-class citizens!
Trump wanted to seat justices that would overturn Roe.  So the SC Justices went with politics their religious beliefs & not the Constitution.
"This Supreme Court's conservative men are about politics. They are fabricating legal interpretations, that magically align with their personal political leanings. That makes them nonelected lawmakers and not interpreters of the law."
"These kind of wherever they are are claim they are religious and good people but you look at their faces and you can see the nastiness and hatred there because of all the pain they carry around with them. 

When you're this evil, the Universe won't let you be happy!"
Obama for V.P.
"Trump figured out how to tear down the trust in every America institution in 4 years in office. Why are these justices using their beliefs or opinions as metrics for which to judge. Your job as a judge is to follow the law, the Constitution. It has nothing to do with anyone's political opinions or religious beliefs. The entire GOP is dirty and trying to destroy our nation."
Of course.  The newly appointed justices committed perjury during their confirmation hearings.  They were inherently uncomfortable about striking down Roe vs. Wade.  They wanted a period of time to allow public acceptance of their tainted confirmations.
"John Roberts has a lot of nerve to talk about this leak being a ""breach of trust"". The SCOTUS has broken the trust of the people. I literally see them as enemies of liberty and democracy at this point. None of them care about justice or do process. Just more greedy little children."
@ManassehIsrael1025 ... You are taking the Lord's name in vain. Fake Christian.
The most corrupt Supreme Court in American History
She is field dependent and unable to weigh other concerns.  She is deaf to human concerns other than being the darling of zealots.  She IS a zealot and so is Alito who is back in the 1500s.  He hates women
"It shows to all those watching,  how easy it is to take over powerful positions in USA & you better believe they're watching!! 🌎"
"If something is being leaked it means something is being hidden. Hidden from ""We the people"". We are not governed, we are ruled."
"She has seven children and an army of people to care for them.  She could have advocated, as a woman, for some concerns that are now evident: she did NOTHING."
Jody Kantor is clear concise. Thank you for your insight and reporting.
Contact your federal legislator and say you wont vote for them unless they bring legislation to codify roe into law. No compromise.
Barrett…..”cover your own butt”
The Supreme Court needs to have their medical license revoked.
"""Relisted' a crime against humanity."
"So, MSNBC is just realizing they were eagerly waiting for RBG to die so they could do this. 
Now?!?!  Seriously?!?!"
It was either Alito or Thomas.  My money is on Clarence.
Shame Republicans

Anyone that thinks the SCOTUS is not corrupt this is all the proof needed that they are.
"Women's bodies, women make decisions.  Not you!  Shams."
Republicans are trash
Whoever was responsible for the binder at the time of it going missing should be questioned and held accountabke.
You can bet that wealthy Republicans will have access to abortion and will use it.
it is absolutely sick what is going on in the US. my honest take on what is going on is that every single woman in the US should leave the country all at once in protest. that might get their attention...
Democrats are something else boy SMDH and I used to be a democrat in 2008 but they are pure evil now
"The thing this tells me is the court must be much more open with their deliberations. This was all very underhanded, and clearly an abuse of the respectability of the court. These justices don’t deserve the secrecy they demand, and we can’t afford it."
It was Alito and Thomas who leaked the draft.
Republican anti freedom party.
"What's next?  Atheism becomes illegal? Childless is illegal? Fahrenheit 451?  Slavery returns?, Child brides?. Burkas? It sure seems like the States is already sliding down the slippery slope. Never say never."

Conservative means to not allow progress and control all our lives to keep us all in place because of an ancient religion brought to us from The Old World?
The current US Supreme Court is a breach of trust
Term limits now! Omfg disgusting and outrageous! Omfg!
"The Supreme Court smells like bad fish. I don't trust them at all anymore. Lifetime Appointments should be stopped IMMEDIATELY. All it does is breed corruption. What motivation do these Judges have to play by the rules when they don't have to answer to anyone, and can't lose their job no matter what they do? 🇺🇸"
Pro choice my body my choice

Seems like a lack of transparency. Transparency is the heart of democracy.

Amy changing her vote on taking the case is meaningless. It's just for appearance and changes nothing about how I see her. She's still a dreadful person.
The blame should fall on Ruth Bader for not stepping down when she could  have been replaced. Her desire to clutch the power until it had to be pried from her dead hands cost every woman in this country their right to choose.
"Ruth Ginsburg should have retired when Obama asked to, but noooooo, she had to play ""justice"" 'till she died putting herself above country. Shame! Power corrupts. Now women pay the price."
SCOTUS surely torpedoed the GOP. They haven't won an election since.
Why does not the news report the truth. They ruled that we have no rights to privacy
And if weasel garland was not being paid off 3 of them traitor would be in prison
"It was Justice Alito!

It's not hard to figure out who leaked the Dobbs decision. He did it to force the others into not changing their minds to this new 15 week ban that Justice Roberts was touting."
"They are plotting to make American women brood mares. N Korea, China and Russia are wanting bigger birth rates for economics and soldiers. Now we can say the Republicans have the sane agenda. Johnson has said that all the aborted babies could have been viable tax payers."

Lawrence needs some yacht time to think about it.
"Repuglicans had been politicking on abortion for decades and then when they finally had to votes to overturn Roe v. Wade they had to choose between enraging the evangelicals or the rest of the country.  May they go down with the evangelical ship.  There's a reason religion is in decline, some people recognize hypocrisy and unethical behavior."
"The American Evangelical Fascists would have been OK to elect the devil for President, if he helped them to overturn Roe v. Wade, and they came very close to the dark Lord with Trump."
"This Christian fundamentalist SCOTUS is severely overstepping their boundaries & duties, overturning Roe was purely politically & ideologically driven. They were more interested in shoving their personal opinions down the throats of the American people than following the law & settled precedent.
Also, I'll never forgive RGB for not stepping down during Obama's 1st term when she could've allowed him to replace her with someone like minded"
Love that all their machinations have actually increase support for abortion. Who'd have thought???
Term limits and rights of recall.
"When I think of supreme court judges, I think of liars and paid for tools."
"Contrary to what democrats/liberals and their propaganda outlets are trying to make people believe. The US Supreme Court did NOT ban abortions.  They simply and constitutionally ruled that abortion is up to each individual state and not the federal government.

So someone saw them scheming the American people behind closed doors and leaked the document in hopes of a change. Good on whoever did that. That's more American than what these religious zealots are trying to do.
It’s absolutely hilarious how stupid MSNBC’s reporters make FOX look. It’s real reporting with undeniable evidence. Hayes is the man!!
Let's just hope Americans vote blue and make Republicans pay for taking away rights
Abortion restrictions have already been influencing elections.  I'm sensing a crushing defeat for the right wing in 2024.
Excuse me??? Since when is determining Constitutionality done in secret? Leaks within the military is treason.  Maybe the court should focus on billionaires destroying this democracy.
"Justice Clarence Thomas should do the right thing and resign. It's probably the biggest, single, immediate step that could be taken to restore faith in the Supreme Court. I'd be fine with replacing him with another conservative provided they were someone with integrity, competence, and loyal to the constitution."
"And Alito is scum…along with Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett. All of them are liars."
Abortion should be an option i mean taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for it tho

We need to elect a president that isnt a geriatric white man"
"We Liberals can cry all we want but RBG new she wasn't going to live forever. She should have stepped down when Obama was president and the Dems had control of the Senate but  NO she evidently thought  she would live forever. So I blame her and I blame Obama when he nominated Gerrick and the Senate led by McConnel stalled - Obama should have gone ahead and appointed Gerrick saying the Senate's Role was to ""advise and consent"" not to stall. But NO!"
The problem is the majority of WW voted for DT in 2016. And in TX 62% supported Rs being elected. (Which now TX has a full court with Rs serving.) Beto should have won.

"I wonder, given the damage the Dobbs decision did to the Republicans in 2022 and in the many referendums on Abortion and GOP Special Election disasters, if this Conservative Majority would have overturned Roe given the devastating fallout for the GOP? I predict it will lead to massive GOP losses in 2024 (polls show the GOP has never been more unpopular) : The Dems are taking the White House and both chambers of Congress next year thanks primarily to the Dobbs ruling…"

"I am a new convert to Republican justice, over turning Roe V. Wade bothered me, but when it comes to  laws making way for gender-affirming puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors, it must be stopped immediately. I am glad we have 6 Republican leaning supreme court justices, I am with them now."
Put Sen Whitehouse in the Whitehouse in 2024
Alito probably leaked it himself...
"The breach of trust came from the Supreme Court, when nominees lie under oath then refuse to recuse themselves for conflicts of interest. They should all resign. Period."
"In their confirmation hearings Gorsutch, Cavenaugh, and Coney-Barrett all said Row was estimated legal precident. 
Then ruled to over turn it the first opportunity they had."
"The only thing that Trump has been right about is that the total system is corrupt; and of course as a totally corrupt person, he wants to be at the top."
"Interesting people these Christian judges, this Supreme Court is now like Catholic Church - full of secrets and crimes against humanity."
No bombshell detected.
You can’t call them justices if they lied on their confirmation hearings.
"Don't tell me, let me guess. Ginny Thomas."
The supreme court is a breach of trust.
Liars appointing liars.
"while they protect the embryos before that child is born. but when the child grow to school age , and killed by gunman, that is ok with them.  what do they really want?"
The democrats have been hijacked by godless baby killers who wants to turn children into trans
So dismantling ROE vs WADE was a “goal” doesn’t that negate the authority of being a judge? Sounds like they have acted like TOOLS.
"We need to remember that barrett has 7 children because she ADOPTED, some are not her natural children and obstetrical doctors warn against having that many children because it takes a serious toll on the woman's health! These things need to be said publicly so that women who have not had children and men who will never suffer pregnancy and childbirth will begin to be aware! There is a complete disconnect in our society of what women actually go thru and the long term affects on the woman."
"I have as much confidence in the Supreme Court, As I do the corrupt FBI agent(s) that are STILL EMPLOYED. (Many agent(s) have also received a ‘Promotion’ for their corruption.). ‘It makes me sick to my heart’. I hope they’re happy."
Democrats are an evil evil party now and this is coming from a former democrat
"There is leadership and there is following.  The Court failed in LEADERSHIP!  Roe v., Wade created one National law for abortion; overturning it creates 50 State Laws.  That is FAILURE of leadership.

In effect denying medical care to women ..."
"This court Robert's,Kavanaugh beret and Thomas are a breach of trust"
Roberts says this leak was a breach of trust. Not as much as the breach of trust created when they betrayed their oath and the nation playing politics with people's lives and bringing suffering to women everywhere in their effort to turn back the clock to a time when women were the property of men.
Justice Alito was and is the leak.
How dare they make killing babies illegal.  That’s transphobic!
The SCOTUS is so corrupt. How can we ever respect their opinions? Such a disgrace to our country. 😔👎
Let's get to the bottom of this.
Just the fact that they discussed the scheduling of the hearing of the case shows what a f'd up clubhouse the supreme court is now.
Literally everyone upset about this are godless baby killers
"The supreme Court is long overdue for a tune-up if not a house cleaning. I wish it deserved the title ""Supreme"" but lately it feels more like Substandard. So disappointing."
The results of 'religious' brain washing of children from an early age backed up and reinforced by fear of 'judgement'  Man rules with the woman as second class who has to do what they are told if they know whats good for them!!
"It’s very clear, all these justices have no backbone to stand up for America’s democracy. America demands justice she cries for justice, and she will have justice. 

Lock trump up now!!!"
"Abort the ""supreme court""."
"I think ""bombshell"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. The Court is illegitimate and wholly corrupt. Not sure why everyone's so surprised."
"Let’s make this very simple.  When one party intentionally stonewalls an appointment, and then presses forward multiple appoints by their own party to create a conservative majority that results in the changing of law that the majority of Americans do not want, it is absolutely political. Period. Full stop.  When you have justices that lie and say one thing to get appointed and then do another, they are not judges of high integrity, they are politicians.  Period. Full stop.  There needs to be SCOTUS reform, oversight, ethics standards, and term limits."
A corrupt bunch.
Lock trump up now!!!
"Oh please. We all know that a Republican-stacked court was always going to overturn Roe. There was absolutely no chance it wasn't gonna happen. This has been their goal for decades. Well, one of their goals. This was inevitable. If it took Republicans another 30 years to get a majority, they would have still overturned Roe the first chance they got. The only way you can stop this is to stop voting for Republicans. Period. If you want to keep your rights and you know the Republicans are against you, absolutely never vote for a single one of them and always vote."
Literally everyone whose pro abortionist are godless baby killers
"RBG should have stepped down in 2014. She didn't, and Amy Barrett will now be a reliable right-wing vote for 40 years.

Did it to yourselves, white women. 😂 Take that 53% of you who voted for trump and figure out how to fix the abortion mess that *YOU* created. 🤷🏿‍♂️"
With great power comes great responsibility. Apparently absolute power becomes corrupts absolutely. It is time to restore balance to the Supreme Court to restore our rights and freedom.
7 kids tf😳 cap those tattered frayed tubes 😳🤮
I think Ginni Thomas leaked it. She had access to her husband's computer and we know she wanted Roe gone. They hid who did the leak to protect her.
"Kangaroo court... Basically the idological cesspool of the slop known as ""conservative"""
Seems from outside the US like deep corruption. Prejudicing cases before trial!😊
"The fix was in when McConnell interfeed with the functioning of government during the Obama administration and the orange mob boss gained power. 
Everything else is just lipstick on a pig."
I ejaculae more substantial loads than whatever this c*m rag of a court passes as tenured stability
"Every time they think they win, they loose more election. Vote blue 💙 and reinstate women's rights to healthcare."
Conservatives will reverse the ban on abortion when they realise that the growth of non-white populations is increasing significantly.
"Roe vs Wade was always going to be tossed out by this Supreme Court. The whole song and dance of ""careful deliberation"" was just as much a song and dance as the GOP swearing to listen to the evidence against Trump for his impeachment and then openly saying ""we'll never vote for impeachment."" The Democrats know it, the Republicans know it and even the neutral voters know it."
So they conspired strategically.  It was all step by step plan.  And what about all these cases conservatives are putting forward that are fake? Like the wedding planner who wasn't a wedding planner who made up a case and got it all the way to the supreme Court!?!  I call BS.
"Truly awful reporting, The Court didnt take Dobbs to spit on Ginsberg's grave. They already had the majority. Ginsberg herself said that Dobbs was bad law and would get overturned. At least the guest host tried to tamp down on his conspiratorial claims."
What does this have to do with “the law”?? This is ENTIRELY political!!  Worrying about appearances over substance is always political. This is just disgraceful!
"The SCOTUS itself is a breach of trust...
In 2023 Trump's SCOTUS is corrupted to it's conservative, authoritarian, racists, misogynistic core."
"All six members shown on this video should be permanently removed from the SCOTUS, disbarred, and placed in prison for their levels of corruption."
"When your country start stripping you of basic human rights, and civil rights; you no longer live in free country. You live in a country ran by the church via the old prunes elected into office. Over half the civil and basic human rights taken away from Americans have come with this phrase said by the politicians that supported it. ""It's against ""my"" religious views and in good faith I couldn't support or pass a bill that goes against my god."" 
You want freedom, it needs to start with all that serve federal and public office to sign a neutrality agree. This would have them agree that they will not allow their religious or personal beliefs or feelings influence the laws they pass. Rather they will do what the people want, or what is best for the people (you know the ones of many faiths and cultures). Second that is, all members of both houses of government shall serve a max of 2 terms of 4 years each. These terms start via election at same time as the president elect is chosen. Third, no one that has been impeached shall be allowed to run for office. That includes the POTUS, any federal office, and public/state office."
"Can’t we just come out and say what we all see, that Alito is the source of the leak?"
"Can’t we just come out and say what we all see, that Alito is the source of the leak?"
Pro-life forever
Clickbait - there's no bombshell here - it doesn't tell us anything about the leak.
"The Supreme Court sucks...""leaks"" are happening frequently & that just confuses  people. But I have to believe the Supreme Court will protect mothers as well as fetuses. No woman should d*e because the fetus they are carrying has catastrophic futures. Women aren't incubators! The recent woman who HAD to have the procedure, to save her own life, should not be decided by legislators, politicians. Doctors know what is best for patients, not Judges, legislators, or politicians. The Supreme Court HAS to see medical complications as actual real life scenarios....this isn't what ifs?"
That will cost many lifes.
"TIME TO IGNORE AND CANCEL THE SUPREME COURT.  
THE ARE OBSOLUTE AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH JUSTICE"
I think the justices are just upset because it came out that 5 justices or known liars
"LIES ONCE AGAIN BY THE DISHONEST CORRUPT LEFTISTS.
What a bunch of media hacks. YOU MEDIA LOSERS.  The ruling had nothing to do with overturning a right to an  abortion."
More on the wreckage of the US justice system brought by Trump et al
I like Jodi Kantor's analytical mind. I wouldn't mind seeing her on more often for future discussions.
Ginny Thomas leaked the draft to Politico. Sam Alito and Clarence Thomas were in on it. None of these three people can be trusted to tell the truth about anything.
This nonsense will hand Democrats wins next year.
Breach of trust? This right wing SCOTUS is beyond trust . They are a kangaroo trump court .
"Alito said that abortion is not mentioned in the Constitution.
You know what else isn't mentioned in the Constitution? Capitalism. God. Jesus.
These theocrats need relocated to Afghanistan."
I still blame Hillary for this.
Why is it just wonens health.  Sue for discremination
"The United States is backwards and behind in so many other ways, why not in this bit of personal liberty as well."
"Person A should never ever make medical decisions for Person B!!!

"" Pro life"" is made up by conservative radicals to push their unfavorable position. Ending an embryo to save the life of the woman carrying it outweighs those radicals' opinion!"
Clarence Thomas had an abortion!!! Actually still does!!!!! His wife!!!!!!
no report on the american people being removed from homes to make room for ILLEGALS?
"So, the Supreme Court ISN'T above playing politics?  This is a thing I so do not want to believe...but the evidence is incontrovertible. And that Beerboy Kavanaugh should openly suggest deceiving the American people so that Amy Conehead can look good? Well, that one is NOT a surprise. What's most disappointing is, where were the liberal justices during all this---why didn't they speak out to the American people once it became clear that trump's patsies were working to make themselves look legit, like right after they'd lied to congress about Roe. All I can say is, they'd better stay holy on the presidential immunity case, b/c now all eyes are on them."
"So, Americans are by a strong majority pro-choice, but a strong minority of religious fascists is anti-choice. 
But against all logic, abortion will be banned for decades. This is a disaster and shouldn’t happen in a democracy. The US political and judicial system is perfectible."
Communist Democrats and their terrorist Projecting their Thirst For Murdering Unborn children and Women's rights
At best these dishonorable agents of Christian apologism use their power for flagrant abuse of religious  dogma that gets metastases into secular Law now dripping with the venom of christian nationalism.  This is basic treason and an overt denial of their oath to our Republic!
"Biblically-speaking, life begins at birth. Read the bible and note the many passages with the phrase ""breath of life"". This isn't some superpower of God. This is God defining life as the moment when a person takes their first breath! This whole debate is a farce by an extremist group parading a deceitful interpretation to gain and hold political power."
So we are blaming the right wing justices for all the abuses they are committing…when in fact they were appointed by one Leonard Leo and confirmed by one Mitch McConnell and his right wing republicans…these right wing justices were carefully selected for that purpose…and if we think is only about abortion think again …don’t forget that are there for life and they were selected young in age for a reason ….we are in big trouble on this country…..and if we think the abortion ruling is based on on religion then we are been fooled ….that ruling is all about money and power nothing to do with religion believe…since the Bible doesn’t condemn abortion ..so we are in danger with this right wing republican justices of losing our democracy….beware of all the right wingers with deep pockets cause their power is not limited to the Supreme Court..all the federal courts are in this …Texas comes to mind …wake up America let’s vote all these right wing republicans out of every office of legislation in this our republic….enough…
Medical procedures getting politicized is practice of medicine without a license. There is a reason why obgyns got to school for 12 years
The last thing you want to happen is for them to find out who ignored the confidentiality of the court and blabber mouth they were taking up the abortion issue because you know it was a leftist.
And nobody saw this coming ?  From the moment of the decision of Roe versus Wade the Conservative Political Wing pushed via their appointments to move back toward abortion restriction.
Nothing more than a bunch of overpowered silly figures !
Don't forget that these justices lied under oath about RvW being settled law.
As a retired judge I have long held the Supreme Court in high regard. I know have nothing but contempt for the body.
"They're mad about a 'breech of trust' on their side to distract from the 'betrayal of faith' for faith put in the Supreme Court that the vaaast majority of Americans support roe v. Wade and this isn't about law at this point, it's about not having proper separation of church and state because clearly woman with their doctors should determine what's right for the woman not politicians. Stealing or rights and trying to silence the majority, all thanks to corrupt Republicans."
"A bunch of Catholics deciding it is women & r*ped little girls jobs to HURT, SUFFER, & CRY to pleasure their sadists selves."
A clear case of how politicized the Court has become; another stab in the back of its legitimacy as the arbiter of American justice.
"""ordering an investigation into 'who did it'"" but no investigation into the crimes (violations of laws committed by regular citizens are crimes, but not if a SCOTUS justice like Clarence does it, not recusing in a trial against his wife9), and not investigating corruption.
Biden should have nominated 4 justices and the new majority should have passed ethics rule - even with the option to kick out corrupt and criminal justices; now Trump will nominate 4 more justices, like ""judge Aileen"" and Jim Jordan - only condition is absolute loyalty to Trump against the Constitution."
Yes No Trust for The DOJ
"The Supreme Court are no longer Credible. They are all Compromised and Rule how the Banks, Corporations, and Their Masters order them to.
They are of no use or value to or for The American People."
What is the basis of law if not religiously held moral values?
We need to replace supreme court every few years.
I still contend that it was Sotomayor all along who leaked the draft Dobbs opinion.
I think the country should ways new ways preventing preacancies birth control pills for men etc
They don't say who leaks it so don't waste your time on this video.
Pelican Brief
"""They may take our dog but they will never take our FLEA-DUMB!""  MEANS WHAT?"
"They leaked it to ""soften the blow"" and should be sued for PRACTICING MEDICINE WITHOUT A LICENSE. 😡"
Our family decided to leave the US mainly due to this issue and also the safety problems! I will not let the untrained and uneducated people push their religion to decide what medical care I NEED or my children in the future!!!!
The Supreme Court didn’t take abortion rights away. They moved the decision about abortion rights out of the Federal government and closer to the people- just like Republican Constitutional Democracy demands.
The Supreme Court is corrupt!
"Her vote to not take the case was entirely self-serving, not ethical.

And that leak changed absolutely nothing, I don't care what the justices claim: they went in with the sole purpose of overturning Roe."
Infiltrated with tRuMpErs
"The courts are crooked. 
Thomas is proof of that 
I think they will support trump throughout as they both need each other to keep what they both want"
Yet more evidence suggesting that the US Supreme court has become illegitimate.
You can still get one in 99 percent of the country so what's the big deal
Total bs they turned it over to the states to decide if you live in a libtarded leftist democrat state you can keep slaughter babies all day long so abortion isn't banned in the USA
What’s the problem?  I flew business class to Europe for my abortion and stayed at the Ritz-Carlton.  I don’t see the problem.
Alito leaked that document.  No doubt.
The Supreme Turds 💩
Regressive SCOTUS.  And what are checks and balances for this body of justices? Wake -up USA. They do have a fiduciary responsibility to the rule of law
"Thank you, Jody.
And Adam."
the writer of the draft is the the leaker .. duh 🤦‍♂️🙄🤦‍♀️
I believe that Alito is the leak.
"I knew it right away it was leaked by a conservative. Why? It would have been more helpful, politically, if it was leaked later for liberals. You don’t need to be named Niccolò to figure it out."
"Women need to start thinking about the laws needed to control men's bodies the way they control women's bodies. Fornication and adultery are prohibited in the bible yet men do it all the time and get away with it and they cause unwanted pregnancies. Ther must be laws set in stone regarding men's bodies, in our judicial system and its time to balance the scales. Men cannot have their cake and eat it too!"
"I no longer trust the SC. Corruption has already entered the SC. By keeping it a secret, they denied the voice of the people to share their perspective. They slapped the majority of Americans people while supporting the minority group. Will never forgive the SC."
"It's not about politics? Remind me, don't we have a highly corrupted judge that still resides in there, with bribes from rich business people?"
"The Supreme Court, Government has no right in the rights of a woman.Why is they still fighting slavery."
What is so Supreme about a Court of 9 people stabbing each other in the back and leaking information? Was  Clarence's the only person who knew Ginni was working with insurrectionists?  Yeah Right!
If the American people vote for a referendum it can introduce a term limit
"Justice Roberts should have shown the same amount of outrage about Justice Clarence’s behaviour, and lack of ethical standards being demonstrated by his fellow judges! And, leave women’s rights alone."
"Was the plan leaked by Alito's office?  It certainly looks that way.  It was a means to expedite the clampdown on and removal of civil rights in the USA.  Filthy business.  Never turn your backs on these ""justices"".  They have no justice intended for YOU."
The next time the Democrats get all three branches of government they have to fix the supreme Court what a disaster
"We are doomed as it is nearly impossible to amend the Constitution partly because any Amendnent can be blocked by a mere 13 States  withholding approval. And since the Constitution is the Supreme law of the land, it cannot be changed by any process except for another Amendment. Does this directly effect the Supreme Court, I don't know, but I'm guessing it does. The Equal Rights Amendment ( Sorry Ladies) is still in Limbo a century after a guarantee of Gender Equality was proposed to Congress....The ERA was proposed in 1923 but did not pass Congress until 1972. And under U S law Amendments to the Constitution must be ratified by three fourths, 38 of the State Legislatures and do not require Presidential Approval..."
Rules for thee not for me.
The problem in the US is that Presidents are allowed to nominate their choices for the court.  This needs to be taken away from politicians and done by some other means that removes partisan politics from the process.  There's is no way it's a fair and balanced system if the court becomes another arm of the party in power.
"this is clearly disgusting...they all must be laughing their way to the bank, both figuratively AND literally...did that earn Thomas and his wife another hefty deposit to their account? No amount of $$ is worth the pain and suffering to anyone that needs an abortion, then to take the RIGHT to choose away!"
"Chris and Jody, I applaud all that you do. I implore you to always include commentary on the right's agenda to eliminate the separation of church and state as nothing more than a lever to clutch on to power at the cost of women's rights. Women know when they're ready to be moms. It's not up to anyone else. Also, please always include framing on the societal impact of underparented children.  The right's pro-life til birth and pro-prison til death are a contradiction that are both morally and fiscally bankrupt.  Nutured children push themselves to become capable adults. Unwanted/undervalued children push away, struggle, & need grace from others. All the sacred texts discuss this. To limit yourself to one book or, worse, someone else's interpretation of one book is America's new pandemic."
"Surprise Surprise, a bunch of men decided to strip women of our bodily autonomy asap...disgusting!"
"In making their judgment, the conservative justices, helped a lot of Republican politicians lose their jobs..."
"ah, yes, blame the leaker, not the poor justices."
What's up with Rudy?
Chris Hayes “reading into things” that people didn’t say sorta seems like a conspiracy theorist…
"Cowards and liars and turds, oh my."
“Breach of trust” who’s?
Who listens to MSDNC
They all lied under oath
SCOTUS is the breach of trust
"Who keeps these republican RICO political honest? Their actions smell, what will they hide when the Insurrection and republican attempts to destroy our democracy surface 😢😢😢😢😮😮😮"
"Ginsberg stood in the gao as long as she could, keeping American women from being chattel, and now she is gone, and so are women's rights. Amy Coney Barrett is the worst kind of traitor."
"Breach of trust is what these Supreme Court members did to the entirety of the American people. To be exact, their decision opens the legal door to declare all rights not written down in the Constitution and amendments as not rights at all.

To be crystal clear, rights written into the Constitution are legally called ""enumerated rights."" Meaning they've been written down in the Constitution. Before this abortion decision, there used to be rights called ""unenumerated rights"", meaning they are not written down anywhere in the Constitution.

Unenumerated rights were ones like a right to travel. A right to wear the cloths you want. A right to eat the food you like. Madison pointed this out before the Constitution was finished in the Federalist Papers and was deeply concerned because he believed a Supreme Court might nullify all unenemerated rights in a decision. And this Supreme Court did just that with this abortion decision saying, ""The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion"". The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to wear the clothes you want either. See it now?

What this Supreme Court has done with this abortion decision is say, there are no unenumerated rights. That you do not have a right to eat what you want. You do not have a right to travel. You do not have a right to wear the cloths you want, and all similar things. This because those are not written down in the Constitution. ""Enumerated"".

This is what Madison was terrified of. That a Supreme Court would make such a decision. And they just did. So believe it or not, Americans no longer have a single right to do anything that isn't outlined specifically in the Constitution. They've declared all ""unenemerated rights"" as unconstitutional with this abortion decision outlined in their opinions. How's that for a wake up call? Bet you didn't know either did you?"
Man it must be a pain in the backside for the honest fair thinking more intelligent Democrat Supreme Judges dealing with the corrupt bias less intelligent republican Supreme Judges who hold the majority
Thanks Trump and the Republican Party😡....You Big Dummie's...Fred SanFord.😎
The six justices who are Roman Catholic should have disqualified themselves - it's like Christian Scientist judges banning appendicitis operations.
Mthe conservatives on the bench are owned by the Koch's??
"Six of the most hated and  vile people on the courts. We wouldn't be going through all this upheaval if they had just left Roe as is. It's clear they hate women and consider us to be 2nd hand citizens to be barefoot and in the kitchen, or bedroom, and nowhere else. I hope women unite and get each and every one of the GOP     out and vote Blue for all women out there.  This, SCOTUS is the beginning of the end."
Most of the people who claim to be against Roe have never actually read it.  It had different requirements for each trimester of pregnancy.
Abolish lifetime appointments
Old news!
"so my takeaway is that Supreme court judges do not just benignly sit and wait for cases to reach their court and then let the law decide in honest and open debate.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  They have pre determined agendas and they play politics (lie, cheat, steal)  to achieve it. Bending the law to do as they (their billionaire owners/donors) want."
It was Ginnie a bet it was Ginnie
The supreme court is corrupt and not a democratic institution....it is an archaic model under the fashion of a monarchy or Roman republic. There should be no positions for life in America. It was all a well played Game.
"Collectively, we deserve everything that is coming including this topic. Of course I do not agree."
"They acted like vultures, they lied. Corrupt. Not ""for the people"", they are for their own agenda, for theocracy. 😡"
A very corrupted Supreme Court and even lower courts.     All these justices have been bribed.      It is about controlling every aspect of women's lives.
That’s exactly what it looks like 😮
"I’m so NOT surprised. The only thing supreme about them is their hypocrisy, entitlement and total lack of integrity"
The breach of trust was done by the lying members of SCOTUS that wouldn’t reveal their bias stance on Row v Wade. We have No sympathy for you Supreme Court! 😊
"98% of biologists agree that human life begins at fertilization.  You might as well argue that evolution is ""just a theory,"" at that point.  The fact that human life begins at fertilization has more scientific support than global warming does among geologists.  Let that sink in."
"Don't we all know it was either Alito or Thomas (or their staff on explicit request of the Injustice) who leaked the oppinion to pressure Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett?"
"Got to rework laws governing the SCOTUS. We now see this is  a court of greed and corruption. They make the Roman Senate and the Chief Priest and the Pharisees of JESUS day look like school boys. To be fair not all but enough of them. Known Crooks passing judgemental it some cases to the highest bidder. GOD hated corrupt judgement so bad HE said HE will clothe HIMSELF in righteous and fight against it ISAIAH,59.. If GOD said HE hated it, they are not getting away with anything."
Did she get her clothes in The Matrix?
"It has a separate DNA from the mother, it has a separate immune system from the mother, it has a separate heartbeat from the mother. It has separate organs from the mother. 

The argument that it is not a human life suggests that because it relies on the body of the mother for survival it cannot be viewed as an individual life with constitutional or even basic human rights.  That is the weakest argument because the same could be said for any vulnerable human especially babies.  

Face it, that is a baby and abortion is murder.  It's not an opinion, it's a fact."
America just need to stop voting Republican and the problem would be solved.
"Mindblowing to me, as a german, to appoint anyone for LIFE in such a position of power with no good fail safe to prevent abuse of power"
"BIDEN NEEDS TO EXPAND THE SCOTUS to 11 and/or we NEED to impeach Clarence Thomas for bribery (Which we already 100% have factual evidence of) and investigate Kavanaugh who was never properly Vetted and screened. This is not partisan, those are facts."
"The hypocrisy of this court is beyond belief.  First of all, two of the justices positions should have been appointed under Obama and Biden,using a rule that Mitch McConnel set up and then only abided by the rule when it helped him get two more seats.  The fact that they seated a Justice a month before Biden took office is unbelievable.  And, both of the new justices told Congress they would support established law when specifically asked about Roe vs Wade during their Congressional interviews.  You would think the Supreme Court would be an example for everyone to follow instead of being a politically based joke."
"States with restrictive abortion laws... With the exception of texas... Represent less than twenty percent of the national g d p.  They are welfare states that depend.

Their names are smeared in excrement and will be for eternity. These people have no doubt convinced themselves they'll be remembered in history, but their egos don't allow them to realize they'll be remembered with utter disdain and total loathing for generations to come
They think they're going to be remembered like Jefferson, when in reality they'll be remembered like Aaron Burr."

"America treats this as a purely personal issue. But it isn't, at least not in a wider context. The world watches and I know for a fact, that most people trusting this supreme court wouldnt get taken for a serious person in many countries outside the US. Only a matter of time until this influences diplomacy."
"There scared of people showing up at there house and children’s school , can’t blame em DOJ violated there rights… please don’t take the job if your gonna cave everyone some freak protests"
Supreme Court is tainted with religious zealots
"Another genius in New York court, too smart to google trumps property value …. Great jobs and great pensions we pay for as they look down on us… 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼TRUMP"
So what’s the news on alito and Clarence not making public all the lavish gifts from billionaires
We have fascists at very level in this country .How can the average American defend against?
Corruption at the heart USA justice. It's the problem of corrupt political lifetime appointment who are often bribed.
"Amy Coney Barrett,  Brett Cavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch all said that Roe v Wade is settled president during their confirmation hearing which amounts to purgury."
"This is all the result of one man's lifetime quest to overturn RvW, and why he allowed Trump to remain president. 
This is evil of the highest calibure, All for the sake of ideology, in something that has NO benefit or loss to them."
No one trust the Supreme Court anymore
So phantom dark money's work behind closed doors selling out good children's everywhere.
Sickening judges
"It’s the Christian/Catholic Supreme Court now, and you liberals will henceforth refer to it as such!"
"4 of these ""judges"" are clearly NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE! Three of them appointed by Trump, 1 appointed by Bush! Thomas has shown himself to be a TOOL of the Billionaires  he sups with for a long time..."
"BS judges 
There is no fairness in the u.s. system. I give no respect to judges choose side."
She s maga also so there was some hidden petty reason I m sure
What this shows is that the Supreme Court is a political entity plain and simple.
We cant have a supreme court relisting their votes es its nit right. Our laws are our business . Also no more lifetime terms for them. Transparency.
"Please, leave abortion aside. It's a shame we have several overtly corrupt, crooked individuals, enacting laws that rule our country and society. It's an absolutely abject situation we take like it should be the norm. Thomas, Roberts,  Alito, and Gorsuch should have been investigated, tried, and put behind bars. Instead, these judges have made their own rules that make them immune to prosecution. The rest of the civilized world looks at us, laughs but feels nauseated."
"For me,  The only bombshell from this story is that ACB wanted to wait until next session. I was expecting more details about the actual leak and not the consequences. Interesting but no bombshell."
"SCOTUS - Must have term limits. What svotus pulled was just plain 
EVIL. !!!"
Lied from msnbc
Why would you need longer than 15 weeks to make up your mind? Democrats are sick.
"LOL, if whole cemetaries can still cast votes and help the favored politician get elected.  Death should not hinder the Supreme Court.  Justice Ginsberg can still cast her vote dead or alive."
Anita Hill warned about Thomas
"They need to be shamed.   Every time they show up to court, protesters need to shout shame shame shame. They know what they did, and expect us to forget and forgive."
It's time to add more seats to the SCOTUS bench.
Alito leaked the decision- it’s not a secret. Roe was settled law so there was no reason to take it up other than to overturn it. They all lied at their confirmation hearings before the American people when they promised they wouldn’t review Roe.
"The [supreme] court is a corrupt band of MAGAT supporters. They are a clear and present danger to our democracy. Look no further than Ginny Thomas. By the way Clarence, how much does it cost to buy a supreme court justice? May be we should ask your owner, Harlan Crow."
I have no confidence at all in the us Supreme Court. It needs radical changes. Appointees by a panel and term limits to start. How is it a good idea to give anyone a job for life?
"The forces that passed all these bans in the wake of Dobbs would have worked around, if not danced and skipped around, a 15-week 'compromise'. The exceptions would still be written on air, water and sand, while the restrictions would steel-reinforced oak. They were horrible in Dobbs, but SCOTUS was also explicit: Do it because we can, and talk big about what's to come. Those two aspects were the only favors they did for reproductive rights, making it crystal clear they were there to erase progress, reason and hope."
The supreme court has too much power in all things
"These CORRUPT JUDGES need to be removed from the Supreme Court! Bribes, breaking your oath of office are illegal under the law!🇺🇸"
You were so close at the end when you suggested barret was only holding out because she was being pressured by the other justices that oppose the reversal of roe.... in fact its the inverse. Barret is suddenly changing and withholding her vite so get a better deal for herself from the other judges that want to reverse roe. Remember how much corrupt backdoor donations clarance thomas received and never reported. How much you want to bet all those kickbacks happened during these secret court talks they dont let the public know about.  Corrupt at the highest levels  and the only thing holding it all together for so long was justice ginsberg keeping people honest.
"Ginsberg should have retired during Obama”s presidency, she was very selfish and now women are dying"
Why hate black conservatives???? Thomas is probably the best supreme justice America has… and if he went on a trip with a rich person so what there friends aren’t gonna be homeless… where do you think the bidens were staying in Nantucket ???
kick out all christian judges.. no faith should be taken into account with these issues..
"''Leaks'' of explosive political decisions are never ''accidental''
Leaks are a good way to gauge the likely response  by the public when 'Officially'' announced.
All good news decisions are announced on Prime Time TV  during Prime viewing hours in a glare of publicity.
All bad news is released at 1 minute to midnight on a Saturday evening..Preferably during some or other catastrophic event, Earthquake or Hurricane or mass shooting..
Carefully choreographed"
"RBG was a remarkable person who led a courageous and honest life and made huge strides for women and all humans. 
  That said, I wish she had decided to retire early in Obama's second term."
Pack the court
Whoever leaked the decision was for sure someone affiliated with the Federalist Society and Leonard Leo. The evidence of that is that Leo had a party the night before it was released at his home in Maine with a number of big players in the effort. My money is on Alito from the jump.
Democrats had 50 years to codify Roe and decided it wasn’t worth it. I blame democrats for our liss
Imagine having a Supreme Court the composition of which is dominated by liars.
"If decision was made based on culture change and religion headings views, your reverting removing rights, as what the British government did when the first colonists came here for. Your argument option would have be all allowing of people, not history telling us this, but human rights and civilization history. It’s sad this pushed the nation backwards and looped, people die from this stuff, only hope and faith something restores the future, brighter future forward as one nation."
These MAGA GOP justices LIED UNDER OATH During their Confirmation Hearings! REMOVE THEM!
"Great reporting by New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Adam Liptak.  So Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch were very excited to get their hands on that case. Not surprising.  Alito and Thomas are the true enemies of women in America, more so than the others.  John Roberts legacy will be tainted, and he will be seen as a weak Chief Justice during his tenure. The corruption of the court is what he will be remembered for."
these people are called judges.....ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
"It is simple, there is no complete sepatation of church and state. You guys remember when Trump posed with the Bible. This should tell the influence of the Christian religion."
"Sadly, the USSC too often strikes me as the final means by which a minority view can be imposed on the majority. This is not Justice, it is tyranny."
"How Roberts Replaced Scalia ???
Scalia told Obama that ""Obamacare"" was ""UNCONSTITUTIONAL"" ! Obama started to Look for a ""REPLACEMENT"" !!!  He Interviewed Roberts, Before Scalia's, DEATH ???  Roberts Agreed, to Uphold Obamacare !  Robert's was Easily Blackmailed, for Illegally Adopting Irish Children... Obama gave Scalia one last Chance,,, when he Flew on Scalia's Plane with Scalia, to Texas. Scalia, again, said NO ! Obama then,,, Had Scalia MURDERED !!!"
They are like War-what are they good for?....Do we really need a SCOTUS! It’s like they are Gods-& can make laws that all have to abide by! But they in turn-can be bought -by the highest bidder & don’t have to be accountable to anyone. It is said - “No Person is an Island”-well these SCOTUS are CONTINENTS!!!!!😢😮
"Attn: Women, if you want your body to belong to you ONLY, VOTE BLUE 💙💙💙💙💙💙, so, we have say over our bodies, I wonder , what's next , will they take,"
The Supreme Court has never been non-partisan. The law is always a reflection of the politics of the people. And the Supreme Court will always reflect the politics of the judges on the bench. How is that hard to understand? There is no law independent of politics.
"Republicans, one and all! Republicans are all for personal responsibility, and freedom unless we don’t approve!"
The 6 justices pictured above are no less corrupt than a Jim Jordan. It’s organized corruption in fact.
Every time you think the US cant be any more of a clown show they go and prove us wrong.
"It's not about abortion, it's about imposing control over other people.  It's about taking away the rights of females.  Next will be the right of women to vote, or the right of blacks to vote, or the right of xxx.  The movement is about removing the freedoms of the constitution away from the people of the governed. Just take as example the women in Texas who could legally get an abortion due to one of the exception, who was attacked by the attorney general of the state. Laws for the governed not for the elites."
"These judges are just like trump,a bunch of liars,"
🇨🇦👍
Delay to gain votes and change minds
Barrett isn't even qualified to be a Justice!  Ginsberg should have left when Obama asked her to retire
Wah wah wah. Them some tears there.
Wasn’t it Trump it’s not that hard to figure it out
The most bereft SCOTUS money can buy!
"( 7:03 ) why is Justice Samuel Alito allowed to collude with bro dude Kavanaugh about how they would vote on abortion rights?  Alito had already written the outline of how to challenge Roe v Wade, why is he allowed to know how any other Supreme Court justice will vote?"
"It doesn't ""look like"" it's about politics and power.  It IS about politics, power and most of all money.  These people are easily bribed and they don't do anything to hide it.  Nothing can be done about it because the people that have been appointed have no morals.  These are the absolute worst people in the world to appoint to lifetime positions where they have power over everyone."
Very telling that a bunch of old men demonstrate their power by deciding what women are allowed to do with their body.
"The behavior of the Right Wing super majority of the Supreme Court of the United States has done more to undermine trust and respect in that institution since before the Civil War.
Reform is long overdue."
Their appointment should not have a political attachment
"💥💥YOUR VIEWERS ARE GOING TO FIND OUT, VERY SOON, THAT YOU’VE BEEN LYING TO THEM💥💥YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT’S GOING ON!💥💥AND WHO YOU TAKE YOUR ORDERS FROM!💥💥

💥💥Your Whistleblowers have been saying this for a long time💥💥"
Completely pointless clip
"( 2:22 ) we already know there was no debate on *how to decide any challenge to Roe vs. Wade* - Justice Alito had already written the outline of how the Supreme Court would overturn abortion rights. That has been public for years now, but our news providers only talk about what is ""new""."
Jodi was very good. Uncanny resemblance to Tim Roth in a wig though.
No surprises that the religious bigots of the myopic regressive Roberts SCOTUS acted as such. It's who they are. From now on when any Dem in congress refers to Cheeto Mussolini he should do so as 'Der 🍊Führer'.
Elito leaked it.
"I didn’t need the recap, I wish you’d have cut right to the story."
I’m not sure what is new news here. It was pretty obvious why there was a leak and the whole investigation around it a sham. Is this just confirmation?
"Supreme court of chaos robs millions of pregnant women of civil rights by abandoning their sacred duty to protect citizens from unconstitutional state legislative action criminalizing health care.
This is an autopsy. Trumputin, and his cohorts in congress made this happen, ripping the seams from the democracy of the United States."
"They should be impeached, instead of Biden, the took an oath and they stated that Roe was precedent. So they broke their oath. Why else take an oath to the constitution ? id it written on toilet paper ???"
Payback to Trump for their appointments
The judges gave in to pressure. What a shame for judges who should NEVER let outside influence sway them.
"For the judge who uses the threat of changing her vote from one position to the complete opposite, this is a political decision rather than a moral or legal one.  The leak exposes this and exposes her immorality.  Obviously, she feels no self-blame, self-guilt, nor self-disapproval for her own actions, regardless of whether the country criminalizes abortion or not.  That is unsurprising since she was placed on the bench with the other two corporate lapdogs, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, to go along with the billionaires' house laborer, Thomas.  Thomas went ten years on the court without speaking a word.  He was a Monsanto corporate lawyer who decided over their deadly cases for American agriculture.  Now the situation is volatile because without abortion, the population of unwanted children rises, and they become the Most likely ones to commit homicide.  So, homicide rates will skyrocket in fifteen to twenty years, depending on the outcome of this case.  Of course, corporate elites would prefer this to distract people from their money and asset collection."
So ironic that justice Ginsburg (who refused to resign during Obama's presidency and a pro choice supporter) death caused this law to unravel.
The fix was in. Corrupt Supreme Court.
"Do not assume this is a change of heart by the various right leaning corrupt Supreme judges. This is a political move, pure and simple, the single most contentious issue that will swing many voters in the up and coming election is women's' freedom to choose, take this issue away and many voters may return to supporting trump, a purely tactical decision!"
"It is about politics and power, not law and reason.  The Extreme Court celebrates the Fascist five."
"A great deal of discussion that ultimately changes nothing. This is an illegitimate court, purpose built for the intent of dismantling 80 + years of socially progressive jurisprudence."
"""Elections have consequences."""
"The pill is not an abortion. There is nothing but sperm swimming. No viable anything. And a man should never be able to decide. Women make up over half the population, in America and, the World. Equality Must prevail!"
"Supreme corrupt court does not see women as equal humans to men; thus they took away women's rights to healthcare and autonomy over their bodies and life decisions. America is much more fascist than we were made to believe. Notorious RBG worked so hard to finally install women's right to choose and these MAGA fascists just decided to destroy people's lives just for control purposes. Too much nasty ""religious"" people in politics that use their faith to suppress people that think differently!!!"
"You are praising her for voting “no” on hearing the the case are over-the-top. She knew it wasn’t going to matter. 
This was her attempting to set 
 boundaries amongst her coworkers  (specifically her party members).

Kavanaugh was duplicitous at his hearing- not a leap to see he would be more so behind closed doors."
"Regardless of Barrett’s original stance against taking the case, the conservative justices overturned Roe for Dodd and now women have to travel over state lines for abortions.  They’re probably proud of themselves believing they’re doing God’s will.

I just hope the child baring women of today keep eyes on who took away their right to choose and ability to terminate non-viable pregnancies."
"Who in there right mind  would keep  THESE  6-7  FAR   RIGHT  JUDGES  ON  THE  SUPREME COURT...?
AS  I'M   NOT  AN   AMERICAN   BUT as   MY  GREAT, GREAT, GREAT GRANDFATHER'S  WORK  which also included   numerous  works...   including ""CRIMINAL LAW and PROCEDURE ""...""

Thank you  these are  my  humble opinions.."
"Only in a banana republic you would expect judges to be appointed by the leading political party, instead of a panel of experts. Sometimes the USA looks like one."
Another fake mainstream mockingbird news channel 😂
"Funny how certain supreme court justices who've used their federal jobs of being court employees that have enriched their and family bank accounts, whove certain scj chosen to be knowling in the pocket of dark money influences and bribery by giving luxury vacations buying homes and vaction homes and paying for schooling for family education.  And  certain actions of scj have continualy shown  that these certain scj are being corrupted and manipulated either thru blackmail attempts or finicial improvements..the doj and irs need to do investigation for rico and false tax statements, if hunter biden is being investigated by irs as private citizen than certainly by federal employee standards of received vaction .vechiles .homes education these certain sitting judges should also be investigated  in the end they are just federal employees and should be held to same standars as other employee's actions codes and ethics across america.."
The most corrupt White House and DOJ in history
"Optics. They waited a long time to ban abortion, what’s another few months?"
Honorble... 🤣🤣🤣😇
"Justice Barret has seven children who had the good fortune to be wanted and born into a well-to-do family; and I do know that the well-to-do have existential problems of their own to deal with.  
But not having the financial means to properly raise a child ain't one of those problems.
1. The Supreme Court Justices should be at least subject to a limited term of civil service,  since they are not elected but appointed.
2. The Justices should always have the ever-present precedent of financial needs in mind when a mother to be makes the decision to have or Not To Have an abortion based on her future economic ability to properly take care and be able to raise her child.
3. In my Personal opinion The US. Supreme Court needs to have ""its Buble"" Bursted."
There are countries that separate all three branches of government.  Presidents are not allowed to involve themselves in installing anyone.  Legislators have no say in the other branches and the judicial are not appointed but investigated and screened by a body experts in democracy.
The sUPRENE cOURT will ruin this country
SCOTUS?  The Dictatorial Court would be more appropriate.  Term limits should be mandatory.  😡
Senator Susan Collins should not be surprised at being deceived during the confirmation hearings of prospective justices. Any dismay she may have felt is pointless as the damage has already been done.
"This is so stupid. Amy Barrett did not change her vote for any philosophical reasons, only because voting to overturn roe v Wade too soon makes her look bad."
"It is a major disappointment when those, selected to ensure that others abide by the law and do the right thing are themselves unable to do the right thing."
"Never again should the supreme court decide against the wishes of democrats, they will be haunted, attacked and slandered until the left influences the outcome to get their way. America's long known glory downhill moving so far under these woke authoritarians"
America continues walking meekly into arms of fascism...F
SCOTUS has no room to talk about breach of trust!
"two members of the supreme court were appointed because they said R V W was law & they wouldn't support it, so shouldn't they be sacked for lying at their interview?"
"Before attempting to carry out their obvious agenda, the ""honorable"" justices would do well to remember that we all know where their homes are."
"Her point for changing her vote was to try to look less guilty.  She was never gonna be persuaded,  periodt. There was no question."
"And what  this proves, beyond a shadow of doubt, is that the decisions of the SCOTUS are strictly political sugar coated with a legalese spin."
"Judgements should be based on the whims of the majority, and not on the whims of a handful of mainly white male conservatives, regarding women's health issues."
"Yea America is on its way of becoming a NOT A FREE NATION , Slowly taking the rights of its citizens. What the politicians should do is take the statue of LIBERTY DOWN. What a joke."
"Chris, i guess you don't have to be objective."
😮😮😮😮
Crooked Clarence Thomas has embarrassed himself and the court.  It will never be the same.  It has lost the respect of the nation.
We need to stop allowing judges to come from the bias and completely corrupt federalist society who we know have a blatant agenda.
"Brilliant Jodi and Adam,  for your hard work...excellent job..thank you.."
We should all be ashamed of what has happened to the Supreme Court.  Corruption is destroying our country.
This is why Biden should load the Supreme court now.
Their decision to overturn wasn't based on law. It was based on their own  personal views espoused to their supporters down the years. It was politics not law and that shows that the SCOTUS is in practical terms corrupt.
"Women who voted Republican for decades are to blame as well. They couldn’t wait to overturn Roe. 
It’s absurd watching the Trumpers get excited about things they don't understand."
How can the whole USA be held in the hands of 9 people !!!....
"A Justice who even threatens to change her vote based on a political perception, shouldn't be trusted with a SCOTUS position. They are there to interpret the law, not make it to favor their own priorities."
The Robert’s court has abandoned precedent which will allow future courts to correct the rulings of this court.
The Democrats should never again approve a Republican nominee justice if they hold a Senate majority. The duality of the GOP's handling of Garland's nomination and Barrett's appointment is so appalling and has led to a SC that in no way represents the majority sentiment of over 300m Americans. There's no point the Democrats acting with  decency and civility for future appointments in the face of this.
An unhealthy leadership leads to an unhealthy populace.
"The federalist society knew very well Amy would cave without much pressure. In spite of her switching vote to hold off taking the case, they went ahead anyway and therefore she will now be frowned upon as corrupt and rightly so 🤷🏻‍♀️ SCOTUS is corrupted and Ailito and Thomas"
I don't understand how can someone support killing unborn human beings.
"Every one of those conservative justices lied under oath saying they would never change roe, they all did the second they got a chance. Why we are allowing any judges to come from the federal society knowing they are corrupt and have a specific agendas.  it should be common sense not to allow these people to even become judges. they are bought and paid for political operatives. And we appoint them to the highest positions and government with lifetime appointments."
Didn’t this exact same thing happen the last time?
Judges for life ! 😂😂😂
Supreme? More like Trash Court...
"When those of you in the Media continue to describe supreme court justices as accepting ( gifts )' when everyone watching knows that they are being bribed by Harlan Crowe, and Leonard Leo. They are bribes not gifts!!!!  How about the outcry from the Media for these corrupt justices to resign? How about the Media asking where, is DOJ??? FBI??? Here is a thought how about someone in the media asking Merrick, Garland How is it possible that the one person who has stolen more top secret and classified documents in our history still walks free!!!! The man who is the largest threat to our national security walks the streets free???"
Just look at these untrustworthy faces! They creep me out😮😮😮
Republicans are waging a battle on women. Time to take off the gloves. Women best grow a pair. Time to shut the bedroom door. No p*ssy for republicans. Shut the front door..on republicans.
Another wild conspiracy theory
"For 50 years Republicans argued that Roe should be overturned because it was a States Rights issue. Five seconds after Roe was overturned they started pushing for a national abortion ban, because now none of them believe it is a States Rights issue."
Best SC money can buy!
Which justice does the Vatican have a direct link to?
"It is about politics !    The conservative super majority only happened because of politics !!!  
The investigation about Kavanough was never thorough either.    
Alito does not want to follow moral rules about declaring benefits received.  
It’s about politics , influence and corruption !!!!"
"We all assume it was arrrogant a$$ Alito that let it out. So proud of the decision, he probably wrote immediately after perjoring himself over this issue to get on the bench. He has just been waiting YEARS for a case that gave him the chance to reverse Roe."
"If ever there was a time to expand the court to 13 it is now, this would have the real effect of restoring faith in the independence of the court and removing the corrupt and corrosive effect of the American heritage foundation that has hijacked our supreme court. For good measure trump’s corrupt nominations along with mr corruption himself ( Thomas should be impeached and removed from the bench) now as in Monday morning not a day later"
"What is the purpose of the Supreme Court and how does it function?

The purpose of the Supreme Court is to adjudicate conflicts and disputes between the States and to resolve petitions for redress of grievances when properly legislated laws are made by a properly assembled and operated legislature disproportionately affect, or otherwise disenfranchise, a State.

This necessitates that the Supreme Court must be assembled by a consensus choice agreement between the States where every State participates by making a list fixed number of candidates from their own State, and the aggregate list of candidates must be reduced to a pool of judges, no less than 7 and no more than 9, for 5 judges to be selected by lot starting with the petitioner to hear and decide the dispute or grievance. The States must be involved because they have agreed to abide by the decisions of the court for their grievances and those decisions are final, not mutable, meaning they cannot be changed, or overturned, by a later court.

We tend to forget this fact today, both in the assembly, which is different than replacements for vacancies, where the President is required to provide a list of nominees for the States to consider, a number and required qualifications is determined by the States in the Senate as part of their role of Advice and Consent, and established by Senate rules for their proceedings, and the President too must be chosen by Consensus Choice with the same requirement for the States themselves to provide a list of all the candidates that will be considered for that purpose through their electors, making the President’s lists of nominees also indirectly a choice of the States.

Here is where the Supreme Court was originally established by Article IX Clause 2 of the Articles of Confederation, and the only difference established by the Constitution of the United States is that the pool of judges will be continually seated during Good Behavior, and the appointment of a Chief Justice to Preside over the Court proceedings, but not participate in the those proceedings as one of the pool of justices. Everything else is the same, including that all petitions must be made to Congress as the last resort on appeal, not directly to the court, and Congress is then required to ensure that the petition is properly adjudicated as required by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

A.IX.C.2
[The united states, in congress assembled, shall also be the last resort on appeal, in all disputes and differences now subsisting, or that hereafter may arise between two or more states concerning boundary, jurisdiction, or any other cause whatever; which authority shall always be exercised in the manner following. Whenever the legislative or executive authority, or lawful agent of any state in controversy with another, shall present a petition to congress, stating the matter in question, and praying for a hearing, notice thereof shall be given, by order of congress, to the legislative or executive authority of the other state in controversy, and a day assigned for the appearance of the parties by their lawful agents, who shall then be directed to appoint, by joint consent, commissioners or judges to constitute a court for hearing and determining the matter in question: but if they cannot agree, congress shall name three persons out of each of the united states, and from the list of such persons each party shall alternately strike out one, the petitioners beginning, until the number shall be reduced to thirteen; and from that number not less than seven, nor more than nine names, as congress shall direct, shall, in the presence of congress, be drawn out by lot, and the persons whose names shall be so drawn, or any five of them, shall be commissioners or judges, to hear and finally determine the controversy, so always as a major part of the judges, who shall hear the cause, shall agree in the determination: and if either party shall neglect to attend at the day appointed, without showing reasons which congress shall judge sufficient, or being present, shall refuse to strike, the congress shall proceed to nominate three persons out of each State, and the secretary of congress shall strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing; and the judgment and sentence of the court, to be appointed in the manner before prescribed, shall be final and conclusive; and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit to the authority of such court, or to appear or defend their claim or cause, the court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence, or judgment, which shall in like manner be final and decisive; the judgment or sentence and other proceedings being in either case transmitted to congress, and lodged among the acts of congress, for the security of the parties concerned: provided that every commissioner, before he sits in judgment, shall take an oath to be administered by one of the judges of the supreme or superior court of the State where the cause shall be tried, “well and truly to hear and determine the matter in question, according to the best of his judgment, without favour, affection, or hope of reward: “provided, also, that no State shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the united states.]"
"It was not very smart of the Supreme Court
Now this political decision works against them, their allies"
"""God forbid a woman should have the right to choose for herself. Afterall, the Bible tells Man she belongs to him!"" Misogynistic bullsh*t! No man will ever accept anyone telling him what he can and cannot do!"
"Fed up with most of the members of the Supreme Court. They should all be investigated - ALL of them, to prove they are not corrupt.  Trump's appointees are the worst.   and Thomas..he needs to go away"
"Listen; roe v. Wade never gave a woman the choice to have or not have an abortion. Never. The way the decision reads gives the womans Dr. The athority to make the decision wether to terminate the pregnancy or not. Over a short time Doctors would just go along with the woman's choice not because she had the right but because it makes billions of dollars every year. Abortion isn't cheap and alot of money is made from the sale of the placenta etc. Ruth Ginsburg states the decision should have gone back to the state of Mississippi. Simply because some states are very liberal and some, for example in the bible belt are very conservative 
The decision was never implemented correctly in the first place. To bad."
So if I’m understanding beer boy wanted to lie to the public ?
The reporter looked the part.
Will investigate this. But the the corruption that happens. What a joke. Have no faith in the Supreme Court anymore
"There need to be term limits on SC judges, this in it for life thing, now with two relatively young federalists spells difficult times ahead I suspect."
"The republicans majority Supreme Court was created to make law those laws republicans elites wanted but r too unpopular for congress, who can be voted out, to pass w/out losing or risking their seats. American voters need to wake up. We’ve had a Republican Supreme Court for at least the past 150yrs, which would not be possible if we were a democracy. The Republican Supreme Court is also created to overturn or weaken any dem policy that does manage to pass. We saw the same thing around 1933-1970’s when FDR and dems were passing the bills we needed given the Great Depression. At first, the republican Supreme Court was oberturning or weakening every bill FDR got passed until fDR, who had large enough margins in congress threatened to expand the court. Only then did the republican Supreme Court moderated their views/decisions. I’m not sure this far-right Supreme Court would change w/threats. Even if they did, dems deserve a turn to have the majority on the Supreme Court and majority among the entire judiciary. We need to be electing more fat-left and left dems whenever possible. We need a landslide election for a far-left dem president. Landslides presidential elections r the only election that result in more significant changes. FDR, a far-left dem, won 4 landslide elections w/dems winning the majority of local, state/state legislatures, and federal government, minus the judiciary. That was a clear message to all government officials that the voters wanted change and the change FDR was bringing. We maintained FDR policies from 1933-1970’s. That all ended when voters foolishly fell for Reagan, a then far-right republican, w/a landslide election. We’ve been on Reagan policies most of the time since 1980. It’s those republican policies that have brought us to where we r today. As long as we elect enough gop candidates to either give the gop majority or to have divided government, where when the minority of times dems did win majorities in the house, senate, and WH, little significant changes occurrs bc dems in purple districts r concerned about losing their seats and we have divided government where about 50% want dem/progressive policies and the other 50% want far-right dictatorship. Aside from a landslide election of a fat-left dem, we must get margins large enough to expand the court and carry that out, which means the ppl have to apply massive pressure until it’s done."
"Horrible reporting on the part of MSNBC.  Chris Hayes need to either go or return to journalism school.  At the very least, he needs to take notes from Jodi Kantor; she was the only real journalist in that entire conversation."
"Forced birth is a religious ideology, and as such, illegal as per the first amendment, first sentence.  All who voted in favor over overturning Roe has violated their oath."
"🙏🏾❤️🔥QUARRELING ABOUT WORDS IS WORTHLESS 🔥❤️🙏🏾

“Rejoice that your names are written in heaven” (Luke 10:20).

“Keep reminding God’s people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the Word of Truth. Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly. Their teaching will spread like gangrene” (2 Timothy 2:14-17).

🙏🏾❤️ WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE IN JESUS ❤️🙏🏾
by: Joseph M. Scriven, 1820-1886

What a friend we have in Jesus,
all our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
all because we do not carry
everything to God in prayer.

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge;
take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In his arms he'll take and shield thee;
thou wilt find a solace there.

🙏🏾❤️ LORD JESUS GOD IS LOVE JOY HOPE & PEACE ❤️🙏🏾"
"Shiny object, What did Trump do now?"
Robert's Corrupt Supreme Court that is the most activist court in the history of the US
"The disingenuousness of Alito is the most offensive of all. We all remember how he was pointedly questioned about the status of Roe during his confirmation, and he kept saying that in his opinion, it was a matter of firmly settled precedent. His insincerity is breathtaking."
"The only reason Roe was overturned is the far left and Gen Z either voted for Trump or Jill Stein, or stayed home to protest Hillary, and elected Trump in 2016. And the crazy thing is, they are doing it again in 2024."
And all Roberts is worried about is who leaked it. Ridiculous! 🤦🏻‍♀️
"Thank you court
Stoping murder
Babies win😢😅"
Amy has done so much for other women 😏
Brittany Watts and Kate Cox are what happens when women's reproductive health are decided by Republican incels and wannabe Commanders.
"The Supreme Court is nothing more than a ""Political Action Committee""..... go figure."
"They will at least uphold the appeals court ruling on the abortion pill. They will probably have 6 votes for that .
But it's possible they will ban it completely. They'll have 4 for sure. Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch and Barrett."
I did it
"Supreme Court Justices:  how dare someone act unethically.. now let me take this call from a rich friend giving me an RV, free money and a luxury vacation!"
The power of this group is frightening and makes the USA look so corrupt and backward. Why would you allow anyone a lifetime appointment in such a body.
"So you can’t confirm that the leak was definitely Alito


Right… got it"
I think all of the Supreme Court Justices who stated that Roe was established precedence indicated that they would not overturn Roe during their confirmation hearing should be impeached.
Is the entire US experiment just Potemkin scenery?🤔
They lied to  U.S Amen.
"Half of the Justices LYING UNDER OATH to get the job was a ""BREACH OF TRUST!"""
Every Justice who voted to overturn Roe-V-Wade AND stated it was Accepted Case Law during their confirmation hearings should be Impeached and Removed since they lied under oath
"I'm sorry how does Justice exist in a forum, where the decisions makers make decisions based on their own personal biases. Supreme Court justices should be chosen on their ability to be impartial. Anything other than that is not Justice!"
Tho Oscar go to judges of the Supreme Court 😂
I am a practicing Catholic and a rabid Pro Choice woman.  It is my choice & no one should interfere!
My guess would be a clerk with principles(which the Court did not posess).
Could someone please tell me how a SCOTUS judge can be allowed to work until s/he dies and apparently can't be thrown out?
I think we should be really honest once for all: THIS COUNTRY IS VERY MUCH CORRUPT AS ANY OTHER COUNTRY.LET’S STOP THIS FANTASY NARRATIVE ACCORDING TO WHICH THE USA IS A GREAT COUNTRY….
"Well, 
somebody in the court needs to be investigated- that part is true."
"""If the Supreme Court Can Reverse Roe, It Can Reverse Anything. No one should get used to their rights.""
 _ Mary Ziegler - The Atlantic

Democrats need to expand the size of the Supreme Court From 9 To 13 to break it's 6-3 conservative majority hold .. ASAP"
I really hope that you guys discuss that the reasoning was that the SCIENCE had changed since the first decision. Come on! Be journalists!!
Save you time nothing new useless
No surprise Thomas is full steam ahead.. All those financial favours!!! Sounds like Mafia bribing tactics from the 60s!!! Impeach him!!!!
"If courts have right to abortion decision, then we should have rights on how much the neighbor eats or drinks or wears.. its the same logic."
"People in their ""Right"" minds, are Lefties. 
NEVER VOTE REPUBLICAN AGAIN.💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙ALL THE WAY!"
Smoke screens
The Supreme Court is staffed by politicians masquerading as judges. It’s shameful. It’s wrong. It needs to be changed. Increase the number of judges to 12 (like a jury in the past) and give the chief justice a casting vote!
Supreme Court nor politics have no place making a decision over a women’s body..  This is a decision between a woman and her doctor.  The majority of people making such decision is(old men) senior citizens:-(
"My theory is that it was one of the conservative justices who leaked it, to damp the outrage when the decision was to officially announced."
"8:50 So WITHOUT the leak, the decision would have been favorable to women having rights to their body..
I guess, we know who messed it up ."
"Call it what it is court of bribery, the justices that are in there now was more a test on how much money is a chosen verdict cost. (Edit) Also not the first time Kavanaugh lied about doing something at a minimal morally wrong if not illegal in court."
The Supreme  Court  is a  good  example  of our entire  country  being corrupt. Its about  politics  and power.  Not law and justice.
"I think the biggest thing that we should not forget about these justices is that they LIED.    Each, under oath, were specifically asked about Roe vs. Wade.  They ALL said that it was considered settled law.  They said that knowing full well that they were lying. They were intending to up end settled law.  This turned the Supreme Court from a judicial body into a political one.  Yet no one wants to address the fact that basically they had committed pergery to get their jobs.  And now we know they were given their jobs to do exactly that.  They were chosen by the Federalist Society because they were known to be willing to lie in order to achieve the highest-ranking court in
 the land with the help of the Federalist Society.
In my opinion, this single act has discredited the whole institution.  Once you lie, you can not ever be trusted.
Amy Barrett is the worst of them because she professes Christianity.  The 10 commandments clearly state, ""Thou shalt not commit false witness.""  So she isn't even a true Christian.  She has lied before her God."
😂
"Absolutely crazy for the NYT writer to ask the audience, “what is the meaning of [Barrett] switching her vote” with no answer. Isn’t that your job as the reporter to find and deliver that answer?!"
All trump nominations should be recalled
"OMG, reporters interviewing reporters. This is a story about a story. Seriously, is this all we have left? There's no real news anymore?"
"The second the Dobbs decision came out I lost all regard for the Supreme Court. Now when they come out with a ""ruling"" it means absolutely nothing to me. June 24, 2022 was the day the Supreme Court invalidated itself forever in my eyes. If they can so easily see me as less than human then they think they can take whatever they want from me and quite frankly that's not a country I want to live in"
The country is past the leak.  This is Another distraction by the SC.
We can’t have abortions in America. Who else will go to war and work crap jobs?
"I wouldn't wish my life on anyone. That is why I am pro choice. If you're not responsible enough for kids, you shouldn't have them.
Republicans have no plan to take care of anyone but themselves let alone all those children they want to force to life to serve them, not God."
Jodi Kantor has a brilliant mind!  OMG!
Term limits on the Supreme Court.
We all know  who  did it  Supreme Court Justice  Thomas's
"I still can't forgive Ginsberg for not getting off the stage when she should have. I also can't forgive Sandra Day O'Conner for leaving when she did...and she deeply regretted it as soon as she saw who her successor was (Alito). 

Regardless of the Republican malfeasance in how they have refused to honor any ethics or precedents while stacking the court, the liberal wing has had a coupe of epic ""own goals"" that have added 2 hard right wing justices that absolutely didn't need to be there."
A breach of trust was reversal of a Law because of religious Indoctrination
"Not only in America... but, in America. Poor free world."
The conservativ Supreme Court scotuses have deceived the American citizens.
We need to pack the court with ethical judges!
Supreme Court is corrupt!
Leaders around the world are asking their citizens to raise their birth rates ...our government is forcing us to raise ours. Why?
"Corrupt SCOTUS
Doesn't know the constitution says freedom OF
Religion.
No laws based on one's religious opinions are constitutional.
When will the media say those words?"
Republican Supreme Court Judges: Corrupt liars all.
I hope they Barrett least regrets her vote now. I hope she gets down on her knees and prays fervently to her God to forgive her and I hope he doesn’t.
So nothing to do with we the people? Just a handful of old folks worried about what their co workers think...smh
"This is the beginning of the end of SCOTUS.  They have declared their corruption and made their rulings illegitimate.  They have made themselves nothing by the abuse of their power.

Even a powerful group can delegitimize their power and authority by abusing it.  Flagrant abuse of power and obvious corruption has a corrosive effect on the roots of the body politic.  SCOTUS may continue to exist in some form, but they have destroyed the basis of their authority.  Which is not the Constitution,  but the citizens' belief in the *idea* of the fairness and impartiality of SCOTUS.  The Constitution is an important document - but all governments exist due to the consent of the people.  Once belief is destroyed (and it is) the inevitable corrosion of the power begins."
"The entire American system of judges being political is moronic.  The British system has non-political system for judges which is a million times better.

People in the US can't get a fare trial because the political position of the judge decides whether someone will be found guilty and not whether someone has broken the law.

What laws are should be decided by people who are elected not unelected like these judges, this is undemogratic."
All this behind the scene politicking between just the justices show how little they consider or care about the purpose of their job. Like them being so concerned about public perception of themselves and when or how long they should take before taking any specific case and all this... it doesnt serve their appointed position or the country.
The current Supreme Court is illegitimate.
"I just want to thank the SCOTUS because if it weren’t for this, European countries, especially France, would not have thought of enshrining abortion rights in the constitution :)"
"Homeboy wearing the leather jacket, has got a 5 o’clock shadow. Then it spoke… IT, is a pronoun, look it up…so now I must be respectful, I’m sorry it. 😢"
"Todays SCOTUS: changing how America views the Court.....as supremely corrupt, arrogant, narcissistic, and devoid of meaningful & consistent values!"
Well well well...
"There is congressional testimony. Sam Alito, the fascist witch hunter general was the leak. What did Mark Meadows burn? What did Donald J Trump sell to whom?"
From president down....why do we allow people over retirement age to be in positions of power?
The last two justices will be held accountable long after the others are no longer defining law.
CORRUPT
"This is truly disgusting. Thomas, ACB, Kavanaugh, Ailito, and Roberts should be removed alone because of lying at their Confirmation hearings and by taking bribes!!! SCOTUS Justices are NOT above the Law."
"SCOTUS = CORRUPTION, a bunch of people who wears black robes deciding the fate and rights of any woman. Her body, her life, her choice!"
Supreme Court won't vote for anything unless there's free trips and gifts or cash for them lol 😂 hahaha
Uncle Thomas.
"Put them on term limits and they'll know they can either be political hack with their short term rulings or true to be law, if not which would be changed once their term ends and remembered in history as either political hacks or true justice of law ✌️"
"“The highest court in the land should not have the lowest ethical standards” - Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, RI 🇺🇸"
"We ""aren't a bunch of partisan hacks"" - Amy Coney-Barrett, during a speech at the University of Louisville's McConnell Center, while standing next to the honoree, Mitch McConnell."
Drop the trans commenters.  Really hard to watch.  Edit:  RBG did this.  Zero respect for her selfishness.
"The supreme court has no ethics to follow, so an investigation into ethics of the leak seems hypocritical to say the least!"
I don't understand Christians being against abortion when the bible supports abortion
No one will ever convince me that conservatives are actual people with thoughts and feelings of their own.
"Every Republican appointed Justice should be in prison for perjury because they all said Roe was law and they would not overturn it. 
Lying under oath is supposed to be a crime in America. Although this court and trump have proven lying to get power is the Republican Way"
"I say that ""A CROOKED JUSTICE IS A TRAITOR !!!"" and should be treated accordingly."
Yo why does that guest look like a dude but dressed like a woman?
Disgusting beyond articulation
The court shouldn’t back pedal on people’s rights
Window of persuasion? There doesn’t appear to be any change of opinion to take away an existing right. The NYT still playing “both side-ism”.
"The corruption in the supreme court is mind boggling
They have to drag the justice's out of the court and fire them and disbar them"
ARE THEY THE SUPREME COURT JUDGES OR PERHAPS ENEMIES OF MILLIONS OF DECENT HARD WORKING AMERICANS!
I want a public accounting of how many abortions were purchased by every member of congress and Donald Trump.  Hypocrites.
Weak reporting.  They know full-well who leaked the decision - it was to make sure none of the conservative judges switched their votes - because they'd get death threats from their rabid supporters if they did.
Why is she trying to sugar coat ACB? Stop trying to launder that ideologue.
ruth's body wasn't even cold
It’s up to the States to decide Abortion. Abortion is not a Constitutional right.  So abortion it legal/illegal depending what State you live in.   What’s the issue
"Ya ya ya.... Blah blah blah.... Everything is a bombshell or breaking News with all these criminals, and yet nothing happens to them! So why bother? 🙄"
The US Suoreme Court is the most fraudulent group of Reublican Stormtroopers . God please add new Justices to take the number of justices to 11. They lack any intellectual integrity or honesty . DISGUSTING.
"Vote Trump  , Democrats are a joke"
So this is just proof of hypocrisy from the scotus? By the entire right calling kb a political appointee they were just projecting what this court would become: a political vehicle for unpopular legislation to pass. The amount of hypocrisy from Alito saying how Democratic controlled states would not abide by his ruling while he allows GOP control states to put up the middle finger to scotus decisions. In the history books this Court is going to be seen as both anti-american and anti-democratic
"The breach of trust was when these robed lying pigs said R vs W was settled case law but then overturned it. It’s not the supreme court, it’s the lying cheating hypocritical court."
Amy Coney-Barret was only concerned with her own legacy. She is not less reprehensible than originally thought. She was driven by self interest.
"As a woman with two daughters in their 20s, I am very relieved that we do not live in America! I feel desperately sorry for women who live in the GOP states, these Taliban-like, medieval states that dictate what women do with their bodies! It's 2023 for goodness sake!!!"
And who should we thank for the this mess? Trump !! He put three judges on the court who made this nightmare happend
"Oh surprise, the court that was stolen by the Republicans under Mitch by abusing the system of appointing justices then decided to impose their personal religious views on the American people while being corrupted at its core by billionaire influencers with similar religious views, and the way they did that was even more corrupt and sinister."
Cavanaugh has resting punch me face.
Breach of Trust is the court of liars..
Term.     Limits.
😮why no one just say 4 of these so call justices lied to congress and they lied to the people
And then people are blamed for being swept away by conspiracy theories. This doesn’t bode well because it injured women across the country and this very much damaged the court.
"Chris used the word 'jurisprudence' in the same sentence as 'Supreme Court', lol."
"After the GOP STOLE a SCOTUS seat and five of the Justices voted to overturn law they ALL acknowledged was ""settled law"" in their confirmation hearings, I can only see SCOTUS as a Kangaroo Court at this point...  and THEN you've got Thomas's and Alito's indiscretions and clear conflicts of interest as well...  how can anyone respect this body at this point?"
"I already read the NYT article. Where is the “bombshelll about the leak? There, in the NYT report, it even says that no one knows who leaked the report. Still."
"They, SCOTUS justices,  are 100%corrupt,  because they know they are above the law and they have jobs for life . I'm starting to feel that dictators, such as Pukin, for example, are more trustworthy than American government officials . Why, you may ponder,  because they are honest about their intentions to stay in power and keep control over their ppl, no matter what they have to do . I'm not saying they are good or admirable by any stretch of the imagination but, at least the citizens know what's going on in the minds of their leaders  . American government, on the other hand,  is full of lying,  cheating, corrupt ppl who smile in our faces and stab us in our backs, all while denying everything"
When was the last time a conservative spoke without lying? Not in my lifetime and I'm 62.
Why can't those justices be impeached for lying under oath..
"Is this journalist really trying to tell me that ACB had a slight moment of self awareness even though that theocratic nightmare overturned Roe anyway?  That's super gross and disingenuous. What do y'all mean what is happening? They were appointed, NG's seat was full on stolen, precisely exactly to overturn Roe. And duhhhh it was leaked by Alito's dinner buddies to cement the vote, duh. It didn't do the Dems any better to leak it just 6 weeks earlier either way it was before the midterm."
The supreme Court has been bought and those justices that accepted bribes should be in prison!
"It has been so long since I heard anything on this srory. And of course now it is being drowned out by the horror stories coming out ss the result of the overturning of Roe vs Wade..But I am glad that people are still looking into this. There is clear evidence here that the ethics of the Supreme Court has be irreparably compromised. The more we hear about this, the deeper the rabbit hole goes. 

The irony is, if Roberts had managed to push Roe vs Wade to 15 weeks we wouldn't be in this mess. The right would still be trying to push back the date, but we'd all be naiive and complacent snd letting them continue to do it. Instead, ee've got Lindsey Grahan saying ""Well, what about 15 weeks?"" And we're all like, ""Oh, no, we were willing to go for that, but that wasn't good enough for you! You had to have a total ban or nothing!""

Honestly I don't know why the Supreme Court hasn't turned on itself yet. I don't know how they can pretend to trust each other."
Didn't this actually happen over a year ago?
"Hey! From what you are saying, it's almost as if the SCOTUS judges are not quite honest .... !"
Amer*ca: where they celebrate your t*ts (Hooters) but they regulate your cl*ts (SCOTUSSS 🐍)
This is a kangaroo court anyway. They all believe in the great white replacement theory.
Thank Mitch McConnell
NY TIMES.....Gets it right every time. Thank you.
Ginsburg should have stepped down long before she did. Anyone with any sense knows she was not ruling in her last years definitely not the day she died but she was a democrat pawn and they used her vote however they chose. Trump picked out of a list provided to him so a group of people put a list of people they wanted and Trump picked his choice of their list. Ginsburg's selfeshness to stay relevent hurt the democrats no one else the process and life moves on. I find it ironic a woman is picked to be a supreme court mainly because she was black and a woman  becomes a justice and then for the first time in history of the country we have a leak.
This is what happens when you don't have term limits and you don't have Justice in the supreme Court they're bigger crooks than people on the streets but yet they're allowed to stay there Thomas should have been gone a long time along with many others who have been proven to be just as guilty as him😢
This is collusion. Political collusion. These justices should be tried.
"Oh the divisive left, strange bedfellows, like Joe and Kamala, Bill and Hillary, or Dylan and bud light."
"I don't buy the argument that the new radical, right-wing justices seriously considered going back on their oath to the Federalist Society cabal to overturn Roe.  It has been building to this for a very long time. As the right-wing, theocratic, anti-constitutionalists that they are, albeit that they claim to be strict constructionists observing ""plain meaning, it was always clear that they could hardly wait for Ginsberg to die.  Why else did they lie openly and operate corruptly during the selection process to get anti-Roe, fundamentalist Catholics on the court?"
"Double win for the right wing extremists. The supreme court has lost all legitimacy as a fair arbiter, which further damages democracy, as well as making arbitrary undemocratic decisions."
"How can you have them for life? This is why corruption grows in Supreme Court, look at Clemens 🤨"
"Our not-so-supreme court, full of corruption and injustice."
If Trump wins in 2024 there could very well be pressure for Thomas to resign do he can be replaced with another young conservative judge.
"Everybody has the right to LIFE,liberty and happiness.except an innocent,unborn child."
5 rotten liars.
RBG had just passed a health screening btw
leo.....all over this he is.
"Any Judge who uses their personal beliefs and/or their political affiliation to make a judgment is not being impartial and should not be serving as a Judge.  We have too many on the Court now that are doing just that, and some are in the pockets of some wealthy people, is that being ethical or having any integrity?  I think it is time for some real changes in how they are selected and voted in, and having some strict oversight over all their actions. in fact, the way things are now, we need this for all our Public Servants and not have any Political party involved.  Yes, the Supreme Court Justices are Public Servants."
SCOTUS is illegitimate.
"I guess Coney Barrett and Kavanaugh were reluctant to take the case up immediately since they had just recently testified that Roe was established law during confirmation hearings just a few months earlier. I guess they figured the public memory is very short, but in this case the public still remembered they were lying during their confirmation. 

Just another in a long line of politicizing the Supreme Court under John Roberts, who stalled on partisan gerrymandering until wavering justice Kennedy retired and Gorsuch took the seat Merrick Garland should have had. And they wonder why respect for the Supreme Court has plummeted under Roberts. He's the head of the judicial branch of the evangelical and corporate controlled Republican Party, not a non-biased judiciary that respects the constitution and decades old precedents confirmed over the years in judicial decisions. And of course second guessing what the men who wrote the constitution intended. Which miraculously always ends up being what they want it to be. As if James Madison could envision civilian weapons capable of killing 20 people in one minute, or that massive corporations would control taxes and limit the right of workers to exert power through assembling in unions. Originalism is one of the biggest cons the court has foisted on the public since the early 1900s."
No ore lies like the new York try imes
It sounds like they got even.
If you have already taken a side on a case before it's happened you Don't deserve any official seat nor are you qualified to fill it.
I think the Supreme Court judges should either ride a horse or pedal a bike 35 miles to work each day. Let's see how many of them want to stay after that.
Wimpy 🤓newsguy Newstime
"They violated the rights of every woman and girl in the Country.
They violated their paths, several lied under oath"
"This is corrupt kangaroo court, DEMS should get fill the courts with more judges to protect this country"
"Oh, yeah. That leak to Rupert Murdoch."
Such a bunch of  weirdos on the Supreme Court. Get rid of the compromised weirdos
The abortion debate is not about right and wrong. It is about cannon fodder and defense industry labor. In 1973 we were done with war. Now war is in the offing...
All I can say is I told you so...they just want to sort how to take rights away and this was just the beginning...and yes they were waiting for her to die change laws and they were not going to be transparent with people in this country...and they never will be...I guess I am amazed that you were shocked...this is a test run... They will look at other rights...
The justices aren’t so  just.
Bring back Medhi
"So all 3 Trump appointed Justices are LIARS. 
All 3 LIED during their confirmation hearings."
WHY TF DIDN'T SHE RETIRE WHEN SHE SHOULD HAVE. RBG's arrogance undid her good entirely and aided their evil. shame.
The current Supreme Court is one big breach of trust!
Supreme court must to stop Biden to help Isreal’s war.
You know what was a breach of trust? OVERTURNING ROE V WADE!!
The supreme pos court.
It's ok if Trump becomes president there will be no Supreme Court because dictatorship don't need them
"I wonder how many women have died through illegal""back street""abortions since Roe v Wade was rescinded?"
The fact that a republican appointed judge to a Supreme Court already has an agenda on an issue like this is bulshit
The current court is illegitimate. We all know it.
"It's been pretty obvious to me from the beginning that Alito or one of his staff leaked the draft to have exactly the effect that it caused, ending any chance to change any votes."
If you are going to allow abortion up to 15;16;20 weeks there shouldn’t be any restrictions at all.  Women past those dates needing abortion are for medical reasons.  But men would never understand that
Although they cannot expose who leaked … personally I suspect Justice Thomas or someone on his staff was the leak.  But it was just a suspicion and we do not convict someone on suspicions.
"Al Franken said he believes it was Samuel Alito who leaked it to seal the votes ahead of the final voting, just as suggested here. And since they never found the one who leaked it, this makes perfect sense."
"""breach of trust""??? more like an eye opener to the inner corruption and political orientation of the highest court-- and it s melding with $$$$ interests -- forget precedent???? what rabbit hole is this Country sinking into? rights won... rights taken...."
The only people who support the killing of the unborn are Godless people.
"""Government has no say over the body of a pregnant woman, but does have unlimited power over the body of everyone else"".  - Democrats"
Why don't we ever talk about the fact that Trump acknowledged in a media interview in the 80's that he'd paid for 3 abortions of girlfriends?
"""A breach of trust"" from a radical, activist hack who's protecting corrupt SOB Repugnican operatives in the SCOTUS?!?
Reich Wingers are _SO_ lucky hypocrisy isn't lethal."
Conservatives will not be happy until they ruin our nation.
"When you fear integrity and accountability, you are NOT the good guys!"
"The religious right are trying to impose their religious beliefs on to the people of America, separation of church and state."
"Without hate or fear in your heart, the Republican party can't control you."
"The Supreme Court is disgusting and a joke!  I've given up on our country! 😢 It's hard for me to feel proud of my country anymore. Why does any count have a right to tell me what to do with my body. My neighbor or friend is pro-life and that's great, but why should they decide for me their belief. Maybe I don't believe in their church of choice, but should I be forced to go to their church because that's their belief."
There is no honor or objectivity in the Supreme Court.  It's just another group of politicians.
"In  Canada, Justices have a 25 year term limit, and must retire at 75. Just sayin....."
"""It's no longer about justice and reason; it's about power"". This is our theocratic present with the GOP dark money SCOTUS."
I honestly believe the GOP was PAID to tear their own country apart.

These liars are imperial legislators masquerading as impartial judges."
"Roberts is a disgrace as chief justice.  And, he's too old to grow a pair."
"So am i understanding that during the pre-leak time that it was actually possible one of the conservatives may have been considering upholding the Roe v Wade decision if it was a private vote/decision but the leak forced them to do what they were being pushed to do by upending it? Which seriously makes me question if it comes from one of the conservative judge group. I got that with how the woman was talking through the video. Or I'm wrong and its still likely one of the Progressive side that did it in hopes it'd shame them in order to keep precedence. I just don't see any true ""conservative beliefs"" in how that Court handles it. Them and the Republican party are trying to force a political view/stance/opinion that is gradually going away but use tactics and behavior that doesn't feel conservative or morally right that real conservatives speak of. Lots of that side are fakes who don't really believe in conservation or whatever they say: recent example would be the Moms for Liberty group founder revealed to have done non-conservative bedroom activities. They're all hypocrites and liars."
"For some reason, I can just imagine the Justices looking in the mirror, in the morning, saying “I AM THE LAW” like Judge Dread."
"i mostly hate feminists but on this one even i can't disagree this is just pure misogyny... absolutly disgusting, these people are not christians"
"Why exactly, is this news a ""Bombshell?"""
Ginsburg said years ago she truely believed that Roe VS Wade was in orrectly adjudicated and she believed it would eventially be overturned.
THEY ARE DOING THE SAME W VOTING RIGHTS
I wish I had access to the article because I didn't follow this.🤔
Cavanaugh  is a right wing zellot!
SCOTUS is bought and paid for.  America is over.
To me I think it's obvious that Ginni Thomas is the leaker
They have destroyed an entire branch of government
"👉 Obviously ""THEY"" knew all along exactly what they intended to do. Each and everyone totally lied during their confirmation. Nice to know that the Right Wing justices on our highest court in the land are just simply LIARS !!! 😡"
This Supreme Court is illegitimate. Expanding the court is the only option.
This is what it looks like!  MEN WANT TO TAKE AWAY WOMEN'S RIGHTS!
Pffffsssssssss…..
"Just wait until the bought and paid for supreme court gives the Koch family all they ever wanted, to destroy the US government. Once the corrupt justices rule that the US government can no longer regulate anything, the country will grind to a halt."
1 year delay doesn't seem like an evolution of the law... it still very much feels political.
Turning women into secons class citizens is FAR more evil and enraging and horrible than who leaked the draft.
"RBG was selfish. Obama was in the WH and should have had an appointee. Ginzberg had had many close calls and was obviously  working on fumes concerning her health. Yet she clung to power, leaving us with Barrett.  
It's difficult to get over her hubris; her belief that only she could do it; extending her time in the sun. I was angry."
"Impeach all Republicans 
Trump For Prison 2024"
Leak=timed release to the press to keep people distracted
"SCOTUS -Guaranteed a lifelong  job with power since 1789...once a human gets power U find out what their all about. Everybody has a personal agenda ...I just can't believe that it took 234 years for the dirty laundry  to be revealed...The Law of the Land....I hope the corrupt judges that have already been identified, get  removed from the bench....there are terms for political offices  and so should there be terms of 2, 4 or 6 yrs at the most.  As a youth I constantly haunted my parents about the SCOTUS setup, and how could this be a part of a democratic society and I think I got my answer - not what we have been led to believe is ALL GOOD⁉ Please fight to save our freedom V🧢TE 🗽"
"So, they agreed with RBG that Roe v Wade was bad law, and should be decided by states."
Abortion is murder point blank.
The amount of comments supporting murdering innocent life is crazy evil .
Thanks so much for doing this piece Chris!
"Four of the conservative justices on SCOTUS are proven liars.
This court is  USA's supreme arbiter of law.
Such is the ethical standard of  USA."
"“Roe Roe Roe your votes gently down a stream
merrily merrily merrily merrily—abortion rights were but a dream”"
She also wrote decisions prior to her appointment that clearly show she supported anti abortion.
This goes to show how desperate the labour party is
"I thought this click-bait was about the SCOTUS ""leak"".   Nothing in this really focuses on the ""Leak""."
"Imagine if American women were legally allowed to forego motherhood through abortion and adoption, without being legally responsible; yet American men are unable to legally forgo fatherhood without permission from women and are forced to be legally responsible. Double standards and female privilege are fun kids. Hands off women's bodies, Hands off men's bodies"
too much power for too long with no controls LEADS TO CORRUPTION
"The labour party is looking for votes trying to rile up the women's  vote the labour party is lame and disgusting, msnbc you are disgusting"
This is sickening now that we are now hearing this… how disgusting….
"SCOTUS 
- ACTING LIKE they’re GODS!!
The SCOTUS is officially a PARTISAN SECTARIAN POLITICAL INSTITUTION that is strongly —— almost totally bought and paid for by far far right CORPORATE RELIGIOUS DONORS!!! 

Reverse ALL TRUMP NOMINEES because 1) Trump has been impeached and stands charged with extremely serious crimes including fomenting an insurrection against the USA 🇺🇸 CAPITOL & newly elected Biden government. 

Both Brett Kavanagh and Amy Barrett LIED UNDER OATH …. Which surely is impeachable and warrants being sacked!!"
انزال وتصميم واخفاء وتوجه الى  وقسم خادع معمي لذيذ وهو كذب ليس لذيذ  محجوز مكفوف يتأمل كيف النهايه حولت الوجه يسارا
MSNBC has no credibility. 😅
"The Supreme Fraud. These court traitors are bought off by the Koch Brothers and other billionaire neo conservatives. Shame on them; they need to be impeached, convicted, and ousted!"
and people wonder why conspiracy theories are so prevalent...
Should have been investigated “yesterday”. Is Roberts trying to save face…just think… they may be hearing Trump’s immunity claim??? This is very scary. The decision was political period….
Inappropriate?  Sounds like a job for Thomas!
So much for basing any decisions on the law.
Typical NYT apologist.
"Enough BSNBC, who freaking leaked the report???, why is this so hard...
Who leaked the report, who leaked the report, who leaked the report, who leaked the report, who leaked the report,????"
Like we are gonna take MSNBC seriously
The Supreme Court is corrupt . How can we trust judges who can’t be held accountable or punished in any way? Thomas along should be removed for working with Billionaires.
SCOTUS best supreme court money can buy.
"Those very white people will nit lije bsbies being left on thier door steps . Let one of thoer daughters get pregnant . D AND C , NICE AND LEGAL ."
IMO…It was intentionally leaked before the actual decision was announced to quell the potential backlash and unrest that would have occurred if was announced on a Special Report on TV…
"The Supreme Court, and therefore the entire justice system, is tainted and untrustworthy. It is shocking how low the United States has fallen. Facts are arguments don't matter. The Supreme Justices have already made up their minds. They only want to get appointed in order to impose their will and turn women into forced-birth wombs for the State."
"Roberts is a  hayseed travesty of a justice,"
"This sounds like a big nothing.  An appeal was made by a state, and the justices considered how to proceed.  They tried to persuade one another.  Something that happens in most cases.  As far as delaying the case, and not telling this to the public, this is up to them to decide.  SCOTUS will take up a case, and decide it when they decide it. Nothing super unusual going on here."
Defund the Supreme Court. They no longer represent justice
JOE BIDENS HOLE FAMILY MUST STAND TRIAL
Look at all the baby killers thristy for fetal blood in the comments. Sick. Satanic
"If it was a Liberal Justice, it would of 100% been reported to the press... that's how you know who leaked it."
"The people who invoke the bible (or ""buy bull"" as I call it) in this debate cherry pick to extremes.   And?   It is usually MEN who decide about women's rights.   Yeah.   Not good."
How old is this bombshell?
The leak is a breach of trust but lying through your teeth about your intentions before the committee deciding if you should be appointed isn’t a total breach of trust to the entire country.
"We have the votes. Now we just need to fill in ""the law."""
This is a “what about is is I’m” and no one give a flying Fuxk about it!!!  It should been at the state level always!!!  Full Stop!!!
.the Supreme Court process in USA has zero to do with justice
"A nation divided amongst itself cannot stand.This knowledge has been known since before Biblical times

This is why The President is THE man to encourage and foster  a united citizenry, not to cause great chasms of hatred and separatism mixed in with bigotry ,racism,fascism and fantasies of being The Supreme Leader         for life

We got what The Electors wanted
AGAIN
What could go wrong? Has any discussion ever come up as to WHY those electors gave their votes to  Bad Orange? Impossible to believe they might just do it again......
Indictments,felonies, cases on trial- it seems none of this can stop a nihilistic scenario sure to take place
if current polls become reality"
Who else thought they clicked on the wrong video? 😂
How the politicians treated RBG after her death was nothing short of criminal.
It was a pre-determined verdict in search of a case.
"Ok, the Stock market is now the highest ever, and did not plummet like Trump projected, and Biden created 14 million jobs, more then the last 4 Republican presidents together, and oil production is far far higher then under Trump. Still we need to support Trump as Trump is the only one who will join the Russian alliance of Russia, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea and Nicaragua. We need to become close to these countries and stop our Western alliances! Also, only Trump will support the top 1% incomes of the USA! Also women rights went out of hand!!"
"I feel these Justices decided on their own religious beliefs and not on our constitutional rights.  I feel in doing so they gave permission to states to become dictorial over women and caused pain and suffering to women who are being forced to carry unviable fetus' and in some cases forced to surrender their own lives.  They are threatening doctors to lose their licenses if they make decisions that are best for their patients.    Brett Kavanaugh and Amy C. Barrett have proven themselves untrustworthy because they said before our country they would not overturn laws that have already been established, such as abortion.  Then President Trump revealed he would use the Supreme Court to pass laws according to his voters religious beliefs instead of our Constitutional freedoms.   All three of these persons have proven to be untrustworthy as well as unconstitutional.  This leak is important, I feel the motive is to show how Amy C. Barrett wanted to deceive the people by rejecting the case but knowing full well she would vote based on her own religious beliefs and not our constitutional rights.  This leak proves how untrustworthy this conservative SCOTUS is. And even more important to point it out  due to the upcoming vote on whether a president is immune from criminal prosecution."
"The Supreme Politicians of the United States presented the reversal of Roe vs Wade was an opinion based on reasoning that the court should not make the laws but only interpret them. Laws are the responsibility of the congress or the state. This reasoning is a complete hypocrisy while qualified immunity is still being applied, it was created by the supreme court and is used in states where no ""laws"" exist for or against. If the court reverses Roe, it should also remove any use of qualified immunity where no state or federal laws are applied after all the court doesn't make laws.
-MG"
The supreme court is not relevant anymore. They can't be trusted and should be disbarred.
IT WAS ALITO.
Amy Barrett and Clarence Thomas are disgusting pieces of filth.  Cavanaugh also.
"Wow,,"
"A key factor in Trump getting the 2016 GOP nomination was he agreed to stack SCOTUS.  This was pivotal in him gaining the nomination.

This leak is motivated by many of the lawyers working in the court who respect the law above politics and are disgusted at the stacking of the court they see justice as being one eyed. They have had enough.  Alito is not a Judge he is an agent."
What is hard to understand it's back to each individual state?? I don't really understand what everyone is so upset about? If you want an abortion go to the state where it's legal? You don't have to broadcast to the world what you're doing. I'm sure the abortionist won't tell. Most people want to vote on it... we are a republic... voting counts.
"There was no true window of ""persuasion!"" The SC is corrupt and the hubris is outrageous."
"“We can’t say for certain who leaked it… But we know the deliberative process was at play… and then the leak comes along, and those efforts are hopeless.” 

So… Alito."
AHH YES!! Justice Barrett the hero for not wanting to take it earlier upon giving the Optics that she might be considered to blame for the law of Roe versus Wade being rescinded. So is this what MSNBC is now ? You guys now celebrate the mediocracy of politics?
Barrett only voted no because of political reason's at 1st. The next term she would have been fine with it. Her no vote was just to make it look good. She's no hero here.
Where does the Judicial oversite committee stand where there is evidence of compromised Justices being bought and sold which subjects the SCOTUS to Rule on matters based on personal emotion while withholding logic.
Unelected Kings and Queens with Supreme power for life.  Does that should like democracy to you?
Maybe presidents who didn't win the popular vote shouldn't pick judges?! Or remove the entire process from  partisanship! ?
This is a gross anomaly.  It will be overturned.  The only question is how long it will take.
Talibangelicals. Women are livestock in these people’s eyes.
"You know who leaked it , the same one that leaked last time . Starts with an ""A"""
SCOTUS is a corrupt institution. A great country cannot remain great when the justice system is corrupt.
It's not about strategy it's about THE LAW (something SCOTUS has completely forgotten about)
"""We just don't know"". Here's some more worthless discussion on the fact that ""We just don't know""."
Strange this woman claims she is able to read justices minds.  Get that woman a crystal ball.
Hmm… Did the leak come from the Alito camp?
Still baby murder
The person who leaked this information is at least lacking integrity but more likely absolutely a criminal and got paid BIG bucks from Biden admin and Democrats.  Clear this absolutely benefited Biden’s corrupt Administration
Sure is interesting of him how all of the right-wing bot farms are targeting progressive channels and comment sections and YouTube does nothing about it.
Murder has never been a  right.
"Woman is not too smug,huh? Knows it all... another one 😮"
Any and every courts authority hinges on perception of its neutrality.
"This shows that the Supreme Court is now nothing but extremist Conservative politics and NOT actual law and order. This nation no longer has a system of law and order and once again its thanks to right wing Republicans conservatism as it's all about power grabbing and destroying democracy, burning the constitution and setting up a Russia style autocracy government under only right wing politics."
More propaganda. Big liars.
Political judges have lost all credibility. The day is coming when they will be ignored and even pushed aside.
All the SCOTUS did was took Roe v Wade out of Federal hands and handed it down to State by State laws.
I got a question. if we are over taxed under represented and can't choose our laws. what is the point of that system? we have reached a new low if justices are 'pocket judges'..
Only Trump's Supreme Court can fix this.
Blatantly political RIGHT WING justices who were hellbent on an outcome instead of following jurisprudence...and we've learned that John Roberts is not up to the heft and import of his job.
"The Supreme Court has become as twisted and corrupt as the current GOP, and taking away our faith in justice. The lunacy of the Republican Congress, the MAGA cult, is all based on lies. Trump has the record for more lies than any politician in Americas history. To see our country go down this path is disgraceful, and aggravating. Lock Trump up and shut him up."
If some leftist clerk thought the leak would save Roe....    And the leak cemented the positions....then that Asshat shot themselves in the foot.  The pro-life side should thank them if they are ever caught.
"With the Court’sRoe decision, the Court lost even the pretense of being impartial.  The Court. Has become an extension of the Republican Party."
"OMG!  What a painful segment.  Why did this steal 10 minutes from my life?  Can I have my 10 minutes of life back?  What is the point of all of this?  Who cares about the normal back and forth of decision making of the 9 most powerful people in America?  They are judges, they talk among themselves, they have to discuss their opinions and the language that goes into it.  WHAT IS THE POINT!!! What is the purpose of this?"
"*SCOTUS = Sick Crooks & Onanists, Theocrats & Undeserving Simpletons*"
Msnbc is a domestic enemy collusion to highest treason.
This is thanks to Mitch and Ruth for robbing Obama of two more picks.
"What's the bombshell, Pat the It?"
Just plain corrupt. PERIOD!
The deck was stacked when wealth began to be concentrated. SCOTUS has been focusing on their grand theories & forgetting the lives of 90% of Americans.  The ones without money to pay for lawyers & donate to politicos.
Can't Supreme court Justices be Impeached?.🤔
Overturning Roe led to the open corruption today with Thomas and Alito.  Using deceit like this paved the way by introducing political considerations.
"Blacks get the most abortions, win win"
"Abortion isn't a guaranteed right under the Constitution, and Roe was poorly decided; challenged by fetal recognition as human by lower courts; especially in homicide prosecution. Increasing fetal viability during gestation further weakened Roe. Abortion assigned to the People to decide under the Tenth Amendment with legislators answerable to constituents is best."
We have fell into the mindset that killing our babies is a personal right. This is an immoral way of thinking and it has been politicized where people don't even realize how it has marginalized to an extent to where they are playing god and that each fetus is a fleshand blood human and the act is murder. Stand in a mirror and tell yourself that you were once a fetus
"Everyone forgets that there are 9 supreme court justices, 5 were nominated by republican presidents and 4 were nominated by democrat presidents.
The ruling was 6 to 3 with judge roberts voting against overturning roe v wade that made the vote 4 republican justices for and 1 against.
Where did the other 2 votes come from?
roe v wade was overturned because 2 democrat appointed justices voted yes.
Everyone is blaming the wrong the wrong group, it was overturned because the democrat justices voted yes to overturn it.
Wake up the democrats don't care about women's rights they only care about controlling power.
Think of how much money the democratic party has made pushing this issue."
"Impeach the whole Supreme Court and replace the with term limits and congress interview of appointees with a special election to be approved by the public, we vote for the Supreme Court along with the president every 4 years, they can’t get any more corrupt"
"I love at 6:50 how Jodi Kantor says, ""Yeah, I see what you're saying but here's another perspective."""
"Great the right has  cheated to get in the court. They have been taking bribes while on the court.
Now we hear that they don't care about law because they are more equal than  the 215.000,000,000 people in the country who think abortion should be available."
So it probably Alito who leaked it.
"Why can't she tell us who leaked it?  Does she know who did?  What happened to the Republicans ""investigating relating to the leak?"""
MSNBC saves my political sanity. Confirmation bias? Sometimes. Sometimes not. But my tribe 😇
"They're already corrupt, might as well get paid for it."
Remember Trump fault. He put them in there. He took our rights. He is proud of it. Thank God I live in New Jersey.
We can only hope that their actions have caused irreparable damage to the Uterus Annexation Party.
"TOOLS AND FOOLS. Total bs. 

The Supreme Court was great when democrats held a majority. How interesting and hypocritical."
Don't complaint. Bring your rearend to voting booth.

It was Ginnie.
There are so many useful (leftist) idiots out there. In the U.S. I mean. Sad reality
I still on the fence with the newest Judge and the leak Judge Jackson. Especially her being so liberal in her confirmation hearing. Still on the fence but I sway with Jackson saying or talking about it with someone she knew would leak it out.

"Dirty deeds and bad faith are just business as usual for the phonies on the ""religious"" right."
"I personally don't care anymore, the Democrats let this happen to raise money. They could have prevented it, and they refused, just so they could uses it as a marketing slogan."
After all these years we are finding out justice is not blind.
Cases are decided by powerful people behind the curtain.
"Amy Coney Barrett said when questioned in the Senate hearing for her nomination, ""Roe v Wade is the Law of the Land"" ""I would not change that."" So she and Kavanaugh lied, which is illegal I thought."
"Pro-life people will never convince pro-choice and vice versa. Never. Even if you could prove when life began pro-choice people wont care. There will NEVER be all one way or all the other. You either compromise or we keep going back and forth. The supreme court was right, until congress passes a federal law it is a states rights issue. Stop blaming conservative justices for basing law on the constitution. That is their job and they ruled on the case before them not the hypothetical in their nomination hearings. There neds to be a compromise on a federal level and put it to bed. Enough is enough. MSDNC stop acting as the moral authority, you could not be more bigoted and biased."
Alito did it himself to torpedo the compromise Breyer and Roberts were lobbying for. It also reminded me of how RBG undermined Roe by hanging on when Obama could have made an appointment had she stepped down.
"So if these hookers said they wouldn't reverse Roe, but now reversed that, are they not impeachable?"
VOTE BLUE
"Remember,  justices serve  based on ""good behavior "". Justices are not guaranteed a lifetime appointment. That's one reason why SCOTUS dont want an ethics standard."
Is that a man or a woman?
Always remember that everyone who voted for Trump in 2016 is responsible for this.
"EXPELL clarence tomass NOW!!!

Don’t mistake pro birth and pro life… two very different things
I’m going to send them a couple of bucks. See if they will grant me immunity from speeding tickets.
The most pitiful thing you will see on Youtube these days is feeble old Joe Biden asking people to send him a few bucks for his re-election campaign. The man is decomposing right before our eyes. Have his family no shame?
"Remember no judge or attorney general ever took up trumps arguments regarding the stolen election , even the highest court took a knee shame on them . Then they said he lost 57 attempts when none of them even looked at all the evidence"
Abortion is murder. Abolish all forms of murder.
Guess the Supreme’s lack of ethics isn’t a breach of the public’s trust.  🤦‍♀️
Anything to distract people from the real issue of corporate dominance of Society.
Over 60 million children murdered by abortion and these two are talking about politics.
I think the Supreme Court needs to go.
Are their confirmation hearings done under oath?   They all lied about the support of overturning Roe.  “ It’s settled law”.  I feel betrayed.
"Back when the first leak happened I said there were 13 more decisions than were written more than 3 years before ACB was put on the SC.
She wrote these decisions a decade ago, to destroy rights in America.

The person who leaked the 14 decisions installing a Sharia Law government and Religious Law, they were VERY clear with the people that they gave copies.

They told them when they could release the other decisions before they are handed out, but there were other notes that she wrote about Making sure they don't take away birth control before they have a majority in the house and senate and they have a Republican president.

The conspiracy is super clear in her notes that go back a decade

The BIG question is, WHO GOT THESE FILES OFF HER LAPTOP??!!!

This has to be someone who had intimate access to her

Most likely someone who was in her house A LOT

I believe she knows for sure and I think the SC knows now who it is that got the files off her laptop.
And it is a person in her inner circle and they did not know this person was not a true believer and they believe in freedom, not religious law, and is a Traitor to her and the other half of the government who want Sharia Law and ban all birth control and make it a death penalty for anyone who is caught trying to get it.

Some day we will know who the leaker is, and it may be one of her kids.
Or her husband."
is there anybody still trusting this fraudsters? they are lawless and still have the power to do what they want. why don't they chance the law in senat or congress - well wherever in US law is installed? why are they not in prison? the whole world knows they got paid for their ruling. us US now a lawless nation? what is it worth???
The Supreme failure...
These new “judges” are money plants in the Supreme Court
"While I certainly understand it's a matter of contention, I don't understand where it's a ""right"" to end a life at its beginning.   I personally have seen several times where abortion was used as a form of birth control. There are dozens of forms of birth control, abortion should not be one of them."
"Roe V Wade was decided based on policy preference not what is constitutional. Supposedly it was based in a right of medical privacy. But Homicide was never subject to 4th amendment protection. It""s a shame that it took strategic planning and politics to allow a correct ruling. It should have never taken 50 years."
Anybody with common sense will not vote for biden.
Joe biden is a War criminal.
They should have this removed and put back as was. As it only hurt Republicans. They have been losing to Democrats like crazy ever since. And even if Trump gets to run he will never win because of this. As long as abortion is not returned to as was. Trump and his GOP will lose more and more power.
"I don’t want fake judges in the Supreme Court 
These are fake judges"
Who is upholding the constitutional rights to ones person?
How sad Ruth Bader Ginsburg was replaced by the nutty Amy Coney Barrett. Breaks my heart. RBG was so brilliant.
These judicial activists forget they hold neither the purse nor the sword. Vote. Organize. Focus locally but network. SCOTUS is like FIAT currency. Its only as powerful as our confidence in it.
Who invited Loki 😂😂😂
"All three trump judges, who were unethically installed, swore under oath, that Roe was president."

"Imagine him, spouting about ""breach of trust""
clown."
"When the gears of our branches of government become so mired in self dealing they lose sight of the current ethos on an issue. Abortion and their position in every way departs from evidence based reality. What they claim simply does not happen in the context they say and people know it. They also know a judge deciding what's best for a woman's health is farcical in every way. We know this. This will be the course correction that's needed coming from the people. Question is, is it still possible given the gerrymandered state legislature's control of mapping and courts deliberately buttressing their arguments. This will be pivotal fulcrum within these times of unimaginable consequences."
how can they know any of this when the court and the justice system can't seem to find out who even leaked it?
Roe V. Wade was overturned in exchange for Kamala Harris being put into office.
Shady AF
How can we even TRUST the Supreme Court? I know I don't.
There now teaching law at 1 of those Ivy League schools imagine that…
"None of these hypocrites live their religion, they only mouth it. GOD is the supreme judge, not the Supreme Court of the United States. They don’t give a crap about you after you get here, unless you have money, influence, and power. They all will have their day of judgment. Yippee!!!!"
The court is a facade
It's clear that the Robert's court is corrupt and is not working for the American people. We need to hold them to account and put in people who actually care about the well being of Americans and not just those who bride them.
"The Thieves, Oops sorry Justices need to have a term limits‼The Biggest Thieve with the wife that helped to have Trump retain power NEEDS TO GO NOW‼"
trust in the supreme court....not any more
Same crew who put those fake pipe bombs on January 5th … why won’t they tell us
"Without abortion we are livestock who don't own their bodies ready to have the mark of a beast branded like cattle with fire, yikes!."
"I am so blown away. As a woman. You guys go for it. But, I know freedom. Have at it. Hands off my body. And all those that of like minds. Peace be with you my friends. We will get through this very strange time. 🌤"
Its a very sad day democrats number one issue is killing babies. That baby is alive at conception. If dems dont change they will have alot of innocent blood on their hands.

The most amazing thing is that people listen to you.
God magic took rights away from women…what a joke
Abortion is murdering a human being.
This from the same people who consider corporations “people” it’s insane.
Everyone knows who the leak was. Why won't you say it?
"It cannot be a surprise to anyone that the decisions to take the case and the decision on the case to overturn RvW were political. Literally r=everything we do in life is on some level political because we are choosing and making judgements all day every day. Weighing out what we believe what we think is right or wrong or what is the least bad or the most good with everything. And those decisions are about our politics in the widest down to the narrowest definition. RvW when it was first decided was a political choice made by supporters and detractors and SCOTUS at the time. There is no surprise here. The real question is why are so many GOP leaders and why is Trump and why is does SCOTUS appear to be so ready to make and force political choices that are not reflective of where most people’s choices are today? What is driving them to make such bad political choices. I really don’t think the media has asked the question widely enough. What role has the slow but progressive change in our climate played?  What role did the pandemic play? What role has over population played? What role has the migration of peoples away from poor economies and Authoritarian states played in the highly charged situation that the world and the US finds itself today? Are there other, are there better choices and is there any ability to change the choices we seem driven to make? The media simply needs to do a better job than they are doing by talking about Trump 24/7/365 when he is likely only a symptom of much larger problems that need to be addressed."
So what does this mean exactly? Nothing can or will be done about it.
America is tied of these liars all in the fascist republican party. That is why America is going VERO forevermore until the republican party is gone 💙
MURDER / ABORTION HAS NEVER HAD ' RIGHTS'
I don't understand how a Supreme Court appointment should ever be a life time appointment. They should be removed if not ruling for the constitution or against the people of the United States. I believe that the setting president should be able to send a removal to the senate just the same as an appointment.
"ROMANS CHAPTER 1 VERSES 25/32.
↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️↗️"
The law is made in your state.
This is not rule of law . Just rule of personal beliefs and faith - both religious and political.
"Wait…it looks like politics and power? …. Hahahaha, that’s what it is."
"By trying not to appear political, they make it obvious that they are political.  Time to expand the court"
Why the judicial system or even any branch of govt having ANY right to decide over your own health should NEVER be the case.
"I never knew how that leak affected the conservative side, but I knew that it benefited them. Many were screaming that the left was behind it, but from the beginning, I could only see it firmly influencing the decision to overturn"
EVIL
Abortion is overused as a form of birth control.
More reasons for Democrats to unpack the Extreme court that the Federalist Society spent $400M to pack.
Too many explosive bombshells this week.
Follow the money
"We all have the right to deny medical treatment for ourselves!   Morally, no one has the right to deny others of medical treatment!"
"republicans, your teaching yoiu children to lie."
"Supreme Court Justices can be impeached by Congress.  We need to vote more Democrats in so we can remove these who lied and who are being bought vacations, house, etc."
The church bench that was called Scotus will ruin our democracy and trash our constitution
I blame the Democrats for not putting women's bodily autonomy immediately into law. Honour system in days of Trump a fairy tale. The shame is democrates who failed women in USA.
Seriously. Nothing but cuss words in my head. Yup. The court is 1000% corrupt.
"I'll never understand why they keep pursuing this poisoned pill. Gen Z turned up in droves after the last time and helped turn what was supposed to be a red wave into a red sprinkle and historically abortion have always been popular. But, if it ends up costing Republicans votes, as it already has, and hastens the death of that ghoulish party then so be it. This will just force more people to vote which has historically been bad for Republicans who havent pulled out a W on the peoples vote in 2 decades."
"The Supreme Court is corrupted to its core. This is a dictatorship with no accountability to the law, and the ability to change the law at will to suit their own belief system is the dictatorship ethos. Judges must be held to the higher court of a citizens review authority based on majority rule. Had that been in place over the year, many of the attempts to deregulate corporations, Citizens United,  and yes abortion rights would never have been accepted into our system of government. In my opion, yes opinion, this started with the Lewis Powell appointment to congress in 1971. He is the infamous writer of what is most often called the Lewis Powell Memo. Since then the Court has systematically sided with corporations over the wellbeing and rights of the vast majority of American citizens. Hense here we are with even the middle class preceeding into homelessness and poverty due to a biased Congress with the aid and comfort of the Supreme Court. I think a civil oversight with authority to bring Court decisions to the process of a national vote before institution would align the Court more closely with the Constitution."
Buy and Sell - give me a break!  They were bought!
Even Ginsberg thought the original ruling was wrong.
"Fortunately, the re-criminalization of abortion in Canada through legislative and/or judicial means will not see the light of day.  Evidently, abortion has long remained a 'proverbial' third-rail of Canadian politics."
None of this information is new.  This was reported when Roe was overturned.   This video was clickbait
"A conspiracy occurred to stack the court with activist ""conservatives"" (federalist/leonard leo, lies under oath to congress, etc.)
We the People have been deprived of our civil rights due to that conspiracy
Conspiracy to deprive rights
People have died due to this conspiracy (women denied abortion)
There are laws against that with the most severe penalties allowed under the Constitution,  The corrupt Court is not immune as the conspiracy occurred prior to their terms

Amendment I gives us the right to opine"
I wonder how many times Leonard Leo was consulted.
"Man, I love when Hayes has smart folks on his show. This reporter was great!"
RBG should have stepped down when Obama was in office. There was way too much riding on an 87 year old woman.
"Thank you Jodi, but man… Chris was trying to push his narrative"
"If women's abortion right is denied, Supreme Court would act exactly the same with the devil China Communist Party, which controls whether women can have babies and how many if allowed."
I mean it was a double edge sword... Probably have a GOP super majority in the house and senate if they hadn't 😂
"So whats happening with Thomas and Roberts again with their corruption?????


Why haven't we heard anymore updates about their shady deals WHILE in public service?????"
All under Trump Era are Major Corruption
This is soooo wrong
"KEEP RELIGION OUT OF POLITICS 
KEEP POLITICS OUT OF RELIGION. 
OR MAKE THE CHURCHES PAY TAXES.
MIKE WON'T LIKE THAT.....💙💙💙💙💙🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
"No matter what case - the fact that 5 unelected people can make the most momentous decisions is a flaw, one of many, in our justice system"
"The left wants  depopulation ....abortion, poisoned food,  poisoned water, poisoned air....war.   war. War killing our young people war is money"
"Notwithstanding the evisceration of Roe v. Wade by the reactionary justices on the Supreme-(ly Political) Court of the United States roughly eighteen months ago, these militant anti-choicers will stop at absoutely nothing until they finall succeed in enshrining the patently odious concept of 'fetal personhood' throughout the American political landscape.  Should this extraordinarily unfortunate situation ever become reality, then the United States will definitely cease to the 'the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave.'  Believe it or not, the enshrinement of 'fetal personhood' throughout the American political landscape by these militant anti-choicers would actually entail an outright ban on Assistive Reproduction Technology (including in-vitro fertilization)."
"I fear learning just WHICH Supreme Court roster was more corrupt and self-serving than this one. Tempting as it is to go by appearances, we can't assume they're the most corrupt and incompetent, but perhaps it is critical to learn if not, WHY this particular Court is not the most corrupt and incompetent and shameless of Supreme Courts.☹"
"It seems amazing that Trump instinctively put the supreme Court on his side.  now the whole right is under his support... Very concerned as an Oz. very dangerous situation,, hard to change or stop them ."
Fraud court
I think Alito leaked the draft or engineered the leak to lock it down
"Liberalism is a mental disorder. Abortion is not a Constitutional Right. The Justice's are correct, its a State issues. The Fed's have no right telling the country how to live."
Enough babbling. What are We the People going to do about it?
"People need to stop getting mad and vote. Voting results are why we have the current court we have. Voting is why Roe was overturned. Voting is why you have Republicans in states like Texas who absolutely refuse to allow women to have autonomy over their own pregnancies. 

All of the things you see happening are because of the ways people voted. If Trump didn't win the presidency, you wouldn't now have a 6-3 majority Conservative court. Which in turn, not only struck down 50 years of settled law, but went against the majority of the will of citizens in the US. 

You have women in this country who keep voting for a Republican party that historically, over the past 50 plus years has been overwhelmingly ANTI-WOMAN in its policies and legislative voting record. But women keep voting against their own interest by voting Republican.

If you want something different, than do something different. If you want different legislation, than VOTE differently and put DIFFERENT people in office."
She only voted no because of perception and timing... Otherwise she was all in.
The shady judge looking into a leak is laughable
The court is as crooked as the administration that loaded it.
"America has defeated many enemies before, and we have done so this time. Justice has prevailed."
It WAS political.
Kangaroo court rendering the law without merit. Its only a matter of time when the law will be completely ignored and the People will refuse to acknowledge they have any import at all.
The guy that retired is the obvious leader of this leak.😂😂😂😅😅😅😊
The result of taking away people's rights is *_losing bigly in elections._* 😂
😂😂😂
There has never been a consitutional right to anabortion.  Roe V Wade was a LIE
"Speaker Johnson:  ""A woman's duty is to birth at least one taxpayer""  It's all about money and control, period!  They don't have a problem pulling the plug on life support from a beating heart!"
Who dud it?
"I think they knew who leaked but won’t say so because it would be devastating to Trump and the Republicans. My guess it was Ginni Thomas who leaked it to Steve Bannon who deliberately published it on Mother’s Day. That is totally a Bannon move. He is RadTrad Catholic (started the movement which holds that the current pope is not the true pope because he is too liberal,) a long time business partner of Ginni Thomas, and thought Mothers’ Day was precisely when he should stick a dagger into all women’s heart. He’s despicable."
More lies from the New York Times
"We have the most corrupt Supreme Court in the history of the US. Alito, and Thomas should resign in disgrace for their failure to uphold the rule of law, and the Constitution, they run over with impunity."
You people are such zealots on the murder of innocent children....astonishing!!!😮
"They didn’t want to appear political? The whole thing is political, from blackmail threats of changing their vote to already have made a decision before ever hearing the arguments. Half the court also lied in their confirmation hearings. No respect for any of these hacks"
Name one theocratic government that works… anyone?
"False title again, nothing to do with the leak."
No more skydaddy in our justice system!
"No self-respecting woman should vote republican!
Same goes for men who care about their mothers, daughters, sisters, nieces, wives, girlfriends as well!"
"Democrats worried about Palestinian children being killed, but don't mind millions of unborn babies being torn from the womb..... things that make you go, huh?"
Uncle Clarence has got to go.
"And the extreme DT appointed judges that vote against choice, are the ones that don’t want to fund welfare or food stamps. Maybe they should donate their millions to the women that have to raise their unwanted children."
"Something about Barrett. I thijnk she might actually put her oath and the law before her personal opinions and beliefs. And certainly before politics. What I am saying here is, I sense there is something in this woman, that might be ethical after all. We shall see."
Next they will ban birth control!
I always suspected that it was one of the conservative Justices or their staff who leaked the draft.  They knew that would lock in the votes.  Yet we had Fox news losing their minds claiming that it had to be one of the liberal Justices.
"The Supremely Corrupt, Opinionated, Terrible, Unscrupulous Sinnners."
"But once the baby is BORN, it has no rights to a good life.These gentlemen don't care what happens to the newborn or CHILD. That is the mother's problem.! ) No public funding. Not even a dialogue! Because it's not politically convenient to say that now the country will need to support these babies for the next x years!
Birth control is also being taken off the table!"
"Overturning Roe is the equivalent of a declaration of WAR on American women. WE WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS. The Supreme Court's power is founded entirely upon the good will of the populace. They can make whatever decision they want - but We The People Do Not HAVE To  Cooperate. By making decisions that are so diametrically opposed to the will of 80% of the people, the court undermines it's own power."
Isn’t there a way to prosecute these Supreme Court justices or disbar them from office? Judge Thomas and Barret are clearly corrupt.
MSNBC=democrat party propaganda machine.
"Never forget who put them there!

The GOP😮😮😮"
"It is about politics and power and certainly not about law and reason anymore, so let's be real about that."
'Looks like'...it obviously is. Someone needs to hold them accountable! This anti-abortion BS is anti-Constitutional!
5:03 no that doesn't change a thing about how we think of her.  She still voted to take away life saving health care.  Look at Texas
Using abortion as a means of birth control is as obscene as it gets. And don't bother telling me that it doesn't happen.
Usually an abortion leak has a foul odor.
"Long as its a republican around, it will be turmoil."
My money is still on Ginny Thomas as the leaker.
"Calling these people justices is offensive. A group of unjust, corrupt politicians pretending to be judges."
Great.  SCOTUS is stuffed with lying jerks.
"I still believe some on our highest court are being blackmailed for that ""escort service"" in Manhattan that Muller investigated. The Steele Dossier, said several members of the GOP and some high sitting judges were customers of this escort service. I believe some are being blackmailed. Tump said he knew he would only put in judges he knew would overturn Roe. He wasn't wrong. Because he knew the dirt held on them. Everyone be out here covering their a$$!"
"5 / 4 , a super majority? Jodi please..."
"She's making decisions based on what the other justices do?
How about making decisions based on what the _law says?_
...since that is her job and all...
Birth slavery _is_ slavery.  It's not legal here."
Would politicians please quit practicing medicine!  Leave it to doctors and their patients!
"Like oh wow surprise, the two justices with the worst ethics who make the worst legal arguments are apparently the source of the leak, for bad faith reasons. Shocker"
Wow. Surprise Surprise not. If Ginsberg hadn't died I doubt that any of this would have happened or been passed. She would have put her foot down and stopped it.
"The important part that everyone seems to skip is the fact that the justices minds were made up BEFORE they had even heard any evidence ! What is the point of having a trial if no evidence you bring before them has any effect on the outcome? It’s not a trial then, it’s not justice, they should throw out the ruling on those grounds."
Impeach and replace or stack up the stained court.
"Alito or Thomas is the leak, that much is now painfully obvious."
Well if the American public continue to believe in Supreme Court to solve the law should by NFT’s and if the public doesn’t believe it’s headed towards Gilead.
If THAT is not politics!!! I don’t know what is!!  Supreme Court must not play politics!!!!!   Supreme Court MUST NOT HAVE LIFE TERMS!!!    8 Years is enough!!
"Bombshell: New report on the Supreme Court's abortion leak explicitly refuses to conjecture about who leaked the draft opinion!

I like Chris Hayes, but this is clickbait."
the supreme joke
Religion is wrong people. It’s racist. It’s sexist. It’s evil. There is no place for religious buffoonery in modern society.
"You didn’t have to give the leakers name.  The only Justice that would have a motive to leak this and force a vote to go along with this, whether he wanted to or not.  Alito  forced this into the spotlight to cement this and make it happen.  Alito
was worried about Kavanaugh’s vote.   

The timing though; that’s too convenient.  The election was less than 2 months away and as long as Ruth was still around they couldn’t do it.  This whole thing smells.  There are no coincidences.  Amy is in the wings and they needed her vote to make this work.  This whole thing was orchestrated to appear coincidental and perfect timing."
Vote Blue!
"It is amazing to people outside of America the justice system there is not about the law, it is about politics......................"
You've been sentenced to one night of rehabilitation
"This ""Supreme"" court is actually a religious tribunal... there's no court to be found. They create law to fit their christo-fascist beliefs and they twist facts to serve their religious agenda."
"The federalist society owns the supreme court, x45 was just the clown that drove the bus."
Alito leaked the decision IMO
"30,000 babies were saved since abortion Roe/wat !!!!!"
"I don’t understand why Roberts is so mad? It’s almost like he thought the court had some sort of RIGHT TO PRIVACY and *HE* should have been granted some sort of RIGHT TO CHOOSE  *if or when* to release a document concerning the difficult decision to TERMINATE A RIGHT THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN CREATED and was WELL ESTABLISHED instead of some random person who somehow found out and made the decision FOR HIM!

I’m so sorry Justice Roberts. I have a great deal of sympathy for you. This whole leak seems like a gross violation of trust. I can’t *possibly* imagine how you must feel!"
"RBG would have retired and let Obama replace her, but knowing the chosen one could not be beaten by Trump RBG decided to retire after Distillary was elected, allowing the first woman president to replace her in an historic event. Sadly Distillary lost and RBG bellied up while Trump was president, and for that I will always thank her!"
"it's not interesting that these activists politically one sided people  , liers, call themselves judges over the population on personal issues based upon someone religion overturning and retracting long established personal freedoms that evey other wealthy democratic nation defends.   those are supreme Ayatollahs not supreme court judges based in constitutional government."
NOTHING LIKE TELLING WOMEN HOW TO LIVE THIR LIFES!!!!!!!! DISCUSTING AND BULLCRAP!!! JUST VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE 💙  BIDEN CAN STACK THE COURT AND MAKE IT FAIR AND THEY CAN PUT ROE BACK IN ITS PLACE!!!!! VOTERS RIGHTS ARE ALSO ON THE LINE!!!!!
Forget abortion. SCOTUS is going to take away our country when they say Chump can't be tried.
"This is a bombshell MSNBC?  A politically stacked court go against presidency and remove human rights, but one wanted to wait 3 months.  They Tok away rights from women in 2022! A bombshell would be that the right wing crooks on the bench all decide to resign because of the damage that they did to the court."
"Half of the supreme court is fascist, America!"
"Nothing new here.  Certainly not ""bombshell"".  It's just a leftist theory.  Fake news again."
Barrett was likely playing judicial politics in tgst she knew the 4 votes were enough.
Ginsberg was the least corrupt
My vote is Alito was the leaker!
"Corruption in current SCOTUS can be ameliorated by setting an age limit of 70 years.
So sick of old men destroying the lives of people who still have their own hair, knees, and teeth."
The supreme court judges are just corrupt career politicians with the title judge. Their ambition and greed has destroyed Any integrity and sense of justice they once may have had.
"Ok, what's the over/under on Kavanaugh being the impatient pissant who leaked?"
"Their decisions are leaked intentionally, by them."
"Sure, the problem is who leaked the information. Not the corrupt justices that work for their oligarchs."
Sneaky corrupt judges!
Please get to the point of the title
"The mind reels that a ‘civilized’ democracy could even consider such medieval, cruel, misogynistic and barbaric behaviour as the banning of abortion. I am 73 and my generation fought INCREDIBLY hard to have medically safe abortions become legal. This reversal in the U.S. is just mind-blowing, and so tragic for women. So very grateful that I am Canadian. 💖🇨🇦"
Why do I get this weird impression that they're suggesting Amy Coney Barret leaked the draft?
"This is one thing about the Dems that ticks me off . they as far as I can tell aren't doing anything to prevent it !!!!
They have had numerous opportunities and options to fix this ....still waiting ."
"What this absolutely clarifies is that it was someone on the (anti-American) religious right who chose to leak specifically to subvert a (slightly) more reasonable compromise.  It's hard for me to fathom why each and every Justice isn't thoroughly investigated (on a routine basis), for clearly many are so thoroughly corrupt they have no business not being in prison.  Without true transparency there is NO justice, anyone who believes otherwise is dangerously delusional."
"This isn't ""fascinating"" as Kantor puts it. It's just despicable partisanship and self-interest. Those things aren't fascinating. They're lizard-brained. They're low."
"Dollars to donuts the leak came from a conservative justice's staff. That's why the ""investigation"" quietly went away without any information on who leaked it."
"8:18 bahh ......... they want that freedom they need that freedom ......... and when they're gonna do something UNTHINKABLE, they leak it"
We investigated ourselves and we found we did nothing wrong🤬.
It was a political stance that had no bearing on whether or not she would vote to strike down Roe v Wade. It was all about keeping up appearances. They lied to get their positions and they'll lie to keep the people satisfied to keep them there.
Abortion Leak…
"Every situation should be looked at individually, not all cramned into one abortion bill or law."
Austin powers.    Its a man baby..   lol.     😂
"I'm so glad that the justices were not on the court when I had my ectopic and lost the embryo from the uterus. I would be dead and unable to care for my seven y/o. I had an emergency ultrasound and then emergency surgery that night. I was having pain so I was able to take blood tests on Sunday + for pregnancy but level low indicated ectopic likely. Pain starts becoming more intense on Monday. Ultrasound and emergency surgery. This is how fast things can evolve, thank God that I was an RN and know the ropes. I believe in choice and medical emergencies DO happen. These decisions are made between a Doctor and his patients."
"OMG have them finding out the truth about the Supreme Court... That is not in the Public interest..."" And move along there is nothing to see here says the un BIASED Justices who don't want things they do in PRIVATE and their Rich-$pecial $$$ friends to be known to the public..."
"When your Supreme Court is bent, a country's not in trouble... it's in crisis."
"'No One Is Above The Law'

Exceptions: Ex-POTUS's, SCOTUS Judges, the rich...yup, No One!"
women now have to turn to lawmakers to make decisions about their healthcare. I guess we should seek legal advice from doctors
Sooooo.....Trump set the tone.😂
They didn't care what case it was they took. They were just waiting to overturn Roe and took whichever one came along.
They couldn't wait till RBG died. Corruption  runs  rampant in that court. I never thought I would distrust the Supreme Court  of the US.  I'm 75 years old. I worry for my grand and great grang childern.
"With the 932 comments already posted, I find it fascinating that almost none of them discuss what Hates and Ms. Kantor are talking about...because it was fascinating. Was everything involving Justice ACB smoke and mirrors? What WAS the motive of the individual who leaked the document? Was there always going to be a 5-4 majority? No one seems to be talking about these things.

Rather, most of the comments are ""a woman should have a right to choose"" and ""vote Biden 2024 if you want democracy"" and ""the Supreme Court is corrupt,"" all things that fall on the probably-to-definitely true spectrum, but most of which misses a lot of the points made in the above video."
RBG should have retired when Obama was in the WH and they had the senate.
Biden 2024 protect our daughters!💙
I can't understand how corrupt judges make these kinda decisions.
"Once again the word ""Bombshell"" is overused in social media. Jodi Kantor gave us some interesting information from behind the scenes, but it wasn't a ""Bombshell"". With the majority Right Wing Justices this was going to happen."
"Perjury trials for SCOTUS that lied during their confirmation hearings saying that Roe was established precedent... Liars, under oath... There are penalties for that..."
"I don't understand why democrats let religious fanatics talk about abortion on their terms.
It isn't about the ""rights"" of fetuses, it is a religious (Christian evangelical fundamentalist) view on women designed to control their sexuality and essentially making them second class citizens.
If it was about minimizing number of abortions mandatory vasectomy on all males of age would be a far less intrusive or dangerous way to go.
Forced birth and the loss of bodily autonomy is basically criminalizing  female sexuality."
Is this interview a joke.
It’s not a “Consrervitive Super Majority”. It’s a privately owned by Leonard Leo as tool to bypass the democratic process.  This is direct attack on the U.S. Constitution.
It was Ginni!
"Pro choice IS “Pro Life” life of the mother, life of children after they are born."
As the Republicans racist as a were prevented the first black president in American history from sitting a supreme Court Justice because what he was black or half black. Then they let dogs a Trump have the supreme Court they said when Obama tried to fill the supreme Court you can't it's too close to an election and we have to let the people decide they feel Ruth bader Ginsburg seat while before her body was even cold which was a very Stark difference from the year and a half Obama had to wait to not be able to see the supreme Court Justice
"SUPREME COURT JUDGES SHOULD BE ON TERM LIMITS, PERIODT."
The last 3 Trump appointed Justices all told Congress that they felt that Roe was established case law. They LIED! Simple as that.
Deciding the law guided by political expediency - exactly what Supreme Court Justices are required to be above.
"Ms. Kantor is already a great journalist, and I look forward to all her future endeavors.

Oh, yeah, and Alito leaked his own draft, the POS."
Policians shouldn't be making medical decisions
"They don't even look judicial, look like they have an ulterior motive to me.n"
"Can someone at least explain why the leak cemented votes? Like, if I'm a supreme justice... I control the rest of the story. I write the endorsements. Why feign disapproval for 3 months?

This is the kinda crap which seems dismissal in coincidence when it first comes out, but becomes a national embarrassment in 20 years, once they've made life altering rulings without any consequence"
"Makes me think about the same person that suggested to our former president, that it was a good idea to appoint fake electors to overturn the decision they didn't like from the voters."
News flash: Roe has publicly said she’s pro life.
"If SCOTUS Justices are allowed to lie under oath during their confirmations, why would you expect better from regular folk and politicians???"
SCOTUS = CORRUPT! 🤥🤑🤥🤑🤥🤑  😒🙄😔
we don’t need Supreme Court at all all this 6 of them involved either the money and they have to make decisions for all American people shut the door
The satanic left gets FURIOUS when people try to stop their sacrificing!!!
This should be the topic of an expose film and soon.
"Samuel Alito was the leaker. This twisted man’s hatred of women is so intense that he leaked this document, and people need to stop dancing around it and him. He took a victory lap and spat in all of our faces. He tells us every day that he is untouchable, and we can’t stop him. Democrats need complete control of the Senate to remove that man from the bench."
Vote blue
Trump needs to be made ineligible for the presidency. He's a criminal
"Like trump, the conservative justices  are liars. Everyone of them is for sale."
Thank you Chris. I appreciate your clarity and evidence of the values that you uphold.
"filth that doesn’t work for the American people


absolutely DISGUSTING"
Clearly overturning Roe v. Wade also highlighted why America's Founding Fathers never even considered allowing women to vote.
A great trip Mick.  So good to see behind the helmet so to speak.   Nice🤘🏽
"We are two completely different countries that are trying to be one. We need to let these Republican states exist on their own. They wouldnt want that though,  because most of the government assistance money comes from Liberal states. Tired of these Christian psychos forcing their delusions onto us"
WELL complicated. my two simple cents. seems after the leak they SAVED face for the HARD RIGHT. Not a way to adjudicate THE law of the land.
Love this supreme court
The havoc the Supreme Court unleashed on women is despicable and please stay out of women’s healthcare
It should be pro-choice and anti-choice
Blackmail.
"Pro Choice here, but it is hard to see how the 14th Amendment implied the right to abortion.  We wasted 50 years when we should have passed legislation permitting abortion.  But we couldn't even get the Equal Rights Amendment ratified, and that was as spicy as rice pudding."
They should realize that if Trump is re- elected; he won't need ANY of them!
The SCOTUS is a BREACH OF TRUST. The entire court is CORUPT!
"Overturning Roe was one of the stupidest things the Right has ever done. Not only did they galvanize Left, they handed the Left a winning platform on a Golden platter."
"They all lied about changing president  ,They need to be removed for lying.."
"The way you all - journalists express yourselves WITH THE WRONG WORDS.: FASCINATING POSITION - the barett , and then Hayes making a statement: ITS FAAASCINATING!!! LALALAAA, CHRIS. IT IS APALLING!"
"The great thing about banning abortions, it nullifies qualified immunity. You can’t have female cops on the force with protections not afforded to them under the constitution or the Supreme Court. How is a female cop going to face her accuser in the court of law when that’s also her baby daddy!"
You do know Jeffery Epstein lawyer became a judge and was the one who signed off on mar a largo search if not then your not paying attention
Why don't they ever have arguenents about how to prevent Conception? Why are all the Arguements about what to do after the woman conceives.
They lied in their conformation hearings commitimng perjury in the senate AND should be removed
The Supreme Court now is only about politics and not about the Constitution.
This has nothing to do with the Constitution. It is simply about fulfilling a minority political agenda.
"And people wonder why Trump succeeded? And why he's going to succeed again? This video tell all. It's a sham. They seem to be against Trump, but are fully supporting him. Disgusting on all fronts.🤮"
I always think Alito himself may have leaked it!!!
They’re appallingly evil!
"Well the satanic church supports abortion, kinda tell you all you need to know about it"
"It is politics even when the court is right, this court makes it decisions out of donor ownership loyalty."
"This isn’t a country, it’s a criminal enterprise."
This was over a year ago u think
It's good that the Supreme Court banned Abortion because now I can have tons of kids!
How can this court be trusted - bet the court  will rule that 45 has immunity
Bombshell ... u told me Nothing .. what a scam ..
Elevating Trump led to 3 more Saltine Supremacists on the Supreme Court.
My takeaway from this is that decisions regarding what constitutes ethical conduct are more realistic when made privately rather than publicly.
The source of that leak has been obvious ever since it happened.
"Democrats appoint a woman to the court that doesn't know what a woman is, and have the audacity to complain about decisions made concerning women. Their cognitive dissonance is on full display."
Geees. You lazy people. They sent it to the states which means  you cant have a say so in what the law says and does. Do your friggin jobs and call your elected  officals and hild them responsible. They work for you not the other way around.
"This is exactly why SCOTUS has become a joke. Many conservative justices were bought by billionaires and sold their votes long ago. Is it any surprise that SCOTUS rulings are being scorned and ignored? These justices have lost our respect because they didn’t have any respect for the positions they hold or the bench they sit on. We need SCOTUS reforms now. 13 justices to match 13 federal courts. Set term limits. Impeach Thomas and Alito. Finally, vote Blue!"
There were 3 breaches of trust when 3 Supreme Court justices said under oath that roe v wade was established precedent and no intention to overturn.
Take that liberal idiots.
"Trump campaigned that he would pick judges that would overturn Roe. Liberals stayed home in 2016 and gave them  3 judges. The liberal government had complete control and didn’t codify anything in 2020 -22, because they believed lying judges when they said they wouldnt overturn the decision. . We then get the leak and people still didn’t believe they would do it. Now here we are with abortion banned all across the US and liberals are once again thinking about doing a protest vote in 2024 against BIDEN. Mark my words, if people stay home and Trump wins, they would find a way to make the ban a federal law."
"She needs the cover for the SCROTUS investigations that SHOULD be conducted.
😭🇺🇲🤬🇺🇲😭
She  voted with the fascist Trumpalodyte party and the bought and paid for Justices....
😭🇺🇲🤬🇺🇲😭
THEY GROOMED THESE CASES WITH THE FASCIST FEDERALIST SOCIETY.
😭🇺🇲🤬🇺🇲😭"
"Even the infamous RBG said, Roe V Wade was judicial gymnastics, and wondered why it has been challenged in court before then"
Please end abortion. ♥️
Stop minority religious cults from enslaving women.
"Ah so Democrat hate Supreme Court, the Constitution, who wouls have know"
If the justices on the Supreme Court think that abortion is wrong then they should not get one.  Period.
Omg the Supreme Court had a Abortion......
This court needs to be investigated and corrupt justices need to go. How do we action this?
wow
Brings on a trans guy as an expert on how women feel.  How about stop killing babies?
It's as simple as it gets...People like this just want to pretend they are gods!
Vote people into the House and Senate who will vote to have accountability for Justices. Why am I held to a more unfair system of justice than our SCOTUS?
The republican justices on the Supreme Court Lied to get on the court and Lied when they did end of story .
"Advice to Chris: Stop laughing through important points you're trying to make, it's reminiscent of Carlson's hysterical cackle!"
Time for Biden to PACK THE COURTS and outnumber the criminal corrupt maggat theocrats!!
Justice Coney Barrett is as culpable every Supreme Court Justice who overturned a woman's right Health Care I don't care how you want to rewrite history the end result is women are second-class citizens and the Supreme Court Justices are at fault
Both bought and stolen court. Not living by a thing they say. We need term limits yesterday.
"Seems to me that this is an ethical situation. Didn't SCOTUS just adopt a new ""Code of Conduct?"" Guess we will have a front row seat as we watch the justices investigate themselves for unethical behavior. Because waiting for your coworker to die seems pretty unethical. And even more unethical is the suggestion to operate on secret decisions without the American people knowing. That's not just unethical, that's deplorable and scary. 💙"
"THIS IS A POOR EXCUSE  TO TEST, WHAT???? TO TEST WHAT??? TO EXPERIMENT WITH HUMANS' LIVES ??? EF SUPREME COURT!"
So which one of them is the rat? That's what everybody wants to know
Biden also needs to appoint a judge ASAP. Don't let the Republicans play the games they did last time saying we cant appoint a judge during an election year. Tired of their crap.
It is about politics and power. That is what SCOTUS has become.
"Oh yes, leaking their corruption is a breach of trust... Republicans really do have no bottom that they won't drop to in order to show how vile they are."
Bombshell. I thought Brett may have had an abortion or something.
Alito did it.  Makes me a little sick that he was chomping at the bit to take away women's right to control their own bodies.
They are the worst ever
"At a minimum, all Trump judges need to be expelled as soon as Orange turd is convicted."
"Wow! Of course, the overturning of Roe did help to get people out to vote and may have worked against the Republicans"
Justices lied to Congress when they said Roe v Wade was settled law.
"I like how we still pretend that we don't know which side leaked it. Robert's still working on that, eh?"
"Good people don’t lie, and do not try to control females, I don’t see the freedom gop claims they support"
When was the leak again cause that's how long late you are getting this news out there it was Clarence Thomas was the lake 90% the other 10% is one of the other conservative justices I knew like within a couple weeks that was a conservative justice probably within one week that was a conservative within four or five it's Thomas
The Republican Supreme Court is ruled by large financial institutions and wealthy donors instead of evaluating based on the will of the people.
"This lady , Jodi Kantor, talks with a natural delay. As if the audio/video is not calibrated correctly.. but it is! .. off topic? yes... Fascinating? YES!"
Illegitimate SCOTUS.
The problem is the political appointment of judges and justices. A better system would be promotion on merit within the department.
"Deciding not to take the case based on how it will look is saying - it doesn’t have anything to do with LAW.  It presents as “we want to do this, but don’t want to look eager to do it”.  That is a POLITICIZED court - not LAWFUL."
"Don't like abortions don't have one. 

Don't push your pro life views on others unless you also support other causes with the same fervor. 

Those causes;
Childcare, Healthcare, prenatal health, education, prison reform, police reform, voting rights, food security, environmental protections, limits to corporate power and influence, not sending troops to die for profit."
CHRISTIAN NATIOLISM WON..in the making BEHIND THE SCENES for the past 2 DECADES..and everyone FELL ASLEEP
"I'm with Chris, Barrett voting no first go round was personal coverage. She hasnt given anyone anything to think about when it comes to her. Alito, Thomas, Kavanaugh, and Barrett all lied during their interviews. Regular people get fired for jive like that depending on the severity. And their lies fall under sever"
Only white males will have rights.
this guys is a great liberal partisan
"Roberts has failed as the Chief Justice and needs to be removed from his position by Congress. Every federal group Constitutionally overseen by Congress is in a state of failure, every one! Changing Presidents every four years has stopped working so maybe its time to change the way Congress functions."
There is no more Justice and Freedom in America now. All are controlled by Corrupted people.
"Maybe I'm not hearing this right from this NYT reporter .._""blah, blah, blah""_  What difference does it make?"
Curse the court!!!
"I said when it was released a conservative judge did this.
They knew that released in June the anger would be felt at the polls in Nov, but released in February the people will have some other noise to distract their attention and by Nov the affects on the election were the pink trickle instead of a blue wave that may have occurred if it had been released under normal court calendar schedules.
😭🇺🇲🤬🇺🇲😭"
Remember this when you vote in 2024: The orange con man nominated these bozos.
They still could have changed their votes after the vote.
I don't trust Supreme court!
Old news
Poor little trumpies 😂
crazy times
Could have thought of a better video title?
"It's so sad that those ""Justices"" had their privacy violated."
Who cares
"""Part of what we need to remember,"" says the Kantor, thanking Chris."
Don't say 'abortion leak'. Could have chosen better phrasing.
Wouldn't it be nice to be completely untouchable and knowing you can be for the rest of your life. Corruption unmatched in any society.
Why does no one acknowledge that Ruth Bader Ginsberg was highly critical of how Roe v Wade was decided
Why do the majority of the supreme court justices  ignore the seperation of church and state in the constitution  ?
Roberts is concerned with his reputation than the country and the legal traditions they are supposed to uphold.
"There is NO trust in the Justices of SCOTUS ,,"
Another trumpazee justice that isn't a trumpazee
"I am very impressed by Jodi Kantor as an investigative journalist.....intelligent, sophisticated and nuanced reporting on this story. Having said that, I am convinced Justice Alito most likely instigated the leak."
"Listen to you snowflakes crying, you want to about feeling a law. Let’s talk about 1618, the constitution(in its original format), Dred Scott, the savagery of the south after they lost the war and implemented Jim Crow. Cry me a river. I know the real reason they want to ban abortion, Dr. Frances Cress Welsing.😊"
"I don't feel any different about Amy Coney Barrett, because she just didn't want it to look as bad on her because she knew, just like the other 2 trump nominated, that regardless of the lies they told in their hearings, they were always going to overturn Roe. She just didn't want it to be so soon because she is a chicken 💩."
I pray that they are seeing what they caused
Let's look at this pragmatically - what was the real effect of Barret's deny? Nothing. It's all theater.
"So the chief orange justice worries about the leak, not the consequences of his decision on the lives of Americans?  These orange activist judges need to be impeached asap."
Lol freedom OF faith or religion AND freedom FROM religion or anothers faith. No law shall be made that violates one's own faith of beliefs or religion to be another's same faith of belief or religion that goes against the others own faith of belief or religion
There's nothing Supreme about any of them.
"So much for the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. 

Biden needs to pack the court. Too much power in too few hands. Hands we cannot trust that cling to power for far too long."
"They'll be coming after everyone's rights. Best wake up and smell the cocos.
The goverment and the courts have no business in people's medical care and they certainly have no business in people's bedrooms. They have no business saying who people can and can't love.
Enough is enough with these clowns."
"SCOTUS is ruled by a group of individuals that lied to get their positions, are blatantly political and the most corrupt group of justices in the history of America.  It is time for the lifetime appointment to be removed and that several of the current SCOTUS justices be charged for their own illegal practices."
"Supreme Court doesn't care about people, they just care about who is president.

That is why it was overturned in the first place.

Not to mention we have very large corruption of the Supreme Court Judges."
I knew it.
"This country is totally effed up. My body, my choice."
"remember, republican majority put roe v wade into place to begin with.  if they try to tell you it's some evil ""leftist"" thing they're fighting, this fact alone makes it obvious it has nothing to do with saving babies.  if that were the case, they'd be talking about how to curb gun violence in the house instead of going on about public urination, the ""left's"" war on gas stoves, hunter biden's laptop, etc"
I never thought they waited. The minute Ginsburg died I knew we were doomed.
"Unfortunately, there are only a couple of Justices that will simply apply the law, then you have the balance interested in using their power for money and favor....This court needs to be dismantled with interims until such time this can be rectified period!!!"
Most Constitutional juris prudence experts say that the SCOTUS to include all courts grant a hold while the legal aspects are being sorted out. The Conservative justices took 10 minutes to decree an opinion.
I have no trust nor respect for the Supreme Court. Taking money and expenses gifts from millionaire and billionaire is wrong. The Court is tainted.
"This court is a joke, they are in it for themselves!!"
"The overturning of Roe shows a failing of the Senate in the confirmations of the newest Justices. All three were asked if they would overturn Roe V Wade, and all three evaded the question and replied that 'it was settled law.' And, instead of pressing for an actual answer, the Senate allowed that answer to stand. All three of the newest Justices should have been pushed UNTIL THEY REPLIED with a REAL ANSWER. 
The Senate dropped the ball."
He did it!!! Alito spilled the information.
"Abortion on demand. 
No Questions Asked."
This is further proof that the Roman Catholic SCOTUS is not independent and is not to be trusted.
Alito was the leaker. A criminal in robes.
So what are we supposed to do if the highest court in the land is morally corrupt?
"Coney-Barrett belongs to an extremist charismatic christian group, People of Praise.

POP is verifiably and creepily out of step with sane American values. Survivors' stories illustrate the horror any sane adult would feel at the usurpation of self-determination.

Buck the patriarchy!"
The lying nine
The US Supreme Court is illegitimate!
Nothing will happen to these traitor justices  .
The leaker didn’t commit any crimes.
"So there is no bombshell. Its just what we already knew. It was likely leaked by a conservative judge like Alito to force the others into line. The new judges were only concerned that it looked bad for them personally because like only 5 minutes ago they were swearing under oath they considered Roe settled law. Who would have thought that a political organisation grooming and promoting judges for appointment to the court could make the court look political when the organisation that put them there openly states the the reason they are being promoted. 
America is a backsliding democracy, and it didn't have a great one to begin with."
🚨🚨Fake news
"SC Justices are there to decide issues of law, not to plot to “make” law. That is usurping Congress, not to mention an abuse of power."
"""It can look like politics and power.""  Yes, because that is exactly what it is about."
"Trump's Supreme Court. Are they bright people who are just oblivious to the Pandoras box they've opened? Or, are they just not very bright.......period. Trump's Supreme Court.......what a winner! Aren't we blessed!"
We need to win house and senate and Oval Office so we can add to the court
Sorry to interrupt I would like to ask question. Why are we not talking about how the third party candidates are hurting the Biden administration for re-election and the reason Trump will be again a president. Dictator is because of third party candidates that are taking away the vote and have no chance zero chance of winning. They should own up bow out after supporters to vote for Biden. Otherwise well we know the outcome and that is trumpets. Victor
"Liar- Liar- Liar- Kavanagh is American destruction

Who and how much were they paid to bring death and poverty to American women?
To even have the thought that the Supreme Court majority are total scum and mostly corrupt is saddening.
Trump leads Biden by 17 points. Thank you Demoncrats for Making America Great Again
Just want to point out that these ghouls literally started looking for a conservative replacement for RBG before her body was even cold. And by literally I mean LITERALLY.
Sheldon Whitehouse has been sounding the alt on the supreme court that billionaires bought...
The conservative majority is corrupt  - bought and paid for by Leonard Leo and the far right billionaires whose dark money funds the GOP.
My money say Kavanagh or Thomas leaked!
"yeah, but here's the real kicker... they both thought trump was gonna still be in office..."
"Weighing the pros and cons of when to hear Roe, is the pinnacle of acting political.
These religious zealots are dangerous and a total threat to Democracy and the constitution."
"7 of 9 are Catholics,   The justice system in this country is getting highjacked by Jesus."
"Jodi's not gonna burn her sources, but the report makes it pretty obvious that the leak was from the forced birth contingent to shut down internal debate.  Which I believed from the beginning.  No wonder Roberts has shut his piehole about it after yammering on about an investigation, LOL"
All but 2 of these losers should be cleaning toilets in jail cell!!!!
"Justice Ginsburg let her own accolades and ego get in the way, and wound up defeating the very cause she dedicated her life to.  I hate it, too.  But it's the truth."
"As a US Army Veteran and Christian, I could never understand how conservitives and christians think they have the right to shove thier beliefs down the throats of others who have different beliefs!! It's not Christ-like behavior!!
    It's pretty simple, if your against abortion then don't get or have one! No one is forcing anyone to get an abortion! But stripping that right to away from others who have different beliefs IS WRONG!
  We are a nation of many different people with many different types of belief and no one form of belief is superior to anyone else's..just different!! 
 It seems the conservitives and fundamental christians seem to have more in common with the Taliban-believe MY WAY or else!!😲
FREEDOM=CHOICE!!"
Term limits please
The meaning is nothing. Her vote to not take the case on was purely because she had JUST testified that Roe was settled law. And her voting to not take up the case means nothing at all when she then went and voted to overturn Roe.   Just typical two faced lying from right wingers.
three daughters vote blue
Ginny Thomas was the leaker.
"It was a shocking decision for the Conservative SC Justices to overturn R v W but no one should have been shocked. We knew that the list of recommended SC Justice nominees submitted to Trump when he was President was a list compiled by the Federalist Society. The Federalist Society was only going to include on the list, nominees that had already ""pledged"" to overturn R v W. You didn't pass muster and make the list if there was any doubt about how you would rule regarding R v W. It didn't take much to imagine that Trump, in his one on one's with nominees, demanded they pledge to him that they would overturn R v W--it was a personal promise they had to make to become one of the Trump nominees. There should never have been any doubt that R v W was going to be overturned--that was ""the deal""."
"The ones who promised to never try and overturn Roe Vs Wade during their hearings and then did so, should be charged with purgery."
Click bait!!!!!!!!!
"I know she's a hero, but RBG didn't do the country any favor by not retiring when her health was getting bad - so Obama could have appointed her successor.  Now, thanks to her decision, we're stuck with a corrupt, right-wing extremist court that frequently serves political power grabbing by the GOP - not what's honest and best for the American people under the Constitution."
Republicans will never win another presidential election thanks to the overturning of Roe vs Wade.
"Precedent is just thrown out the window, nothing existed before the revolution."
So much for precedent and the word of the Supreme court  justices.
The court made the correct ruling. We should all celebrating the wonderful caring ruling that shows we as a country are not selfish but that we value life.
"So Republicans claimed it was the libs that leaked it to help their case,but it was the conservatives that knew it would end persuasion or compromise."
"Supreme Court  ""Justice""s"
I remember thinking in high school that the US Supreme Court justices must be such great human beings to have made it to positions so incredibly important. I thought so highly of them- sad how wrong I was.
I'm grateful someone spoke up .  These judges think they can do what they want without consequences or accountability this is the problem in America today.
The United States Supreme Kangaroo Court.
I am done with the men on the court. They hate me and want to control me. DONE. How do we remove them NOW.
"No trust in this court at all. No ethics, and full political. 

Term limits with stronger standards or codes than the lower courts. To start immediately."
Even the judges at the Hague only get 9 year terms .... these clowns get lifetime gigs...
“Breach of trust” describes the Supreme Court against the American People.
RODENTS!!!!
"I don't believe those conservatives justice thought twice about over turning Roe, they dont care. Vote Blue 💙 2024."
IF IT WAS A RIGHT IT COULD NOT BE TAKEN AWAY.  ROE V WADE WAS A MERE PRIVILEGE and was taken away. Women have less rights than a corpse.
They want to go back to medieval times. Suffering is not the only option. We have modern medical science now.
"She looks like Tim Roth. 
This all goes back to billionaire money running everything."
After Alito makes his reasoning I hold no faith in his judgement.
Time to impeach these judges or change law from lifetime appointments to time limit…
The Corruption Court
My body my choice.
Most of them can’t fathom what it is for a woman to have one so why should they even have a say?
"They want to overthrow row vs wade, but don't want the bad rep of being the ones doing it, and failing at it. 

Pretty sure they'd be the most hated judges if that happened. Both by their own supporters and their oppositions."
I’m sorry but I can’t help feeling angry at Ginsburg. This partly due to her selfishness.
"Awesome, we love your Bombshell reports DNBC and msnbc. We keep waiting for Bombshell follow up reports,  but never see them. Would this be called Spinning perhaps, or just plain propaganda?"
"The bible is neither antiabortion nor pro-life, but does provide a biblical basis for the real motivation behind the antiabortion religious crusade: hatred of women. The bible is anti-woman, blaming women for sin, demanding subservience, mandating a slave/master relationship to men, and demonstrating contempt and lack of compassion: ""I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."" Gen. 3:16 What self-respecting woman today would submit willingly to such tyranny?

The antiabortion position does not demonstrate love for humanity, or compassion for real human beings. World Health Organization estimates maternal deaths at 500,000 a year, with at least one in five stemming from unsafe, illegal abortions. Thousands more are hurt and maimed from illegal or self-induced abortions. Unwanted pregnancies and complications from multiple pregnancies are a leading killer of women. Why do antiabortionists want North American women to join these ghastly mortality statistics? Every day around the world more than 40,000 people, mostly children, die from starvation or malnutrition. We must protect and cherish the right to life of the already-born."
How much more BS does Americans need……..Biden need to expand SC and stop the destruction of democracy!!
"Stare Decisis is dead because of this decision. A court with right wing liars, touting established stare decisis before Congress, then obliterating it first chance they got. Liars of the supreme(?) court."

"Funny how every institution that the left does not control is ""broken"" and needs to be fixed."
"It has ruined lives in Oklahoma. Women's Healthcare has ceased to exist. The all white mostly male Republican state legislators wrote and passed the strictest abortion ban in the nation. Obstetricians and Gynocologists have fled the state. IVF and fertility programs closed. IUDs and Tubal ligations are illegal. Gov Kevin Stitt appointed a TASK FORCE to monitor all pregnant women from conception through giving birth. Doctors are required to give the Task Force information on all their pregnant patients. Any pregnancy that does not end in a live birth is investigated starting with the woman, her doctors, her family and friends. All social media, texts, emails and cell phone conversations will be searched. Vehicle license plate tracking history will be used to determine where she went during the alleged pregnancy.  The state supreme court issued a decision that abortions are legal if the doctor determines the woman's life is in danger. The state legislators are ""thinking about it."" In the meantime they are working on a complete ban of all contraception. Most woman aren't getting obstetric or gynocological healthcare. They're going to General Surgeons for hysterectomies, Physicians Assistants for ovarian cysts, Urgent Care for prenatal care and ERs to deliver babies. One hospital ER no longer treat pregnant women fearing legal liabilities. Most woman aren't getting pap smears or pelvic exams. And if they think they're pregnant, they're terrified. Woman are suffering. Mortality rates for woman and infants will soar in Oklahoma.  It's only going to get worse 🥺"
Lord help us especially all the Ladies the justices of the high courts are CORRUPT
Completely corrupt court.  Bought and paid for.
"*When will it be called corruption?*  Until the media uses the proper English the way we the normal people do, the effects of the MAGA are being normalized."
How can the same country go to the moon AND  create a corrupt supreme court?
I wonder how much it cost to get Roe v Wade turned back. The best justice money can buy.

Not sure that's the breach of trust to be concerned about here.
They got paid to over turn Roe VS Wade
Who cares about a leak about something you were about to immediately do anyway
Justice kavanaugh should be nowhere near the law because he has no idea what an entails or how to interpret it. Clarence Thomas is completely corrupt and Alito lives in the 19th century
RBG is with GF now.🔥

"Every child that's ever been aborted could have been the next Albert Einstein, cured cancer or just the common cold, or even developed a Warp Drive that would give us the ability to reach other stars and solar systems in a matter of days instead of millions of years.

"The process of appointing judges needs solid rules that can't be impacted the way Mitch McConnell did. He STOPPED Obama's nominee from June and held it until Trump was in office the following January.  Then forced Trump's final nominee through congress in September of 2020 before Trump was ousted. That's the FIRST crime against Americans.  Then, even though they all declared the Roe v Wade Setteled Law, they went back on their Constitutional requirements and re-adjudicated it according to their RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.  
Now, who can I take breach of trust to for a hearing? If the #1 court in the land can toss out the separation of Church and State,  we've lost the core of America's founding.

Amy Barrett is a lowlife fake. She and that other drunk that got appointed. Its time to CHANGE those lifetime appointments. They should have to run every 4 years like the rest of the politicians and there NEEDS to be term limits on ALL politicians. The choice to have a bunch of kids is hers NOT everyone else! She is a FAKE Christian TOO. She doesn't have the right to bring her personal views into politics
"A Breach of Trust to the Women of America. Shame on them. Do these unqualified Justices now see what happens when they let the States take care of it. Women are usable to get the care they need because wrinkled assed old white men know more than the doctors. Shame on the last three for lying. America now in some States are worse than third world Countries. I don't care if Amy had 17 children, she was part of destroying Healthcare for Women who have no power. SHAME ON THEM."

"So what I'm hearing is that 9 adults have their internal meeting notes exposed to the public, and they all decide that means they have to immediately freeze their decision-making ability?

These people aren’t pro-life. They’re pro-birth. Once a child is born they don’t care what happens to it.
We knew most of this already: we knew that Alito himself leaked the decision to cement and consolidate it.
I am absolutely dry heaving sickened.
The whole Supreme Court is a breach of trust.
"Fixed terms that have to be renewed,"
Everyone knows it was Alito; he is pretty stupid to think we don’t know it was him because he did it before.
"When it comes to 'standing' legal precedent, which Roe has stood for 50 years, completely unchallenged, and the fact that a number of yet to be appointed Justices cited Roe as being firmly established, makes a mockery of them."

This SCOTUS is Morally Corrupt & Illegitimate!
See it Supreme Kurt did that turnover roe v wade before the public it a leak from supreme court and the wealthy paid them also !
I don’t think a thinking feeling fetus should be aborted. A woman doesn’t need 15 weeks to decide she wants an abortion. 15 weeks is a compromise not a banning of abortion
Americans preach about freedom and yet its being stripped away but hey brother we got guns 🔫  freedom woo!

strongly supports the speculation that Alito leaked it to freeze in the win.  Not only unethical with regard to taking favors.  Apparently the rot is much deeper.
"Term limits & expand the Court! Now!
The only answer at this point.
The Supreme Court has lost all integrity now.
Corrupted beyond belief!
Thomas needs removed without question."
"How do ""We the People"" change this? There needs to be term limits."
It would be interesting if Barrett has a pregnancy where she needs to get an abortion
It's not like people have any confidence in the supreme Court
Meanwhile thomas is bought and paid for by harley crow and other rich white men
"These folks on SCOTUS all said they considered Roe settled law in order to get seated/confirmed by Senate. This is not just about politics and power but about one side who believes the rule of law only applies to the weak or naive. I am disgusted. Kavanaugh, Barrett, Thomas, etc. should be impeached and removed. Merrick Garland deserved seated instead of Gorsuch."
I’ll never understand America. They protect your right to carry guns but not autonomy over your own body. You can take away a life to protect your own if it’s  with a gun but not a medical procedure. Law and religion are supposed to be separate.
When are Republicans and  SCOTUS going to repeal a woman's right to vote?
"How many leaks is this?
Leak?"
"Finally all things are coming to light!!! 
Hopefully we all will be more prepared to fight fascism. Everything ends in the same point. Fascism. Love for power. Narcisism. Evil. It's going. It always come back unless we do not allow to happen again."
We knew all along that alito leaked the draft to cement the votes for his handmaid's fantasy world.
But why? Who is the real winner?
"Trump's Republican Fascist Party including Trump's Republican SCOTUS agenda is  CONTROL, OPPRESSION, and POWER.          Anti-Democracy.  Anti-Freedom of Choice."
This is one of many reasons why I don't and won't trust  the Supreme Court of Injustice.
"The decision whether or not to have an abortion should be left between a woman  and her medical professionals, and everyone else needs to mind their own gd business. An embryo's potential ""right to life"" should *never* outweigh the mother's  very real right to life."
"Delay, delay, delay; sounds like the court uses the tactic similar to 45, for political persuasion."
Chief Roberts is like the policeman who blames you for possessing valuables when reporting a robbery.
"Click bait , bombshell?? , nothing here , distraction from BIDENS failing Presidentcy.😎🇺🇲Vote republican no matter what or who .😊"
It was never a case to judge. It was a done deal political stance waiting for a case as an excuse.
So embarrassing our country is run by people that believe in an invisible man in the sky. Or at least pretend to. 🙄
"Alito bragged to his fan’s,
so They leaked it.
I think we already know this.
These “Justices” need to keep their traps shut if they don’t want leaks!
How dare Roberts!"
"Sure thing, we will never know Alito did it!"
"Biden was extremely naive not to expand the Supreme Court.
Especially if it ends up costing Americans their lives, as it might easily do."
This talibangelical SCOTUS are all so frikin CORRUPT and we're stuck with them for 40 more years unless by some miracle Dems have control of the Senate and Presidency when Alito and Clarence kick the bucket
"If the changes look like bribery, politics, and power — watch ""The Pelican Brief"". We need at lease three of those now."
The leaker’s name rhymes with Tinny Ghomas.   🤫
Kudos to the level minded NYT journalist who is not trying to push an agenda. Chris hayes is just pushing that terroristic dem agenda.
The supremely corrupt court
Future Justices of the Supreme Court should be elected by a straight national vote like the president.  Taking politicians out of the selection process is vital if the Supreme Court is to regain credibility.
They’re going against the majority of citizens. Get out of our body’s! Corrupt court!
"So, the only thing this reporting really reveals is that Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett wanted to hide SCOTUS's decided plans about overturning Roe v. Wade from the public for a period of time in order to make the Court's action -- which was blatantly political and about power -- look less like it's political and about power. Did I miss anything?"
"I don’t think it’s that much of a mystery… Amy cohen Barrett changed her yes, to a no on taking the case on simply because the end result would be the same. It only takes 4 justices to take a case. She would’ve been the 5th and she thought, why dirty my hands on this decision when at the end of the day I can say “I’m distancing myself” from it and still get the result I want. Which is to overturn roe."
"*Biden Job approval*

*33%  Pew Research / Nov 27 - Dec 3*"
"That whole thing was set-up, and we Americans lose."
Harlan Crow and his billions are obviously the 10th and 11th members of our lying corrupt Supreme Court.
"There is nothing more dangerous to the United States, or women's rights, than Christian Nationalism.

Religion ruins everything"
"9.**11. Jordan's King Hussein killed 25.000  Palestinians in 11 days  1980 . And it was none other than Pakistan’s General Muhammad Zia-Ul-Haq, then a Brigadier, who helped King Hussein carry out the massacre of 25,000 Palestinians, in what is now known as Black September of 1980 1:02"
"why dont you guys go back to our british way of having judges, where its just a job, they cant have a p[olitical bias,  and they can be fired. thats why you never hear of corrupt british judges, because theres no incentive to  be corrupt"
"Hmmm, anyone looking at 3rd party commission reimbursements (a.k.a. slush fund payments) to ANY of the justices?"
lefters are CRAZY for abortion💙
"It’s sad to think that a life in progress, especially a human life where there is thought and feeling, would be snuffed. I just can’t stomach this, but I don’t know that it should be banned because of the implications to the expectant mother, especially the dangers  of botched illegal  abortions as well as  the unwanted hardship on the woman. Many women regret getting an abortion. There should be more support for women who want to keep their baby."
"The arrogance of Ginsberg is unforgivable.  She should have relinquished her seat knowing how old and ill she was.  Instead, she stayed knowing she had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana  peel.  I despise her.
TERM LIMITS!!"
"History? Decent timeline & rehash. Conclusions? Nothingburger.  The last time laws went backwards like this, we ended up with Jim Crow. And now we have Jim Roe."
Trumpy did so much damage to this country.
Thanks to YouTube for explaining what an abortion is.
ok
"If the law of the land can be interpreted differently depending on the religious indoctrination and delusions of the interpreter, then the law of the land is worthless."
"I said all along: a republican/conservative judge or staffer leaked it to push and force the other fence-sitting conservative judges (Roberts and now astonishingly Barrett).  They leaked it so the conservatives would stand firm.  Disgusting, so much for being non-political."
I know you do not have to reveal your source. My guess? You have NO SOURCE to protect. IN HOUSE HIT PIECE.
Wow!   The Supreme Court tries to take this case after a Justice’s passing?   That is a new level of being scum.
It’s such a shame that all these people including dodgy GOP colluded in such corruption.
Moscow mitch and his stolen seat. RBG not retiring and letting Obama replace here. Now handmaid's tale here we come.
It WAS about politics. All about POLITICS.
So creepy the way corrupt SCOTUS always smile in those photos.
We definitely need a third party in this country...😡
"I know she was extremely popular, smart, insightful and wise with her opinions, but RBG should have retired during a time when she could have been replaced with a fair and balanced justice.  I feel like she gave her seat away to the conservatives and here we are now."
"Misleading headline - there is no ""bombshell"" of newly discovered information like who did it."
Enough with the bombshells already from all news networks especially Fox News.
Some of these justices said they would uphold Roe v Wade and then didn't.. why should we trust the ones who lied with a pure interpretation of ANY U.S. law? 🤔
aint that a shame
"Well, either way Americans want abortion access and it will return. Men are just salty seeing women surpass them across the board 😂 Just work harder men!"
"""breach of trust"" = exposing the internal corruption"
"Better, the Supreme Court is a kangaroo Court with carpetbagger Judges, with one black."
If only RBG in her 90s let Obama replace her we wouldn't be here. Thanks for that.
Abortion is more complicated now because of science. We can see when the baby develops a heartbeat. It's not an issue of Christian morality the being is a life.
I am baffled by the hypocrisy of God's country core feeling
"Unbelievable that these selfish, superstitious, shameful, idiots, were ever allowed to take away women's rights."
Ginny Thomas.
Biden 2024.  Lock them all up. Disgraceful. Thanks Chris great reporting as always.💯💯💯
ROE ROE ROE YOUR VOTE! 🗳 ☑
Term limits a must!
My opinion is that they took a gambit and it is going to take them all down. In my opinion the case is not yet settled.
"Trump for Prison 2024, 
Most corrupt Supreme Court in modern times. 5 Slanted Republicans lied to We the people."

"As I said 3 days ago, cue the Scotus Chief Justice Roberts court messing up AGAIN with WOMEN OF AMERICA enraging said women to the voting booths next November, as his scotus did for Mid-Term votes. Go ahead, make ALL women Even Madder, roberts et billionaires."
Old news
"I thought she was a guy , until she spoke’😲🤷🏻‍♂️"
AMAZING! *Always Vote BLUE!!!*  💙💙💙
"$CROTU$ must consult with Leonard Leo to determine how they will rule.
How long before they rule that women are no longer people but property?"
There was a HUGE bombshell of information that’s just been exposed..  I wonder why MSNBC continues the propaganda instead of honest journalism?
"Barrack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Republican establishment wanted Merrick Garland to replace Antonin Scalia which is what would have happened if Hillary won 2016."
"As a woman I am pro-life. However,  I support and respect my sisters right to choose. Why judges and politicians feel the need to push their personal beliefs on others is beyond me. Integrity is a thing of past."
The Supreme Court is a breach of trust.
I’m sure it was Gini Thomas!
"The  ""pro life "" agenda is based on religious beliefs  .   Seperation of Church and State is clearly stated in our Constitution  !  It's time to rigidly enforce this and get religion out of our courts and government  !"
The Supreme Court is a kangaroo court in disgust
"Killing Rowe Vs Wade WAS all about politics, not law.  After that it is all about politics now, making up stuff out of thin air."
How grouse these unsuprime Court judges are they should be impeached (ASAP) 😡🤬
"Why bring this news, the deed has already been done."
"Face it, America - your top-tier justice circuit is as bent as a bad penny."
"People had to be asleep to not know what was happening with the Supreme Court. This is exactly what the Republican Party was working on, starting with Ronald Reagan."
Just released: A male staffer of a Democrat Senator was filmed getting plowed in the butt in the Senate hearing room. This is not a joke.
GOP on the way to the dust bin of history have never done anything for anybody never will !
Our Supreme Court seems to be corrupt.😢 But what do we expect from a court that says a “well regulated militia” is every person in this country. I don’t think I can take them seriously as my moral compass. These are not people I admire or want to follow.
"0:09  Let's avoid mentioning trust, particularly in light of Clarence's blatant disregard for ethical standards. We failed to see any investigations into Clarence’s immoral behavior."
The SP Court is such a disgrace!!!
1/3 of the court was chosen by a president who did not win the popular vote.
They have zero credibility. None... the only saving grace is it's bringing together we the people. All the suffering this has created for women is unnecessary  and  pathetic
"Can they be impeached? The whole group of congress people, republican senators McConnell and the republican court justices should all be impeached because this was a plot."
expert witnesses for hire
I wonder why Republicans think it's  ok to have traitorous bribe taking criminals and liars on the Supreme Court......
4 MORE YEARS. BIDEN/HARRIS 2024 🇺🇲
"We're here because Ruth Bader was too self absorbed to step down when she needed to, when Obama asked her.  I hope she's rolling in her grave."
"If Trump is to Putin what SCOTUS is to Trump, does that make America de facto Russian?"
"The SCOTUS is a joke - they make a mockery of themselves, of democracy, of decency, of justice."
"""The dog that caught the car"" is going to cost them the big prize next November.
Vote Blue💙"
I'm going to laugh so hard when tRump turns on his non rich supporters.
"Republicans are ready and willing to lie to your faces about what their plans for reproductive rights are- the truth is, and what they have repeatedly proven is that what is happening in Texas, Idaho, Florida and Louisiana  is what they want for all 50 states. And don't think for one second contraception is safe because repubs have several bills in 3 states targeting access to birth control."
Apparently stare decisis only applies to liberal justices but not conservative justices.
Halls of Justice???
Saved the right for abortion?
The Supreme Court is a breach of justice.  No one respects them anymore.
The Catholic witch is showing her colours.
A woman  body is her own. A woman body is not owned by the churches or the government.  Do you understand.
lester is such a fn corny blockhead
“Abortion leak” are two words that shouldn’t be paired together.
"Breach of trust to We the People, SC, knew back in February they over turned it, yet KEPT it from WE THE PEOPLE OF THE USA 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
"Biden/Harris 2024 🇺🇸 SCOTUS, particularly the political hacks appointed by the “former guy” and the bribe takers Thomas and Alito cannot be trusted. Vote Blue so we can have much needed reforms to the SCOTUS, like binding ethical rules!! The People deserve better than the current CORRUPT Court."
"Ah, yes.  Our illegitimate Supreme Court.  Religious fanatics violating our Constitution daily.  It's a GrEaT time to be alive ... if you're a man, right?"
"So, the point in time that the question comes to light does not freeze considerations for the opinion.  You call that freedom, I call that Justice Denied!"
People who exclusively vote Republican are ignorant and selfish people. Mainstream Americans can't even talk to them!
That's a breach of trust but not a corrupt bribed Justice on the court.
The SCOTUS is the breach of trust!!
"Anyone remembers the Pelican Brief??? Every one of those justices that said that they wouldn't overturn precedent, should be fired. The Supreme Court is the ONLY job that you lie during the interview, get the job, and when people find out that you lied, nothing happens and you still remain at the job, FOREVER."
"Definitely, the Beatle members were much deeper thinkers than any of us fully relied.
Only much later on did we come to know of their true inner feelings, their profound thinking.
We actually were a good bit of their anxiety and pressure, because we idolized them so.
We  probably drove them into isolation."
tRump is a *TRAITOR*
You mean the justices that swore under oath that they wouldn’t mess with ROE under oath in their senate hearings because Roe was settled precedent were uncomfortable taking women’s rights away? Shocking. Yet they still did it.
Don't tell me Justice Thomas is'nt the only one With a Sugar Daddy.
*if republicans had the White House they would of expanded the Court a LONG TIME AGO..Hint..and who gives a F about the leak*
The end of RvsW is completely and solely the libs fault.
The greatest influence on SCOTUS  was Mitch McConnell. 😭
Trump rigged court.
Kavenaugh is a lying viper  who should never be trusted. Vote term limits for members of SCOUS.
"The great majority women of this country deserve and support the right to our bodily autonomy. SCOTUS ruling undermines our human right to absolute control over our bodies and our medical care. Republicans thought we would forget by the time the 2024 election. They are wrong. When it comes to our civil rights, women will not forget. 
We will never forget"
"What was the breach of trust was the fact that 3 Supreme Court Justices said during their Senate confirmation hearings, under oath,that Roe v. Wade was decided and law , that they wouldn't touch it,yet committed perjury and overturned it!"
it sounds messy to me....
How can a throne of iniquity like the Roberts Court investigate itself. Psalms 94:20. It can’t!
"Every Trump appointed SCOTUS, LIED, to get ON the Court, to begin with. Just to overturn Roe v Wade. This is PROOF."
"""A WOMAN'S BODY.....A WOMAN'S CHOICE"""
"GOP want to control your body, what words you can say, what you can read, what you can wear, how you identify and who you can love."
"Brent might need abortions legal, his college age daughters will soon be playing that game Devil’s Triangle, unless he cares who knocks them up, he better keep his options open"
Trump has paid for his share of abortions
"All of the Supreme Court judges swore under oath they considered Roe v. Wade settled law, during their Senate nomination interviews."
FJB and ALL his MORONS 😂😅
The most supremely corrupt court.
Blacks for Trump
Republicans stripped away the Rights of more than half the population. They will continue to pay bigly at the ballot box. Look at the reality in Texas.
The sad thing is Biden is useless - and he is in office now & women in Red states are suffering- Biden is not saying anything .. to the red states!  Ignoring us
The most corrupt Supreme Court.
"Thank you president Trump for your great Supreme Court, the greatest gift to America 🇺🇸"
We all know the SCOTUS was bribed. That's all they do is pander to the highest bidder.
The Supreme Court is corrupt... the justice system is bought by billionaires.. our democracy is UnderThreat.
Abortion is murder.
It was about politics! The court was packed illegally as an appointment was taken from President Obama! Then the political move by Republicans letting trump appoint during his last year of office. I call BS
I do not trust SCOTUS any longer.   It is tainted and needs to be sanitized.
What happened to republicans demanding states decide?
Term limits
"🇺🇸 Trump/2024 🇺🇸 
Make Trump get another Supreme Court Justice pick Again."
"Calling abortion a ""women's right"" is like calling Chris Hayes a journalist."
"Republicans:""We have take full control in Supreme Court! GOOD LUCK WITH IT! 😁😁😁 WITH OUR MEN IN SUPREME COURT WE ARE ABLE TO BREAK ANY LAWS WE WANTS!"""
"Yes please tell us, weirdo!! Because your MSNBC audience are to dumb to think!😂😂😂"
"The Criminal all need to be REMOVED!! They are illegal put in by criminal Traitor Treasonous plotting grifter Scheister.
None of their business!!
President Joe WILL veto ot anyway he has said"
Not surprised supreme Court got caught with this plot 😡
Mississippi is the poorest state & many black’s & uneducated and poor whites. They really needed abortions to be legal. Sad 😞- if u are against abortions do not get one.
"The united state's supreme Court cannot be trusted anymore !!!
They have abandoned ethics, decency, values, morals, humanity for money and power !!!
They have been bought and paid for and are not a legitimate court anymore !!!"
"Fun fact:
  Over 32,000 babies have been saved from being murdered since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Thank you, God 🙏🏻!!"
Expand the court and implement term limits for the Justices!!
"😂 so shoot the messenger and never mind about the message, so much cynicism 🤦🏻‍♂️."
