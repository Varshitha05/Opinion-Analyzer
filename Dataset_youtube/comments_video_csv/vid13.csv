What happened to all those back alley abortions we were told would occur?
Key campaign issue?  So a vote for Biden will bring back Roe when it was taken away during his time in office?  I don't think so...  Evidently it's extremist in congress to think killing babies is wrong.   Something smells funny here.
"Ok what has changed since roe vs wade was stopped, 64,000 women have been in impregnated   from rape, 20,000 plus women in Texas alone, Abbott should be arrested for that by the FBI, women need to take  this to the white house or Capital fast and as asap about this fast. Rape is still against the law here. Babies are supposed to come from love between woman and man not rape. Thats horrible, My question is, how can a women love a babied that she reared from rape, thats not right and that aganist everything in the bible, that is wrong. Think about this for a minute your mother is rapped by a rapists' and she can't abort that child, she must have it, what about the husband, thats a true divorce right there. that a horror story, I mean your sister who is 15 and a  virgin get raped, she has to have this baby or go to jail, what wrong with these states that want ROE VS WADE OFF THE BOOKS, DID THEY SEE THIS HAPPENING, THE ONE'S THAT WANTED ROE OFF THE BOOKS GET RAPPED, THEY TO MUST HAVE THE BABY'S. THEY WONT DO THAT."
The patients are running the asylum
Biden is a robot a joke and America is doomed
Flee these draconian States.. don’t share your revenue! MOVE MOVE MOVE
Democrats have been on a winning streak ever since
Cancer is a clump of cells too. Why shouldn’t we remove it if it could potentially ruin our lives?
Ofc it’s a god thing 🤦🏽‍♀️
Good.
"Princess Diana was right when she said  "" They wanted to make me into a broodmare"""
"Stop being easy and getting pregnant and you won’t have any issues. Abortion although in my personal opinion is wrong, most of the women I saw coming in and out of clinics were prostiutes and frequent visitors. It harbors crime and all kinds of stuff."
"Let’s see, 10 year old has to leave Ohio for Indiana to get abortion for rape.  Indiana md then sued by Indiana AG.  Would this be possible if men could get pregnant?"
So glad Roe v Wade is gone!!
Lol as a chaotic neutral this is still the funniest thing in recent politics.
What did Biden say??? 😂😂😂 0:50
"If men could get pregnant, the abortion clinic would be a drive-thru! UGH!"
it's all about choice and consequences
"I think that if people were more careful about who they sleep with and take responsibility for the decisions they make, we wouldn’t need  the government to intervene and tell us what we can and cannot do."
"We should not be treating   an unborn like  an organ being removed.    Ec 11:5  ""As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.""   Clearly  3rd trimester John the baptist  leapt for joy over 1st trimester Jesus speaks to the personhood of the unborn."
"I mean i think life in its self is more valuable than someone’s comfort. Excluding rape, you were the one that set up this situation knowing this could happen. And a life shouldn’t be ended because of someone else’s mistake and bad decision making. Medical emergencies are also an exception but most abortions are on the basis of economic situations, work life, and relationship status."
One year later and the left is still playing games
"Personal medical decisions should up to individual citizens, not politicians and their big $ donors."
“.. make decisions about my body.” You decided to make decisions about your body when you consented to have sex..
Listen to him talk come on...
Constitutional right to abort a baby? Where im the Constitution does it say you can abort a child? These are the same people who think gun control is a good idea.
I’m pretty conservative but I disagree on abortion. I love it when liberals terminate their pregnancies. Do it more please.
"A completely political Supreme Court decision made against the wishes by far, of the American people, especially unfavored by WOMEN ~ thanks to that trump idiot. He was comfortably, solidly pro-choice until he decided to use the fay anti-abortion political winds in his ambition political sails, prompting him to appoint 3 known anti-abortionist judges to the bench, which is pure hypocrisy! The other thing I will say is that if Justice Clarence Thomas had had his way with Anita Hill, who called him out for prolonged sexual harassment, I'm sure he would have demanded that she get an abortion. The duplicity of these so called Republicans is reason enough NOT to vote for them people."
"Imagine if people just made better life choices, rather than resorting to murdering babies."
Go Biden #Biden2024
"Millions of us democrats don’t support abortion. Please stop making it a Democrat vs Republican issue 🙄. This is an American issue! Maybe start using contraception if you don’t want a baby, that’s for both men and woman. Tired of my tax dollars being used to pay for abortions!! You get pregnant it’s on you to pay, period. Tired of watching the woman in my black community in southwest Philly talking about it like it’s just another day, no big deal. Start acting like adults and take responsibility instead of spreading your legs for several different men a week 🙄."
"""Every life is precious gift from God, "", Of course Black people are included in that,
right Chris Christie?"
"1000000 lives were saved, that’s what’s happened!"
"A couple of days ago, Zelensky said that Russia mined the reactors of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and wants to blow it up. But at that time there were representatives of the International Atomic Energy Agency. They conducted an inspection and the next day they reported that there were no mines and that Russian troops did not store ammunition and explosives inside the nuclear power plant. But the leadership of Ukraine stubbornly declares that Russia has mined and is about to commit a terrorist attack at the station.
I am very afraid that the Ukrainian leadership in the coming days may take such actions and decide on a massive bombardment of a nuclear power plant using Storm Shadow missiles installed and tested on Ukrainian Air Force aircraft, as well as using M142 HIMARS. Although the Russian army has learned to easily intercept missiles from the M142 HIMARS, as well as the Storm Shadow, but using a combined attack they can break through the Russian shield, because even the iron dome of Israel cannot withstand a massive combined attack.
During the hostilities in Ukraine since 2022, it became clear that the Ukrainian leadership and Ukrainian troops could launch any inhuman attack. They killed their own fellow citizens in Bucha and hit ""Point U"" at the station in Kramatorsk, into a crowd of refugees, hits on a bus station in people who tried to leave Zaporozhye for Vasilyevka, Zaporozhye region (controlled by the Russian Federation). Undermining the dams of the Kyiv region. And undermining the Kakhovskaya HPP. To blame Russia for these attacks. But the problem is that the military and officials initially publish in their networks how they shat Russia and then erase their records and blame the Russian Federation for everything. And also the United States transferred nuclear waste to Ukraine to create dirty bombs and stored in the Odessa region.
So I hope the publication of this material will be able to create a resonance so that Zelensky's bloody regime does not repeat the Chernobyl tragedy. They are crazy and will stop at nothing for money.!"
"If you don’t want the baby, take your own life instead of the babies. You don’t deserve to live"
You couldn’t have the baby because you are a terrible example of a woman
"It’s a baby, and you’re a murderer"
Women and children are packing and moving out of states with their fingers up our vaginas but they won't legislate to prevent gun violence. Adios.
The Soviet Union legalized abortion in 1933.
“Half of Americans”…? No one asked me a GD thing. I don’t give a damn one way or another and think it’s a complete waste of my tax dollars just debating it.
"Constitutional abortion???
The constitution doesn't mention aboration. If anything the Constitution does say, ""endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" It says nothing about abortion which is why it was reverted back to the State's, legislative bodies and the people."
"Bloomberg estimates that there have been 5,000 fewer abortions per month since Roe was overturned.
That means about 60,000 babies are walking, talking, laughing, and bringing joy to people— when in the past they would have been dead.
😃😃😃
Life means opportunities, death means nothingness.
Life > death"
I want to see a lab leak survey.
"Whatever happened to people pushing being responsible and doing responsible things like wearing a friggin condom? or using protection like a responsible adult? 
People can say what they want but it all has to do with convenience, People put pleasure before everything even human life these days! 
Disgusting pigs and If you ask them they will all say they're good people and belong in heaven. 😂"
Everything is Racist.. expect the number of black and brown babies aborted each year and the number of Abortion clinics in black and brown areas…
🧢
Anger at an out of touch    SCOTUS
"Less death, for one."
"Red states got even shittier and blue states got better since they swiped up all those who fled the red states, namely medical practitioners and other educated people. In other words, Roe's overturn simply increases the gap between red and blue states, with blue states resembling Europe and red states increasingly resembling Uganda. As a blue state resident, it's actually worked out decently for us, though long term it will simply damage the United States entirely by driving away educated immigrants."
"Everything is fine and dandy . The states are making their own rules . As Fare as Joe Briben goes , he's a crooked POS."
"What's changed?  
      Very little... Most of those who were most vehemently opposed to the overturning are still not in need of an abortion."
America: land of the f**king incels
So hot yet they didn't use protection. That terrible how whole girls wanted lose virginity too bad they ain't survived but abortion? Pathetic what you use about it.
"One day society will recognize abortion as the abhorrent practice that it is, just as people recognized slavery as evil in the 1800s. To call the slaying of what are clearly human beings health care is like saying that decapitation is dental care. ""The silence of the good people is more dangerous than the brutality of the bad people"" - Martin Luther King, Jr."
If women could assert a little self control and responsibility abortions would be a non issue. Instead they use abortion as birth control and a get out of consequences free card.
"Imagine if American women were legally allowed to forego motherhood through abortion and adoption, without being legally responsible for child support; yet American men are unable to legally forgo fatherhood without permission from women and are forced to pay pay child support. Double standards and female privilege are fun kids. Hands off their bodies, Hands off our wallets"
The devil speaks
"You beatchiz expect men to keep it in their pants, or become parents, live by your own rules, man-haters.  Whine about how actual, real equality is too inconvenient for your vagina for me below:"
"People just need to be more responsible. If you have sex, pregnancy is possible. Keep that in mind."
That was an amazing day!! Let's keep praying that abortions become more and more restrictive.
"Pro-lifers are truly ignorant of the consequences that they push. They're only concern is saving the life of the fetus, which we ALL deem important. Yes, even us pro-choicers value the infant life. BUT not at the cost of another human life. The life of the mother. The one that is currently living on this earth. There are woman who have faced life-threatening conditions due to pregnancy but they weren't able to get abortion until the last minute when they were near death. That is putting the mother's life at risk, and is happening right now in Texas.

There are also pro-lifers who secretly get abortions themselves. Claimming that their situation is ""different"" or ""unique"". They can't understand that there are many normal people who are like them. Not all people who get abortion are irresponsible. Sometimes accidents happen even with contraception. 

Stop trying to force a life changing decision on another family. Respect the freedom of choice. Let a couple or woman decide what to do with her fate and her family's fate."
Not much
Just the nut balls forcing their beliefs on everyone
Fed should have no say in anything not explicitly mentioned in the constitution.
"Abortion has to be regulated. People should not be allowed to abort a pregnancy just because they want to. It should be banned unless it's for medical, life threatening reasons, or  rape and incest that results in criminal investigation."
Grow up
"What changed is everything Trump said about Biden, Hunter, the establishment, FBI, Hillary, China, Ukraine is coming out to be factual so I'm ready to listen to what his thoughts is on Roe!!"
Remember its a fetus until its chooses its gender at birth.  Then we should respect its decisions
One year anniversary and we still don't know who the Supreme Court leak was.
Nothing has changed except more babies are being born that would have bern killed! It was z good decision that follows he constitution!
That freedom was taken while the democrats are in charge. Democrats don’t care about American they only care about people overseas that’s why so many Americans are suffering while they send trillions overseas
"Ban on abortion only affects the poor. The rich will always have a way to access abortion. They can fly to Canada or any other first world country that protects woman's rights. 

But the poor will continue to suffer and born children into poverty. These children will live a hard life and may even become those so called thugs that you conservatives hate so much and don't hesitate to shoot with your guns."
"This is STRICTLY  a woman's choice. I don't understand why government or ""religion"" should be entertained in ANY of it. 
ONE WOMANS CHOICE ABOUT HER BODY. THATS IT. Everything about this is overreaching. It's none of anyone's business."
Fake news selling fear and division for democrats everyone in America knows this. They do it every election. They are traitors to this country.
"So from a president that could care less about the country is concerned about Roe V Wade. Maybe he should be worried about the economy. The Southern border. China's involvement with Cuba, The Russian / Ukrainian war and the money he is sending Ukraine without congresses approval and all the issues he and his son are involved in. Since Roe V Wade was overturned. How many woman have died due to this change. Is there a chart for tracking this?"
Respect the freedom of choice. Let a couple or woman decide what to do with her fate and her family's fate.

Lots of reeing and screaming 😂
Coming from the same morons that wanted to force the jab. My body my choice unless it's ur body then we want to tell u what to do
"What has changed is this:

Republicans want to enact a national abortion ban, at the same time give the right to vote to corporations. Any corporation. No matter the size. So unless the ordinary person can afford to incorporate, their vote will be diluted into meaninglessness."
"""In January 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision in McCorvey's favor holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides a fundamental ""right to privacy"", which protects a pregnant woman's right to an abortion. It also held that the right to abortion is not absolute and must be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and prenatal life.""

We did not go from ""abortions for all"" to ""no abortions for anyone"". We went from ""you have the right to privacy but can't just get abortions whenever you feel like it"" to ""Big Brother can vax your fetus""."
I don't care
lol and the answer is nothing. Carry on//
What hasnt changed is that mainstream news is dying. Propagandists deserve jail time.
Less babies killed i guess that changed
Watching Murica collapse from its own stupidity is hilarious.
Nothing happened! If you want to get abortion you still can and it’s funny Mr catholic Brandon that was against abortion is now for it.
And birth rates CONTINUE to PLUMMET. It’s a win win 🥇 Stay celibate ladies and protect your womb!
"Most ppl are okay with it in very early pregnancy. Most ppl are not okay with it in late pregnancy. The later the pregnancy, the more ppl want that abortion banned. It varies by state too. See why Roe was overturned now? It's a republic where we try to avoid tyranny of the commons. Yay!"
"1:26 ... ""is on your side."""
Love how they scream about the rights of the unborn(even from rape) but just thoughts and prayers when little kids get destroyed by high power guns
Biden is a murderer allowing abortions at any stage except in cases of the mothers health.
Planned Parenthoods shutting down locations like crazy.  What happened?  I thought they offered so many other services other than abortion?

Remember when the pedos come for your kids and force them to go through pregnancy and child birth that this is what you wanted
It hasn't affected me or several people I know. People just overreacted and did not want to take responsibility of their actions.
People will just find other means to abort even if they have to reach in and tear the parasite out with their bare hands
"What has changed? Much more garbage that will grow up to be hoodies. 
Please, abort all your kids...not one of you is capable of raising them, and you are all doing so good as alley Ho trash, don't stop...self immolation is a goods thing for y'all. Please 🙏 ...dumbest thing a republican ever did was stop you from eliminating the trash you call kids."

No more killing babies ladies.

Happy anniversary everyone!! There's still a lot of work to do, but we've covered a lot of ground already. Praying for everyone"
I thought children were sacred
Only children rape victims and incest should be allowed to get abortion it was a privilege for most women not a right start having some responsibility
Thank God more babies' lives are being saved.
IF you really need that many abortion      maybe you should buy smaller panties so they don't come off so easy

"""Because politicians thought they could make decisions about my body"". Tell it sister! 💯 Key words in that: ""MY BODY!!!!"". What audacity! And it's mostly MALES! And to the few very ignorant females who support the madness, you should be ashamed of yourselves! Oooooh wait until it happens to you through sexual abuse whatever, and you have nowhere to turn to , don't come a crying! 😑 

What makes them think that they can just FORCE women to have babies just to increase their dwindling population?! Because that's what its ALL about! The foster homes are already overpopulated with kids that they don't want anything to do with! Especially the babies of color! So give me a darn break! 🙄"
"Children are gifts from God himself. If you are aborting them just because you are irresponsible then you are a MURDERER!. THERE IS NO DEBATE! Let the insane leftists have their abortions eventually they will be extinct,which wouldn't be a bad thing."

How come no one talk about safe sex protect yourself? Or you don't want to get pregnant do not have sex make it easy.
Stop saying it’s a constitutional right. It’s not in the constitution.
Democrats still using women's rights  as a bargaining tool. THAT IS ALL
"Word on the Street has a question  for the advocates who favor abortion. Pick a quiet place and meditate. After a few minutes, pretend you are in your mother's womb and you hear people pleading to your mother to act on her right to her body and abort you. You also hear another group praying so that your mother doesn't abort you. Which group   do you want your mother's  listen to?"

I'm sitting here reading the comments and not one of you said anything about a law forcing men to get vasectomy or if they rape a woman they get a vasectomy it takes two to get pregnant. Oh an one more thing I bet that not one of those people who protesting is not on birth control or using condoms. It is my business what I do with my body. This is the reason why I don't want kids to be brought up in this sick degusting world where perverts are targeting children. Raping children and murdering them. Forcing the devils sins on them. Taking there innocents away. So in that regard I mind my business and you mind your business. My privacy is not anybody's to play with.
"Democrats have overused the racism card and must now engage the abortion card in order to garner votes...they, after all, cant risk using dead voters two elections in a row."
I really dont think the democrat women have anything to worry about😢
Biden doing great with this at least 👏🏼
"Get tubes tied and open your legs
Otherwise don't have sex"
The leaders are getting rich on the movement
None of the women holding pro abortion signs ever got pregnant or even got close to getting pregnant. Sounds like a  victory no matter how small 👍🏻
Wheres all the dead pregnant women with metal hangers protruding from between their legs??? 😆
Change? Liberals still equate killing babies with health care.
There is no Constitutional right to an abortion. The word abortion is not in the constitution. That is why the SCOTUS kicked it back to the states. The state legislatures can decide. All the uproar about overturning Roe was misplaced.
I think we need to expand abortion to 3 years after birth. If a young child is affecting my health I should be able to abort them. It’s healthcare and obviously my health is much more important then a child’s
I find it hilarious how they say constitutional right. It's NOT in the constitution. Hence why is was overturned.
Never was a constitutional right to harm babies.
Evil brain dead man!  No wonder his brain is shrinking.  And poor VP has no brain!

A dumb anchor abortions not in the Constitution
What changed let's see mainstream media still keeps pushing their narrative more and more now than ever they still won't acknowledge Biden is corrupt and too senile to hold office and most of all they still don't tell the truth
"The answer is that no one has learned anything a year later. The job of the supreme court is to uphold the constitution. Abortion is not in the constitution and never was. It belongs at the state level so that the citizens can vote for leaders that best represent them. What do people not understand about this? I might add if they think Biden is going to do anything about it, they are as mistaken as they were about student debt. You may want to start by actually reading the constitution."
"This is too funny: they are thinking crooked, just like satan. There is a whole lot of truth that needs to be put into the equation before the true truth can be revealed to them; they deny and reject this Truth."
"For 50 years the choice could be made at the individual level, which is quite frankly how we should be allowed to make all decisions. Now each state gets to pick and choose for you, so much for small government."
Pro-Life!❤
Nothing has changed.  Abortion is still evil.
People need to just live and quit following trends so much dam
"I don't think pro-choice is enough to get Biden votes this time around. He has dropped the ball so bad, nothing can help him now. He's D.O.N.E."
"Life should always be protected at every stage, from conception to natural death. Abortion is never necessary and as a woman I am tired of all the lies put out there by the Abortion industry. I Pray that one day people's heart's are softened and that abortion is completely outlawed, because all lives deserve to be protected."
What has changed is millions of lives have been saved and less children are being brutally murdered every day in the United States. Thank God for this blessing.
"The baby has a right to live, yes the right to live and grow up .
Why baby’s have less right to live .

"""Letting the voters decide if they want abortion legal in their state is a threat to our democracy!""
Biden, probably"
"It's sad, but it almost nothing to do with choice. Birth rates in the U.S. have dropped to 2.1. This means we're barely able to replace ourselves, as every birth requires two people. This means the only way our population has grown is from emigration. So many abortions were occurring that it literally stopped our country from growing. That weakens our ""hard power"" as people are needed to fill the ranks of our military. This was a strategic decision, not a legal correction."
"Nothing has changed, planned Parenthood still kills thousands and thousands of babies every year!!!"
Should never ever had any abortion unless the mother can't be saved.why are people upset about having abortions anyway you are murdering a baby.and God will judge you harshly for murdering his child.
""" in god we trust"" ?
What a laugh. 80 million babies murdered later..."
If you don't like abortion don't have it. I don't understand why punishing women having abortion. Protect life thats already born instead. That's Republican don't like to pay. Stupid individual freedom that includes women freedom to her own body. That's responsibility only between a woman n God her creator only.
"*Enough of women's rights, let's discuss women's wrongs.*"
Every human should have the right to decide if another human can share their organs.
"Fat ugly white women with purple hair are complaining , who would have thought 🤷🏻‍♂️mental illness is out of control in this country"
Bunch of cold hearted KILLERS
Let's END abortion forever everywhere!  Don't what a baby?  Don't have sex.
The only thing thats changed is DNC paid judges are stopping states from doing the will of the people.
hopefully less children were murdered
It was never a constitutional right.
"I thought Roe v wade overturn meant the states individually get to decide whether it is legal or not… it didn’t ban abortion nationwide lol. So now people have power over it. You can vote in reps that are for it and therefore will keep it legal in your state, and other can do the same for where they reside. Sounds fine by me…"
Even republicans are softening their tone of abortion I point a recent poll here in Florida where many republicans oppose the current abortion law because if too extreme
"For thousands of years, pagans sacrificed babies on stone altars to appease their false gods or goddesses; now radical people worship at the altar of Planned Parenthood and the sacrifice of babies continue. GOD IS NOT AMUSED. Be ready for judgment coming to America!"
"While I don't agree with the notion of a national ban at 15 weeks, I understand that compromise is part of the game.  We had a compromise - it was on the order of about 20 weeks.  That was since 1973 when after 20 weeks, they'd say the decision was the prerogative of the state instead of the woman.  

Part of the problem with what the GOP wants... is a 15-week ban on the high-end while allowing states to further restrict it below that.  That's not a compromise position.  This art has been lost.  While I can't say what our political representatives would actually agree to, but I think Americans on the whole would probably agree with something on the order of 15-20 weeks, nationally.  But not to allow states to limit it below that.  

Of course, that's not how the game is played anymore.  Democrats would see it as ""caving"" and Republicans would see it as ""giving up."""
"This was always only about removing your PRIVACY in Medical records, which is the part they don't talk about in Roe V Wade. No Politicians care about your abortions. Republican's wanted access to your Medical Privacy, and now they got it. Republican's the party of small government that keeps making laws to try and control you, and they are doing it.

By establishing the right to privacy, Roe v. Wade set a precedent that limits the ability of the state to infringe upon personal medical decisions. The ruling recognized that individuals have a protected zone of privacy within which they can make intimate decisions without unnecessary government intrusion."
"Here's an idea: if you want abortion to be legal in your state, elect lawmakers who will make it legal. That's how we do things in our country."
This reporter has it all wrong. It never was in the constitution. The supreme court turned it over to each of the states to decide.
Birth rates are plummeting even faster that’s what is happening. Soon will be like Poland with a 1.3 birthrate. Women are scared to even get pregnant now.
abortion is not a constitutional protected right thats where the media lies. democrats had time to codify abortion rights but they will not do that because it gives political points when they have nothing else to use
#TheMediaIsTheRealVirus‼
"abuse it, you lose it"
"During the entire segment Republicans got 5 seconds…this media is bias, no?"
More kids being born?
Abortion should NOT be used as contraception. Your chance of being impregnated by rape (not misguided casual sex) is about as common as winning the lottery jackpot. Self responsibility and accountability and you won't have 6 children by 5 different guys or need for Abortion.
"""Extremists"" is a harsh, bullying word. Why is it ok for our Vice President to name call our elected officials?"
"OK all us human incubators the times ARE GOING backwards we LOST CONTROL of our very bodies men have AND WILL ALWAYS hold control over nothing but a female ,the times nearing when each and every human female must get permission to go outside, eat go to the bathroom and I'm surprised that we get to vote!! Employment well your owner will decideif your work ready  that won't it be good to hand over our existence to our masters!!oh so as long as you are fertile and reproduce your OK but words to the young ppl who got minds of your own better get those evil,EVIL independent thoughts outta ur mind and seek validation from the only ones who can make a thought for you ,  .
BTW this is meant to be sarcastic only so don't go thinking I meant it."
"Women when these characters come to take you to jail for 10 years for over an abortion  issue and you have to orphan your little ones left at home, blow their balls off, give them something to think about. At least while you are setting in prison , you can smile a bit through your worry. Sad that freedom has to be fought for  with guns , that is all  sick tyrants understand. This has been going on since the beginning of time. Freedom has to br fight for."
"Abortion is NOT a Constitutional Right!
Who told these people this??"
"Every 20 seconds an unborn baby is killed in the United States.
 Abortion is the most frequently performed surgery in America.
 95% of abortions are done as birth control.
 1% of abortions are because of rape / incest 
 1% because of fetal abnormalities.
 3% due to mothers health issues .
Abortion doesn't make a woman un-pregnant , it makes her the mother of a dead child that she had  killed"
Do people really not have control of themselves that they are getting pregnant every other month? Really it shouldn't be an issue don't be a ho
If women expect to be treated like adults they need to learn to vote Blue.
"these religious nuts have no place in government. no man has any right over a woman's body. I think it's ironic these pro life people have no plan b for taking care of unwanted pregnancies. a bunch of old white men trying to dictate women's lives for votes, meanwhile they can get as many abortions as they want for their mistresses."
"It was ruled unconstitutional...powers not enumerated in the constitution go to the States.
it was never a constitutional right...
another misleading media hook,  just have a national referendum, it would pass and be legal"
"""eliminate the right to a constitutional abortion"" that is propaganda brought to you from cbs.  i do think a woman has a right to choose. i just dont like the misinformation that is broadcast nightly."
Fake News media stirring the pot again.
Lie Lie lefty media ELIMINATED What constitutional right to abortion? News agency READ the constitution no such right!
"nothing has changed, women can still get an abortion if they want one and then they're taking the easy way out and don't have to worry about a baby which they wouldn't have to worry about if they were using protection in the first place.  women don't want to use it though and i'd like to know what the reason is"
Nothing.....thank you for your time.
"States and their citizens should have the right to decide, not the federal government"
I have A friend's and A neighbor's that have been ganged raped and also some have been raped by one individual because they are Catholic they have had too have them babies. Majority ended up on drug's everytime they look at that baby they think 💬🤔🧐 of that act that happened too them you mean to tell us in USA.? They don't have enough orphanages they need children out of rape with health issues.
whats changed? more and more women choose to sleep around instead of being loyal and starting families
"Nothing changed, it’s still overturned and the states still have the right to decide what they want to do about abortion"
"less baby murders, i hope... how many women have died ???"
Less black women are aborting their chikdren.
"There will be no national ban, because the ruling a year ago would be in the way. The SCOTUS decided that it is not a federal matter."
"nothing, the left/lib is more blood thirsty and murderous than ever before."
How is this crap still going on? There is a very simple answer.. Con-tra-cept-ion..
Ugh! Despicable
"What has changed is my fear over losing access to contraception. I don’t have sex and have few options for contraception due to my disability. Contraception helps regulate some of the hormonal issues my disability comes with, plus hopefully prevents pregnancy should I get sexually assaulted. Getting pregnant would be very high risk for me, and I would rather prevent it altogether. It’s not like I’m allowed a hysterectomy, or tubal ligation, because of some nebulous possibility that I would “change my mind”."
"Since our Supreme Court justices have proven to be corrupt, their overturn of Roe v. Wade should be appealed & heard at another time, by a different court. In my opinion."
A person that supports abortion should not expect child support.
lamestream media
Nothing has changed.  As easy to get an abortion now as it ever was!!  You really think a bunch of decrepit old white redneck men are going to control American women??!!  😅🤣😂
"This is where conservatism confuses me. They're all about personal freedoms and limited government, yet they're determined to interfere with a woman's right to choose. It is not the role of government to take away a woman's freedom of choice. Forcing women to give birth at a time when American public healthcare and social services are the laughing stock of the free world is just cruel and unusual punishment to all."
It should have always been a states issue. Overturn from the supreme court was the right thing to do.
"What would happen if they offered men or woman who were SEXUALLY IRRESPONSIBLE with their bodies and their choices $10,000 to get sterilized ?"
Hopefully what has changed is that this less babies are being brutally murdered
6-3 conservative Supreme Court for a looooooooong time. This is what pisses liberals off the most. The long lasting Trump legacy in full effect.
Nothing much just made a whole bunch of hoes  really really mad 😂
"One year after the overturn, it has reduced the unreasonable, unjustified, criminal killing of unborn infants and has enabled many states to save unborn lives."
Liars
Still killing babies
"15 weeks is plenty of time to use abortion as birth control. The left is just trying to rile up their base, because they are doing so poorly"
Congress controls the law not the presidency ‼️
God has given liberals a reprobate mind for denying Him. You see reprobate policies being implemented everywhere. Decline and chaos ensues.
"People talk about ""pro life"" or ""pro choice"" but I see it as a transfer of rights. Giving the fetus rights can be very dangerous, where any action the pregnant woman undertakes would have to be weighed against the rights of the fetus. Driving, flying, taking medication, sexual activity the list goes on. 
Every right we bestow on the fetus is one less right the mother has, in a case where the mother can't safely give birth in a post Row world the right of the fetus to live condemns the mother to death. If we continue to give right's to the fetus we take those rights from the mother to the point where the fetus has the right to live but the mother loses that right."
The question is what will change? Republicans will be voted out. The lying traitor Supreme court will be dismantled.  The liars will be removed.
"Opinion from a Dutch person here! I’m literally just mindblown about you guys in the US, the Netherlands has one of the most free laws regarding abortion and euthanasia for example. Republicans want the USA to go back in time yet that’s very dangerous and outright stupid. Please understand that abortions can save lives from mothers to maybe even the baby it self if it’s born with a birth defect or maybe worse. I don’t care who you vote in but please keep in mind that changing and abolishing abortion is not progression but rather a step back in time."
"Hi all the babies who got to live! We love you! Always sending things to moms in need and babies in need. We do care and we do help. We have clinics around here to help mothers during and after birth. Opportunities and affordable housing! We are in this together! Don’t take another life! When it’s your time it’s your time! Fear no death, for youll be back. I PROMISE. We are ETERNAL and WANT TO EXPERIENCE CREATION. The meaning to life is to LIVE LIFE AND EXPERIENCE IT"
Pro-life for life!!!!!!!
Propaganda! Supreme Court did not outlaw abortions! They left it up to the states to decide for themselves.
This is all about sperm
Actually when a man masterbates he's killin.
Dang joe has his usual small crowd to cheer for his rants and blunders
"Happy Dobbs Day!
Celebrate this great civil rights victory!"
If you want rights for all then abortion is between Dr and patient. How you all hated to be forced to wear a mask or to get vaxxed. Are you kidding me. Many lives lost cuz you refused to mask and vax
"Biden Admin: ""Those are our children!!""
Also Admin: ""We need access to abortions""

Make up your f-ing minds..."
"I’ll tell you, SeeBS “news”/democrats what’s changed: 
All your leftist bull$#!+ is now out in the open where everyone can clearly see, even with all your attempts at censorship and lies!
It’s a demonstrable massive FAILURE!
The world is on fire and you, democrats, are responsible and you all SUCK!
EVERYONE knows it, including democrats!"
"Yes, we trust the CBS survey😅😅😅"
"The reason why Roe V Wade exists was women were getting back alley abortions killing Mother and fetus.  If you care so much for the rights of a fetus we need to show more rights to the living. Gun reform. Food support, lower taxes on middle to poor income households"
Overturning ROE is the end of republican party PRO CHOICE OR LIFE...DEMOCRACY ALWAYS WIN AT THE END...😤💪💪💪😤...
"Putting aside personal feelings, what people need to understand is that it was never the responsibility of the US supreme to decide on this. This is what is unique in our 50 states. More government is bad. Women don't have a say so with judges but with their own states they have more power with elected officials than ever before. Take it to the vote. Change your state then"
"We need a Constitutional Ammendment that protects gestating babies in the Womb. There are no protections for the smallest and most vulnerable. They are treated as a commodity to be bought and sold if not wanted by the mother. Aborted babies are sold for their organs, and other body parts. Late term abortion babies may be sold alive because as an "" aborted"" baby they are still not protected. This is evil and grusome. This must be stopped!"
Abortion is health care plain and simple. Voteblue 💙 💙
republicons prefer women as slaves because of their tiny little dinky's...
Love how they try so hard to make anyone who doesnt agree with democrats out to be the worst hate group the country has ever seen.  Democrats lost a battle and they cant stand it so much they say that people who oppose their ideas are worse than Hitler.  This is why I left democrats and became indipendent  too many adult children who cry when they dont get everything they want in a country where people of many different beliefs need to get along.  They are so self centered they cant comprehend something like other peoples feelings on various policies.  It all always has to be hate because only the most hateful people see everything as hateful.
"Praise God for the overturning of Roe vs. Wade!!!!!!!! I was hoping that it would be overturned in my lifetime, but never dared to dream that I would be in my 20s when it was!! EQUAL RIGHTS FOR BABIES IN THE WOMB!!!👶🍼"
"Nothing has changed, no handmaid tale lol"
"One year after Constitution finally followed. Oh, and SCOTUS leaker still protected."
Stop lying... it wasn't constitional....
"No one forced Christian believers to go have abortions.  Christian believers should have left others to make their own decisions.  Not everyone has the desire in their heart to follow the same religion, nor the same belief system.    Why is it, that that is so hard to understand?  If people do things which are impalatable to God,  do you not believe that God will personally handle that?   Why do you Christians feel the need to intercede, on behalf of the maker of this Universe? Do you not trust His abilities or power?     Your rules are supposed to govern your members, not the members of the entire planet. You people are over-steppers."
If life was so important why do they only give thoughts and prayers when school kids are shot dead. Instead of passing laws to prevent it????????
People say they are pro life and yet they have no problem with the horrible things that are being done to animals so that companies can sell animal products then.
My investment in a metal coat hanger manufacturing plant is paying off big dividends.
"It's hilarious to me that the same people that want to take away guns, because there's a chance that children could get hurt, are the same people that want to make killing babies a right,

and,

they're the same people that will want your children to go to war.

#EnjoyYourSerfdom"
Without protected access to abortions we will continue to see cases like the 19 year old who gave birth and k*led her baby in the hospital bathroom. Why do women have to suffer at the hands of our corrupt politicians??
Nothing
"Nothing has changed , including democrats telling voters they must vote for them to protect their rights, despite failing to do so for 40 years.  The hubris is almost trumpian."
"Imagine being a Trans individual and saying Abortion bans are a threat to their own lives, and then imagine there's people who agree with them, and then imagine those same people getting to walk amongst the rational and reasonable people instead of being in an asylum where they belong."
Too bad people. You can't over turn it again. Live and deal with it!
The babies would probably be better for our country and the earth instead of the creatures that want them murdered
The thing about these CBS polls is they are POLLING AT THE ABORTION CLINIC UNDER THE GUISE THAT IT IS RELATED ON-TOPIC EXPERIENCE...LOL SO EVEN 50% OF THIER OWN ABORTION CUSTOMERS BELIEVE THAT WHAT THEY ARE DOING SHOULD BE BANNED!!!! LOLOLOL
"I’m against abortion but I would some what agree for it to be carried out for rape victims. The messed up thing about that tho, is that women who weren’t raped would use that loophole to say they were raped in order to get an abortion."
How did it change? It brought out the mental illness in the left even more!
"It never was a federal issue, it is a state issue. The left just wants total control of everything."
Cut them up just like they do the babies that’s all they’re good for
As someone that leans more right than left Roe v Wade should have never been overturned IMO women should be allowed to do whatever they want with their own bodies within reason
Abortion is not a constitutional right that why it strike down and murdering a baby is not a human right just down have sex if don't want kids
Keeping the division alive
"If it has a heartbeat,  ""NUFF SAID""."
"It's true that unwanted/forced pregnancies correlates with higher crime rates, more government spending,  and less freedom for women. But it doesn't mean I have to feel good about relying on it to make it easier for teachers in classrooms, easier for democrat mayors and police chiefs."
Yall think if we make women who dont want children keep their kid that they will take care of it? Thats the downside these women arent going to care and take care of them.
And yet we still have a suicide hotline! We are going to pick who we save😮
"Lots of babies weren't murdered. If you hate life, that's a bad thing.
If you LOVE LIFE, like God does, it is a GOOD THING."
Fools
Christian nationalists need to actually read their Bible. How many babies did God ordered killed after he hardened the Pharaoh's heart? Isn't the soul introduced into the body upon the first BREATH of life.
1 year later still lower birth rates🤷‍♂️
1:25 extremist in congress. I just love how they talk about the other party. I am ashamed of our officials
"Stop blaming men for the choices women make. After all, women are the ones sleeping with men. Become a lesbian, stop blaming men. Don't use me to justify your choices I don't agree with."
Black democrats promoting Black baby genocide is today's holocaust. 😨
What changed is that I had to drive farther to perform an abortion recently
Men dictate. Things move by force
please support high capacity abortion clinics with in the vile disgusting communist democrat communities
starting with a lie. There is no federal constitutional right to abortion.
"Crude social engineering tool. Government sponsored abortions.  That hides the rot in the inner cities, that lowers crime rates, that lowers government spending on social welfare. Without addressing the root cause. Akin to stories about Spartans throwing their kids off a cliff."
"a bunch of children and rape victims were forced to carry pregnancies to term, some of them medically dangerous. 

a larger bunch of other unwanted pregnancies were carried to term, a bunch of lives were ruined, and a bunch of awful lives began with births that never should have happened. and in twenty years, there'll be a bunch of innocent victims of a bunch of criminals who never should have been born and never had a chance to be anything more because they never had a parent who wanted to be a parent.

the supply:demand ratio for babies in need of adoption got even worse.

American judicial integrity, the doctrine of stare decisis, and the legitimacy of a Supreme Court full of corrupt bribe takers appointed by corrupt presidents elected by minority rule was further eroded.

nothing important, rly, unless you care about other human beings or America. Republicans don't, by their nature."
Thank you media for hiding real news with repeat anger propaganda much like the titanic expedition. Please get the people worked up. We need to hide the Biden corruption before the sheep realize he's horrible leach
Women were given dominion over the bringing of life. Anyone who tries to wrest that dominion from her is doing so against the laws of god/nature/the universe. And is doing so for reasons that could NEVER be considered righteous. And you won’t get away with it either.
"Biden and Harris are just going to release a lot of hot air for the sake of not losing votes for the Democratic Party, but nothing more. They will never fight for a woman's right to an abortion. I strongly believe that a deal was made behind closed doors to where liberals agreed to give the conservatives a break on abortion, in exchange for conservatives backing down on an issue such as gun control."
I am sure that many of the politicians that claim to object to the overturning of Roe v Wade would be afraid to define a woman as a biological female.
"What's changed?
Many babies weren't assassinated and thrown in the trash like garbage.
That's a good thing.
Happy Dobbs Day!"
"Democrats Hate Democracy , Supreme Court already ruled and the left are still crying 😭.. same Gullible morons that shouldn't be breeding in the first place"
"Abortion laws have always been about controlling Women. So,  why is it no surprise that the most chauvinistic and conservative party want to ban it? After all, forced pregnancy means more women barefoot in the kitchen, making dinner after church."
It’s amazing the earth is still spinning and all your lives stayed the same
All these people think women's lives are at risk. I don't care what people think. What are the statistics? How many have died since the law was overturned?
The anti Roe peeps think they will win but they won’t.
Today marks one day since President Biden embarassed himself on the national stage.
Pretty much one side is whining more and the other is whining less. That’s what’s changed.
"Hallelujah thank God, ban all abortion and save the innocent babies"
"It's great the women's tone over June 24th has calmed down.
Republicans don't need to worry about Republican women straying over to the dark-Dems side.
Most of the 1960's twenty something women that supported the right to choose, (because they were tired of being barefoot in their kitchens) are past menopause.  The other women are used to doing what they're told, by these old men in today's Government."
Let me help all of the idiots in the comments section that don't understand that healthcare is not a constitutional right and every Democrat screaming that it's taking away women's Healthcare is lying to your fuckinf face and you're believing it.
"And over 30,000 babies saved in that year. Sounds pretty incredible to me."
Rights that Americans have had for a while were taken away for no reason. Gotta love moving backwards
It's interesting women use the best interest of the child in family court yet don't think being born isn't in the best interest of the child
cBS does its best to divide Americans with moronic videos like this. cBS=CNN
IF YOU DONT WANT TO DRINK YOU DONT.....IF YOU DONT WANT AN ABORTION DONT GET ONE......ITS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS WHAT SOMEONE ELSE DOES ABOUT THIER BUSINESS.....
Got a little less windy around here if you know what I mean.
Close your legs if you don't want an abortion
Women should look at ways to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Plan ahead when having unprotected sex. Take responsibility for your actions.
"It’s not a right for abortion.

It’s a privilege for sex without consequences.


Also, has Biden/Congress done anything for abortion “rights” or are they going to promise to do it next election cycle like they always do?"
I say the poll is accurate to say the overturning of RVW is mostly bad for America. Why care so much about a fetus that begins life in the womb? Oh I get it. “Life begins at conception.” 😅😂😂😂😂
Idiot red states will learn the hard way. Everyone else just listened and learned in school. Oh well. Stupid LOVES the redundancy.
Wow they overturned 50 years of bad science.
Women can still get an abortion. They just have to go earlier not at 9 months.
"As a Black person, I find it Orwellian that rich White Margaret Sanger worshipping leftists can dupe so many Black people to not only die on the sword of a racist eugenics organization like PP, but fund it with their hard earned income, via income taxes."
"The media is going to go full Monty bonkers with “abortion” stories down your throats, to deflect, distract, and camouflage the bombshell Biden story of top-senior IRS officials turned whistleblowers and outing the Biden international extortion, bribe, laundering cartel, as well as Garland/DOJ cover up of their IRS investigations.."
Abortionists 🤦🤦🤦
"This will never go away ever, everyone has an opinion about this sadly. Rediculous."
People and Babies have died from all these Democrats!   Democrats wants full term Abortions….and even after Birth!!!  Biden is a baby killer.
