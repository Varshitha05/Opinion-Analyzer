"Notwitstanding the evisceration of Roe v. Wade by the reactionary justices on the Supreme-(ly Political Court of the United States, these militant anti-choicers will stop at absolutely nothing until they finally succeed in enshrining the patently odious concept of 'fetal personhood' throughout the American polticial landscape. Should this extraordinarily unfortuante scenario ever become reality, then the United States will definitely cease to be 'the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave.'"
"As an almost 30 year old, I feel bad for all the teens and 19 - 24 year olds that are living with family still (then finally have a kid) and additionally I know the millennials still failing today so people need to shut up. The culture is kind of shit that is all."
Guys use birth control n condom. No need to birth 4 religion n politics
close your legs drunken floozy
why are democrats so stupid
death is death
normal mothers defend their cubs
why do human women want to kill their own? the rest of the universe says no
Why can't these pro-lifers care about kids who are actually alive? Like the kids being killed in schools? Get a job. Stop harassing people outside health clinics. And of course it's all men.

Well maybe you should find out how that happened and do something different. Maybe Keep your Legs Together.
"Fighting for their lives: Women and the impact of abortion restrictions in post-Roe America  ""On the Brink"" Nightline news commentator Diane Sawyer.  Outlawing abortion is insane!!!

"Please keep covering the total disaster of these terrible backfiring ""bans"" and interference in American people's private reproductive health decisions. We the People need to immediately Restore the correct Roe v. Wade decision that is the only legitimate law of the land and only legitimate USA constitution."
Previous conversations especially with high risk mom‚Äôs and viability of a high risk or non viable infant were discussed regarding decisions to carry the infant to term this allowed the mother to decide on what they wanted to do with the pregnancy given just the facts. That discussion can‚Äôt even happen instead we schedule hospice to speak with them to prepare for the unthinkable

"""For You formed my inward parts; You knitted me together in my mother's womb. ‚Ä¶ Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in Your Book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them"" (Psalm 139:13,¬†16)."

Legalized Abortion is also legalized baby killing murder and what we kill we must eat so readily available abortion is also legalized cannibalism. there is a better way celibacy and immaculate conceptions Outer-course which will make Intercourse a interpersonal behavior of the past just like what orthopedic neurosurgeons and psychiatrist are doing"

"Approximately 25,000 children age out of the adoption system every year without ever having found a family.

Take care of the children we ALREADY HAVE , FIRST."
"Im sorry but i just have to say that the young woman who talked about ""bring back the humanity"" by ""allowing"" a woman to bring a pregnancy to term and seeing that child die in her arms... EXCUSE ME?? This is the type of person who needs to experience the cruelty she inflicts on other women."
If the case of rape.its ok to abortion.if the case is used as birthcontrol or just happen because of your lifestyle then its restricted to do abortion.dont you ever think about the baby that breathing in your womb.it could be your bless
Why are conservatives against abortion so much? It's just a bunch of aborted liberals....

It makes sense why women would want one but for men to support abortion means they don't support equality.
"I have what I need stock piled. Including an ear wax removal kit with a camera on the end. I'm not being forced to have a baby. 

A woman who chooses to give birth is a mother. A woman who is forced to give birth is breeding stock. 

And I want to make sure everyone knows that when dr. Bernard helped the 10 yea old from ohio, Indiana attorney general todd rokita went after her for ""violating doctor/ patient confidentiality"" even though she gave no identifying information.

Meaning, when a child becomes pregnant through SA, keep your mouth shut, because republicans want to claim that it ""never happens""

In fact, the govenor of Missouri states that the only time a woman or little girl gets pregnant through SA is if she ""likes it""

It's legal to not have sex
"partnership of murder and enslavement by the government and women, fathers are either forced to pay 18yrs child support thereby creating 18yrs of tax revenue OR the same biased courts allows the mother to murder the fathers unborn son or daughter without his consent. The government get their slaves and labor force and the woman get to do as she wishes. This is what all men should know from a very young age, long before they fall victim to this steaming pile of complete bullüí©."
"Good people defend the innocent. Protect young people. Evil is not pro-life. There is no Abortion Rights debate! It is all made up for Communism Ideology to thrive. (Communist Democrat narratives lie. Communist Democrat characters are above science.) Science tells us when a human life begins. Science tells us Males are biological male, and females are biological female. Pro-life Republican characters stand for truth. Truth is not a cult, despite tyrant elitist Globalist Communist Democrat lies. An elitist scholarly woman in the UK literally said, ""Truth is a Cult."" Communist States give women the right to murder the innocent. Abortion - is a medical procedure to end a human life. Free People are not against abortion. Free People are against murder. Abortion used, as a way, to murder an individual is still murder. Abortion is intended to preserve life via self-defense. Abortion is used to save the mother‚Äôs life in rare medical emergencies."
Abortion has killed more humans in the past 100 years than all of the deaths in all the wars in that time period. That's a fact and disgusting. Abortion is murdering innocent unborn children.
"The fact that these people are forcing their choice on other people explains how backward humanity is. More shocking from that side of the world. Imagine telling a rape victim to carry a pregnancy from rape. God forbid. Like every other draconian and evil laws, it will be overturned one day, no matter how they think they can impose it on people. It's criminal to take away people's choice or make doctors indecisive to determine the best outcome for their patients. Horror God forbid again. Imagine the case of a man that raped his daughter, and you want the daughter to keep a pregnancy she does not want. Only evil people will support this. People should be given a choice to decide with their bodies."

The Roe v Wade reversal was just a step in the right direction. Abortion is a human rights violation. It needs to be illegal.
What is it to Republicans anyways they dont gives two shits once the poorchild is born
"Children are super expensive. Fertilized eggs get stuck in tubes.
Pregnancies stress the body of the woman (like if she has cancer or if overweigh)
If you'd ask a man to be 9 months connected to another man to pump his blood it would be OK if you for any reason needed to disconnect."
Everyone who is even remotely afraid and is able to afford it should get their tubes tied or a similar procedure. Hysterectomy is a bigger operation and has more consequences but I underwent it and recommend similar steps for every woman out there. No need to be afraid after its done.
Proven fact. 100% of people desiring an abortion were never completely aborted themselves.
It's leading to Reich wingers losing elections.
"For what it‚Äôs worth, Abortion was not just legal‚Äîit was a safe, condoned, and practiced procedure in colonial America and common enough to appear in the legal and medical records of the period. Official abortion laws did not appear on the books in the United States until 1821, and abortion before quickening did not become illegal until the 1860s. If a woman living in New England in the 17th or 18th centuries wanted an abortion, no legal, social, or religious force would have stopped her. When the Constitution was written abortion was acceptable,legal, and practiced."
"The media has hoodwinked the public about this law. The U.S. Supreme Court did not ban abortions. They argued that the decisions on abortions had nothing to do with the Constitution, and the SC deal only with laws related to the Constitution. So, they handed the decicion over to State laws, allowing individual State laws to regulate abortions instead of Federal laws. No one has ""banned"" these rights across the entire country unless the American people vote to ban it on the State level.

Why exactly did the Republicans objecting to the Clinton-pushed Roe v. Wade law? The legal objection was to change the term from 9 months to a normal term (around 24 weeks), and then to allow each individual State to determine abortion laws based on local votes. 

And why? Roe v. Wade allowed women to carry a baby to full term, abort it in the last minute right before birth. The truth was that in some states women, for money, became incubators for the Clinton-legalized baby-organ trade carrying babies for 9 months simply so hospitals could profit from the organ trade in the millions. The Rep's argued that this turned abortion into mu_der since the baby was fully conscious at 9 months. Baby organs were openly traded and sold for enormous profits by hospitals - a trade considered illegal in most countries...."

"It's manslaughter biblically actually is murder. Religious people should only pay taxes for what they support. But non religious people can pay for their own taxes and charity. Its up to 12 weeks unless she is dying. Then you just go to prison for killing a new born baby, or I'm out. Id rather have nephilim."
"What is the definition of a Baby? ‚ÄúBaby (noun): a very young child, especially one newly or recently BORN (newborn). 

Abortion is not murder or a baby! you must be born first to become a baby. Facts üíØ"
"What is the definition of born? ‚ÄúBorn (verb): come into existence as a result of birth.‚Äù

What is the definition of birth? ‚ÄúBirth (noun/verb): the emergence of a baby or other young from the body of its mother; the start of life as a physically separate being.‚Äù 

Given all these current definitions, you do not exist before birth. Your life does not start until you are born. You are not a separate being until after birth. 

Set your morals aside from fact, truth, and law. Your personal morals are not the guidelines that everyone needs to follow."
"You gotta be BORN first to be considered a baby. The definition of a baby is: a very young child, especially one newly or recently BORN (newborn). 

You gotta be BORN first to gain citizenship. The 14th Amendment: ‚ÄúAll persons BORN or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.‚Äù

And lastly, you gotta be BORN first to have human rights. ‚ÄúUniversal Declaration of Human Rights - Article 1: All human beings are BORN free and equal in dignity and rights.‚Äù

BORN humans have clear and concise statements in all of our declarations. What‚Äôs not clear are the rights of UNBORN humans. 

The UNBORN might be human beings, but either way - according to our declarations human beings must be BORN to inherit all these rights.

Here‚Äôs a great example of clear language protecting UNBORN humans: 

Ireland‚Äôs 8th Amendment: ‚ÄúTo recognise the equal right to life of the mother and the UNBORN.‚Äù

Without this kind of language in our declarations - unborn rights are not as clear as born rights. Advocating unborn rights will require reinterpretations of current declarations. Implied interpretations do not override what‚Äôs factual and clear: the official definitions of the actual words being used in these declarations. Born rights are clear - Unborn rights must be clear first in order to even debate overturning the rights of the born human carrying the unborn human."
There is NOTHING respectable about the anti abortion folks. You guys didn't even make a nice life for the Roe vs wade baby. All of us adoptees are shortchanged and none of us deserve to have to live with you guys abortion is better.
"The question of whether or not to have an abortion concerns only the mother (and the father, if there is one). Abortion is not something that affects the whole population. It is the responsibility of the mother (and the father, if there is one). It is not like vaccination, where if you are not vaccinated you can put other people at risk. The same goes for gun laws. So the question is, why do you care what other people do with their own lives when it has nothing to do with you? Why do you feel entitled to tell them how to live?"
"It makes me so sick the lack of empathy or humanity people have for mothers who need abortions. Some of them WANT their babies but their told their baby will be born dead. Can someone tell me what is the point of forcing a mother to continue with a pregnancy for a baby that has a 0% chance of being born alive?! I know some religious women want to keep it so it can be baptised, but that's the MOTHER'S choice. Fetal demise is more common than people think. One woman had to wait for the inevitable miscarriage which was very painful. Because she couldn't have an abortion right away (for a baby that was ALWAYS going to die) her chances of having another successful pregnancy had significantly been reduced because her uterus had been damaged. All the abortion law did was reduce her chances of having children."
"Male bears have been known to kill and eat their own cubs. Worse is America.

Go kill a puppy in public. Abortion kills life or no procedure would be needed. Hide from the Truth, child."
"Where does the US Constitution state when one is Worthless?

Science proves once the sperm impregnates the ovum, life is gained. Only an horrid reality can terminate that life.

Define Compassion.

Science proves in Nature what is NATURAL, related to SEX. Reproduction is about another generation."
Killing is killing. That is why abortion is wrong. I state the obvious because people deny the obvious.
Women & girls have the right to choose.
"So worried about ""controlling a woman's body"" but zero concern for dismembering the body of a helpless human being forming on the womb.

"If the mother has the option to opt out of motherhood, so should the father, but people don‚Äôt wanna talk about that!!!"
Okay so woman has the baby and she neglects it....does these people even f ing care!!
"Anyone who really believes abortion is murder and wants to prevent it would support birth control counseling, low cost birth control covered by healthcare, sex education, regardless of age. They would also support Universal prenatal and postnatal healthcare, provide healthcare to children, and support subsidized non-profit high quality daycare.  To give that baby the ‚Äúevery chance at life‚Äù. I have never, ever,  heard any pro-life politician or political spokesperson voice support for any of these measures that would easily prevent millions of abortions."
"I had an abortion. I‚Äôm happy I did it, I would do it again. Obtaining it was stressful and expensive. About three weeks into the pregnancy it seemed like I might not be able to get the procedure in time so I tried to hang myself. I nearly succeeded. My partner got to me in time and in the end I was able to get the abortion. I would have tried to die again if I had been forced to stay pregnant. Some people shouldn‚Äôt be moms, some peoples dna shouldn‚Äôt be passed on. My mental health is trash, my whole family has mental health problems. Why would anyone want to put that on a child?"
God bless America.... at least the people in top had the brian to rule out roe v wade

All doctors and nurse practitioners will be able to prescribe the pregnancy termination pills, and all pharmacies can stock it in a major change to abortion rules in Australia.

All doctors and nurse practitioners will be able to prescribe the pregnancy termination pills, and all pharmacies can stock it as new rules are brought in.

Until now, prescribers and dispensers of the two-part medical abortion treatment needed extra certification or registration, meaning only about 10 per cent of doctors and 30 per cent of pharmacists are currently able to deal with the pill.

But from August 1, restrictions around the MS-2 Step will be removed, in a move the government says will ‚Äúimprove equitable access to healthcare for all Australians‚Äù.

Nurse practitioners ‚Äì who represent about one per cent of nurses ‚Äì will also be able to prescribe the medications under the PBS."

Kids are for life  a debt that a poor person cannot do in his her work life , School and list goes on.

Some parents trapped and no where else to go a bottle/drugs in turn have there parents hating there kids for this. I really would like to know if Kristan Hawkins cannot have kids and hating on the ones that can and cannot afford having a kid in there current state of life ? Its just sickening to hear that a person raped now has to raise the rapist kid wtf"
"I just don't understand how can some of those people twist the idea that you are giving back something to people when you are in fact letting government remove rights, remove freedoms and dictate what women can and cannot do with their own bodies, treating them in such a discriminate way. Yet another step into theocracy.
The brainwashing must be deep for people who cannot feel cognitive dissonance from such a logical contradiction.

And again, the problem with all of these people is that they are preaching rules that don't have the effect they idealize in their heads in reality, because they purposefully remain ignorant and don't look at real life statistics, data, and refuse to listen to what the scientific community is saying.

It's trying to pass laws, applies rules, and see the world according to their uninformed, idealistic and ignorant assumptions rather than working with science and years of recorded history to understand the problem in what they are proposing.

The whole problem of trying to criminalize abortion is that you cannot stop abortion by criminalizing it. We have centuries of history to prove that. It's exactly because no woman in the real world would ever consider an abortion if it wasn't her last choice. No women will even enter an abortion procedure as if it was a choice about walking in the park or not. This ridiculous, demeaning and quite frankly sexist idea that women would go to an abortion clinic like they go to a tanning saloon is just plain idiotic.

And so, it doesn't matter what the law says, if you have someone desperate for an abortion, they will always go with whatever choice that is available. Legal, illegal, safe clinic, back alley, a scientific accredited procedure, or a coat hanger. We all know this, or we should all know this, and trying to turn an eye to this truth is just evil, it seems to me like a trace of sociopathy.
Making abortion legal isn't about more abortions, it's about making the procedure safe, it's about regulating and supervising the procedure properly,  it's about saving lives of women who need this very basic access to healthcare that is being taken away from them by politics and extremism.

A well regulated abortion clinic and practice actually protects women, and in several cases ends up protecting babies too, despite what radicals will say. It creates a web of support that prevents women from being coerced into it by abusive spouses, abusive parents, abusive boyfriends and whatnot. This is an entire whole point that is being lost there.
Illegal clinics won't care about that and won't have proper procedures to prevent those. So not only you are removing choice from women, you are also empowering abusive relationships to end up in abortion cases because you are removing the legality of it which forces the practice to go underground.

The real problem with the pro-life people is misinformation, idealism, and trying to fight an invisible enemy they don't comprehend on purpose."
"Stop having premarital sex, stop having drunk sex, wear a condom, take the pill,  get married first.  These are crazy thoughts right?  (Much easier to do rather than getting an abortion AKA (Killing a defenseless baby) which ends their life, triggers your lifelong guilt, and puts your life/health at extreme risk, like bleeding to death after the procedure, loosing ability to have future children, and std's from extremely risky behavior)  Its like smoking:  The label says don't ""You're harming yourself""  but some do it anyway.  Humans.  Seek God....Who commands, encourages, and promotes loving monogamous, married relationships.  Maybe you avoid having to considering an abortion in the first place."

"But that is the thing medical bills are expensive and insurrection company are not cheap and don't always pay for medical bills like giving birth. So, retail companies love to put children clothing, nappies, formulas and toys up very high. Then you got other bills like gas, electric, water, mortgages, and more like food are expensive enough and that means parents work longer hours for very little pay and skip meals so their children can get, sleep and go to school. 

Also, the number of child abuse is far worse as some people only have children to get benefits and not love, care and be a parent to a child that would love them until that uncaring, and abusive parents kill them. Abortion actually saves lives and dying in their mother's arms is more worse because that is physical abuse to the woman.

I am pro-choice I will accept whatever choice the woman wants. Who are we to listen to someone telling us women what to do with our bodies? My ex-husband told me because he is my husband he can tell me what to do like have seven+ children and to not get a tattoo and ruin my body. Well, it is my body not a man's or anyone else's to do with."

I didn't want to be pregnant anyway, but it would be a nightmare having an unwanted pregnancy now. So I got my tubes taken out."
"Abortion advocates are trying to push for termination up till the point of birth. That means killing a fully formed, healthy baby that can survive outside the womb simply out of spite, there's no justification of excuse for it. They're baby killers and murderers. Women wonder why they have historically been oppressed, it's because everytime they are given rights they eventually push for baby killing and it falls to the men of society and put a stop to their heinous, reprehensible evil actions."
"its pretty simple,  the states where the population wants to reduce access can do.. and the states that want full access can do.. that's pretty much the impact roe v wade has had.."

"My deepest condolences go out to this woman with a miscarriage. No matter what, this is a very difficult time that I‚Äôve walked through with many of my patients. This example is ridiculous though. I‚Äôm a medical doctor and the safest way for a miscarriage to pass is naturally. If this woman is passing the products of conception naturally, this is the best medical option. Mifepristone/misoprostol are the second line treatment options for a pregnancy loss before 12 weeks. Dilation and curettage are third line treatment. This patient had the best outcome after a sad happenstance."

If they want to stop abortions they better offer to raise the babies or give them enough money to raise them. Note that they care about the unborn until it comes out of the vagina then it's your problem. Not having money is a big thing. There are people in the world who have starving children and have to watch them die. Is that humane?
"I appreciate how humanized this news piece has been, but I also want to know the data; have partial or full hysterectomies gone up since the ban? Have women been dying more due to pregnancy complications? Maybe a sharp uptick in new babies being released to the state? Mental health issues? Substance abuse issues? Have women been moving out of these anti-abortion states? If they can't move... Are there underground abortion providers again?

If it be the case that this information is unavailable because these states are not collecting this information, I would think that would be an important thing to add."

"This is not about rape victims! Of course any woman raped should immediately receive drugs that end any potential pregnancy. Incest, of course any girl should be able to end any pregnancy. All other women..really? Sex education. Contraceptive or abstinence. How the hell does any woman get to 3rd trimester and have a right to abort leaving a foetus to die outside the womb. This is not progress, feminism, rights or bodily autonomy. Nope, just disgusting."
"Thanks for highlighting incompetent doctors who should have taken legal advice on what they could have done instead of getting their advice from CNN and thanks BBC for actually reporting it correctly that it wasn't a ""ban on abortion"" (as you did for years) but giving it back to the states which is where laws like this were always held.  If their citizens dont like it - they have to right to vote them out."

Why you turn off the comments on andrew tate video.
"They (BBC) switch off the comment section for Andrew Tate charge video but keep comments on for other videos. See how corrupt the media is in pushing for an agenda they want.

Again these charges against Andrew Tate, there is no evidence; they can't put forth anything as they don't have anything.

"Say abortion is bad but don't invest into child care because that would be socialist.

Yup, its america time!!"
Abortion shouldn‚Äôt be allowed at all. Someone might say if she was raped then you have up to five weeks before the heartbeat starts. If you having irresponsible sexual then don‚Äôt take your irresponsibility to the innocent child. Give away to adoption or foster care if you can‚Äôt take care of them. How can a human being kill their innocent unborn babies. Some people are evil and heartless and should put to death penalty for killing an innocent child in worst way possible.
The problem for the United States is that the Republicans and Democrats contradict each other on abortion and mass shootings. They are extreme in each case.
The way the leftists have brainwashed kids now and disregarded biology completely. They have now lost all creditability in this issue.
"Frankly, no idea why anyone else should be butting in with what a woman does with her *own* body. It‚Äôs her choice. Simply no one else‚Äôs business. Those who bore on about the ‚Äúrights of the unborn‚Äù seem to be overestimating human life. I‚Äôm willing to bet that if you ask 100 people randomly whether they would have wanted to be born (knowing what we do as humans), the vast majority of them would decline the offer. Invariably, it‚Äôs those holy rollers who adhere to primitive scriptures written by men thousands of years ago who cause all the trouble here. It‚Äôs no accident that abortion rights are such a hot topic in the US, a country with an alarmingly high belief in invisible daddies in the sky. Preventing legal access to abortion doesn‚Äôt stop abortions from happening, it just prevents *safe* abortions as women will seek dangerous underground methods if the legal option is denied them. Another thing that‚Äôs always confused me in this debate is how the pro-lifers in the US are oh so keen to ‚Äúprotect the life of the unborn‚Äù by denying legal access to abortion, but are quite free and easy with the lives of the born, and are all for any Tom, Dick or Dirty Harry buying a gun like they‚Äôre buying candy from a store and going out and shooting up a school every other week. Seems like there‚Äôs a contradiction there. Personally, my only issue with abortion is pain. Does the unborn foetus feel pain? On this basis, it should be done as early as possible in the gestation but the bottom line here is simple: it‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs right to choose what she does with her own body."
"First, it is nonsense to suggest that the law never tells people what they can or cannot do with their bodies. In fact, there are many things which people are not legally allowed to do with their bodies. To name just a few, they cannot sell them for sex, or sell their organs to people who need transplants, or put certain drugs into their bodies."
"Pro-life until after it is born. Not pro-life for the women, or the kid after it is born."
"If pro-lifers didn't want to be hypocrites, making abortion illegal should have been their last priority. 
https://youtu.be/JQoSZixSFEw 
Making abortion illegal doesn't stop abortions from happening, it only stops safe abortions from happening. Instead of women going to a doctor to undergo the procedure, women will try to give themselves abortions through unsafe methods. 

Strong sex education classes and easy access to free birth control are the only effective ways of reducing the actual number of abortions. (People won't get abortions if you give them the tools to not get pregnant in the first place.) However, conservative states routinely try to cut back on both of these while still condemning abortion. 

Pro-lifers go on and on about ""saving the life of the child"", but what about the quality of life for that child? Have Pro-lifers improved America's poor foster care systems? Have they fought to provide financial aid to new mothers who can't afford the children that they didn't want because they couldn't afford them? I haven't heard Pro-lifers mention anything about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted children. 

The United States has poor sex education, access to birth control is restricted in one way or another in many parts of the nation, our foster care system has been neglected, and having children will often financially ruin women who didn't want children. 

Yet despite all those issues, Pro-lifers continue to support keeping abortion illegal, which only exacerbates those issues. 

The actions of Pro-lifers (and/or lack of actions) show their true intentions. Pro-lifers don't really care about the children. They only care about punishing women for being sexually active. That is the outcome of making abortion illegal, it will make women suffer. 
They want women to suffer because those women aren't conforming to their ideals and beliefs."
"You at least have the humanity of a child dying in their mothers arms. Bruh. How do you even come to such a awful conclusion. Oh yeah instead of letting an adult/mother decide on their own, let's just decide it's best for that person to have a baby die in their arms."
You do not have the right to murder innocent unborn babies you sick freaks.
Protect the innocent children from these evildoers.
Abortion is Murder.
"Science¬†makes it very clear¬†that preborn children are human beings. It‚Äôs a scientific fact that¬†life begins at fertilization, with the baby having his or her own unique, individual DNA strand, entirely separate from their mother. Within the first trimester alone, the baby has a beating heart, measurable brain waves, unique fingerprints, and the ability to respond to touch."
America has a problem with cause and effect.
And America Thinks its a free Country haha
It astonishes me that a country which still has the death penalty doesn't allowed abortion in any sense for some states.
God this is depressing

"What about the innocents life? Because it is murder. The answer is responsible sex, using contraceptives."
Freedom to people of USA from American democracy...

"Funny, most European countries have had more restrictions than the USA up until now."
"Also, Hollywood needs to stop promoting the wild sex culture that spawns disrespect for women and babies."
"Democrats at to blame here, if they had not pushed the abortion with no restrictions up to birth and no care for born but unwanted babies, the American people would not have wanted to reverse Roe."
"The woman at 6:50 I wonder if she would be happy to carry a pregnancy to term, go through the traumatic experience that is birth for her child to die in her hands. That's such a stupid and entitled statement."
"What these people leave out is if the baby is gonna put the mothers life at risk, is it really worth it for her dying or having severe body damage even if the baby lives."
"The risk is Female led Eugenics. ''I've been pregnant, but i recently discovered that the father wears a toupee...so i no longer want the baby''. ... I think the scales risk being tipped too far in favor of women as to who gets to decide who lives/reproduces and who doesn't. Because the poor/bald/short/black/brown/Ugly/fat, whatever...also have a right to be born safely, and not be aborted, because the irresponsible mother has now decided that she no-longer finds red hair attractive. Indeed It is true that we are all eugenicists to a certain extent, deciding on the characteristics that we want in a baby. But that decision should better be made at the time before a woman decides on whether to go ahead with the sexual act and not after the baby already exists. A human life is not an iphone that you are choosing from a store shelf. Color no longer trendy? No problem! just get another one! Otherwise, why did we fight the Nazis, who had their own national eugenics program that sought to make everyone beautiful, tall, blond, smart and perfectly healthy? In fact, listening to a modern western women's list of requirements for men is eerily like reading Himmler's list of requirements for the SS. Where is the compassion here exactly? The equality? And it is not surprising that the feminist camp are pro abortion, because other than women's rights, it represents ultimate control over men. I dont see them fighting to include men in this important decision making process... Let us see, once men have been reduced to walking sperm receptacles that women can procur from, whether they have the respect for anti-discrimination and tolerance that they say they do, as abortion commercializes human life."
"its not nice to murder a child in the womb, that has to be chopped up to be removed. shame on you"
Gods law is higher whatever wot is wot . Wherever that leads.
"Do anti-abortion men know HOW WOMEN FEEL during their pregnancy and giving birth??? It's unimaginably painful and unpleasant, especially, if a biological father is a rapist!"
"It‚Äôs not the land of the free here, it‚Äôs the land of fascism.

"The problem with taking away women's rights, is that you are opening a door that put us back to past. First it's our rights to our body, next will be our position at work (mostly due to fact of child care but we have been fighting for equality at work for years), after that they will go after the education system for female students... slowly and carefully if we allow them, they will end up putting women ""back in their place"" notice the quotation marks.. because they are too weak and scared of our intelligence"

Hey BBC why aren't you uploading the interview you did with Andrew Tate ?? What's going on ?
"Who Amon you have No Sin Be the One Cast the First Stone.. this is what I remember from the Bible. 
No health situation should be judged by the courts or governments. Plus I can't stand the fact of people outside the clinic or posting comments against others in any situation, especially when they are quoting the Bible or religious beliefs... because if they are very religious as they say then what happened to the Do not judge others, Only God has the Right to Judge, and Most Importantly... Who Among you have NO SIN be the One to Cast the First Stone???"
I'd respect their views if the same people were stood outside care homes and adoption agencies offering support to the babies who have been born. There i said it.
That picture paints a thousand words...

"We're doing great here! It's crazy that women not being able to kill their own fetuses in the womb as some form of petty, primitive birth control stirs so much controversy."
"The pro-choice crowd has had over 30 years to weed out all the ‚Äúunwanted people,‚Äù and no one can argue that they‚Äôve been stingy in carrying out the death sentences. So far, they‚Äôve butchered between 45 and 50 million babies and they continue to kill them at the rate of over 3,000 a day. Meanwhile, we are asked to ignore the fact that, since this holocaust began, America has suffered huge increases in teen pregnancy, homelessness, hunger, welfare, divorce, poverty, child abuse, spousal abuse, deadbeat dads, gangs, illegal drugs, sexually transmitted diseases, high school drop outs, and the list goes on and on."
BBC wants to kill babies
Both sides need to meet in the middle.
Totally unbiased view from the BBC. Abortion is the murder of a child. It is that simple. I can't believe how sick our culture has become that we think murdering children is health care. In the ancient Roman world infant exposure was totally acceptable... So why not also make it legal to murder children outside the womb if we decide we don't want it?
very one sided coverage. No mention about the rights of the unborn babies only the rights of the women.
Infographics like you used sets us back and is why we have a hard time convincing old men what abortions really are.... stop showing full grown babies.
"Baby killers have no place on planet earth

"It' not your body, therefore there shouldn't be a choice to kill an innocent child."
"There should never be an abortion exemption for alleged rape.
It is too easy for a desperate female who ""made a bad decision"" and regrets becoming pregnant to falsely accuse an innocent male of rape so she can gain access to abortion."

"I am pro life,wish I had all five kids."
"If a woman gets raped and has a baby on the way, then carry it until it is borned the put it up for adoption. But in the same aspect if carrying this unborn baby endangers the mother's life then I would agree to having a abortion to save the moms life. But that is the only way I would agree to having one.
Now here comes the kicker, Some women have children that are on welfare in order to keep the money coming into the house. AND a lot of them have no idea who the fathers are.  So the TAXPAYERS again have to support these families for ever. It becomes a way of life for generations of these garbage people. passed on from generation to generation.
I would like to see welfare defunded and make these people get off of their butts and work for a living. OR work for the money they are getting from the government.  It used to be this way back in the 40's and 50's and some of the 60's.   There isn't anything FREE in this world because someone has to pay for it."

"If natural processes aborted, who are we to make things tougher and more unpleasant using the Law? That's just political stupidity America."
"We are ALL a former fetus - and some of us missed being murdered so we could reach adulthood. So when does a fetus start living - immediately. Those evil people who encourage abortion are so deluded they behave like a false god thinking they have the right to decide who lives or dies. They will eagerly stand together to protect a nest of owl eggs, but they have no concern about the precious egg of a human being. Jeremiah 1:5 & John 3:36."
"It‚Äôs not pro-Baby, it‚Äôs anti-women. This takes away the physical and sexual autonomy of women. Contraception can fail, and then it is the woman who has to deal with the consequences. So to be sure, no sex for women in the land of the free (men). Sad‚Ä¶"
"That's a totally, ridiculous, backward medical situation they have there in the good 'ole South of USA. But then their medical healthcare nationwide is a big joke in the Western World."
Just like George Carlin said Republicans only cared when you are still in your mother's womb but once you're born you're on your own. To sum up if you're pre life you're gonna be just fine but pre school then you're definitely f**ked.
Pro choice all day and everyday ‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂ hoping to open my own abortion clinic one day
This is totally false claims. Having a miscarriage is not the same as having an abortion. One is you lost your child. The other is you chose to kill your child. And those medicines and procedures are atill available for those having miscarriages and you are not forced to do it on your own. My life was saved after my last miscarriage bc of these treatments. Killing your baby is wrong bottom line.
"Ladies, if there is a chance for you to leave the state (where your body doesn‚Äôt belong to you), please do. This crazy bigotry is truly dangerous üòè"
"It's not allowing the mother to carry to term, it's forcing the mother to do so. It's being legally required.  It's not compassion, it's oppression."
"These people only care about control. Gun violence is the leading cause of death in children 17 and under. When it comes to sensible gun laws, their attitude is, ‚ÄúF them kids!‚Äù"
Japan is the opposite!! Bad neglect in Japan ÔºÅAbout sexual legal for protect women and childrenÔºÅ
"*Abortion Laws in the U.S. in a nutshell:*

Let's say you go the Wendy's I'm working at and I begin making you a burger. You didn't order the burger, you don't want it, and you refuse to pay for it, but the manager will call the cops and have you locked up if you try to stop the burger from being made for you against your will. When the burger is completed after an agonizingly long time and is given to you, it's rancid and shrivelled, like Marjorie Taylor Greene's box. Completely unacceptable for health code standards or social acceptability, but you have to accept it in this establishment. At McDonalds, you can refuse to have it and terminate the unwanted order, but not here at Wendy's."
"A woman I knew got pregnant, was overjoyed UNTIL the diagnosis of CANCER was made. 
Because abortion was not legally allowed, she DIED, so did her son. 
The family of two girls and her loving husband lost her. 
Is this acceptable when it's obvious that women who are pregnant have such powerful hormone changes CANCER speeds up? Women die? 
My own great-grandmother had an abortion when doctors were so ignorant about reproduction, they had no idea how to help. She died at 93 years old, yes, but couldn't have another pregnancy because it would kill her. 
Laws like these ludicrous versions DON'T stop miscarriages, abortion by natural causes. Nature aborts fetal matter in all mammals. We're mammals."
No more abortion.period .
"It's all about control for bullying Religionist Fundamentalists and RepuGNicans, who ONLY care about ""babies"" BEFORE they are delivered. After birth, babies become ""undeserving financial burdens"", and, ""coercive intrusion"" or not, the mothers ""should have kept their knees together""."
"Medically and legally speaking a 6 week old zygote is not a baby. People calling it a baby are factually incorrect and ignore the can of worms it would open to classify it as such.  This isn't about saving lives, if it were they'd be pro-choice because that in fact saves lives  It also just so happens that in the states that are against abortion, childcare and foster care ranks among the worst in the nation.  The federal SNAP program provides a mere $6 per day in benefits to needy families and Republicans want to cut that down even more including many other federal programs like reduced and free school lunches.  Pro life my ass, pro forcing their own opinion on others.  They've completely taken the right of a women to decide what to do with their own body."
It is pure evil to force a mom to carry to term a baby that will die-holding your child while it struggles for every breath isn‚Äôt righteous.
How many women are putting their lives in danger  having to seek backstreet abortions .  Republicans won't pay a extra cent in tax  to provide services to help raise  the children they forced people to have   .
"While I respect the idea of protecting life, many of the pro-life people are also pro-guns.  What I find confounding and ironic is that these people are more concerned about embroyes than the lives of children and adults."
"I‚Äôm an American and it‚Äôs been so corrupted by those ignorant religious people like that crippled man in the video (crippled probably because he‚Äôs fat and has diabetes, another lovely American symptom)."
Keep the squrty end out.
Just be responsible
"Abortion is genocide, it's no secret why we need foreigners, eh Britain? I know it's you brits causing problems, your empire can suck shit."
"if you dont like it, move somewhere else, i dont see the issue really"
women just want the freedom to kill babies. stop lying
"Force them to have a baby, and then enable anyone to have a gun to kill the child later on. A country gone mad!"
First degree murder unless it's rape there should be no abortion. It's a crime. Just don't have sex or use protection Ffs
"Obviously, BBC News took the far lefts side because they're yucky #fakenews"
"No matter what side of the debate you stand on there needs to be a serious conversation about expanding foster and adoption care services to take care of abuse, neglected or abandoned children."
That‚Äôs ok. We‚Äôll just enter through the back door.
"You are lying: it was never a right and it s not. The right to live is superior and that s the reason, as you know since you are journalists. It¬¥s called Natural Law."
PRO-CHOICE! ‚úä Nobody else's business
"Abortion is every woman's choice across the majority of the world.
Republicans are like Taliban men dictating what subjugated women should do. Land of freedom?
The US constitution has been amended 27 times and is the reason they are called amendments.
