"EXCELLENT for two reasons 1) The Constitution says nothing about DISMEMBERMENT ABORTIONS and these ugly leftists in 1973 simply made it up exactly as they did in the Dredd Scott case where another Dem appointed judge upheld slavery by claiming that the obvious equality provisions of the Constititon did not apply to Blacks as Blacks were ""merely property like a horse is property"". Of course, NOTHING in the Constution mentioned slavery or suggested that Blacks were SLAVES. Rather it guaranteed freedom for al men equality. Leftists like to make crap up that is not there. Ditto for abortion - not mentioned in any sense and the founders knew of abortion and debated it and decided through a vote not to address it one way or the other. 2) it is up to the people to debate the issue and to decide for themselves on a State by State basis wheteher to allow it generally, or in some situations and not others. or in all.

"I am confused i am not an american. Isn.t ametica ment to be a Democracy. But so many people are against thus but have no say, the discion is being made the court. Gaving a abortion ia such a person thing seem like a basic right has been taken from you. They not going raise you kids and help feed it when your broke. They have no idea of the trauma of being raped and having to liturally carry that. If your against abortion fine don t get an abortion but don t push it other people their ife thier choices"

"And a year later abortion rights are being enshrined into state constitutions all over the country. Amazing result for the pro choice side.

The abortion right should be banned . Hello abortion is immoral  and unconditional.  Think about it the first amendment garentees certain inalienable rights the right to justice peace life liberty and the pursuit of happiness how is abortion going to protect the rights of the unborn children and what is the difference between an unborn child and another child or someone who is over 90 so keep your pants up no unwanted baby and for as rape is considered most rape ends with your own body miscarrying anyways

"Right to Life anti-abortionists have just made their entire platform null and void through their willful support of euthanasia. They are now the biggest hypocrites on earth!
Canada has legally murdered hundreds of thousands of seniors, disabled, poor and destitute Canadians through their euthanasia program. Pro-life has not only been outrageously silent about this legalized murder of innocent people, a lot of them actually support it.
The pro-life anti-abortionists have not said one word against these legalized murders proving that they really have zero regard for human life once it‚Äôs born. They don‚Äôt care about children living in abuse or poverty because they‚Äôre born to a mother who neither wants them or can afford them. At no time have they ever supported the women themselves once they give birth to these unwanted children, nor do they care what happens to the children. And now their hypocrisy is blatantly obvious for the entire world to see. Through their silence and apathy, they have fully supported Canada‚Äôs murder (euthanasia) program.
You don‚Äôt get more evil or hypocritical than that!
Anti-abortionists are the original ‚ÄòKaren‚Äôs‚Äô, and every last one of them wants to control women and none of them care about any form of human rights except their own narcissistic control over others!
They absolutely support murdering innocent people, just not unborn fetuses!"
"Some of you folks are sick. Use a condom!!

"This is such dishonest reporting. The right to murder your child wasn't revoked, it was just sent back to the states, per the Constitution. Roe was based on a lie, anyway.

Imagine being red-raced mad over not being able to slut around and murder children without consequence."

not anti or pro abortion. however I do question why is abortion being used as a contraceptive being that there are so many more options available to prevent a pregnancy

A woman can‚Äôt impregnate herself but men will gladly make laws to deny her a choice in decisions about her own body.
It's unbelievable that those against abortion; to the draconian point; seem to be OK with giving their children guns to take to school to murder other children!
#GodblessouNation
Government pushing this pretty hard there probably planning a future war
"I am so sorry and scared with what is happening in the USA over a woman's right to choose if she wants to have a child. We are at a cross roads in society. Populations are declining in socially developed countries and we have been propping up our traditional systems for economic growth through the use of immigration. We are moving towards a point where if we are to continue to grow our economies we need to either tackle the declining birthrate or develop a better system of importing labor, one that benefits both the countries sending and receiving populations.
Our greatest asset in the UK is our knowledge and the amazing systems we have developed to deliver it; our schools, colleges, companies and universities that train our young people. I am a firm believer that by growing our education sector we can solve both these issues.
If you are in the UK, when you vote in your local elections please remember to check you are not voting for a pro-life politician as we do have them in the UK."

"The government is right , remember the first commandment, '' Thou shalt not kill '', that includes your unborn babies ladies. You can't just kill them if you want to, its against God's law...."
"I would like to suggest an enormous class-action law suit to make the supreme court pay child support for the children who are brought into the world under duress and a multitude of challenges for the woman...and usually ONLY the woman.

"On my pack of cigarettes it says ‚Äúsmoking can cause my unborn child to die‚Äù. If anti-abortionists are serious about saving fetuses, then they would also have to treat smokers like criminals. That would mean no more smoking in the red states like Kentucky and Virginia where the tobacco grows.ü§î Just another example of Republican hypocrisy?"
"Good, now girls can learn to close their legs. The next bill should be the removal of child support and the punishment of paternity fraud. Women need to be held accountable and punished for their actions."
"So safe sex is not a thing anymore? Huh. Interesting. Maybe, wait for a real relationship or marriage then have a child. Why are women and men surprised that sex = having a baby! Ignorance is not okay people, neither is killing a life because of the consequence of 'having sex'. Good maybe men and women should be more careful now with whoever they have sex with. I agree with NO ABORTIONS. I'm pro-life ‚ù§"

"The unborn child is alive and deserves the right to live. God doesn't make junk or mistakes. Every child is precious in the eyes of the Lord! Why would we give women more rights than the innocent unborn child. Do you think the unborn doesn't feel pain in the womb. I assure you, they do. I have studied abortion and it's procedures. Do your research, it's not as simple as you think. One procedure puts an instrument into the womb to scramble and kill the baby. During this procedure, it has been observed the baby backing up and trying to move away from the foreign object. The unborn child senses danger and trys to protect himself. I have witnessed doctors telling their horrific abortion stories of removing arms and limbs of the baby. It is barbaric and wrong!"
Praise God! The unborn child is safe!

It‚Äôs americas own fault
Yes hahah finally some good news
"Abortion is murder. I state the obvious because people deny the obvious. Look in detail at: 1) the stages of development of a foetus week by week, and 2) the methods actually used to kill the babies, and you will understand more what it is. There is no right to kill. We don't have a right to kill newborns, for instance. They can be put up for adoption if necessary, but not killed. The same logic should be applied for poor defenceless babies in the mother's womb."
Hope this kids will have a good family

ofc they all have rainbow flags and rainbow hair and cat earsü§£
"Also. Legally and ethical (religion is irrelevant), prolife wanting to ban all abortion is unrealistic.  Although rare, there still exist that abortion is needed to save the mothers life. Why isn't this brought up?"
"What was the reason they turned her away? With trauma, how does abortion help with that?"
"Prochoice would need to prove that keeping abortion is part of the constitution. Since it isn't, you can't re-overturn the decision."
Let‚Äôs see how it does
Doctor's should protect and respect life. Such disgusting doctor to kill innocent lives! Hell for you is welcoming. üò°üò°üò°
I love the song! Jesus loves the little children.
God answered our prayer. Pro-life all the way.
"As a kenyan health worker  I should say in our constitution though it's is unclear when life begins  after conception  in our law's every Kenyan woman is to protect life of the unborn child and will only be carried out if the pregnancy poses a threat to the expectant mother ,here the issue of is not tied with woman's rights because the right to life overides it"
"Americans are so sensitive about abortion but, at the same time, don't care about women and children dying in ""the war on terror."""
"Yes abortions can be said to be right because a pupeteerage and a feeling and an emotion is a invite to have a message be profoundly enforced.
Ex: a outsider of a group or in a group individualized trying to escape an existence is using a person's body( ex:, woman , female, her, she,etc to birth a hopeful continuance suggests an unseen critiquer and a judger and a measurer etc, to enforce a prevention Al mimicking of inbredism and or hazardous breeding so that a starve of simulation of practices suggestive to tribalism, ignorance, deceitful intentful predatorial, and reckless mating , babies being used as weapons against person's families etc.can be stopped, the only person's that would be angry at message posted would be deceitful intenters probably involved in some type of criminal activity.
Also, abortions prevent regrets, second doubts, fear , worry and overpopulation attending and humn slavery , also ,sex slavery and unnecessary not authorized science experimenting , forced choice action of organ stealing etc...Drop the microphone now.. Depopulate"
"Guys, abortion may be illegal soon. If you accidentally get a girl pregnant, make sure she‚Äôs an anti-vaxxer.
Instead of paying for 18 years of child support, you‚Äôll only have to pay for 3."
"America is so funny. They ban their own abortion. I just watched a video about Witchcraft by witches ""shave your head and get in the closet"". I swear they do it on purpose. I'm laughing. They are so stupid."
"Back in the day I had halfway convinced myself that the 10-week-old ""clump of cells"" I aborted wasn't human yet until five years later when my sister said out loud on her deathbed, ""She has a son...I can see his face."" Yeah. God revealed to her the baby I had secretly aborted which opened my eyes to the reality of a fetus's full humanity in the womb from the moment of conception. There are no secrets with God and He will expose them when the time is right.

""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, And before you were born I consecrated you; I have appointed you as a prophet to the nations."" 

Jeremiah 1:5"
But why is it illegal now? I don't understand this decision.
If you cant speak for yourself democrats will kill you.
And it will impact women from poor backgrounds most.Vile.They won‚Äôt care even if these women kill themselves for having to have a child they don‚Äôt want.Doesn‚Äôt sound very pro life to me.

"I  used to work at an abortion clinic and I saw some extremely messed up shit there which is why I'm so anti-abortion now. I remember a 23 year old woman came in 7 months into her pregnancy and said ""I don't want this stupid baby anymore, kill it"" and the doctor said ""okay"" and he put jumper cables up her baby hole and connected them to a car battery and let it run for six days straight. 
After every successful abortion, the doctor would shout ""Take that, Baby"" and  push a red button that made sirens go off and confetti fell from the ceiling and we'd all get Maccy Ds for free."
They want women to have back alley  regardless be nice in our comments
Yeah mistake by the court regardless women are going to have abortions
I wanna hook up but they let it out how they willing to do it. It was awful how they murder unborn kid? I care but most of the wholes guys don't care just whatever privacy from. üôÑ
Great day to be a male adult in this great nation of the USA
They still have the right to have an abortion. They just mad because the federal government isn't paying for it. They need to stop lying. All they did was kick it back to the states to decide. Just like the constitution says it should be. Woman are still in control of their own body. And someone needs to speak up for the unborn human being that some people are okay with killing. Why is it okay to have an express lane to kill babies in the first place? Perhaps we should focus on why that is
I have question if women can abort the baby cause its their will so does that mean men don't have to pay child support this is just question so don't give to me.
"By right to abortion you mean the enshrined right to murder babies. 


Yeah, you're that low"
"by Deatrice Moore, I have to agree with Justice Kavanaugh, it's not about abortion. It's about controlling women, attempting to make them virtuous according to Christian belief and morality. Delegitimizing any and all forms of birth control. Forcing women to engage in sex for reproduction only. Giving men the right to determine family size. Forcing women to be house wives, mother's and home makers only, reducing the ability to seek higher education and employment outside the home. Forcing women to stay in relationships that may be unhealthy for them and the children because they are totally dependent on their husband for support. Decreasing single parent households, thereby increasing the number of traditional families. Read and comprehend the meaning, importance and ramifications of the 1873 Comstock Law which remains on the books, last enforced in 1996, has never been repealed or overturned. It is currently enforceable in 21st century America."
Best solution abstain from sex.
"All this for an unwanted unborn FETUS.. who if survives till fullterm may aswell be dumped in the foster care at birth, just to grow up without a loving parent, a caring family, a protective home,
& Have an underprivileged, poverty-ridden, LONELY childhood.

And even worse, that vulnerable CHILD could be abused, raped & end up getting pregnant by age 10,

Then SHE will be forced to carry the pregnancy even though a 10year old child is mentally & physically unfit to endure pregnancy & childbirth.

The very people who claim to be her 'LIFE'S advocate' before birth, will no be longer  concerned whether she DIES due to pregnancy complications..
because a baby's life in only important in the WOMB & will no longer valuable ever since she takes her very first BREATH in this world.!!!

Sensible people can see how wrong all this is..
There is no point in proclaiming to be a PRO-LIFER if you can't  guarantee a QUALITY LIFE to all the UNWANTED babies that were FORCED to be born due to your decision & irrational beliefs!!!!

Better focus on the welfare of orphans, & children of low income families that are already ALIVE!!!!!"
For anyone who supports abortion is a disgusting human being. Killing the unborn? That's twisted. And using the most lamest excuses for it..!?
"Why American women protest and cry to kill their baby, stop having sex or cut out your whomb geez"

Ok u r taking away this right wht can one do if after giving birth mother decide not to take care of baby nothing then who will suffer baby rather then these rights should be there everyone has to live with human dignity i m not saying this in favour of women i m concern about poor baby
When one of them gets rapped and be told u gotta keep this kid I wanna see what they gone say after that
some used it as birth control.  Sad and wrong.
"So a woman with down syndrome who is either unwilling or unable to care for her child is forced to have it? Zero chance our Repugnican lawmakers will fund social services for the child's care.

We need change and Biden out of the Whitehouse.
"The movie 2001 a space odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion. A space odyssey is a fetus in the womb. The Clint Eastwood dirty Harry movies was angry calm. It seems nasty but it's a good police officer. Angry calm is how a women chooses abortion. 

Everything in motion  makes one error. Your supposed to park the errors where it doesn't matter or you play wack a mole with errors. It's intelligently designed that if you try killing God you will always make one error. A movie is in motion so you have to park the errors where it doesn't matter. 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind. That why HAL computer eye is colored red so it still has artistic integrity.  2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made. It only has one error to park. You can't do better than that."

"Hello, May I share an Old Testament Verse with you from Daniel 7:14 ""And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a Kingdom, that all people, nations, & languages, should SERVE Him; his dominion is an Everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom shall not pass away, and His Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.""  Also, can I share Isaiah 53:5 "" But HE was WOUNDED For our TRANSGRESSIONS, he was BRUISED for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, & with His STRIPES we are HEALED.""
God the Father loves you so much that He sent Holy Sinless Jesus (His Holy Son) to earth to be born of a virgin.Then, to grow up and die on a cross for our sins. He was in the tomb for 3 days, then Father God raised Holy and Sinless Jesus Christ (Y'shua) to Life! He appeared to people and went back to Heaven.  We must receive Sinless Jesus sincerely to be God's child(John 1:12).After we get saved by grace through faith in Christ, if we truly love the Lord Jesus Christ, then we will obey Jesus(John 14:15).  Mark 1:15 ""And saying, the time is fulfilled, & the kingdom of God is at hand: Repent ye, and believe the gospel."" Jesus said in John 14:15 ""If you love Me, keep My commandments. ""There's a real hell. It says in Revelation 21:8 ""But for the cowardly, & unbelieving, & abominable, and murderers, & immoral persons  sorcerers & idolaters & all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire & brimstone..."" Please sincerely receive Holy Jesus and put your true faith and trust in Him today & please repent.  Will you have a Real encounter with Holy Lord Jesus (Y'shua is His Hebrew Name) and stay in a Genuine relationship with Him daily please?"
NO UTERUS NO OPINION 
This is so disgusting. I bet the rich wives of these powerful men wont ever have to worry about this. Pathetic
"Statistics show that countries which prohibit the rights to abort, have higher abortion rates than those who don't. Statistics have also shown that abortion rates are on the decline due to better education and contraception. Making abortion illegal will actually cause it to rise again, among poverty and crime rates. We all want to reduce abortion; nobody wants unwanted pregnancies. Making it illegal is not the answer."

If it isn't right it's not a right.
"If you look up ‚Äúcrisis pregnancy center‚Äù in your area, it will either be an place to kill children (abortion clinic), or a place that gives aide to women in crisis pregnancies (food, diapers, clothing, and in Grand Rapids, someone who will listen to her fears and be there for her). The number of organizations that help women/families with crisis pregnancies is enormous!  Abortion clinics would lose money if their clients were more familiar with them. The Pregnancy Resource Center is one of many in Grand Rapids Michigan, for example.

Abortion clinics make more money when people are afraid, less money when people have hope.

Most people who have abortions will parent differently after their abortion, because of how they have suffered. What a horrible nightmare for millions of women. Some suffer right away, many others suffer later on. Some seem to be fine for decades. Everyone is completely different.

Having an abortion cannot be a nonviolent act.

That means that abortion hurts women. I grieve for all my friends who have had the courage to tell me about their horrific experiences.

Our great-grandmothers would roll over in their graves if they knew we were averaging over 1 million abortions per year in the United States."
"It looks to me like the democrats think that women are irresponsible sex machines. I don't think so, but if you are a irresponsible sex machines....get your tubes tied! There, problem solved! If you're willing to have an abortion, surely, getting your tubes tied solved all abortion problems. If you want a child in the future...untie your tubes."
"Great  ! If your mum had illegal aborted you , pro abortionists , you couldn't be around !. Christian Ronaldo's mum want to abort him but was not successful  !."
"It's insanely funny how these same pro lifers are also pro-guns which are eventually responsible for the deaths of hundreds of children. Like, make it make sense?"
Being pro-life is not about the baby. It's about spreading misogyny and patriarchal propaganda. Look at the way in which these pro lifers talk about women. There's hatred  dripping from their words like they're angry we have any rights.
"Since religions have caused the abortion problem, as women  we should not be letting them take our tax money allowing them to be a non profit organizations. They attacked our liberty. Also, since they entered government, that should disqualify them. We need a tax revolt."
They never think about poor woman cant provide their kids.
"It's time to make being an ace a religion. Women should just takes vows of celibacy and practice total abstinence. They can take care of their needs better by themselves. Let's see how these people feel when they don't get some in the years to come (if they get any at all with how bitter most of them are) Then again, that might just lead to more rape cases. You really can't win if you're a woman huh"
Simple solution.... stop spreading your legs ü¶µüò§
"Jeez, what is wrong with this world...  whatever happened to taking responsibilities for own actions?. You don't need to shout n scream just to get your point across, its unethical... I can understand where both parties, both male and female are coming from. Because once iv been that child inbetween two parents, both squabbling over each other after they split. However it doesn't have to be this way, as you can both have what you want and still be happy. 

For the women: To get men to be more responsible for their children, get them to pay for their kids up until their 18 or after college. Plus this will encourage absent fathers, to bond with their children and take the load of pressure off of you.

For the men: You've got your whole life to yourself, and have your own space without the added stress on top. And you don't have pay for your child when they become an adult, and if you want to be apart of your child's life... then you can, as the offer is still on the table.

And for the young teen parents out there, you can study at home and let your parents bond with their grandchildren... or just let a friend look after them.


And for the people who have been raped or forcefully been sexually assaulted. Contest for DNA profile of the rapist, get them to pay you money for the abuse they have done to your body. As this will allow serial sex offenders to never do it again, as their actions have consequences."
"All these gross comments proves it, women stay away from men.
They dont care and just acuse women to kill kids.

AVOID MEN AND THEN YOI'LL BE HAPPIER AND FREE.

Call me whatever you want for such a comment, men and women so-called pro-lifers are now forcing us against a wall AGAIN.

So drastic measures need to be taken.
Men blame us for everything anyway, one more reason to never have one close to you!
Men says cant trust women, then dont trust men either."
"I cant wrap my head around women actually wanting this.
Skilled women lost due to being forced with having kids, skilled workers, scientist, knowledgeable PEOPLE dying and getting in dept to bring more kids to the world, when we have DIRE and serious lack of space/ressources on earth.

Pro-lifers arent pro life, theyre F insane."
"Was there a ""constitutional right to own a slave"" when slavery was legal?

There never was a ""constitutional right to abortion"" in the US. Abortion was just legal and it obviously shouldn't be as it kills vulnerable human beings."
Sorry Dr. willie Parker.  You‚Äôll have to find somewhere else to kill babies.
God wills it!
"It was Moscow Mitch who made the decision to lie and abuse his power. 1 of 2 of those Supreme Court picks should've been ether Obama's or Bidens. McConnell told Obama it's an election year and he can't pick but got Trumps pick a month before the elections. 
That is a bunch of B.S!"
"And these are the very people who cry and moan when their privacy is invaded, But it's OK for them to go and invade other people's privacy! Unless you plan on paying and raising that kid... Mind your own damn business!
Thanks to these morons, The increase of welfare and other goverment programs are going to go up."
Personally I think men should have the Right to financial abortion its the woman job to make sure she doesn't get pregnant and if man doesn't want the child he shouldn't have to pay for it but I will say some women are simply not strong enough to have kids Women have massive privilege today child birth is now safer than its ever been I would like to know how many abortions are done for medical reasons  or Because the child won't be quite perfect or maybe a  child is to much of inconvenience  Maybe Men will stop doing stuff Because it to much of an inconvenience and then the world will Grind to halt and Women will learn the truth basically you are just along for the ride
"My thoughts on this:
Just keep abortion legal! Women can die from giving birth which is very harmful and they could be young women too. And if a women wants to keep her child, or sacrifice her life for her child she will. It is their life, their child‚Äôs/children‚Äôs‚Äô life so they can do what ever they want. They produced the child, they can decide. What if they get pregnant against their own will and she doesn‚Äôt want to be a mother yet, or too young to give birth? But then again, she could just put the child up for adoption. Just keep it legal."
Show me where it says abortion was ever a right in the constitution.
Don't Murder Your Children.
Elon musk wants more humans..Rest you can understand how capitalists control the government
Because of the dire drop of the birth rate in the US. The government should provide every women with new baby born an 800$ monthly incentives and for every women who doesn't want baby government must encourage her by sending a letter of incentives as a monthly reminder for every married couple to have babies in order to recieve monthly incentives and for every unwanted babies women can deliver them to the government special offices around the country to recieve a huge reward and incentives like the government is buying the unwanted babies.
People need to learn to love and be less selfish and hoes be more responsible instead of being popular rich and fuck around and party all the time. Abortion is a sin
They can take birth control to preventing  rather then Abortion they Suck babie throw      in the toilet
Why is it always the ugliest women protesting for something. Don't you have something good to do
Head should be ‚Äúwomen are responsible for their own actions but they‚Äôre mad about it.‚Äù
This is awful to hell with the rotten anti abortion movement
Oh I really hope this is just the beginning.
The God  is  supreme  .  Everything happens according  to the  The God's  will  .
Murder is murder regardless of what you call it. Bravo on the states that banned this abominable practice! Bravo and blessings to the lawmakers and judges who stood up for life!
This is a dark time for the world.
This is so wrong.They must reverse this decision.Abortion should be made legal.
"Three Supreme Court Judges  who lied during their confirmation Need to be impeached or  fired.  The US does not look after babies after they are born.  Mitch McConnell stated that they don't have enough babies to be adopted out. Three Court judges have made abortion illegal. They want a civil war. They want blood on their streets. These Judges need to step down. They want women to be subservient. They don't want women to have a choice.  BIRTH CONTROL now banned? They want women to not have a say even though they vote.   Now they want to stop transgender, gay people from the legal right to chose. Well there you have it. The US is now a third world country thanks to those Judges and the way the Republican Party has shown what they really care about.  From BC Canada"

"What they want to achive with this ?, Cause it seems like there are enough people in USA."
No right to your body no right to abortion no right to give birth when u want.
All these Christians in the USA saying that abortion is murder and a crime against God. The bible says sin is sin and all sin is equal. Telling a lie  is the same as murder and thinking about murder is the same in God's eyes and commiting it. How many states in America will not allow abortion but still have the death penalty? This is hypocrisy is it not? I hope the government has a plan to put extra funding in to help children as so many more will be living in poverty. I hope they are already starting to make sure their are more good quality foster homes and make adoption more accessible.
"I pray for the unborn babies to have another chance in life... Women are not the only living beings in this world... Unborn babies still deserves to live... If the mother doesn't want the child, just give them away for adoption... The unborn babies have also the rights to live... I understand the pain of women of being raped and not prepared but, abortion is not the only solution... Women are not the only ones suffering... There are innocent children out there being abused for being born from a mistake... Women need to understand that... And no, we do not blame the woman who got pregnant nor guilt-trip of them getting pregnant...  We need to understand the truth that we are not the only ones suffering... The unborn babies are innocent and deserve to live too..."
"Good luck with all the extra babies coming from minorities growing up in poverty....
I bet there will be many new Einsteins and Hawkings coming from there."
Man should really be careful
why are the unborn being denied life how is it that pregnant mothers want to play God and kill what ever baby they want and keep the ones they want  it not moral your mother's it's a life your taking out your own flesh and blood a tiny beautiful baby that could have made you happy but never got a chance cuz mommy killed it may god have mercy on your souls
how can you make a better world out of killing your own children cuz that's what your doing killing murdering your very own children this is not a right no one should have the right to kill use contraceptive and why should tax payers pay for it
abortion is murder.
"They have no business call those bunch of self serving biased freaks a supreme court. Ridiculous how those people even passed the bar exam let alone were given such a privileged position. They don't care at all about the law, they only care about themselves and their personal income. It is a travesty that such an institution could evolve to such a state of anti-social dictatorship. It is not based on any proper values."

We choose what we want to choose for the abortion or not. They will still have children but not to ban the abortion. If there are rapists out there what will it ever happen to them? What are they? How can they take away our freedom? Is it because they allowed to do what they want with us? And try to forces onto us? What will our future be?

The diaphragm is fully developed around this same time of 8 weeks allowing intermittent breathing motions to begin. Anybody who says these functions don't represent a living being is just being wicked. No more excuses for evil behavior and practices. We need to do better as humans,  this is absolutely sickening."

"This country is twisted asf! Women want the right to murder children with impunity and truly believe a father has no voice in her decision. The argument that a woman carries a child so she has all the say  in whether it lives or dies is complete bullshit. It's not just your body if there's another body inside of you.  NOBODY should have the right to just decide on a whim that they can kill a baby. Extreme circumstances,  I get it.  You want to dodge responsibility or don't want a baby with a certain man...GTFOH!  Women actually think that's a right,  it's not.  That wicked ass decision was rightfully reversed.  This place is doomed as it should be."

"Well let me put my 2 cents about pro-life vs abortion. There was the time when arranged marriages were laughed at. It seems that people are now for many reasons  finding out the hard way that current mentality on ""I choose whom I please"", no longer works for many. Perhaps going back to old ways to arranged marriage where by not just you but your parents are also part of the arrangement is probably more morally and religeously right then going about your own way doing anything to please yourself attitude and in the process cause a big political issue not just for americans but many other countries. Do you see where we have deviated now? With arranged marriage parents play pivatol role and strenghen family ties with one another. As well in arranged marriage dignity of female is protected by him before marriage and he becomes responsible before and after marriage. This enforces the rule; marriage before kids, is probably the better way to go about. All I am saying is that we must look down way down to the crux of the issue and not debate on the issue prolife vs abortion whuch is at the surface of all issues because that is ONLY a bandage remedy."

"HOLY BIBLE- 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."
"So glad to see so many logical, moral, decent voices in the comments speaking on behalf of those poor little babies who can't speak up for themselves.

THE ONLY DEVERSTATION IT CAUSES IS THAT IT TAKES AWAY BABIES FROM ADOPTION AGENCIES...
why you carry in the pregnancy if gonna you make aborted?
Shame on you for killing the babies
The fact that these people are so emotionally overwhelmed with happiness about someone's rights being taken away makes me shudder
I was pregnant at 17 a few months before the end of year 12. I was going to have an abortion but actually miscarried the day before. Which was a blessing. Even then I still had guilt. Like it happened because the baby knew I didn‚Äôt want it. But even now I still think I would‚Äôve went through with it. My life would‚Äôve ended. I‚Äôd have no chance at university or any meaningful job. It‚Äôs not something people do lightly. In Australia 12 weeks pregnant is the limit. I couldn‚Äôt believe that abortion was legal up til half way through a pregnancy in America! My god! Like abortion should be legal but not past 12 weeks. That‚Äôs just wrong.
Wow. So glad to live in Australia. Even ectopic pregnancy which causes death is banned. Wow. How many women will choose not to have children? I‚Äôd have been one. I have three kids but I‚Äôd not do it if I lived in America. Death by ectopic pregnancy I don‚Äôt think so.
"Abortion is technically killing someone, if u dont want a baby just use a condom nothing stops u"

"Rights are things humans are given by God. Hence, a government cannot truly give or take away rights, but simply affirm or deny a citizen to exercise those rights that are already inherent.

There has never been, and never will be, a right for anyone to kill an unborn human being in order to end a pregnancy.

However, there has always been a right for human beings, especially the innocent, to live.

We must care for both women and babies. And, we must bring masculinity and fatherhood back.

Love the woman. Love the baby. Love the man.

Love all three."
"The propaganda that a woman's bodily autonomy rights include the right to have her unborn child killed, is the greatest, most nefarious, and most sinister act of what I would call ""the government being a simp,"" in the history of the world.

Because telling women, or anybody, that they can do anything they want, even when those actions harm other people, is an act of pandering to them, illogically and unjustly. And this is what being a simp is.

Women's rights made many good things happen: it was right and just for us to rectify situations such as unequal pay, sexual assault and rape, and other inequalities between men and women. 

However, selling the killing of the unborn as a 'woman's right' is the greatest act  of being a simp conducted by a person or group of people in world history. It is mass deception at its worst."

Abortion shouldn‚Äôt be banned abortion should still be legal under certain circumstances if the baby isn‚Äôt going to survive if the mother can‚Äôt physically have the baby safely if the pregnancy is threatening the mother‚Äôs life or if the pregnancy was the result of rape those are real legitimate reasons for abortion where the mother would actually need it.

"Women should put more effort into preventing unwanted pregnancy. Why don‚Äôt we hear more talk about this??? For all the stress, the cost involved and effort to go to another state- seems to me people ought to be focused more on preventing it in the first place. I see the efforts to create funds to fly women out of state once pregnant- I have yet to see a single effort by the same folks to establish free birth control programs for all those women I hear about who don‚Äôt have access to birth control and/or they can‚Äôt afford to pay for birth control. It‚Äôs always been one of the primary arguments I‚Äôve heard from people defending abortion. So where‚Äôs the efforts to get these women free birth control? Seems to me it would be hugely more cost effective and you‚Äôd reach a lot more women than any effort to fly them to get an abortion. Not to mention aren‚Äôt Democrats all about the green energy agenda? Surely you wouldn‚Äôt want to add to the carbon footprint flying millions of women to their abortions if you could just prevent as many as possible? Preventing pregnancy doesn‚Äôt appear to be a priority. WEIRD."

ahahaha this hapened for a reason that god made so dont get made now because you wanna KILL BABIES whats wrong with people?????
"Maybe some people should at the very least, read our constitution once in their life. before spouting ignorant responses."
"The women who supported the ban of abortion I hope they go through the most difficult hardships of life and raise a child they never wanted ... The child will grow feeling  not loved and not wanted will probably suffer from  malnutrition and might kill their own parents for giving birth to them , oh wait that has happened before in the past.."
"You want to be salty, leftists? Then you should have played the game better. You focused only on Washington, as if that is the be all and end all of politics. You've never been able to do the long game, not like us. You've always put the primacy of what you're feeling over the ability to see the bigger picture. We told you that you'd live to regret it when Harry Reid nuked the judicial filibuster, we warned you, but you did not listen. All that mattered was you wanted something, and there was an obstacle in your way, and you wanted to get rid of the obstacle. But us? We worked for this for *decades.* We played by the rules, elected pro-life Republicans not only on the federal but the state and local level as well, we advanced pro-life judges, we advocated, we used lobbyists to shape and alter policy and frame the debate. We began working at Roe's downfall before the ink on the ruling was even dry. We labored patiently for more than thirty years to bring about this exact moment, and God, is it sweet. 

We played the game of thrones, and we beat you. You hear me, leftists? We *beat* you! You don't like how defeat tastes? Then you should have realized that political influence does not begin and end in the White House. While you were focused on winning the presidency, we swept you out of dozens of state legislatures and governorships. While you were focused on the Supreme Court, we nominated conservative judges to the lower courts, too many to count. It's so funny, watching you open your eyes, seeing your horror at the realization of just how thoroughly you've been outmaneuvered--not just today, but for many, many years. 

And in November, we're going to kick your ass all over again. God willing, there will be a red wave so great it will take you *years* to recover."
"Question for everyone here, I have a neighbor who is pro-life, and since apparently pro-lifers are at war against women I am worried for her safety.

Why are you ALIVE? When is death NOT a promise of your coming?
"The lawyers now need to take this matter to courts as a matter of self-defence. If those central states American bogans want to imply that a woman violated by rape is murdering a child through abortion, or that a woman at risk from death through physical or mental health complications is commiting a murder by protecting herself, then they are forcing this to the next level of evolutionary debate - what is a fetus? The fetus is a parasite, it consumes the woman's food, it makes the woman ill, it tricks the woman's body and mind hormonally, and it can kill the woman by over-growing and squashing the woman's vital organs, THEREFORE the matter of murder by abortion is also a matter of self-defence by abortion. Make no mistake, it is those power abusing churchy bogans that separated the two and created the woman vs fetus discourse by implying murder, and this reasoning now is the consequence."

I don't understand. Do they expect the kids that will be born from that decision to be okay? Like they can't even keep children from abuse. Now they are adding more to the problem.

"When you speak much about speaking on women's right and right to choose, consider these too; 
1.)Like toddler or adolescent, the terms embryo and fetus do not refer to nonhumans, but to humans at particular stages of development.
2) No matter how much better it sounds, ‚Äúterminating a pregnancy‚Äù is still terminating a life.
3) The one-time choice of abortion robs someone else of a lifetime of choices and prevents him from ever exercising his rights."
So it is better to have the baby you dont want. Maybe get depressed and maybe end up killing the child.
"My body my choice what a disgusting quote, in this day and age women who don't want babies should be taking contraception, it's lazy irresponsible females who are literally using abortion as a form of contriception, shame on all of you, to feel its OK to kill your own baby is mind boggling."

All abortionists and those who wanted it should have been aborted by their mothers since it's ok anyway.
"Abortion had become an excuse for immoral sexual acts. It is clearly an act of murder against an innocent hopeless unborn life. It is frightening how great and horrible this killing of unborn babies are. GOD ALMIGHTY'S TRUTH AND JUSTICE REIGNS for trillions of babies murdered in this horrible way,it's selfish and arrogant,no matter how men and women try to make it their human right to kill babies. And fetuses made as beauty condiments.Sickening."

"Calling abortion a ""human right"" is like calling a slavery a form of employement, it's so ridiculously, outlandishly false and awful it shouldn't even be disccused as such."
Where would you be today if your mother had decided to abort your dumbass?  Think about that.
"Banning Abortion, will not stop abortion, it will kill many women because of unsafety methods, children can't give birth they will die on their beds or they will suffer from it. This is a big trauma for all victims. I'm glad living in europe, but it is concerning that young mothers end on streets with their Babies, the spirale will go on, those Babies will get molested, will suffer and have hunger. Who is gonna help them. When women have support and the right age, they will not consider to abort, they will provide their children with love. But how when they are rapevictims, victims of a violent and abusive husbands, boyfriends, poverty. No man should talk about killing Babies. Those men are willing to bring misery into the world. Barely adopt, most of the kids end up in hands of abusive people. USA has so many homeless and poor people. More concerning, I love my country Switzerland we have excellent help and everyone has in our country Health Insurance, for the poor it is covered by our government. Those girls can't not even have a save C-Section.. how they will pay the medical Bills. So much wrong in some states of USA."
"This is bad and good at the same time  imo. People should control having sex before marriage and, use condoms, not creating the mistake to kill an innocent unconscious human and on the other hand feel sorry for poor people and man who will pay for it and women who will take care of it and the children who will grow up Knowing i was not wanted by their parents and sometimes wished to be killed."
"The Republican Supreme Court are rape and incest supporters. I think they are demented. What Amy doesn't get is when they get all they can from her, she will be gone too. Same for the women that support this insane crap. The women in this country are not free. We are disrespected as we always have been since the beginning of mankind. I think Justice Thomas is a dirty old man with too much power and I think the rest of them fit right in there. I had an ancestor that served as justice on the Supreme Court as well as his son. They would be ashamed of this court. Instead of gaining freedoms, we are losing them. I will never understand why little men with little penises think they should be telling everyone else what to do with their lives. They work for us. We pay their wages. There is no place else in this country that the employees tell management what to do. They don't pay our bills or suffer our struggles. These disgusting Republican Justices have no idea what the average person struggles with in this country. They are ignorant of the people they are supposed to serve or they really don't give a damn. Probably the later of the two. We need to vote and get so many we can make abortion part of the Constitution as well as voter rights and marriage equality. We need to outlaw assault weapons so the people in this country are safer."
"Would a woman say: ""Live won today"" , into the face of a woman that got raped. Or a woman that dies if she gets the baby."
Maybe you should be less religious and more human. I can¬¥t believe this is happening in 2022.
Why don't they focus on giving young girls birth controls instead of always fighting over abortion get them all on brake controls and then they won't have this problem
"Good thing these pro abortionist didn't get murdered by their mothers out of inconvenience. Even if it's a product abuse, its not like the kid is the one who abuse you. But im pretty sure majority of these unwanted pregnancy comes from poor judgement between a man and a woman. If you don't want to get pregnant then dont engage in sex. So stop whoring out.

Good for you america for not killing your sons and daughters just because its inconvenient of their lives to raise a kid."

"Approximately 1% of all abortions result in the mother's death

Since 1973 to present 44 million abortions have been performed in the United States.

That's 440, 000 women who have died getting illegal abortion. 

You had the impression it was completely safe right? 

You paid them approximately $1,000 to kill your kid and they killed you and your kid -- your choice?  

Did you even consider the fact that you could die?

Did you consider the fact that they could screw up your uterus?

Did you consider the fact that you will regret that decision to kill your child  for the rest of your life?"

Of course, there are many more reasons on why they could be getting an abortion.

It is a crime against babies in the womb... why? Because it is murdered... you make look good by calling it abortion.

Your body your choice? Which part of the baby did you create? The baby was formed in your womb by the Holy Spirit... good or bad means that got you pregnant. Job 33:4; Jeremiah 1:5; Psalm 100:3

God put the seed in the man... the man put the seed in the woman and the Holy Spirit transform the seed into a babygirl or a baby boy.

6 weeks in the womb... God the Son  breath into the baby nostrils and he or she becomes a living soul the womb.

Complication... is a different situation that could lead to the mother living and God's creation in the womb returning to heaven... 

We all are the seed of God... His image and likeness (Genesis 1:26,27; Genesis 4:25-26

Satan is the greatest deceiver and liar that is destroying the human race. (Revelation 12:9; John 10:10; John 8:44).

BBC used to be a fairly unbiased source of news. There is not now nor has there ever been a ‚Äúconstitutional right to abortion‚Äù the privacy argument doesn‚Äôt stand up to even the smallest amount of legal scrutiny. What happened was a gross over reach by one branch of government was corrected and the issue was turned back over to congress and or state legislatures where it has always belonged. Congress (both houses controlled by the left) has the power to codify Roe but they won‚Äôt because abortions after the third trimester aren‚Äôt as popular as the left would have you believe. If the left had left Mississippi alone in banning abortion after 15 weeks (two weeks later than France BTW) the Supreme Court wouldn‚Äôt have gotten involved. But hey BBC don‚Äôt let facts or information get in the way of your push for on demand abortions up to birth. Personally I‚Äôm going to stick with Bill Clinton on this one ‚Äúsafe, legal and rare‚Äù.

"""It's her body, her choice"", yes it's her body, but so what, every single one of us was once in a woman's body. Using that logic, that would make you your mother's property and she has the right to decide everything concerning you from the moment your born until the day you die! If all your mothers reasoned that way, you ""pro-abortion"" people wouldn't be here commenting your ""rights"" on youtube."

Absolutely disgusting to see people celebrating SCOTUS' anti-democratic act after they lied to Congress and the American people. Women will die because of the anti-life GQP judges. No surprise rapist Brett hates abortion. Black women will suffer the most from this. Truly just another form of white supremacy destroying the USA as they strip rights away from women from rewarding rapists.

To keep the $ Ponzi scheme alive they need a larger population to take on the new debt. To pay off the old Debt and on and on we go. Until now this is THE END OF THE ROAD watch that video to see. I think the abortion law is this reason.

It also sounds like the original law dates back to 1971 too when the Ponzi scheme started when they removed the gold standard. 50yrs ago. Now the population is shrinking and the debt is higher than ever who will pay it off? Stop aborting babies you monsters. 

It makes sense doesn't it.

Search the video END OF THE ROAD that will teach you all you need to know on the currency Ponzi scheme.

"¬´ Woman will die from botched abortions....¬ª she argues that women will die, but children who are murdered, that's okay!"
maybe a strange thing to say but if those people that cant get abortions die cuz of it cant they SEW the pants of the Suprime court? and if a prolifer gets r@ped and ends up prego she'll have to bring the child into the world and destroy there mental health to do that?
Then why not make a law for these pro life people to adopt these unwanted babies and take care of the baby? I mean they are so loving and kind and I know they will make wonderful parents...
"Birth rates are declining in America and have been for  years!! this is much bigger than people's feelings, no children means no future!!!!"
What about if a girl is assaulted? What if a teenage girl is r@ped and gets pregnant and can't afford to care..
"All actions have consequences. To be clear, people have the right to choose. However, if you choose to kill, you will suffer the consequences of that action. The question people need to consider: Is one moment of convenience worth that consequence? Furthermore, if you act on your right to choose to do something, others should have the right to act on their choice to prevent you from doing it or act on their right to choose to punish you for doing it. 

This is why we have laws and why those laws should reflect the highest moral standards of the society they serve. A law that simply protects a right to choose is not moral as morality is something that can be chosen. We can choose to follow the laws, we can choose to be moral, these choices can be arbitrary but like all choices, acting on them have consequences. An arbitrary law will not be just and by default becomes immoral. Law and morality need to be absolute to promote order and deliver justice, without absolute laws and morality, we will have chaos and injustice.

Abortion is not moral because it is both an action and a choice to commit that action. Abortion is in fact immoral because morality will determine that an unborn baby has the right to live just as you or I have the right to live. Therefore If a law protects that choice then the law becomes unjust and ultimately immoral.

This is a bit of logic wordplay and I hope it promotes some critical thought. Feel free to choose to listen to it, or not; but your choice will not change morality no matter how much you seek to justify your actions"
And also this is just a attack on woman as are men still allowed the snip
It's sad
America the new china..come to the uk for them you all welcome
I'm not American but even i can see you guys need to get rid of these bible bashing nutjobs in your country
How would a Baby feel when it grew up and was informed  it was conceived by Violent Rape or Incest?
"Hey prolifer here, we finally got rid of abortions!!! Now we need to execute men who masturbate, I mean we are just protecting one to three lives at a time when we ban abortions, imagine how many more we‚Äôll prevent when we stop ejaculation. Cock rings should be mandatory for all sexual experiences."
"As if I already didn't have enough anxiety about birth control accidentally failing...if I get pregnant I'm still going to abort, no matter what it takes. Ya'll happy now?"
THOU SHALT NOT MURDER!
"How can abortion, which is an act of taking one's life, even be considered as one's right? Abortion is a result of a conscience totally blocked by selfishness."
At this point I wonder what other nations think of America
"For me, this is largely a battle between two extreme groups. Religious fundamentalists on the one side and modern feminists on the other. 

One group is advocating for a complete ban and the other group is demanding abortion on demand. 

I think both groups have something of value to say on this issue. I don't believe the issue is as binary as the protesters make out on both sides. It is for them of course. However, there are options that don't entail either of the extreme positions. Obviously, I am talking about abortion permitted in some cases and not others. 

I would find it difficult to endorse an abortion because a pregnant woman was recently offered a promotion at work and decides to change her mind about the pregnancy so she can earn more money. On the other hand, if a woman who is ill and is going to give birth to a child with profound disabilities I could not condemn their choice to have an abortion. I know these are extreme cases but this is my point. Extreme cases are not common (by definition) but they definitely can happen and probably do - given the size of the population. 

I hope the debate turns away from the two extreme positions to having an ethical and political discussion that acknowledges gray areas and attempts to develop a policy that takes everyone's thinking into account.

Meaningful dialogue is extremely difficult when emotions are so high and people are so certain of their position. It's understandable."
FFS this is awful ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
"If u can't be responsible adult female, don't spread ur legs without protection! The government have the right to protect unborn babies from iresponsible adults."

"SO I CAN HEAR ALL THE RELIGIOUS FOLKS WAVING THEIR GOD AROUND SAYING

BUT MEANWHILE ALL THE DOCTORS ARE AFRAID TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW  THEY'LL GET PERSECUTED BY THE LAW.
  THIS IS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A FIRE UNDER THEIR ASS FROM ALL THE RELIGIOUS TYPES WITH THEIR BIG GOD

TELL ME AGAIN, WHEN DO WE GET TO PERSECUTE ALL THE RELIGIOUS FOLK? THEY GOT THAT CRUCIFIX THING. YOU KNOW THEY'RE INTO IT.

DON'T STOP! 
DON'T STOP!

THE TRUTH IS RELIGIOUS FOKE  WAVE THEIR BIG GOD AROUND WHILE THEY MOLEST CHILDREN.

 DON'T BELIEVE ME,
 LOOK AT ALL THE NEWS REPORTS OF ALL THE PASTORS  MOLESTING CHILDREN. 

IT'S A NEVER-ENDING STREAM. 

THEY'RE ALL A BUNCH OF PEDOPHILES WITH THEIR BIG GOD,  ACCUSING AND PERSECUTING OTHERS."
"In America:

5year punishment for rape 15 year punishment for abortion. They think this law will help the unborn babies. But they are forgetting that until the baby is born it is in the women's body so the Unborn baby is nothing but a part of the women's body, just a fetus. And what about the underage girls dying because they can't bear the pain of labour. Or the women who got raped and needs to abort the child. US is trying it's best to kill women mentally and physically.And toxic men are a biggest part of the problem. As it so easy for men to get off everything. They don't have a fair punishment for rape. Don't want to pay for child support. And they act like they have done nothing,they have not ruined and destroyed the life of women at all. Seems like the Dark age of America has already started and it's time for revolution. Otherwise we can't even imagine the number of women dyingeveryday in America because of emotional and physical pain. And it seems like US will keep making dumb laws until women has no right and freedom at all in US."
This law is worst without abortion ur killing more woman and baby with that law and kids won‚Äôt be abandoned do they want kids to be out on the cold or be in the orphanage America shouldn‚Äôt be like China look how they country turn out with so many people
Better don't get laid
United States of Amerika  keep this up. its fun to see you run in circles. makes us see how good we have it when we see things from you.
They will care about a woman getting abortion but once the child is born they will leave them alone and let them suffer
People that are pro abortions always use rape to defend their arguments. But the truth is abortions are mostly done by women who can't keep their legs close and use protections. Now you be blaming the fetus growing inside of you. Abortions could also weakens the uterus of a woman. This law is clearly to protect women.
"There appear to be about eight states effectively banning abortion, which to me seems absurd. However, many, possibly most states have generally more lenient abortion laws that the UK. Do people really think that it ought to be okay to abort babies, on demand, right up to birth? There appear to be seven states where there is no limit on age of gestation where an abortion can be given on demand. Is it not murder to kill a fetus that is sufficiently developed to survive outside the mother?"
"At the end of the day, a government using your body as a resource without your consent is a human rights violation, end of. This is the government using women as incubators, their autonomy be damned. It‚Äôs a human rights violation. Keep your religion and your faith out of my uterus."
"The thing is women have all the chances in the world to not have a baby. But of course, they make the unborn suffer the consequences of their idiotic decisions."
"What a dehumanising experience for women in the USA :/

"The BBC News does not appear to know US history or US politics concerning this.  Democrats use this issue to garner votes. Obama ran on the promise that he would codify the ruling, then once in office he stated that he had more important issues to deal with.  Larry Elder did a show on this and showed clips of Obama lying and then, after elected, of him giving women the FU finger on the issue.  Larry Elder also showed an old  clip  of Biden when he had a functioning brain. He was surprisingly eloquent and though pro-choice, compassionately stated that more help was needed for sex education, and more so, help was needed to help pregnant women to be willing to give birth and not choose abortion as the answer to an unplanned pregnancy. If Republicans took his stance they would mow down the Left in elections."

Stop killing baby's
"This is so heartbreaking. I'm usually very opinionated on political issues, but I honestly don't know what to believe here. As a woman I understand how terrifying this is, but I'm conflicted. I hate the idea of people using abortion as a method on contraception and it does happen. I also hate the idea of coathanger abortions and women dying. I hate the idea of having to chose between keeping a child that was a result of a traumatic rape and sending your own offspring into an unjust foster system where they're likely to experience hardship and their own trauma. There will be so many more babies, making it harder to find responsible people to adopt them. We need to reform the foster system if this is our new reality. The Jesus loves me people also need to chill, we have freedom of religion and if you pass a law like this it needs to be because you think a fetus is a human, not because you're a religious extremist."
They will want to ban condoms next. Because they are killing sperms that would of made life.
Means you want to just enjoy with no responsibility in the name of Rights. In exceptional circumstances it should be allowed else sustained.
It's  all about control
"The thing is that the free world really needs America right now, and America is at war with itself against these extremist religious zealots trying to impose their unreasonable views on everyone.

Hopefully not regress to the UK and the roots of all this rubbish society? Hopefully it leads the rest of us to see the fruits of basing a society on pillars of greed and vanity, and how like an insidious lie it festers eventually fractures the psyche of a whole civilization to the point they are just at constant war with themselves and can‚Äôt even function to solve the simplest of civic problems once they become apparent - such as not having citizens shooting up children in classrooms for example.

"Something else that has been overlooked & is terribly sad is this decision will cause a wind back to a time where unsafe home abortions & death of babies in horrible ways will be increased to millions, instead of in safe hospital or clinic situations."
"A terribly sad story of forced child birth. 

A member of my family was violently raped & tortured, then she was forced to have the baby by religious anti abortion beliefs. 

It led do decades of sorrow & an abandoned baby. The mother was forced to keep the rapist's baby, but lost her mind from being forced to have the baby. 

The baby grew up to have the genetics & violence of the rapist. The mother could not cope with being forced to have the baby & it had to be given to its grand parents where it grew up to beat them & threaten them constantly with vicious attacks, causing absolute fear, terrible scars & horror for life. It was a shocking situation. 

I dont agree with the vicious way anti abortionists attack women to take away their rights, even though they are trying to give the unborn baby its rights instead. The religious & riches morel beliefs that forced her as a young girl to have this baby under such trauma, are the ones responsible for her terrorizing & ongoing torture, & are more responsible for that baby than she was for being raped as a young girl. She did not want the baby she was forced.

I believe if she had been given the right to choose her own fate over her body, instead of being forced to loose her life from anti abortionists, Instead of a life of sorrow & not being able to ever look at that rapists baby, she was forced to have. She might have had a life instead, perhaps met someone she loved & had her own baby to hold & love instead of being forced to have a rapists baby she was never able to except or love when she was a young broken raped girl, which caused her to never have a relationship or love."

"Wait so what if the pregnancy can risk the mothers life? The issue with this ruling is that there is not in between if you go having sex all around and have a baby without protection shame on you and honestly you should be allowed to have an abortion.

There's a lot of issues with this on both sides and it's kinda sad tbh"

"Do fetuses have the right to life?

The argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong.
I will simply assume, instead of proving, that your murder is seriously wrong.
I will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder.
Finally, I will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issues to which this analysis of abortion ethics may lead.
The symmetries arising from the analysis of the main arguments on both sides of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult.
Consider the following standard argument against abortion: Fetuses are both human and alive. People have the right to life.
Therefore, fetuses have the right to life. Of course, women have the right to control their own body, but the right to life goes beyond a woman's right to control her own body.
Therefore, abortion is wrong.
The fetus' right to life does not include his right to use someone else's body to preserve his life.
However, an opponent of abortion may point out that a woman's right to use her body does not include her right to end someone else's life in order to do what she wants with her body.
In response, one might argue that a pregnant woman's right to control her body is not much, if it is wrong, to take any action that ends the life of the fetus within her.
However, an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus' right to life does not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses.
The consequence of all these symmetries seems to be a stalemate.
But if we have an attitude, then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of rights, a fetal right to life versus a woman's right to control her body.
One could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control one's own body in the case of abortion, because the loss of one's life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control one's own body, a respect for nine months.
Therefore, the right to life prevails over the right to control one's own body and abortion is wrong."

"Amen üôè unbelievable #‚Äôs of aborted children Let‚Äôs mother pregnant in the first place Responsibly Reasonability 
Aware of how to prevent conception"
Peaceful Protests by BABY KILLERS......
MEN SHOULD GET A VASECTOMY TILL THEY DECIDE THEY ARE READY FOR KIDS!!! That should be made standard procedure once abortion is outlawed
"YEAH LETS GOOOOO RUINING PEOPLES LIVES AND CAUSING ADULT DEATHS. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUCK THESE PEOPLES LIVES BECAUSE ITS MuRdEr AND SO WHAT IF IVE NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH IT BUT IT MEEDS TO HE A PERFECT WORLD FOR US STUPID WOMEN IN AMERICA YEEEEEEEEEEEHHAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA









As someone from Britain I find this so funnily stupid on how there ruining young peoples lives and can‚Äôt wait for this to end up like prohibition with alcohol.  Also god damn if someone doesn‚Äôt want to have a baby let them have an abortion and stop doing what YOU want think about what other people think."
Good news. Abortion should be a crime.
"Oh yes a law that needs to be looked over, same sex marriage are you kidding me"
Right to abortion? Care received? So killing your baby is caring for him or her. The BBC is always biased in such matters
"Abortion was prohibited during communist era in Romania and we ended up to have so many orphans kids in our society... And woman can still do abortion themselves at home, which is very dangerous and can led to death. A lot of woman died innocently from husband-spouse blackmailed social relation... Is true that is not moral to abort, but it is the parents sin.. It is not something you can have control over it, better help people do it right at least"
So now there is a definition of a woman? That‚Äôs the most hypocritical response that woman made that the woman is ok being beaten and raped as long as she can have an abortion? Why not help the woman a safe place to stay or take her in.
Praise God.
OK if the governments plan was to create a new type of abortion that is less 'violent' wouldn't they overturn this right after they found that 'less violent way'? Just asking.
"I really cannot overstate how much this both enrages and unnerves me. Enrages because it represents a massive step back for American society that puts millions at risk and unnerves because it sets a very dangerous precedent. If the abortion landmark ruling can be overturned so easily, what of the rulings that solidified contraception, repealed sodomy laws and legalised gay marriage? 

I also find this ruling to be extremely hypocritical. The procedure is called murder, but the children born are at risk of being murdered in their classrooms and there's never any huge reaction prompted to stop that. There is no exception in any case, even if an underage girl gets raped by her grandfather. It will drive women to desperate and potentially fatal methods of abortion where they can no longer access safe and legal procedures. The women forced to bear children they can't care for or don't want, it will affect their mental health. America is regressing before our very eyes and mark my words, it is not going to stop here."
"It makes me sad that pro-abortion people always want to justify there position by saying that if a person is poor, they should not have the right to life.  If a person is disabled, they do not deserve to live, it's too inconvenient to care for them.  Even Joe Biden, what he essentially said is that black babies should only live if there parents are well off.... Do they ever really think about what they are saying?  THE QUALITY OF LIFE SHOULD NOT DETERMINE THE RIGHT TO LIFE!
They always default to rape victims as the silver bullet... Why don't we make the death sentence for the rapist and not let the child pay for the sin of the father...  How quickly will rape be minimized and how empowering would it be for the victims (mother and child) to know that justice have been served.  PRO-LIFE can exercise the death sentence because the violator made there choice and if the God-ordained justice system says death is the consequence for them, so be it.
 The truth of what the pro-abortion people really want is for women to live as undisciplined men who wants to practice promiscuity without consequence.  ""My body, my choice = I want sex without responsibility.  NOT REALITY!  It takes two to have sex and limiting or dare eliminate unnatural abortions will cause men and women to think twice.  If you don't want to have a child with that person, you don't want to have child support, then think twice... that's the choice right there!  
There's a difference between a natural abortion (miscarriage) vs selective (unnatural) abortion.  God gives life and He has the right to take it away... no one else!"
The BBC Don‚Äôt like democracy.

Ok I don‚Äôt like abortions but if it‚Äôs to save a womens life then it should be legal for that case if a little girl was raped it should be legal but A 1 night stand is ur on fault they can go to adoption centers but the little girls and the ones that will lose there life without should have every right to live
in us you have a right to buy a gun but when you are a rape victim or any f.. reason to have an abortion no what a rotten stupid world eeeew
i am not 100% with abortion but what about rape victims and women that they are in danger and giving birth will kill them. shaaaaaaaame
"Its called responsibility!
If you dont want a baby, than have safe sex, and there are many ways ano 2022."
I like how she says anti and pro abortion. not pro life and pro choice that shit is confusing
Stupidity what about the women and young girls that get raped your laws are flawed the new normal All the women are raped so they have to have children from being raped stupidity
"Women should have the right to choose whether they should cancel their pregnancy or not. Making it illegal is going to cause more bad than good. Drugs to kill the baby and damage the mom, unadopted kids crammed in homes, homeless and jobless young adults, kids abused because they were ‚Äúunwanted‚Äù or caused by rape, young teens killed by birth, population spikes, and much MUCH more. This isn‚Äôt a democratic country‚Äôs decision; it should be up to the person."
"In case of rape, ok I get it, but I know some people that do it just cause they don't like using protection and many other reasons other than being responsible, so I think it should be allowed only in special cases not else."
"Hey American people üëã just a reminder. Don‚Äôt worry too much if you can‚Äôt get an abortion. Just be patient cause in your blessed country, you‚Äôll just have to wait a few years until this kid you didn‚Äôt want get shot at school üè´"
"Women should choose if they want to be mothers or not and get professional help if they decide for breaking the pregnancy. Abortions is not murder, abortion is women's right to live their lives how they want and have proper and legal medical help if needed."
I can see how it would be hard for a nation who requires a license to buy a fork to understand making your own decisions.
What do pro lifers think about Arkansas and Michigan banning abortion even if someone has beeen raped
What if a women who‚Äôs been raped requests an abortion but no one believes she‚Äôs been raped even though she has been? Wtf happens to her
It's not a right
Women will die women will die women will die women will die how is life winning? When you have a dead miscarried baby making you septic and the doctors too busy talking to his lawyer to realize youre already dead.
"imagine your daughter gets raped, what then, are you willing to raise the child, your daughter resents, from the father who ruined her life forever?"
"It'll be interesting to watch the blue states. In the past some democrats in Red states have advocated for the mothers right to terminate the child days or weeks after birth. It would be just like them to try to enact this now as a ""we'll show you"".
I'll be watching.
I guess we'll have to call it postpartum abortion."
These pro life people are seriously delusional... I live in South Africa its been legal since apartheid ended and is free in state hospitals I have friends who've had abortions and it saved their lives and mental health.

"USA is truly backwards, old ass people who arent even doctors get to decide over abortion rules. The fact that rape and incest is not a cause for abortion is actually retarded to a level I can't even understand."
thanks be to God...congratulations people in America.
Abortion can not be right in ay way. It is sin
"So, how can you guarantee an unwanted child would live in a well loving family and won't get neglect or face domestic violence that every children shouldn't be facing"
"us supreme court's decision just shows how ridiculous usa is and does live in some other reality. in other words, outside of this world. only totally fools make decisions like that."
BABY LIVES MATTER TOO! IT MAY NOT BE A HAPPY DAY FOR FORNICATORS BUT IT'S A HAPPY DAY FOR BABIES.
"As if the world doesn't have enough people. This will just create more unwanted babies, more resource shortage. Not to mention the medical risks women had to face if they have pregnancy complications."
abortion is equal to a murder of innocent child and every women who commit it should be publicly executed
"I hope miscarriage on these pro lifers. Carry and birth dead babies, then open your big, fat mouth."
"Is there anyone who doesn‚Äôt know that condom does NOT prevent 100% of pregnancy !  What if a woman got pregnant from a hookup should she just accept this result and destroy her own life???????? If u still think abortion is murder, sure, get ready to pay childcare or stop having casual sex."
This is so crazy. People who are against abortion didn‚Äôt win anything but all the people who are now forced to have a baby or  to get an illegal and dangerous abortion lost everything. There are just two options: Control over a uterus by the state or control over a uterus by women themselves. Why do people think the state has a greater right in this??
Close your legs until marriage and this wouldn't be a problem!! 99% just wanna have a fun LOL
"Disingenuous at best, BBC. 

It‚Äôs no longer a federal right, but it can still be approved on a state level as far as I know. So it‚Äôs not ‚Äúbanned‚Äù."
Abortion is murder!!!!
I think this a personal decision that should be left to the individual to make for themselves. Everyone's in different circumstances in life and this could ruin lots of peoples lives. I don't think it's a decision people would make lightly to have an abortion but some people just aren't in the wright place for children. it shouldn't be a crime in my opinion and there probably going through enough without having the added stress of being criminalised by other people who carnt emperthise.
"What if an unmarried young girl gets pregnancy, which may be an obstacle to her career... It means, men have more chances to get benefits from various ways. Am I sure, is this announced from Supreme court of U.S.

Congratulations Supreme Court just did a good job. Abortion is evil and shouldn‚Äôt have been allowed in this country.

Abortion is banned. The states can decide on how to deal with abortion.

My comments are getting deleted by the Politically correct brigade üñïüèªyou
"These dumb a$$ Liberals are still tlking about abortion like it's a ""constitutional right"""
It‚Äôs quite a contradiction - one can never kill a baby outside the womb but can do so  to one in the womb. Does a baby have a right to it‚Äôs own body too. I know it‚Äôs a complicated issue and there are no easy answers when it comes to rape and a mother‚Äôs life is in danger -
In a country where free sex is so rampant. Illegalising abortion may not be the right thing. Atleast make it flexible case by case. And create a culture of family values and less free sex then applying the illegal abortion rule will make sense.
We live in a very bad time were freaks are taking over the world soon men will be able too bear kids
"BBC is LYING to you!! This decision does NOT make abortions illegal in the USA, and I wish that was the case!! This decision merely allows each individual state and the voters decide whether or not abortion is legal or what parameters there will be. Only leftist extremists would argue that states should not decide these issues LOCALLY!"
"Abortion brought the U.S. down on a Communal l level, a Personal level and a Spiritual level. The country has turned from God and killed many potential human lives. This turning from God has caused the plagues prophesied by John the Revelator in the Book of Revelations."
Fake News- it goes back to the state level where it belongs.

No State health car. the right to bear arms. Criminalised abortion. why does one nation want so many of its living citizens to die?
"Pro life advocates are hypocrites.  They care nothing about the lives of innocent children; if they did, they would be out in the streets protesting all the bombs that have been dropped in Iraq__ over 500,000 children killed in that war.

They don't care about innocent lives, they only cheer, fervently, the military's catastrophic, nightmarish policies in the middle east."

So.. Shit isn't a shit until it leaves your arse. Hmmm interesting.
"The ""victory"" being crowed over by the ""life"" brigade (who, if you checked their homes, would all be found to own multiple GUNS) is in fact, the imposition of a religious ideology upon people who do not share their belief system. This, despite the fact that the Bill of Rights explicitly states that the government (Congress) ""shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"". I guess technically it's not Congress forcing us to all live according to one fanatical branch of Christianity's interpretation of a word here & there in the Bible. However, Congress put these bozos into the Supreme Court. Many people do not believe the soul enters the body until birth, and therefore, the foetus is NOT a live human being."
"Why not to split into two countries?abortion and no abortion,holding guns and no guns."

isn't an unborn baby a human life too?!
Good job supreme court. Abortion must be kept to the minimum and only cases of emergency when the woman's life is at risk. I sympathize with women who get raped and end up pregnant. but a fetus is a human being and simply can't be killed because he has no voice
Women who are FOR ABORTION have ALREADY BEEN BORN....
"Women giving Birth was fatal not that long ago‚Ä¶ we have all had it too easy, this is a great advancement to re-establish respect for each other and learning once again to take life seriously."
I feel like the only reason the bans are happening is bc abortion is basically removing a child like is a tumor and some people don‚Äôt like that. I don‚Äôt agree or disagree I‚Äôm neutral
A life‚Äôs a life who gave us the right to decide who lives and who dies..I wouldn‚Äôt want that on my conscience
Use protection :‚Ä¶.The end.
"Right to abortion?!!!
What about children's right to life?!!!"
in Korea we have baby box women put baby in the baby box so baby can live. the pastor take the baby and take care babies.

"US has gone back in time , interms of human rights."
"The laws here in Australia are somewhat different to the us. 
My partner and I have been together 27 years now,from the moment we got together way back when she stated she never wanted kids! She‚Äôs not maternal at all. Anyway after a year being together and her trialling a few different contraceptive pills,she got preggers and she was on the pill! Her decision was easy as it was only 4 weeks and our doctor agreed on the abortion and after all these years we still believe it was the right thing to do as we both never wanted kids. I think that it‚Äôs not selfish but rather responsible as the child would not have been wanted or loved and possibly hand balled to someone else?  So it just goes to show that contraception most certainly is not foolproof. I still think women should have the right to abort within a certain time frame."
Liberals are hurt. Use some burnol.
The 21 year old is terrified because she loves to get smashed without protection lol
It‚Äôs disturbing that not once did they mention that for mothers turned away a child gets to live.
So the Catholic Church now rules even if you are not Catholic!
how about they give all the unwanted children to the judges/ politicians who caused this mess? I'm sure they quickly change their mind if THEY are forced to care for a little human.
"You shouldn't know our recent history, yet all of America is forgetting very recent history. Dem's have had dozens of opportunities to put this in our Constitution. Led by Obama's run up to getting elected a second term where every speech he famously said, ""If elected my very first day in office I will codify abortion"". Then upon winning the immediate reply was, ""It's not on the top of my list of priorities"". I think they never made this a federal law from thinking it would never happen. Also a little over a third strongly oppose abortion, putting of enough they may not be elected. But only they know why.
And nobody should call this group anything but pro-zygote. Now when an expectant woman has a complication she can't go out of state no matter the money. Like a tubular pregnancy, or a zygote dies in the womb. Now a surgeon won't touch her. Pregnancy in America now is a death sentence. Guess there's reasons why no media is reporting these obvious facts and most recent history. The Dems only answer is for us to vote harder. We have! Why haven't you done your job Democrats? Yet all you will hear in any media is it's chump's fault, or blame the Supreme Court and these violent pro-zygote supporters. Just some truth and history nobody mentions because they all have agendas outside truth. Seems we are doomed to keep repeating history. ‚úåÔ∏è&üíï To Everyone!"
Wow what a dick this is trump's fault. Appointing 3 judges who are against abortion
Haha keep crying
BBC you suck ass.
Oh my goooood the right to abortion wasnt struck down they just gave it to the states to decide. How does a official news channel mess that up that badly?
This is absolutely crazy.
Terrifying
"The judges actually appealed to the law to strike down Roe V Wade, not Christian theology or secular morality. The 14th amendment actually does recognise the privacy and individuality of a foetus. And because it‚Äôs not possible to hold a foetus accountable for anything, you cannot justify abortion unless in cases where it‚Äôs not possible to carry to term and survive. 
But I highly doubt any state, no matter how theological they are, will go to this length. The only reason Roe V Wade was struck down is because the people voted on the politicians to do so, and those same people hold a pretty moderate view on the subject. But even then, Roe V Wade was always poorly reasoned."
The most dumbest decision by a so called democratic country ! Just what are the supreme court judges thinking? What if the one affected is thier own? Probably then they will understand and its so important that state and religion remains separate. If mixed then hell will break loose.
"El Salvador's abortion ban: 'I was sent to prison for suffering a miscarriage'
By Will Grant
BBC News, San Salvador, El Salvador"
"criminalising abortion isn‚Äôt going to stop them happening, it‚Äôs going to send them underground. women will start dying because of unsafe procedures or self-induced abortion- and this is the American dream? nevermind the sheer numbers losing their lives because of incredibly painful, life threatening complications when they will no longer have the right to the cure they need. It‚Äôs madness honestly."
crazy bible thumpers.
"They cannot eliminate a fundamental human right! The right of a woman to decide for her life and health is still there! But those 3 ""judges"" could violate and did violate this right! And that is a crime! It's outrageous! But I'm sure it won't last long!"
God had give strength to these judges to do the right choice
So many beautiful babies are killed by their own mother that‚Äôs so sad
"Anti choice people are not pro life , if it was they would take care of the women and the babies once there born . Alot dont they care whelst there in the womb once there out they dont give a toss"
Abortion is murder simple
"I thought that men can get pregnant and we have 64 different genders you can identify with. Can't define what a woman is. Now when Roe vs. Wade was overturned...all of a sudden the term "" woman"" is alive and well again. Abortion is just plain murder of a human being. In California...if you shot and killed a pregnant woman... it's considered double murder. How about if that woman is getting an abortion when she got murdered????"
thanks President Trump
It's good news for me to see that America's freedom is killing children
Not sure where in the constitution it says  abortion is  a right? Maybe under privacy but that is a reach. Passing a bill will be more efficient way of making this a law. Obama had a super majority in 2009 and did not wish to pas the law.
"Let them get as many abortions as they want. In fact, speed it up. It's exactly the kind of people I wish didn't exist."
"If a man cant get pregnant how come they are there  protesting.    Oh yeah, its only men who disagree with you that are bad."
Rights to kill babies overturned
America. Where if you get raped you are forced to have that baby just to raise it up and send them to a school to be  Massacred.. backwards ass country.
"Wow ....imagine a civilised democracy outlawing child murder ....
Disgusting ...lol"
"Its not just about abortion,,what triggers me is how easily they can come up with their own decisions on women's body"
"In plain English, those imagery rights conjured out of the 14th and 9th Amendments by political courts instead of doing them the right way via the Congress and Amendments are now in jeopardy.  The learning point is do it the right way and a Supreme Court that follows the Constitution will not be able pop your balloon. Maybe the BBC will understand this language. Perhaps someone at the BBC could obtain a copy of the United States Constitution? The decision on abortions will now return to the States and the people of those States who elect their representatives, where it has always belonged until a rogue Court changed that in the 1970's. That has now been fixed. It is amazing the number of uninformed people making fools of themselves showing their lack of basic understanding of the Constitution of the United States. Least we forget the largest abortion business in America was founded by a racist whose aim was the elimination of those ""weeds"" as she put it of the human race, i.e.  blacks, Asians and anyone not white. Margaret Sanger was a racist. Funny how most of the abortion clinics were placed in black communities as was most of the babies killed. That does not get mentioned as much in the videos."
Americans are really dramatic.....they are protesting to be allowed to kill innocent children that they split their legs very joyfully for...wtf these clowns always amuse me
If it‚Äôs life risk for the mom then ok but otherwise use condoms
"this small devil woman is still in favor of abortion not knowing how evil abortion is, shedding of blood, maybe shedding of blood is what pleases the devil, but i pray that that ruling must permanently in America, small nation will also follow suit to ban abortion at all costs"

"absolute rubbish, BBC  lies again . you believe a baby aborted at 8.5 months is good .  madness!!!        give the facts , explain  the case to the viewers .   shameful"
what happened to separating church and state? to all the people bringing religon bs into this
The death rate of women and newborns in states that have banned abortion has risen.  This means there will be more orphans.  This is just insanity for which there is no explanation.
"Ignorant, narrow minded people applauding this ruling."
"In the USA, you have the right to hunt. Imagine if PETA has such a great campaign that they convinced a huge number of people in the USA that hunting was a sin -- evil. Killing animals is a sin. Having guns to kill animals is a sin. So the supreme court sees the arguments and agrees. Killing animals -- especially animals that are not even predators, should be made illegal in the USA. So this ruling comes down. Now ... you are a gun owner, and you can shoot at little targets of people or animals, but it would be absolutely ILLEGAL to actually shoot an animal with your gun. Anyone doing that has committed animal murder and thus should be arrested with their gun confiscated. If your religion has you believing that this is sin, then you might be able to get that law passed in a sort of sneaky way where your supreme court judges LIE about past precedent about hunting. Watch Powder. Good movie."
6 political appointees affected the right to decide what a woman has the right to do with her own body. 6 people decided the rights of 340 million people. This has to change.
This is pathetic... I mean goodness gracious this stupid country just keeps making mistake after mistake... I feel like now is a good time to leave before something terrible happens...
It's OK if you don't like abortion. But your feelings can't decide others rights to abortion. That's it.
Those people who are anti-abortion are deranged and mentally unstable. This country is fkced up. Note that reasonable Christmas are pro choice.
Abortion in not right it‚Äôs murder

Abortionists are extreme egotists
"Them:Guns should be banned!
Us:Killing babies should be banned too!
Them: wait what!??
Us: we can play this game too"
to all the dumbasses the law clearly stats its up to the state to decide for example if she was a rape victim and dosent want a rape child they can allow her to have an abortion.
Any you fuchtards ever think about wearing a condom or being on birth control? You all about the dumbest people ever.
They  slay their baby's in the belly just like the Bible said
Best decision in 50 yrs
Abortion=kill. Replace the word Abortion with kill and listen to what she us saying.

I'm pro-Theresa who hemorrhaged due to a placental abruption, causing her parents, spouse, and children to have to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or her unborn child.
I'm pro-little Cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11-year-old body isn't mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal.
I'm pro-Melissa who's working two jobs just to make ends meet and has to choose between bringing another child into poverty or feeding the children she already has because her spouse walked out on her.
I'm pro-Brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially, emotionally, or physically able to raise a child.
I'm pro-Emily who went through IVF, ending up with SIX viable implanted eggs requiring selective reduction to ensure the safety of her and a SAFE number of fetuses.

Not every women  deserves to be allowed to have abortion! Some women need to take responsibility of their actions cause it‚Äôs not right to sleep around and to have one after another abortion. In cases of emergency and rape yes it‚Äôs okay. But when women ‚Äúkeep‚Äù making same choices without thinking the consequences then they should definitely deal with the result that comes with the choices they make! No child deserves to die. It‚Äôs just so selfish and these women keep making same ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù again and again without concern of innocent children involved! No one has right to end another life with their foolish choices!
Abortion is not a reproductive right since reproduction has already taken place.ü§£
"Keep those draws on ladies! No more casual sex! No more do overs! You break it you buy it! Think twice before you do it! 
Abortion should be for rape, kids and incest victims! Not for irresponsible women who live their lives with their legs open for every Tom, Dick and Hank! Keep those legs closed and those panties on! 
It's not just the man's fault! A woman will only allow concessions to a man when she wants him to have it! Rape is something totally different so don't go screaming rape and blaming him for every damn thing when you allowed him to enter your home, take you to the hotel, make out with you in the car, and finger bang you! This Supreme Court ruling is a wake up call for those from both sexes who can't keep their draws on and their dicks in their PANTS!!!"
"congrats to the US. there will  be a lot of women, especially teenage girls, suffering thanks to these irresponsible idealists imposing their believes on others."

"The US is one of the few nations who are not facing the population bomb. China, and Russia are imploding because they don't have any young people. This is a real problem for many nations. Nations who let abortion rule the day, are literally running out of enough young people, to run their nation. People are an asset to any nation. When a nation's old people, out number the young, it is literally dying. The immorality of abortion has a high price."

How would an abortion stop someone from beating someone else up?
suiiiii
I would love to see the same outpouring of feeling against the death penalty
"So, basically in America, women have rights but not to their bodies. Am I hearing that right because the reason England made it legal to stop illegal underground abortions which resulted in more women dying then the foetus she was carrying and some women were unable to have children after those illegal abortions. The results were this 25% lived and could still have children. 25% lost the ability to have children and finally 50% died from underground abortions. Men realise most of the time they didn't want to use condoms and it was blamed on the woman for ""getting pregnant"" the amount of teenage pregnancies in America is higher than the UK. America is 52/1000 teenagers are still in high school pregnant age 16 years old when in England it's 32/1000 teenagers are still in high school pregnant age 15 to 16 years old. Some people can't afford children because retail shopping markets get profit for buggies, children clothing, nappies or diapers for Americans, cots, mosses baskets, baby milk and toys. The list can go on. There is enough people in America. In fact there is 329.5¬†million people living in the USA.¬†

Also, the amount of children abuse by parents that never wanted them in the first place. That is cruel thing to do to them and abortions can stop child abuse.¬†There were 4.1 million reports of child maltreatment in the United States involving¬†

7.753¬†billion people on the planet I think we are good. Well, Americans are slowly shooting children and themselves to death with their gun laws."
Well I don't think most people care about anybody in this country

It's all because of the people Trump appointed to the court.

"None of us walking this earth at this moment if we had been aborted. Are you not happy and grateful that you got have the gift of life?

Abortion is murder."
Its called being responsible.....to easy just to end a life......not quite the same but its like to easy to marry and divorce these days.
IT is time for all republicans and liberals' to get read of your republican representatives this is because you republicans dint do your job and got read of your representatives that are not doing what is best for but for them self's when the time comes show them what will happen  if they go against the peoples wishes your vote. will let those republicans by daring the swamp.

"The byproducts of left wing human waste is: dead unborn child, trans women's breasts, and trans male penises. They are a strange breed."
Nice to see another totally misleading headline from the BBC
You are liars! Your title is a lie. Abortion was sent back to the states and the the people of each state.
"Just make a Law.  No one is allowed to have children without a licence .  Requirements no welfare, no bipolar allowed, no mental person eather.  YOu must make income and have a job.   Lets see if these things start chanting to for children now instead. or have a blue screen of death."
"This world....!! Stumped at the need for more gun constraints but no issue banning the constitutional right for women to CHOOSE to abort their babies!  Women are upset (as they should be,) but too many of you don't factor in how reckless/unprotected sex (for some, NOT all) results in unwanted pregnancies! Yes, let's fight for our rights, but let's also work on being more responsible with our bodies, which would decrease the number of babies terminated before birth!!"
"This is just beginning. The next target will be gay rights and birth control. The conservative wing is trying to fall back 50 years and if this absurdity of the supreme court continues, soon enough the United States will become once again, a white man‚Äôs nation. The Democrats must win the Senate election and put an end to this 21st century blasphemy."
May God protect the fetus of the antichrist what is he waiting for now a soul?
"This is so sad, those poor women that will be forced to have a baby that they don‚Äôt want, then what? Give the baby up for adoption or struggle to look after them and the child potentially ending up in foster care? This is so messed up, what a step backwards for America."
"We remind the Chinese government do not to encourage the bombing of Ukrainian railways! Don't encourage Russian war! Otherwise, we will no longer guarantee the safety of the the Belt and Road railway!"
Another reason why the whole world is laughing at the US...
Plan b pill
"Imagine being so desperate for sex, you'll forgo all the many types of contraception, and pursue a few moments of pleasure at the expense of someone else's life. Sad person, sad world."
"Abortion is a woman's right. However if a woman can terminate her pregnancy due to her financial situation, etc,, than a man should have the right to terminate his contract to pay child support if he has poor financial standing. Rather than taking away rights, we should be giving equal rights to both men and women on this issue."
this is disgusting
"Life is life yes,why do humans think they can control life,is it because we can terminate life?who will ever understand what life is?"
"Congratulations USA! Welcome back to the civilized world! The United States has made progress in civilizing by changing legislation, and now you are one of the people. Only primitives kill unborn children. Thank God! God is great! Glory Jesus Christ!"
The abortionists seem to have aborted themselves out of existence.
"Stop getting drunk and handing out your pussies, be an adult and there is no need for abortion!"
"Everybody wants to ""save the children"", but nobody wants to raise them. 

If the entire country does a 180 in less than a decade because of this, we need to pack the courts. You can't changed 100 years of preconceived decisions built ontop of other judgements in less than a decade; you're cheating the system... at that point you're forcing your perspective on other people and not looking back at past judgements, taking in multiple perspectives/judgements and deciding where to go from there... that's how the courts have always worked."
"The title is misleading, it didn't remove any rights but gave them to the state, witch is the proper place. Not a constitutional right. This is a states rights issue."
"If the law was about men, women would just say.... be more responsible."
"All pro-abortion , just go to a doctor and do the things, so you can't have kids in first place. What's the matter."
If  you have no control of your body what is next...chip implants...
"Noooooo the right to chose and the right of abortion is a human right and our right of freedom, we need to fight this rulling, this decision is not the final word, the people will speak up and fight for our freedom"
Another thing they have blamed Trump for... Why doesn't anyone see that this is all about negative coverage for Trump  - he was high in the polls as Biden is pathetic - all of this is to sabotage the next election.
"Right to abortion? Dont make me laugh. What you mean is the right to murder an innocent child has been abolished. One of the best days in the US. Keep moving forward to progrssive!

There are many ways to prevent accident pregnancy. Sex isnt a necessity too. If you cant control your body and want to have an unsafe sex, then you deserve to raise an innocent child you're creating. You are a human, not an animal. Murdering an unborn child isnt a solution, its a selfish most barbaric sht one can do."
I wish it happens to my country too
This channel is a circus
"Interesting... such governments also should provide all essentials to d children being born unplanned including good education and provide for families sufficient enough to meet all demands. Besides, why is controlling over population not a KPI of controlling climate change. This should be not only about a right of a person to decide but also should be understood that controlling reproduction is a overall good thing for d society. US is becoming the land of crazy. Strange and sad."
Yay yay yay.  I love life and i love our constitutional rights‚Ä¶. Such a tear filled happy day
Yay yay
"It's funny how suddenly the left is talking about ""women"" again. I thought biological sex had nothing to do with giving birth? I thought you were all supposed to say ""birthing people"" now? What changed?"
Good now they can‚Äôt kill baby‚Äôs
"""Jesus loves the little childern"" How weird is that lolol. Church people are funny"
"This because 'Communists' said- Enforce COVID-19 vaccination status for work & travel. *The Court was just doing what was asked, invade privacy!"
This is extremely bad decision from the Supreme Court. What will happen to all the women who can't give birth to a child due to medical conditions and risk to their life? What happens to all the women who are raped and can't bear the children due to trauma or just because so? Is this how the USA does things? Sad how the humanity and intellect of people just goes backwards and women are still objects perceived by men without any rights and choices! Sad
The Irony in this is They seem to care so much about baby's getting killed in abortion and yet they don't give a shit about the Children who died in school shootings This is nothing but Hypocritical bullshit.
"Abortion is wrong, all of you who support it is going to hell"
"So a stillborn baby is worth saving instead of a women that could actually live? It‚Äôs cruel to force a women to care a already dead baby to full term, or a child a product of rape or incest, I do agree that people need to be more responsible when it comes to having a child, but people deserve a choice not all pregnancy is consensual. This anti-abortion ruling is just gonna lead to an increase in heath problems, such as suicide and depression and kids ending up in foster care without a family, because there isn‚Äôt enough children already there already."
"My body my choice except for vaccines. If they are so terrified, close your legs and use contraception."
That's really disgusting that government did this to women in the USA. All the women are sisters and I support girls who protest against this shit. Abortion is the right of every woman. Rise up abortion rights! Love from Russia‚ù§Ô∏è
"Where does a British anchor of all people get off calling an originalist, faithful interpretation of the Constitution, ""radical?"""
This will also solidify the fact in peoples minds that religion affects even the non-religious. Religion divides and it hurts people. Faith is a virus.
"I think if a woman gets rped no abortion, but then I think the just the father and the father alone should be legally responsible for the baby as a counter option to life in prison"
Freaks -- on both sides.
"Looking at time index 1:30, the entire world needs to see exactly what sort of circus freaks have been pushing for the destruction of Rights and Freedoms, in the US of A."
"I don‚Äôt understand how arguing that because kids lives in the foster system are difficult, that somehow justifies killing them. If a child in foster care told you they wanted to commit suicide, would you stop them or let the go through with it?"
"America's corrupt and total evil filth, called the Evangelicals, have metastasized their cancer with their takeover of America's federal and States governments. This will not end well. I the same week the SCOTUS decided to make it perfectly legal for concealed carry, anyone who wants to shoot someone just has to say they felt like their life was threatened.  Many are going to die for that decision and their same-breath overturning of R v W, women will be dying. 
This is NOT about LIVES -- this is about going back to an America that never existed.  
People like Marjorie Taylor Greene is perfectly Ok with the Jan 6th insurrection because it was ""patriotic Americans wanting to get rid of dictatorship!""    Well, people -- look who the real dictators are."
You should hace shown the stories of those who‚Äôve chosen to safe the lives of their babies - they are humans too and their lives have meaning
"USA will be full of Basterds , Congratulations :D   ;     We will call  Basterd USA"
"#peopleofcolortriedtotellyou
Do not vote for Trump. He was able to nominate 3 Supreme Court Justices that are going to destroy your lives."
"I'm pro choice myself. I don't think abortion is a good or a bad thing, I think it's a case by case basis thing.

All I can say is I hope any state that makes it illegal is willing to pour ample amounts of money into the foster system to balance this.. which they won't."
"Abortion is the process of tearing a fetus, crushing it, and removing it from the body for disposal. Is it a women's right?"
"That‚Äôs A Lie!!!
    The Supreme Court Of The United States Of America Simply Handed This Back To The States, Where It Belongs!

This is beyond weird and stupid. I mean how do these people(against abortion) function? They fail at being a civilized human at the basic level.
"Women have the option of keeping the child, putting the child up for adoption, or going to a state where abortion is legal. The Federal government should never have been involved...just as the Federal government is NOT involved in the Life/Death decision of Captial punishment...where each state sets its own law."
Congratulations to all the unborn babies üë∂üèª and to all the dads who want their kiddos!
"I don‚Äôt understand what they fuss about if the government  rule  to no abortion. First women or girls. Keep your legs shut if your not ready to become a mother. Focus on study , find a decent work instead of dating so young so casually. If you don‚Äôt want to be responsible then stop having casual sex without protection. It is your body and thats true but its not the fault of innocent life to be kill because of your irresponsibilities. The government should focus more on how to change this young generation to be more cautious ,solve the drugs issues and homelessness. Some of this women  use drugs , drink alcohol  and do casual sex . Killing is never  right even how much you justify it by saying your young etc."

"We need to wake up! America, you are becoming Russia! American people giving up their civil rights for convenience and religious beliefs of other people! They will be chipping away little by little from our Freedom! I wish everyone will see what is going on! Fight is on ! It is NOT about abortion! This is about our DEMOCRACY! Who will be next?

"Coming from my perspective, as a woman who struggles with having children.. I agree with this law. However, this was not always my viewpoint. Since I understand what it is like to be assaulted, I was always pro choice. That is until I found God and realized that He would want all of his children to be born no matter what. I deeply feel for all the victims of assault and I hope these people find God to help them through. On the other hand, I've known women who just wanted to go out, get drunk, not use any kind of protection and then wanted an abortion. That sickens me. I pray to be blessed with a child somedayüôèüèº"

"Simple ... you want abortion? ... Then you should also lose your womb too ... so that killing of a lives in a wombs be abolished too. AND then you can have all that free and unprotected sex you want!!!

In rape or health cases, these are a different matter."
Yes! Pro-live won. Great historical Decision to MAGA.
"This is a great way to start changing the world , mow kids need to be disciplined for bad behaviors and to have respect for others . I see a lot of changes that need to happen.

63 million babies have been aborted since 1973.

"America is busy with its nose in Russia‚Äôs affairs while it‚Äôs own house is burning down. Let‚Äôs see if women will have strikes, walkouts and siitins to secure their right of CHOICE."
I wonder how quickly any of these women will change their tune if they have an unwanted pregnancy.
ONE & ONLY person can make life is THE LORD-GOD so he has the FINAL DECISION not you females. Which means it‚Äôs not your body it‚Äôs the Lord-GOD‚Äôs body you didn‚Äôt make it he did.
Look at all these twisted sick girls crying in the middle of the street because you‚Äôre gonna force a young girl to have her incestuous father‚Äôs baby or the man who brutally raped her and took her innocence from her you‚Äôre gonna force her to have that baby.. what about ectopic pregnancy? When the child starts forming in the woman‚Äôs fallopian tube and it‚Äôs going to rupture you‚Äôre gonna let mother and baby die now? Maybe some of you should go to school to learn that sometimes abortion are needed to save the mother‚Äôs life. Get a life you guys truly are weirdos. Stay the fuck out of my vagina!
"What happened to contraceptives, don't they work in America?"
Wow finally innocent children who have been aborted for no reason can have a right to live .you can't be getting pregnant any how and not been responsable for your actions. Abortion is murder

all women's in life can't do the abortion after the 40 day's of pregnancy this was in all holy books before the holy Quran , they can remove the baby before the 40 day's of pregnancy I swear in the name of great God it's the true truth, but but if the woman respect it and she doesn't remove it from her body she will not regret at all especially the one who hurt so bad like the ones who get raped from bad sick criminal from any years past or now because she a victim innocent woman and the great God respect them so much and if the woman raised the child she will take a great boons after life üòî the great God will burn all the criminals in hell of fire after death, women's can do the abortion before the 40 day's of pregnancy but she must go to a good professional doctor in hospital üè• but she can't do the forbidden abortion after the 40 day's of pregnancy because the great creator he put the soul in body of the child in his mother womb, about the bad sinrs women's who do the forbidden adultery she must stop ‚úã and if she was pregnant she must raised the baby or she give it to the government they will take care of him , if someone wants something pls text me it's my honor to help you., yes I forgot something very important if the woman was so ill and she bleeding she must go to hospital to remove the baby if that baby wad so dangerous to her live herself because sometimes women's fall off or she had some accidents any accident in life or someone hurt her she must go to hospital immediately and it's not matter if she was pregnant before 40 days or not she must safe herself üíîü•∫ poor women's can't imagine how they feel when they be pregnant God bless all women's , if the woman was not clean faithful she can remove the baby before the 40 days of pregnancy but she must stop and ask forgiveness I hope that üíî."
"Abortion was never protected under the Constitution. That's why Roe v Wade was overturned. The Supreme Court did not take a stance on the legality of abortion, because there is no such law over which they have jurisdiction; rather, they reached the only conclusion they *could* reach, which was to affirm what IS in the Constitution, and that's the 10th Amendment, which makes abortion a state issue (which it is, given that healthcare is mentioned nowhere in the Constitution). Democrats have had 49 years since Roe v Wade to pass another Amendment to enshrine abortion rights, but instead they did nothing and therefore have only themselves to blame. But as usual, they point the finger at anyone & everything else for allegedly wronging them."

Otherwise, what are we different from those who bury their daughters for fear of poverty 14 centuries ago?
Note: All laws and regulations allow abortion in cases of rape and danger to the life of the mother. What we object to is abortion without a real reason, which is most of the cases of abortion."
"People are Stupid Some lady said ""What about the Dads that rape their Daughter"" My answer 2 that is Good Now there will me Evidence of what he's doing instead of us having laws that Help these people DESTROY EVIDENCE AND LIFES!!ü§®"

"If I were to debate a person on abortion there would be 3 things I‚Äôll point out. 

1. The fetus has value, just not as much as a person (that‚Äôll be important leading to the third point and I‚Äôll expand on that) 

2.The fetus is a ‚Äúhuman being‚Äù in the sense it‚Äôs a being which comes from someone, but it isn‚Äôt a person. It‚Äôs not cognitively changing or reacting to anything that happens to it so from that standpoint it matters less and is complete indifference

3. The reason it‚Äôs good to draw the line at birth (third trimester abortions rarely happpen and most of the time they do it‚Äôs for extreme medical reasons) is because of physical consequence. The woman has something in herself which If held to the contrary of what I believe she‚Äôd have to deal with the struggle of giving birth as someone who doesn‚Äôt want to as well as the vast amount of possible health issues that come with giving birth outside of just when the baby is out. Once a baby is born, there‚Äôs little to no physical consequence because the person can rid themselves of responsibility as they will and it‚Äôs outside themselves. The baby also isn‚Äôt a person but it matters enough to have it live due to what it can accomplish mixed with that it isn‚Äôt a physical hindering of someone with actual personhood as far as their body"
Get your facts straight. The federal government turn the matter over to the individual states. There are only 5 states where abortion is illegal.
Hoes Mad...Hoes Mad...Hoes Mad...Hoes Mad.
So if you got raped and pregnant? Your gonna take care of the child?
THERE IS NO FEDERAL RIGHT TO MARRY ANYONE; PEOPLE VOTED TO DEFINE MARRIAGE IN THE LAST 15 YRS AND THE USSC TOOK AWAY THEIR RIGHTS BY OVERRIDING THEIR DEMOCRACY.
Trump did that; the man gets things done.
"Are all foreign journalists this ignorant? There is no Constitutional right to an abortion, there never has been. That was the entire point of the SC ruling. Even Liberal legal scholars concede that Roe was founded in bad law. The Supreme Court does NOT legislate policy. Its ONLY purpose is to interpret the Constitution. I was a journalism major before my professor told me that true journalism was dead, and the first thing we learned is how to do proper research and fact check. Please educate yourself."
"As an Australian, you may say I have no right to view my opinions- but I say screw that! I‚Äôm lucky to live in a country where our government actually gives a sh*t about us! It‚Äôs sad how some of you Americans care more about your guns than women! 
Here‚Äôs an idea, if these men/women that believe in a magical man in the sky think it‚Äôs okay to tell what women should do with their bodies, how about you old f*cks get a vasectomy at age 60? And even better, men below 18 as well? Can you American women please bring that up with the Supreme Court? If they think taking away woman‚Äôs rights is okay then theirs should be taken away too! Fair is fair right? Bloody pathetic! 
I hope these laws change for you beautiful American women! Xxx"

"IT'S ABOUT THE POPULATION TO SUSTAIN STATUS QUO. Black Americans Are The Most Valuable Economic Resource For The White People Power Structure. IT'S ABOUT THE POWER OF THE INK PEN TO MAINTAIN THE WHITE PEOPLE POWER STRUCTURE. The goal of white supremacists' [law making] courts with weaponized abortion laws is about sustaining a perpetual supply of black bodies for the number one job creator of white people -- the civil and criminal codification systems. These two systems DO NOT WORK WITHOUT PEOPLE to intrap into 1 - if not both - TO FINANCE JOB CREATION AND GOVERNMENT FUNDING(S).  Black Bodies are the number one RESOURCE to sustain both civil and criminal systems for white people employment and power. It is also ABOUT INCREASING THE WHITE AMERICAN POPULATION to protect the economic power of the white race FOREVER into the future. The White American POPULATION IS SHRINKING. To play the long-game, DEMANDS FORWARDED THINKING OF AT LEAST THREE  GENERATIONS - [100 YRS] FROM THIS MINUTE. BUT FIRST YOU GOTTA BE AROUND IN A CENTURY - MEANING DESCENDANTS / BABIES TO PASS POWER & HIGH INCOME TO.. The white labor force MUST BE replenished as the older white labourers leave the labor market. The potential labor output of the unborn white child is EXTREMELY VALUABLE to those in longstanding white positions of power and high income. The longstanding positions of white power and high income cannot remain in the hands of white power or be conserved and sustained for white people ONLY if the white labor force to retain and conserve the high income is not replenished. This is why Dixiecrat Republicans with high income and positions of power do not care about life after birth. Because the high quality of life after birth is subject-to birth into an already established white family with benefit and security of longstanding white positions of power and access to ""white power & privilege"" is determined by birth and/or the output value of mental and physical labor of the white person. It is ""White Socialism"" disguised as ""capitalism"" which is based on false scarcity and false fear of black power. The official ""Citizenship Document"" or ""Birth Certificate"" issued by all predominate white countries is the ""Proof of Collateral"" for the country of birth and based on the potential output of valuable assets, value development and job creation (basically the country's GDP) white countries are able to borrow high amounts of money from international resources based on the potential cash flow & collateral produced from the labor of each citizen - especially each white citizen - whom cannot be collateralized if abortion impedes white population or white birth certificates - hence death certificates and the withdrawal from the gold standard of dollar value. This is why in 1971 the USA eliminated the dollar gold standard and put the dollar up again the USA full faith and credit of the USA's Gross Domestic Product - which should NOW be the Gross Labor Production instead. Especially the income and job creation mechanism of the civil and criminal codification systems - the two systems typically allocated the largest percentage of City, County, State & Federal operating budgets - designed to extract income from the powerless and poor non-whites by way of fines, fees, judgements and convictions to finance white job creation throughout local, state & federal governments by way of the covert Marshall Law style policing in the low income (non-white) communities for the sole purpose of perpetuating poverty - and thereby gaslighting civil liability and criminal activity - a perpetual supply of civil liability and a pipeline of criminals for sustained white job creation. The civil and criminal codification systems are the largest white people job creation mechanism in local, state & federal territories - the number one creator of all types of job positions, income levels and careers. Jobs & careers reserved and passed down to white family & friends forever and ever. Propagated to conserve and retain white power and positions of high income. THE TRUE POWER FIRST ACQUIRED THRU GUNPOWDER AND PROTECTED TODAY WITH THE LARGEST MILITARY AND THE MOST NUCLEAR BOMBS. A POSITION BLACK PEOPLE WILL BE KEPT AWAY FROM AT ALL COST - EVEN IF THE WHITE PEOPLE WERE NOT SO AFRAID OF SUCH BLACK POSITION AND POWER, THEY CANNOT ACCEPT BLACK PEOPLE CONTROLLING THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY WITH THE MOST NUCLEAR BOMBS - UNLESS IT'S OVER THEIR DEAD BODIES."
I am loving in a giant cult run country. Fuck.
The states will decide if they will allow abortions. The people of the state will decide and that‚Äôs the way it should be.

"""I'm 21 and I'm terrified!""  Of what?   Seriously, of what?  You're not in danger.  The only thing you can't do now that you could before is murder a baby.  Except you still can in half the states.  Are you terrified that if you get pregnant, you might be required to give birth to the child?  Okay, fine.  Giving birth, being pregnant, that's all a very big deal, so it's understandable to not want to go through that.  If that's the case, try not having sex.
There's a lot of talk about rape, incest, and pregnancy complications.  Aside from the fact that these cases are a tiny minority of abortions, my opinion on those is as follows.  
1, Rape: reallocate resources from abortion clinics to psychological counseling and maternity assistance.  Strongly encourage the victim to make the best of her situation, and help her through it.  Abortion may be a last resort in extreme cases.
2, Genetic/physical/mental defects: I think that this category is justifiable as potential reason for abortion, especially in extreme cases where the child's quality of life would be severely impacted.  (eg, if an incurable disease would mean the child would be born and live a short life of suffering, it's arguable that it would be more humane to end it as soon as possible)
3, Incest: Refer to part 1 and 2.  Incest may or may not be rape, and may or may not cause a deformity or defect.
4, Pregnancy complications: If complications arise and the mother's life is threatened by the pregnancy, this is reasonable cause for an abortion procedure.

There was also talk of abortion being a Human Right.  It's not.  It cannot be.  Human rights are inherent, not provided.  You have no right to any service or resource whatsoever.  You do not have the right to have an abortion, to have a life-saving medicine, to have access to the internet, or to have water.  Here's why.  If you have the right to, say, education, that means that any government which upholds human rights must guarantee that you have education.  That means they must not only build schools, but they are responsible for making sure there are teachers.  And if, hypothetically, you lived in a low population area and no teachers were around, the government would be required to relocate a teacher to that location, so you can have your rightful education.  They would need to make it a legally binding statute that someone must educate you, and if that someone refuses to provide their service, they are in violation of the law.  This makes them a slave of the state: work or be punished.  Give water or be punished.  Educate or be punished.  Abort this pregnancy or be punished.  Freedom is a Human Right, because we all have it by default.  Actual rights are things that you start out with, that you have by default.  They can only be restricted or infringed, they are not, cannot be, something that someone does for you, because that infringes other people's rights.  Life is a right.  Freedom is a right."

A return to subjugating women and keeping them in poverty and misery.
"the woman with the sign in the thumbnail ""The future is anti-abortion""....what a clueless snapper. I can't believe there are women who are against abortion and against a woman's right to choose. Seriously what a woman does with her body and her life should be up to her NOT some Republican loser. I'm not American but Republicans are TOTALLY F'd. This is just one reason why they are F'd but there are SOOOO many more reasons. Leave the women alone, let them decide for themselves."
My :God!! The thought that a baby about to be delivered can no longer be subject to having a pair of forceps thrust into its skull and its brain sucked out is unconscionable!!!  We demand partial abortion!!!!!
Abortion kills innocent human life and should be banned worldwide
imagine being saddened by not being allowed to murder human babies in the  womb
Some of yall in the comments raising hell because they said y'all can't kill y'all babies no more..can't be the same people going to church praying to God for money..I mean seriously
This reporter looks amazing her suit is so neatly fitted on her. The woman in the blue.
If women can opt out of being a parent then men should have the same right without being financially burdened for the next 20 years. Men shouldn't be forced to pay for something women ultimately can destroy.
"The ‚ÄúPro-Life‚Äù movement is Pro-Death, and more people need to recognize this important fact.

The same justices and politicians who weep crocodile tears for embryos are the ones who sentence thousands of the elderly and children to die.  How ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù are they really when they refuse to protect people from COVID and guns?  The blood of thousands stain their hands, disproving their rhetoric about caring for life.

We need to vocally label conservatives as the pro-death party, and directly call out people like Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas as the heartless, treacherous wretches they truly are.  Don‚Äôt let these hypocrites claim the higher ground on the cause of saving lives; challenge them and ask how many people died from their other actions."
"Why not use condom 
What is the need to get pregnant if tou dont want the child dont you know doing sex makes baby"

Jesus Christ üôè is boss. The world universe has killed millions trillions of unborn children.   
women says it is their choice and their bodies.  what about the child body.  parents supposed to protect their unborn child not get rid of their tiny bodies. God help women."

It sounds kind of sick doesnt it!
If most people had seen what the after shot of an abortion looks like they wouldnt feel that way!"

"Psalm 139:13-18(TLB)-13¬†You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit them together in my mother‚Äôs womb.¬†14¬†Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex! It is amazing to think about. Your workmanship is marvelous‚Äîand how well I know it.¬†15¬†You were there while I was being formed in utter seclusion!¬†16¬†You saw me before I was born and scheduled each day of my life before I began to breathe.

"As a child whose parent considered abortion. Its not right to force women to have these babies. It sucks knowing you were unwanted and that you ruined your parents lives. One broken condom and they got me, a recalled birth control and they got my sister. To this day, my parents hate each other because of my mom's decision to have us. They were happy newlyweds but were definitely not ready for children, let alone two. Sometimes I wish my mom just went through with it. I hate that i put this burden on them and its not like I would've known. And that's what these millions of kids will feel like. My mom had an abortion at 15 when she was raped by a mentor. She was too young to be a mom. She ended up having another one 8 years after i was born. Another BC mistake but she found out she had cervical cancer around 2 months and had to choose getting chemo and losing the baby or waiting til the baby was born and hoping it didn't spread and we lose her or both of them. She chose to stay with her living children. I mean we were sad at the loss but we wanted our mom more. Abortions aren't always bad and each one should be treated individually instead of outlawing all of it."
"Can you imagine the increase of foster care that these unwanted births will go into. Most teenagers having children , don't have the means to provide for a child , whether it is financially or mentally. Children may suffer if in fact these children never get adopted and go thru the foster care route.  Will the government then help with the surge of children in a foster care situation?"
Protesters should educate themselves on how to prevent a pregnancy and stop killing defenseless human beings. Life begins in the womb and that life matters and should be protected.
Praise God for Life.God alone has the right to terminate life. These woman that are fighting are deeply disturbed They have unclean Spirits. Jesus is king and every knee will bow either as Guilty sinner needing forgiveness. or as sinner being Judged.All these woman are upset u know how these precious women can avoid being all these problems fear God don't have sex outside of marriage. Jesus is prolfe He died so you can have eternal Life.. be Born again Trust Jesus as your Savior from your sin
So much for land of freedom and opportunity! It is a v cruel and impractical ban. What if you know your child will be born crippled or stunted and cant help yourselves if you decide not to proceed with pregnancy?!
It's a slaughter house....these people are demon driven!!
It's evil to murder an unborn precious living human created by God not man's decision....√ßhanges are good Lord God says all good things comes from above

    For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,  they are the sons of God.

     He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3.16-18
     For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. Romans 14.11

      And the smoke of their torment ascended up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.Revelation 14.9-11

"Funny, the same people who are screaming ‚ÄúMy body my choice‚Äù are the same people who support vaccine mandates. 
The same Democrats who call everyone who does not support them racist are calling Justice Thomas ‚ÄúUncle Tom‚Äù. 
The same Democrats who want to ‚Äúpack the court‚Äù are the same people who were outraged when Trump got to pick a few Judges. 

Once again, Democrats live by the belief that anything is OK as long as it fits their agenda.

"Good bye USA!  Did the taliban just take over?  Disgusting, disturbing, disbelief!  I will never visit this country again."
"Reading the comments below, I am reminded of why Leftist elites call you brainwashed morons ""useful idiots"". The Supreme Court did NOT take away your right to kill unborn babies. It simply upheld the 10th Amendment, which makes clear that such decisions are the purview of the individual states, not of the federal government. Some states will outlaw feticide, as is their right, and others will keep it."
Reversing Roe is a big win for pedophile priests and the religious fascists that worship them.
They need to make abortion ilegal. Death penalty for abortion.
Biden looks like he's gonna pass out just reading his script. Dude is just not interested lol

For 50 years USA was in lockstep with North Korea and China with abortion.  Now we can get back to walking a moral path.
"I have been to court many times.  When the Judge asked me if, I plea guilty or not:.,  the thought always went through my mind: 'could you have avoided this'  'could you have made better decisions'.  ""Could you have listened to your father and mother not to go out on a Saturday night'.?!/..  

I understood I made lots of wrong choices at that age.    I always plead guilty. I knew that taking responsibility for my own actions meant being accountable.
       Today, these folks seem to forget who is responsible. They Are!"

The only good thing about 2022
"Men need to shut their mouths. An unwanted baby doesn‚Äôt ruin THEIR lives‚Ä¶only women‚Äôs lives. So now foster care and orphanages will skyrocket in population. Many more kids will be without parents. We‚Äôll have 12 year olds giving birth. Raped women will be forced to carry. Poverty for women will increase greatly. I think the ""fathers"" and fetus should get DNA tests and be forced to pay child support upon conceiving not birth. Also, pay half the hospital and doctors bills. Prison if they don‚Äôt!  They already don‚Äôt with no consequences. So we are putting women right back at that severe disadvantage and women‚Äôs salaries will decrease and we‚Äôll see fewer in management positions because of sickness, delivery and maternity leave. Of course men want this. It gives them the upper hand. Forcing women to have a baby they don‚Äôt want will never turn out well. Imagine the self abortions and desperate measures women will take. Many will have the procedure in Mexico. This will traumatize millions. I think as long as a fetus can‚Äôt live on it‚Äôs own outside the womb, abortion should be legal. Government better not touch the Plan B pill, change birth control, no questions asked rule.  In fact now we need more of this readily available and free at Planned Parenthood. Federal laws like this worry the sh/te outa me. Each state should govern itself not nine people!  I know my state will ban it but I still believe in state governance. We CANNOT let this seep into other areas where we end up being run federally. We aren‚Äôt China, Russia or North Korea. I guarantee those six votes were to lord over the states not to care about fetuses. They know good and well this will financially cost us dearly. It probably also has something to do with an increase in natural born American citizens becoming more and more of the majority. Taking away women‚Äôs rights is unjust and discriminatory. I‚Äôm SO sick of the inequality. We‚Äôve never even had a female President. Never. Black Lives Matter?  Yes and we‚Äôve even had a black president. A man. üôÑ I still get teary eyed thinking about at least we have a Madam Vice President. But I want to see a Madam President and First Gentleman of the White House. And all of those people standing out there crying in happiness‚Ä¶are they going to adopt thes unwanted babies. Will they volunteer their time at an orphanage?  Will they foster ten kids? Of course not because they‚Äôre hypocrites. So yeah‚Ä¶there are so many horrible things about this."
Hm well the same sex marriage is next. One thing to say to the judge....how about interatrial marriage judge? oh sorry you are married to a white woman hm....well if you open Pandora's box you never know the outcome ....
It's scary to see these women celebrating... abortion can't be stopped...women will continue to terminate unwanted pregnancies by all means possible and most likely now die doing it!
"U guys remember the film Hot Tub Time Machine? Specifically, the scene of Chose It Dose It. So, if the believe the babies should be born, they should be handled the rights to rise those kids. The mother's don't want to kid (this varies). All those people who don't want abortion laws should be handed the kids born. The kids which the mother does not want for which ever reason. We all win."

Americas gone a bit crazy lately hasn't it üòï
Praise Jesus
"If anything America needs to stop having children... the thought prosses here must have been extremely short. Poverty will rise, clearly! Lower educated family's will grow causing more mental health issues. But at least you still have gun laws to support bad mental health in children. The movie idiosyncrasy was supposed to be a joke."
"LOL so much not correct with this reporting.  There is no ""legal obligation"" to ban abortion.  Nonsense.  All the ruling does is follow the Constitution and gives States some of their Rights back against the Federal Government.  The States will now get to decide for themselves as they always had the Right to do so."
"""Who is the government to decide what I do with my body""
Who are you to decide what happens to the babies body?"
Trump is a Trump indeed
Pro-Life does not end with delivery of the baby
What's next America? Chastity belts?
It should be illegal for women to say no to men. Saying no is the murdering of a potential baby! Murder is murder!
guy saying abortion is murder on 5:15 can burn in hell for all i care because its not murder.
banning abortion is wrong and its a womans choice. some people make excuses saying its murder and should be banned if people dont like it then leave it alone and they need to just stay of it its none of they  business.
"God is watching over His gift of life taken  for granted by humans.  Contraceptives are widely available, they are not banned. For rape and incest cases, the individual will have to make a personal decision.  Some pro abortion activists say, it is their body.  No one  says it isn't.  Killing a baby/embryo is still murder. It should never be used as a substitute for contraceptive. There are long term implant contraceptives available and other states still available to perform abortion if someone sees nothing wrong with ending  a human life on an ongoing, as needed or regular basis."
They SHOULD have the right to tell people what to do with their body if they're using it as a baby killing weapon. What if I'm an expert in karate? They shouldn't be telling me that I don't have the right to chop your neck and make you dead right? Yes they should! There are a lot of different ways that the body can be used as a weapon!
Its interesting to see the clear bias of the reporters.
"Yeah these abortion women have dreams they that they believe were destroyed, but destroying the dream of a prospective Father who wants children is just as bad! I have children, and I pray every day that no idiot aborted my child. That's sick shit! I once married a girl in order to prevent her from getting an abortion."
"Rapist „ÄÅpedophiles' „ÄÅtoxic families and relatives must be very happy now they can able to control women again. Congratulations America. You are just as bad as other third world countries. Un-educated. Narrow minds, control freaks. NOBODY HAS RIGHTS TO TELL WHAT WOMEN WANTS TO THEIR BODY!! you cannot even help all of the orphans so why putting your nose on women's decision? What about mandatory all of the guys to do vasectomy so it's fair? Then we do not need to worry about getting pregnant. I would rather not to forgive all the parents who decided to keep the  babies and ended up neglected or killed them. Where are all  your supports for the parents who need help if you are pro-life?!If you think women who did abortions are selfish then pro-life are selfish too because you judge another human being without thinking about their situations. We all not perfect but do not act like you better pro-life people!!! America has more problem than this!!!!"
"Mortal man can change laws left or right, liberal or conservative but God's laws remain the same. "" Thou shalt not kill""."

Americas coat hanger sales have gone through the roof üòÖ
So women are now upset they lost their right or choice ....men have no say either way and should have right to financial abortion...only fair right. Now you know how men feel....how's it feel ladies...suxs doesn't it
Delicious liberal tears.
"Hey women out their who want to murder babies, get some contraception or keep your panties on. Murder should never have been an option."
"No matter how you rub your lips with your mouth, Abortion is wrong, period."
Boycott American conservative owned companies and businesses. They supported this.
"I get tired of doing this but here we go again.  There is no constitutional right to abortion, nor was there ever.  Biden and his leftist advisors may say there was, but if you go look for yourself, you will see they are in serious error and misleading the public.  The constitution actually gives the states the right to legalize abortions.   It doesn't even give that right to the Supreme Court.  So when SCOTUS decided on Roe v Wade they were acting as an unelected legislative body and acted in contradiction to the constitution. Even RBG recognized this and said the decision was on shaky grounds and she was pro abortion.   This supreme court now is recognizing this and has handed the states back their rights.  Look, if you want your rights and freedoms that are enshrined in law, then you have to follow the law.  You can't pick and choose which laws you are going to follow.  If you want to change the law then you need to pressure those who can do that.  One thing I do know is that whenever the left doesn't get their way they react violently.  Remember the George Floyd riots?  How about the threats and plots to kill Supreme Court Justices?  I thought only right wing fascists did that sort of thing.  Guess not.  Seems the left is much more inclined to violence.  I've even watched certain members of congress and the now vice-president of the United States encouraging and cheering on that violence.  Think that might be sedition?"
Land of the free!
The US is becoming the anus of the world
Abortion is not something a mother think lightly of. She probably thought it through and pulled herself together to go through the process. I feel sorry for every women who aren‚Äôt in a state that will protect our rights and will have to travel to another state for resources and services. There are many unwanted children in the system who struggle to find families because families also have their own standards on the children(ren) they want to adopt.
Care about people .. care about women .. really ‚Ä¶ what about the care of the unborn babies‚Ä¶ selling the parts afterwards on the open market .. care of the women ‚Ä¶ REALLY‚Ä¶ take care of yourself before sex ‚Ä¶ not afterwards !!!!

BBC fake news! It means that people should go to states that agree with their values‚Ä¶ to kill babies
"I mean abortion is a choice, and it is upto the women who is carrying the baby what she should or shouldn't do. In no way she should be compelled to carry the child if chooses not to. Very sadge üòîüòû."
"Those of you who don't live here in the U.S. please take to the streets and protest for us. Maybe if other countries join us it will help. I'm frieghten for my children and the world over with these extremist changing America in the worst way and having the largest military, the furture could be a very frightening place for all of us. We're being oppressed. Please help us."
"Abortion is murder.  You get an abortion by a doctor.  They're the murderer and the woman is an accessory to murder.  If there was no options for women, not to get pregnant. I could understand.  But there's MANY options to prevent getting pregnant.  And as far as wanting to get pregnant, getting pregnant. But finding out the baby has health issues.  BE A HUMAN BEING AND GIVE THAT BABY A CHANCE AT LIFE.  And my views aren't about religion.  It's just about being a caring, sensitive human being.  If a woman gets raped.  You can put that baby up for adoption. There's so many couples who want babies, but can't.  Couples can give that baby a home. With lots of love and care for many years."
"Wether or not you are for abortion, notice the rise of churches in the US,
Back to the middle ages"
"Slippery slope... so what's next beyond the current issues? Should we take away voting rights from women and people of color? Should only ONE religion be allowed? Should all people with diseases and disabilities be removed from existence? Yes, it's all the same thing and yes, this is normal in some backward countries right now :)

Democracy is great but not for everything. We have seen where democracy does not work for certain issues. Sometimes, you have to scrap democracy and support something because it's just what a society of equality and respect is all about. 

I'm glad that companies are getting involved because they have rights too and often power. It's funny how big progressive companies are the ones with the courage - I would love to see big conservative companies come out supporting pro-life, but you know they won't because at the end of the day, this would still hurt conservative parties a lot more than progressive companies. That speaks volumes as to where the general society sits and what brand is more powerful. Again, we'll see how pro-choice companies like Netflix, Disney, and Amazon will be impacted - I don't think much because most pro-lifers are hypocrites and will still visit Disney, subscribe to Netflix, and buy from Amazon LOL"
"So many children in states who go through foster care, child abuse and youth drug abuse. Now there will be many more due to unwanted child birth. I can't believe it doesn't even make exception for rape and abuse victims. This is stupid, leaving mothers accountable while fathers will fly off(talking about those who abandon women after pregnancy)."
"All the anti abortion chicks are so ugly, so it doesn't matter to them, no one getting them pregnant."

"Hey everyone ...divide and rule strikes again, their still playing us."
"You would think the US would of learned from history, Nationwide Prohibition and the Drug on War campaign where became illegal and how well that turned out.. I think the US government is a bipolar rollercoaster"
"Its crazy how people want to have pleasure but do not want the responsibility that comes with it. For every action there's a reaction. The whole reason humans have sex is to procreate and its engrained in the biology of every living thing. Do not reply to me about rape and incest (which contributes for 1.5%  abortions. A majority of women who have abortions are doing it our of their own convenience to shy away from the responsiblity of having a child) , or clump of cells (which we all are), consciousness (which in technicality from the viewpoint of pro-choicers would mean people in coma or asleep arent human beings since they arent conscious), women have the right to choose ( which everyone has the right to choose but that does not mean the choice is right and some choices should be prohibited e.g just because I have the choice to stab some one doesn't mean I will because as I stated earlier there's consequences for each choice we make whether its immediate or in the future ), you have control of your own body ( which in this case the body in dispute is not the mothers and the child is the one going to be destroyed so its our duty as pro-lifers to defend it) ,women may die from pregrancies (with our advancement in technology the only 2 our of 100000 women die from pregnacies which is a mortality rate of 0.0002 % and thats for women with complicated health issues the average women wont have any problems) our arguments hinges on the comparision between  humans inside and outside of the womb and our contention is theres isnt any difference aside from their physical location so to say that people who are pro-life dont care about a childs well-being when its outside the womb is BS"
What‚Äôs the LGBT doing about this‚Ä¶ why are they the most hit and vocal about this? Isn‚Äôt girl to girl or male to male can‚Äôt conceive? Can someone explain? Thanks.
"It doesn't matter, if you know the USCONSTITUTION.  Article 4section 2, states clearly 
 "" the citizens of each state shall be ENTITLED  to ALL the PRIVILEGES and immunities of citizens in the Several states.""
 We have Equal Rights..States can't make anything illegal that is legal in,  ""the several states "".
 "" Several"" means 3 or more."
Third world country‚Ä¶.in certain aspects.
"Shame on all of those involved in making this extremely harmful decision. For the so called ""land of the free"" this quite frankly a disgrace."
"Shouldn't get pregnant in the first place. Only reason for abortion is if the woman was raped,or if the baby will be so badly deformed the quality of life is heartbreaking."
"it‚Äôs a shame to see those women cheering, for what??? why do they care so much what other women and people with uterus do with their body, why does it affect them?? go touch some grass"
Millions of innocent lives will be saved. No one should have the right to murder children. 50 years of darkness in the USA have ended.
"Ah yes, don't trust women to decide for themselves whether they want to or are ready to undergo the extremely difficult period of pregnancy, childbirth, and take care of a child. Treat her like she's not an adult and take the decision off her hands. Then pretend you're doing God's work, but not actually care about the kid once it's born."
Many people are not having children until  late 20s early 30s. So I have a conspiracy theory that another small reason is to get more people in the workforce to compete against china's superior work productivity.
Finally Joseph Biden the 8 is taking drastic measures to increase the population as he should. Time to return to our traditional roots.
These protesters believe that the supreme court actually makes the law..When in fact its your own state makes the law..Now women you have to take responsibility of your own fk up when out there drinking an fkn one night stand dudes...
It was NEVER a constitutional right to abort a baby.  What you are saying is not true
"In America I don't see any difference between Lawful sexy life and rape.what does abortion mean for such society? because who will determine weather the case is related to rape or Consent? Anyway abortion is equal to Kill unborn kids intentionally, During the intercourse the dependant partners must be reverse a little bit when the agg is broken to avoid abortion."
"I hate to break it to all of you, who are going on about babies and children, but:  we're not talking about babies.
Over 90% of abortions take place before consciousness, awareness, ability to feel or experience anything, has developed in the fetus.
They're a collection of developing cells that have the potential to become babies, but they're not babies.
I suspect those among you who oppose abortion on religious (or what you think of as ""moral"") grounds, do so because you believe in an immortal soul, and therefore they are people from the moment of conception.
This is a belief, not a fact.
It's not ""moral"" to condemn others to a life of misery and poverty, simply to appease your own unsubstantiated beliefs.
(And incidentally, to all those crowing ""if you don't want a baby, don't get pregnant...simple"":  51% of abortions in the US are (or were) provided to people who had been using contraception when they became pregnant).

You all need to realise how simplistic and ill-informed are the opinions by which you deem yourself fit to pass judgement and sentence on others.
Look at your own Bible, and ""judge not, that ye be not judged"", and look for the beam in your own eye ... but I guess you only pay heed to the words of your supposed Saviour, when they fit your own preconceptions and prejudices.

You're all quite sickening."
"This is fear mongering at its best. Abortion has not been criminalized by the Supreme Court! The Supreme Court reversed a WRONG decision that was taken 50 years ago which was based on a flawed interpretation of the Constitution thereby federalizing abortion. What it has now done is to place the decision to legalize or ban abortion where it rightfully belongs -- in the hands of each State's own legislature. And you already see the results of that decision -- progressive States will legalize abortion and everything will carry on as if nothing has happened. More conservative States will ban abortion, but at this stage there is nothing that prohibits a women who seeks an abortion to travel to a neighboring State and have her abortion."
IN GOD YOU TRUST BUT YOUR KILLING YOUR OWN FLESH!
MARCH FOR LIFE DONT KILL THE INNOCENT BABIES !
Maybe it's time for EU and UK and others to offer US women the right to seek political asylum in countries with abortion rights... At least that would send a message to Pence and other fundamentalists.
VICTORY FOR INNOCENT UNBORN BABIES!
Follow God.
"Well america, you're gonna have to introduce ID checks for women crossing state lines."

Search up cern july5th its not good
"""Pro life"" idjits fail to see the larger picture where ultimately this will make women 2nd grade citizens. who from whatever background now has to think twice about having any sexual autonomy. A man during a one night stand would do the deed and go away but the woman will have to spend the night hoping the protection didn't fail. So many other ways where the law accommodates the man but never the woman. Just because women have the ability to birth doesn't mean it's a duty, it's not a miracle process. That's how  civilisation evolves. From a necessity to eventual enlightenment of choice. God made all humans capable of that. There's absolutely no logic, reason or emotions in this decision. It's a farce and women have to deal with it."
"The land of freedom, huh?"
The rest of the world should follow this example!
"Commercial sex zones have developed around U.S. bases worldwide. Many look much the same, filled with liquor stores, fast-food outlets, tattoo parlors, bars and clubs, and prostitution in one form or another. The evidence is just outside the gates in places such as Baumholder and Kaiserslautern in Germany, and Kadena and Kin Town on Okinawa. Even during the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there have been multiple reports of brothels and sex trafficking involving U.S. troops and contractors."
"Seeing the leftists in anguish...

"Why abortion, why not wearing condom in right way..and have birth pills...why killing baby?...so cruel....have sex with responsibility..not for fun ....all unborn babies killer will go to hell...and thats their place forever..."
So raped children in the USA will have to give birth from now on? Or they‚Äôll have to have an abortion in underground hospitals?
"Also, I understand these particular situations that you all here are talking about here and respect it, but God decides about it, not us, who lives and who dies. He is the righteous judge. Amen."
Yep a civilization does not kill it's children no matter the circumstances you take the babies right to life from him.

First they came for women's rights
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a woman.

Then they came for same sex marriage and intimacy.
And I did not speak out
Because I was in a hetrosexual marriage.

Then they came for interracial marriage 
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a person  of colour.

Then they came for the poor
And I did not speak out
Because I was not poor.

Then they came for me
And there was no one left
To speak out for me.

"1) contraception does NOT give 100% protection from getting pregnant.
2) as I see it, there will be less sex after such ""law"".
3) the numbers of lesbians will grow, because it is impossible to get pregnant this way.
4) the rates of suicides among young pregnant women will grow, specially among teenagers.
5) abortions still will be done by those who need it, same as when alcohol or smoking is forbidden, BUT it will lead to high maternal mortality and complications (because not done in official medical center).
6) now read carefully: they have banned ANY abortion (even pills!) in many states already, including for the underage victims of rape and incest!!!!!
7) numbers of babies left in orphanages will grow, amount of homeless/criminals too - because if kids were NOT WANTED and parents left them, who will educate and give love/attention to +900.000 babies per year? who will feed them, give clothes and teach?
8) they say that this decision protects life, but they refused to pass the law about free contraception or baby food!!!"

"""Thousands of people want to have a right to kill people since they are not yet born"", is it?"
"Your headline is incorrect.  There was never a constitutional right to an abortion.  A quick word search through the US Constitution will quickly show this.  Roe V. Wade used a rather tenuous interpretation of an imputed right to privacy and even more tenuous interpretation of the right to Due Process in the original ruling.  The only reason that it has stood since 1973 is that there have been no SCOTUS challenges which directly addressed Roe v. Wade.  There have been cases which addressed the APPLICATION of the ruling, but none which addressed the validity of the ruling itself.

Do some research and you will find that even the Pro-Choice side admitted this in 1973.  There have been many millions of dollars spent to ensure that nothing with the required wording to challenge the original decision never saw the inside of a US District Court, much less SCOTUS."
Same sex marriage should also be abolished

Abortion is evil
God bless the supreme court
Great üëå victory to all those who love life
Just shut up American women if u were aborted u would not have a life to abort someone shut up and give life why take life from someone
"If women are so damn mad about ‚Äúmy body, my choice,‚Äù then why are you not mad when a man transitions to a woman? Who will never understand what being a woman is, never having menstrual cycles, never giving birth, never growing breasts. You will never be a woman if you‚Äôre born a man. You will never be a man if you‚Äôre born a woman. Say anything you want lol, but you‚Äôll always be what you were made to be. Confusing."
"How tf has it effected your community negatively?? So you‚Äôd rather have neglected, abused, abandoned, traumatized, and fucked up youth??? My lawd, I‚Äôm someone who sees both sides. Women have that right, to a point. I knew a woman who had 8 abortions before she had her children. Didn‚Äôt care about birth control, or any sort of PREVENTING pregnancy. That‚Äôs wrong. Period. However, other circumstances I can totally understand. So now we‚Äôll be caring for all these kids, or their families will. And there will be an even bigger strain on government assistance with unwanted babies. Are all these pro lifer‚Äôs going to help??? Are they going to fund and raise these children? Will they help when they need counseling, and housing and food??? Hell no they won‚Äôt, we‚Äôre struggling as it is. CPA in most areas are a JOKE. They can‚Äôt deal with the high volume they have now, what will the future be like? This is supposed to be the land of the free, but it‚Äôs the land of the ‚Äúhow much money you have will gain you the power and voice‚Äù insanity. Solidifies and international move in my mind"
"Abortion is killing and women should do abortion just if they have good reason (health issue, in case of rape). Who are we to decide whether someone should live or no!? The fact that we own our body doesn't give us right to decide about someone's life. If we are already pregnant then we should take responsibility for our actions!"
The right to have an abortion has never been guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Please read the U.S. Supreme Court Justice's decisions. Abortions have been given back to the voters in each State.
Abortion is NOT  in the Constitution.
I can't wait to hear someone say how this will severely affect transgender women.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"No sex with men(husbands, boyfriend or that app) they say till the recent ruling overturned.
Women will use it as a weapon against non favorable husbands or boyfriends while going out to have sex with another man; they will all relay on the natural calendar.
Men be on the watch; our slits are becoming very tricky!
Men be on the watch!"
You all better cut the christian crap about unborn babies . You cant force anyone into giving birth and carrying an unwanted child. End of story. My body my choice so you shut up
It is wrong to kill your children what's wrong with you?
Good news!
"Women's body, women's rights but after we have a heartbeat then it's MURDER!"
What ever happened to good old birth control? Why are people so freaked out that women have to pay for their abortions now? Also it is paid if there is danger to the mother. Why are the news not discussing both sides of this subject matter.

"Abortion is illegal in majority of countries around the world, execept where the mothers life is threatened"
Women stop showing your daughters to be like you acting like a w**** getting pregnant by everybody and then one in abortions. Burn your tubes burn your insides so you don't get pregnant show your little girls to burn their insides they're too so they don't get pregnant that way I don't have to be protesting stop sleeping with everybody INBREDS
America is nothing more than one giant used car lot.  ~Vet
so USA is a religious government? sharia law type shit but christian?

Violence of abortion? White privilege? What about women who are raped? What about accidents?
Wtf has someone else's organs have to do with that lady? Ridiculous.
All i'm saying is the cost to raise children in 2022 is absurd. If developed countries want to ban abortion they should at least make policies to make it easier to raise children for example making a social benefit program where daycare is free so the parents can just work and earn money to support their family.
"""I've seen the devastation abortion has brought on our country"" ? What is she talking about I would like to know what devastation she's seen"
Blame religion lol
"Hard to tell the difference now between the Taliban and America. Neither believes in women's rights. The adoption industry is lacking fresh stock to broker. Adoption was once a billion dollar industry that plotted to make this comeback. Day care will be targeted next to ensure American women are forced to stay home to care for children they didn't plan for and can't afford, or forced to relinquish their new borns to the adoption brokers."
The US Supreme Court did not strike down abortions. It did however give each state the ability to decide (by the people who live in those states) to vote for whether or not you can have an abortion in that state. Many companies have said that if a women would like to get an abortion and the state does not allow that they would provide access and pay  to help the women get an abortion. Your headline sucks - stop it
This is not true. False flag.

"America the country where guns have officially more rights than women.


What a shame."
"Thanks God!! This murdering act is finally ending. 
A win for life."
This title from the BBC is nothing more than a deceptive lie! You still have the right to murder your child in the US. What the judges merely stated is the same thing that Ruth B Ginsburg stated in her own writings and that was that the federal government has no right to dictate and that each state individually can vote on what is allowed and want isn't allowed. Read the blasted and complete decision written by the judges. BBC is full of crap!
"Once a fetus is formed, to terminate it is murder, except in immediate health cases. If women do not want to be pregnant there are condoms."
"What there saying is legal abortions are no longer available legally, but illegal abortions will be on the rise. No doubt this will lead to the death of the children as well as the possible death of the mother. Is there is no excuse, abortion should be legal with in the first 2 1/2 months. right now you have abortion group celebrating, yet they do not know the horror of what is to come with old style coat hanger abortions. It is sad that a 13-year-old girl raped by their father should be forced to carry a child and take away any possibilities of college or any advanced schools. I can honestly say that guy we see a rise in unexpected infant deathse because of this."
"Like I said in my video that I uploaded yesterday, we need new people in the government that weren‚Äôt born during world war 2 because obviously they still think we‚Äôre in the 60s and 70s ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Abortion was form by KKK and to control black population. Per the liberals standard, whoever support abortion are racism"

"Women are being treated like ZOO ANIMALS or CATTLE. It is certain that if this corrupt money making approach to banning abortion will cause the USA to suffer a raise of ramped poor mental health for the women who are forced to bare unwanted children and the children who will suffer the shame of being unwanted and or foster care and what come with it. This act on the part of the Supreme Court needs to be walked backed now before this mess get started. America is in shock as it is. We don‚Äôt need another mass issue like Roe vs Wade being overturned. If you look closer nothing really good came out of Donald Trumps administration. And,l if anyone is thinking about the IRS checks Trump allowed I am not for sure but believe the fine print for some if not all stated the money had to be paid back. Loopholes and fine print. Read it. Trust in government is out the door."
I predict a fracturing of the United States into two countries: 1 will be a neo-conservative country and 1 will be a social democracy
"There was NEVER a constitutional right to abortion in the US, and the SCOTUS decision only returns the question to the states where it should have always resided based on the 10th amendment."
"are the pro-lifers carrying guns? Religious fundamentalist fanatics are usually armed and willing to kill others.
France is in the process of making abortion a right in their constitution. 
France is a laic state and refuses the control of religious fundamentalism 
interfering with people's freedom of choice and human rights."
"Utter madness. Such a backwards decision. Bearing in mind this decision has been made in a country like the US, which is meant to be at the forefront of advancement, it‚Äôs just scary."
We truly are progressing backwards.
"This entire thing seems surreal. I am starting to wonder if ""States Rights"" went too far compared to having a consistent ""Law of the Land""?  Will different illegal abortion states make it a crime for a woman to leave their state and travel to another state to have an abortion? If some states can shorten the trimester time for abortion, can other states lengthen the trimester time?"
So the supreme court just announced it should no longer exist since it can't be expected to uphold half a century's worth of precedent and would like to side with religious fascists.
Women who want abortions make horrible decisions in their lives because they don't think before they acted üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
"So ... if a woman is raped and pregnant,  she has to keep and raise the baby ? ? Whoever vote for this is extremely selfish and stupid. If you wanna be a mom, do it, don't force others have to. Anti-abortion, fk off."
"Speaking as a Short Man, I was disappointed by this ruling.  I want to make my wife get an abortion if it is a daughter. 

I don't want some shallow girl who only dates 6ft tall guys."
So much for 'Land of the Free' pffft
There is no excuse for abortion - it is women committing so-called legal murder. Here are some simple solutions to avoid pregnancy: 1) Keep your legs closed; 2) Use contraception; 3) Get married first and do things in the correct order. A man needs to be consulted before any abortion as it was his SEED used to create the baby. It is NOT a woman's right. Suck it up princesses and get off your feminist high horse
Portapotti Instagram models will now have to be careful that they don't get pregnant by a 12 year old boy or his 90 year old grandfather in Dubai. Take lots of contraceptives and don't forget to take them. Ha ha

Why would u murder that innocent unborn baby..üò°"
Why don‚Äôt the BBC show us how the aborted baby looks after the abortion just so people have a good image in their minds of what Abortion actually does to the baby?
As a non religious person. I cannot understand how religious people accept 1000 year old beliefs and have it so engrained in their core.
What does the government gain from doing this? More kids in foster care? Satisfaction from a few people?
"I find ironic what the GOP christian conservatives did to undocumented children at the border and yet in the same breath say that the life of an undocumented unborn child is more important than abortion rights of a us citizen. Truth is, this is about religious fascism. We the people shouldn‚Äôt have to be forced to conform to christian idealism."
"I understand that most pro-lifers are christian. But, what I don't understand is how these same christians most likely never even considered fostering children...something they will have to answer to God on judgement day. The whole reason they're so adamant about abortion is because it makes them feel godly empowered. Y'all pro-choicers have to start guilt-tripping the christians into opening their homes to foster children...isn't there a verse that talks about how many will be thrown to hell for not doing things like feeding the homeless, taking care of the parent-less, etc?"
"It's none of my business as a Christian what unrighteous persons do.
It's unchristian to interfere with others."
"I agree with life first, but not by religious involvement in politics.
All religions involved will be destroyed soon, amen, you should believe that fact."
"Religious interference in politics did this unbiblical action.
Jesus commanded his true followers to, ""keep without spot from the world."" Not to get involved in it in any way."
"Amazing how every lefty has some extreme account to give in an effort to show that abortion is good for women. If every case was as the lefties say they are then surely the issue you need to address is abuse on women, but in your lefty mind the problem is solved by ruthlessly destroying the the one party involved who is the most innocent of all.  Joe Biden judgement day is coming, every doctor making a living of this - judgement day is coming.  To all you pro abortionists, you say you will never stop fighting, I want you to know that my brothers and I have the armour of God on and we will never stop fighting evil.  The battle belongs to the Lord and He said the righteous will inherit the land.  Come, bring your fight, God will have the glory and it will be in your faces continuously."
"Any monster that could cruely and violently serial kill their own children, has serious and extreme mental issues."
"Hmmmm,is it just me,or are the anti abortion women a bit ugly,and the pro women pretty? And I would love to know what the ugly woman meant when she said abortion has been reeking havoc on communities? Surly its unwanted children that are generally more problematic? Just my opinion, but surly only one person has the right to decide,the woman who is pregnant,not a bunch of protesters who have no idea of each individual circumstance!"
Baby killer
"Just wondering, isn't there a 3Month time period? I just generally want to know why would someone not get an abortion before that time if you don't want to have a baby? I might be wrong though"
"Americans seem to have some pretty warped ideals. On the one hand they've outlawed abortion, in thrall to those self righteous, holier than thou types who believe that the moment of conception means life and it's sanctity thereof. Even though it's not a sentient being and being no more than a collection of cells, would never be capable of existing outside the womb. Conversely - and some may say perversely - we have the thorny question of gun control. It seems the high and mighty can plead the so called 'barbarity' of abortion. But bringing in rigid gun controls is apparently impossible, and so every few weeks more and more innocent people will be going about their daily routine completely unaware that they're not going to see another day, because some individual found it way too easy to accumulate a raft of guns and ammo and had got a grievance. Americans really need to reassess their priorities."
"If these people believe so strongly that they don't want to get pregnant, why not get sterilised instead? That way they can sleep about as much as they won't and not need to ever have an abortion."
"wow, the US is going so backwards it's becoming 4th world country. it already has no decent healthcare or has one that kills it's people, and now this??? in 2022???
this is literally ""back to middle ages because the bible said so"". Disgusting!!!!!!
how can someone be so EVIL to want this much to take away basic choice from another?!?! you leave your life the way you want but to watch to take away this medical right from another? it's plain EVIL!!!!! and ignorant, backwards, primitive.. I have no words!!! üò∞üò∞ü§¨ü§¨"
Those women in the rally wants to kill their own babies?
"right so lets kill kids since ther lives will b shit,,, christ u talk about a dead end job so many ppl frm around the world risk everythi ng to escape into america u rt out of touch daniel"
"I think it is extraordinary that it was legal to kill an innocent baby for the convenience of the mother.

The baby's body and soul belong to the baby.
The rights of the mother do not extend to it.

Banning abortion is a revolutionary decision.
I am very happy to see that no more helpless babies will be deprived of life.
I am very pleased.
God bless all babies!"

"I literally have a video from my local news of the Catholic Church telling the news in an interview that they have spent a lot of money and time on this and won‚Äôt stop until they achieve it‚Ä¶.not all Christian people are bad by no means but this is why, at the least in America, Christianity is becoming more and more hated and why there are less and less Christians.
Our government is supposed to leave religious beliefs out of decisions because we are not just a Christian nation, we have freedom of religion. But yet everyone trying to pass this have been doing so based on THEIR religious beliefs. Have your Christian beliefs by all means, but don‚Äôt force everyone else to live by Christian rules regardless of their religion.
They will still happen as they did for thousands of years, you only cause more problems with this law. And the facts these don‚Äôt account for rapes and/or abusive relationships that the other person may not safely have an abortion within that window of time if at all, it‚Äôs absolutely absurd. I know if I was a woman and I was raped and became pregnant I will find whatever way possible to abort that child till the day of birth. Imagine having to live and look after a child from someone who did that to you, especially with features that person had, fuck that! That would be hell on earth right there, a very miserable time that doesn‚Äôt go away."
The baby is chopped up like a chicken. So happy with this ruling.
"Dear BBC.  There never was a ""constitutional right to abortion"" in the USA.  You can read the US Constitution all you want, but the word ""abortion"" is not there."
"Doesn't anybody realise that this is not just about abortion ?
This is about taking away the privacy of a woman !
It a woman is pregnant or not is nobody's business but the woman's herself !
Now if a woman wants to travel states in the US she will have to take a pregnancy test first !
This is outright crazy !"
"I haven't seen one good looking anti abortionist, so of course they don't care no one would dare to get them pregnant"
It's not the fact that the justices were pro-life it's the fact that the justices were upholding our constitution something the other three and liberal activists failed to ever do
First of all abortion is not outlawed it just goes back to the States and there will always be abortion in United States sorry to say. Your rhetoric is disgusting as our president or should I say our illegitimate president
What it means in practice is that individual states make their own mind up about it and the government let's them don't see a problem with that I do believe there are cases where abortion should be allowed but with strict time restrictions that's my opinion
"My body my choice,  except for masks.  Lol."
SCOTUS shot down a RULING not a right yesterday. Returning it to the states where it should have gone in ‚Äò73! What Dems are pissed about is rulings from judges are no longer considered ‚Äú law‚Äù. Pass a law on abortion. No one ever voted on roe v wade. And abortion is NOT in the constitution! Oh no. . . Babies might live!!
The inmates are truly taking over the asylum.

I am so happy it was overturned . Every child should have the right to live
I agree with libs on one thing . I believe they should not have kids either .
Looks like Margaret Atwood‚Äôs Gilead is not far away. I thought America was a free country
"Well that is perfect, go Americans. Get children nobody wants and then they can buy guns and kill other children. And the history showed how great it works when abortions are not allowed. So stupid."
"YOUR BODY, OUR CHOICE."
"You people that call evil good and good evil. Preserving the ultimate innocence, which is a pure unborn life should be the number one priority for every living female. Its an absolute shame and tragedy that it has to be the government that teaches  people a basic instinct such as this."
"If you believe in God and religion, that's YOUR business. Don't do an abortion. But don't force your beliefs on others."
"People need to understand there is a difference between having an abortion because it is ""inconvenient"" and having an abortion because the women will die ..."

The Psalmist said it was God who joined his bones together IN HIS MOTHER'S WOMB! (Psalms 139:13-19)

Psalms 139:13-19
[13]For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother's womb.
[14]I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Your works, And my soul knows it very well.
[15]My frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth;
[16]Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Your book were all written The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them.
[17]How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them!
[18]If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand. When I awake, I am still with You.
[19]O that You would slay the wicked, O God; Depart from me, therefore, men of bloodshed.

UNBELIEVABLE WTF
As an American we no longer Can't say anything about human rights since what the Supreme Court did Stripping women's constitutional right  to privacy Write to her own body and so on And until we fix that.
"Having an abortion should not be a crime but a right because there can be a lot of variables  leading to it such as rape, incest or unwanted pregnancies due to lack of sexual education or it could be a financial burden if you are struggling to survive. There is also genetic malformation or in rare cases such as ectopic pregnancies death of the mother will take place if the pregnancy is not terminated. I don't believe is a decision that will ever be easy due to moral, emotional or religious beliefs but the choice should not be criminalized. Whether to do it or not should be a personal choice since it is the female individual that will have to carry and deliver the child and later on raise it or decide to have the infant go into an already overwhelmed and broken system."
I live in Georgia and I was adopted and I wish I‚Äôd never been born my parents were physically and mentally abusive mainly mentally we moved around so much I never got to leave roots anywhere and I am also physically disabled now being forced to live in a disability system that forces disabled people to live in poverty. I am the living proof that so-called pro life people are in fact not pro life they are only forced birth because if they were truly pro-life they would‚Äôve liked politicians to take things like foster care adoption disability and other social services extremely seriously and would fund them with whatever they needed and with whatever they could instead they routinely elect politicians primarily Republicans who routinely try to restrict these programs and rights on a regular basis Lindsey Graham most recently and famously came out in an interview admitting such at least if someone claims to be pro life and yet is a Democrat I can somewhat believe them to disagree with them because at least they actually support all the policies that actually make life worth living for millions of people.

"Abortion is never an easy choice but sometimes it can save life.. Brave women, stay strong in fighting for your rights.. 

EDIT: I got a lot of hate from people who say FOSTER CARE is good answer. 
- There are 400 000 children in foster care, 26 000 age out each year and are instantly homeless 
- Most who age out have disability
- Children in foster care sre 4x more likely to get SAed 
- More than half of child sex trafficking victims recovered were from foster care/group homes 
- 40% of foster care kids reported abuse or neglect.

Do you still think foster care is better? Do you want more babies put in that hell becouse of new system?"
"""the land of the free"""
"Not cute for semi-fascist BBC to give so much preference to ""pro lifers."""
"The ""unborn"" has ""right-to-life"" at the ""point--of-conception"".  Said Rep. Kevin McCarthy, aspiring 'Speaker-of-the-House' in-waiting.

Justice Thomas of the Supremes wrote the opinion to fulfill that belief by overturning a previous ruling over forty-years old, in an unprecedented legal retrogression,
to give 'States-Rights' primacy over matters of whether a woman's right to self-determination regarding her pregnancy is ""trumped"" by a zygote's ""legal-right"".

The ruling is riddled with self-contradiction.  The premise is ""Life begins at the point-of-conception"".

Those same ideological corners in states ruled by such sweeping fundamentalism, are the same entities which often deny the 'right-to-life'  to those already born.

This Concept-of-'Life' is rudely terminated at birth.  

It denies the mother that right, even if continued pregnancy carries the risk of harm to her survival (or even to the fetus if carried to term while undergoing, say chemotherapy).  Such decisions of life and death are best left to the patient and her medical provider.  Decisions of health, made on evidence-based science.  NOT on EXTREME IDEOLOGY.

Another glaring contradiction is this concept of 'Right-to-Life' is denied at the gates-of-the-penitentiary, to those on DEATH-ROW.

It is even denied at the gates-of-Elementary-School, to little children (the 'Already-Born'), barely growing out of the baby-fat gained at birth.   Their 'Right-to-Life' is trumped by the ""Right-to-Bear-Arms"".


Why stop there?  Actually, we don't.  Those ideologues are the same ones who think nothing of supporting Neo-Liberal foreign-policy, which insist on bellicose adventures, by shipping overseas $50 Billion-Dollars worth of weaponry, to fight a PROXY-WAR-OF-CHOICE.   Weapons, some of which ------------------------->>

. . . end up in the hands of MASS-SHOOTERS, who had LEGALLY PURCHASED, such high-powered WEAPONS-OF-WAR to deny the 'Right-to-Life' for little-children ALREADY-BORN."
"üåü Abortion Stats üåü
From the abort73 and Guttmacher Institute  websites that are dedicated to women's right to abortions..

üåü Ages of Women getting abortions.
young girls - 19 = 8.7%
20-39 = 87%
+40 = 3.7%
ü§î The narrative of young women making mistakes is used to cover up grown women who are using poor üêà management and getting pregnant.

üåü Reasons they got abortions 
Sexual assaults and health problems accounted for less than 4%.
4% Interfere with education 
7% Not mature to be a parent 
8% Don't want to be a single mom
19% Done with having kids
23% Can't afford a baby 
25% Not ready 
6% Other
ü§î So... the narrative of victimhood and health risks are BS to cover up that grown women have unprotected sex. They don't want to be inconvenienced by a child. They need American tax dollars to bail them out.

ü§£ I'm cool with that if the Father's have the right to financially option out of parenthood. Women forced fatherhood on millions of men. If women can delete a baby then Father's should be able to peacefully walk away. That some equality I can vote for."

What are your british laws on abortion???
"Telling it the way it is. Like it or not, I don't care!

Here's what my position on Abortion was. I didn't care! I've always thought a woman should have the right to have a child or not. Her body her choice and all that.

But then something changed. I heard about a case out of Mississippi that was trying to put limits on when an abortion could take place. Not if, only when! They didn't want to ban abortion, in fact at the time federal law wouldn't have allowed them to do that. They just wanted to have a say on at what point it's a person that needs protections. Well the abortionists didn't want any restrictions on when an abortion could occur and that is where they Fucked up! Because most americans aren't willing to go that far! 

In my naive beliefs on abortion I thought it was something that was being done when it was just a blob of cells in a petri dish, something that didn't even resemble a human, especially not a little human being that could even feel pain, a person! 

So once I found out that was the case I decided to investigate further. And I found out there are people and states that have no problem with aborting all the way up to full term babies and that's a bridge too far in most Americans opinions. So yes now it will be an each individual state decision. Most people don't want to live under California or New York laws, that's why they don't live there.

I predict the next big Supreme Court fight will be, when does that baby have constitutionally protected rights like ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" At what point is He or She a human being deserving of mercy and a chance to live their life! At what point does the unborn baby become the injured party and not the mother! These are all questions that will need to be answered in the highest court in the land! This time around they will have a whole lot of science to help figure that question out, unlike the 1970s!

Just sayin..."

"Joe Biden correct in 2006 ""I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy, and I think that it should be rare and safe, and I think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions. And there ought to be able to have a common ground and consensus as to do that,"""

"Oppose the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on abortion rights.
The Court on June 24, 2022 ended the right to abortion in a seismic ruling that shreds half a century of constitutional protection. In a significant curtailment of women‚Äôs rights, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, a 1973 landmark decision giving women in America the right to have an abortion before the foetus is viable outside the womb ‚Äî before the 24-28 week mark. 

The ruling sent shock waves sparking protests. Abortion rights ‚Äî which have been available to women for over two generations ‚Äî will now be determined by individual States.

Also overturned on Friday, was Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 case that upheld Roe .The Conservative Justices are picks of Donald Trump who had said he would appoint justices who are ‚Äúpro life‚Äù (opposing abortions).

‚Äú With sorrow ‚Äî for this court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have lost a fundamental constitutional protection ‚Äî we dissent,‚Äù wrote liberal justices adding that the decision ‚Äúbreaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law‚Äù.

‚ÄúIn doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the court‚Äôs legitimacy,‚Äù liberal Justices wrote.

We the Rights activists are concerned that there could be a domino effect on these other rights.

U.S women have lost the fundamental right to make informed decisions about their own bodies.

Before Roe was made law of the land there was a time when women risked losing their lives getting illegal abortions. A time when government denied women control over their reproductive functions, forced them to move forward with pregnancies they didn't want, and then abandoned them once their babies were born.

This horrifying decision will have devastating consequences, and it must be a wake -up call, especially to the young people who will bear its burden.

The court has a strong conservative bent, which is based on a 6-3 majority, was evident this week. Friday‚Äôs decision comes a day after the Supreme Court rolled back restrictions in New York State on who may carry concealed guns in public.

""The decision is a tragic error and a sad day for the court and the country.The court has done what it has never done before, expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans. Roe had protected a woman‚Äôs right to choose, her right to make intensely personal decisions with her doctor, free from the interference of politics‚Äù said Democratic U.S President Joe Biden.

All are requested to oppose and react peacefully on the rulings on abortion rights and gun culture. The right to privacy, liberty, equality, personal freedoms should be protected."
I‚Äôm pro life and against abortion. It‚Äôs inhumane and murder. The fetus feels pain when the act of abortion is conducted cause nerves are one of the first things our bodies form. It‚Äôs a mystery whether the fetus feels pain before or after 13 weeks but it‚Äôs not responsible to take chances based on curiosity

"The right to privacy in reproductive services is what Roe was ultimately decided on.  There's nothing in our Constitution about women or reproductive rights. Religious organizations fought Roe because for many, their annual budget relied on adoption fees.  Newborns are in the highest demand. For centuries churches sought unwed pregnant women to gain access to newborn to sell or adopt for a fee.  The only care about children from gestation to delivery, that's because they want newborns to fuel their religious organizations."
its all one big satanic mess
Feminist want abortion because she want funny sex....
Abortion is murder and abortion is illegal...
"Abortion is woman's right. Okay, you have your right. 

What about the baby inside your womb? Did he/she  told you to abort him/her? Baby should have right too right? 

You see, this abortion thing is easy to be settle. It comes with your decision at first. Why you go and have sex at the first place? What is the reason? There you have it. That's the jackpot and legitimate question. Why you had sex at the first place? For fun? For what?  

Now, I know some of these women are a victim of crime such as raped victim, or poor living condition that lead to early sex. What else, brother and sister doing sex (do stupid things) and so forth. I understand about all of this victims situation and for this reason as well, I don't encourage them to have an abortion at the first place. No. Absolutely not. Go to the doctor's or report your case to the nearest Police Station for next action taken. 

As for parents, they have the responsibility to teach their children from an early age about sex and what is right about it and what is wrong. 

The Churches and other religious believe need to teach their believers the right and wrong about Abortion and Having Sex. 

For the LAW, increase the  punishment for those who raped, so that people know that raped is a very serious crime and can lead to heavier punishment by law. 

Lastly, Sex is a gift from God and we should use it in the right way. The same thing with baby. It is the gift from God. God is the only one who have the absolute right whether to take life or not. 

For female, you could learned martial arts too, you know, to protect yourself. You never know what will happened to you when you walk by yourself at night. Carry weapon too. Just for protection."

"The latin word for  medicine? ""Medicina"" It means the Art of healing or means of healing from medicines, relating to healing, from medeor or medicor to heal or cure. All actions of the medical profession belong in the arena of healing and prevention of disease or illness from natural or unnatural causes. Abortion is not medical treatment to preserve life or to prevent it's decline. Therefor it cannot be place in any category of medical treatment. It has nothing to do with a denial of a persons rights. No one has the right to demand through law a person to take take an action against them that is causing harm and the killing of living cells and life form within the body of a person. Harming the women and the women in agreement to harming a living life is the real criminal act here. The courts have no right to redefine medical treatment as a right to not save life, but to destroy it. A Women may think and feel anything she wishes, but she cannot force others to agree with her and demand them to pay for destructive actions against her and the unborn. There is a distinct difference between medicine preserving life and curing people from disease then using the platform of medicine to destroy."

Abortion over 22 weeks is murder!
"The decision by the Supreme Court was done to correct the actual original decision done by the court regarding the issue under debate (abortion). It is the original ""decision"" made by the court that was incorrect and unconstitutional.  The ruling that has now been CORRECTED has no effect on the issue of abortion itself.  The issue could have been about anything, not just Abortion.   The decision has now been CORRECTED and allows for all voices of the people to be heard on the issue under debate (abortion)  as opposed to only one side, which is what happened as a result of the original incorrect decision made by the court."

So if they can tell young children to take puberty blockers, they can get young girls sterilettes or free birth control pills and teach boys about wearing condoms and responsibility towards their partners."
"It's a states rights issue.  The great thing about America is that if you don't like how a state is run, you can move. Whereas the British government constantly shits on their citizens rights and doesn't give a fuck because you can't do anything about it."

I know my comment maybe a bit harsh But this may deter Young women of the younger generation to think long and hard about pregnancy and that they can't just throw away an Unborn life if they have second thoughts SO people need to stop whinging and start thinking that's what the grey matter is the for

"The Unborn Are Fully Human

The most significant debate is about when life begins. Is the unborn child fully human or tissue? It cannot be both. When does human existence begin? Science says that at nineteen days, a heart starts to beat, and at forty days, the heart output is almost twenty percent of an adult.

In God‚Äôs eyes, an unborn child is entirely a human being. Scripture also contends life begins before birth and refers to the unborn and born interchangeably. One is as fully human as the other. For example, God reassures Jeremiah, the prophet, of his importance by showing him he was known before he was born. ‚ÄúGod knew him as fully human before his birth. Before I formed you in the womb I knew you before you were born, I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations‚Äù (Jeremiah 1:5).

King David wrote about how God knew him fully before he was born. ‚ÄúFor you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother‚Äôs womb ...Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be‚Äù (Psalm 139:13, 16).

When Luke writes about Elizabeth and Mary greeting each other, he speaks of the unborn John the Baptist as a baby. ‚ÄúWhen Elizabeth heard Mary‚Äôs greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the¬†Holy Spirit‚Äù (Luke 1:41).

To end life through abortion divides life into the unborn and born, and we learn through Scripture this opposes God‚Äôs view of both being equally human."
"A lot of unwanted children are going to be fucked up! Good job. 

America is such a shitshow!

Luckily you can just punch a pregnant woman in the stomach and get rid of it that wayüëçüèª"
"Wtf is this. Abortions nowadays becamr like going to have a tea. You need to educate your children!! This is not a way of protection! There are some cases where it is  needed but to have abortion just because you don't care, it is stupid."
"NO. No ""Right to Abortion"" was struck down. The Federal Government via the court has handed the right to access this medical procedure back to the individual States. The Federal Government can no longer force individual States to perform abortion procedures. In any State were abortion is legal...  then abortion is still legal. Only in States that have outlawed abortion as of the time of this ruling, is it now illegal. The BBC can't even do Journalism."
The right to an abortion was not struck down. It‚Äôs easier to get an abortion in the US than UK
"Wonderful day 
God is 
Great"
"Abortion is murder and all of you supporting it are forgetting that that‚Äôs an innocent child. There is no difference between a child in the womb and outside the womb. Saying that they‚Äôre going to have a hard life means you are saying people who are poor and endure adversity have less valuable lives and would be better off not existing. If you don‚Äôt want to have a baby then be more careful or don‚Äôt have sex. If a life gets created, it‚Äôs no longer your choice and you don‚Äôt get to kill a child because it‚Äôs inconvenient to you"
Cope harder
"Abortion is murder yet a necessary evil.
It is primarily liberals who get abortions It goes with the mentality. Abortion keeps democrats from breeding more democrats and that's a good thing.
20 million black babies aborted 
30 million white liberal babies aborted That's 50 million fewer democrat voters Praise Jesus."

Nobody has the right to tell another person what to do with their own body when it doesn't affect them personally. Full stop.
Arguments for justification give  me the right to take any action.
"My mother got pregnant years ago despite her IUD. It caused a very complicated pregnancy that put her life on jeopardy and she had to have an abortion to save her life. 

My childhood friend‚Äòs dad left. Her mom got interned into a psych ward soon after. She worked like a beast to get the best grades and crumbled when she discovered that she got pregnant. She could barely afford rent with the help of her boyfriend and had no family to help. I can‚Äôt even fathom what kind of life she‚Äôd have if she didn‚Äôt have an abortion.  

I‚Äôve been severely depressed and anxious for as long as I can remember. At times, I couldn‚Äôt even function normally without meds. I do my best but I‚Äôm still very mentally unstable. If I ever got pregnant and was forced to give birth, it would be a disaster. With the emotional and physical turmoil that comes with pregnancy, it would be a miracle if I make it to the delivery without attempting to end my life."
The Biden Presidency has been a complete and utter abortion.

"God is in control  of His people. No more abortion! No more and no more.  My ex told me to abort my last boy, I refused,  my boy now is 6 years old boy going to year 2 school class. Women sex is not a fun, sex is responsibility and sacred and when it come to abortion  it is life destroyer!. If it come from rape or sickness ask God to give you grace to carry it. You will not believe  what child would be and might be a glorious child that give you that joy  you will never expected. Stay save women."

US gives too much power to those unelected judges !"
"US will get dumber even more as more children with 47 chromosomes are born !
More marriages will be wrecked as a result !"
"The SCOTUS ruling striking down _Roe v. Wade_ simply causes this scenario to revert to what it was prior to January, 1973. I remember in those days, if a woman lived in a state that didn't allow abortions, she simply went to another state where it was legal, and had the medical procedure done there. Again, this procedure *is not* banned in all 50 states as the result of this SCOTUS opinion."
"Why does abortion exist. So many reasons to have one, but what about thinking about not getting into that situation in the first place. Why not try to not get pregnant. That goes for men and women. There is always a medical exception and should be allowed. But also I think it's time for men to prtest that it is not fair that they have no say , especially if they want to give up their rights and financial obligation. When a women decides to not get an abortion, when the father wants her to have one, He is forced into child support. In the times we live in, where is the equality."
"It doesn't matter just go to California or the blue states for abortion if the red states ban it.
And trust me most of us men don't want to be father as we will only get divorce raped by alimony and child support.

1) drunk women/men not thinking consequences.

2) idiotic 17-25  years old people who don't really care  about anything and just do their
 thing.

3) women who may keep the child for  for taking money from their partner.

ofc rapes , healthy couples that got an accident etc are excluded.

NO mention of murder being healthcare.....  What I have, in fact, found is murder is illegal and healthcare is to preserve life."

No matter what side you're on it is a great day for America, for our constitution and for our democratic republic.¬† A great day for women, the unborn and human rights."
"For my British/European friends who are being duped into believing that this is ""A step backwards,"" by the fear pornographers (the media). All this ruling does is return the issue to the states. It's what we call Federalism. Abortion is no longer in the federal purview where it didn't belong in the first place.

You may be surprised to learn that some states, like California or New York , will probably make abortions even easier to get then during Roe.

This is all the Left's fault BTW.  As part of their asinine Woke Revolution, they tried to make any abortion for any reason, early trimester, late term, the day before birth, legal. And... they demanded that those abortions be taxpayer funded. It's all related to their idiotic premise that gender is oppressive and women, er... excuse me ""Birthing people,"" are being oppressed by this tyrannical ""Fetus"" that they don't want freeloading inside of them and making them be RESPONSIBLE.  Oh! the humanity!

And right on cue, enter Donald Trump..."

"There should be grief counseling for people thinking about killing their child. They should also be told what actually happens to the baby. and how corporations profit from the little body.

And yet thinking before having sex with everyone is a solution not an abortion.
they are angry because pookie got regulated

"Stop having sex with men.  Even better, no marriage, no children, no dating.  Learn from the South Korean women's 4B (now 6B4T) movement.  SK decriminalized abortion in 2021 after a nearly 70-year ban"

Bearing arms is a ‚Äòright‚Äô ‚Ä¶ killing babies isn‚Äôt in the constitution.
"Finally these babies have rights, thank you Jesus , We have to many contaceptions today to accidentally get pregnant , if you are in any situation and their is a chance you can get pregnant you should set up an appointment as soon as possible to get protection they have the 5 years plan, these streets have been running over with the Blood of the innocence, this quick fix have cause more harm then anything , i am pro life And also the same women that get pregnant call it a mistake and keep doing what us Women i am talking about Real ones need to be more Responsible and take precaution this 2022 and we still saying we made a Mistake, SAD."
"The U.S is a nation in conflict with itself lacking direction and purpose and most of its decisions are frictional and transactional. It cannot, control its gun violence, women's rights have been setback decades and decades. Its governments is either in inertia or moving towards the religious right, guided by the Supreme Court that is out of touch. In foreign affairs it is either starting wars for the benefit of its economy or failing to stop wars for the benefit of is economy.

millions   of  children  born    who  will  care   for   the  children whose  mothers are unable   to care for   them...   a lack of  money a lack of maturity    What of the  children born  as a result of rape?   r  Stupid  Stupid  selfish men  no where near  when they have  to pay child support!!!!
"I have a good idea, how about all men, especially those who are most opinionated get vasectomies at birth, so then when couples are ready for children, they get it reversed. Wouldn't this vastly reduce the need for abortions?"
"It would be interesting if people, even the very poor and destitute, make a mass exodus outside of these states if they fear that they may need these services at any moment, and that the population demographics shift, but I think what will happen instead are that people will just not get as many abortions in those places, won't drive out of state, and will just carry the pregnancies to term or will find ways to stop the pregnancies which are illegal in those areas. I might have preferred that people leave states and no longer pay taxes in states where they feel the government is not representing them properly, or otherwise, if they wish, stay there and wage political campaigns to get those states to make things legal that they want to be legal, but the problem is, it appears the majority in some places may actually not be like them or on their side, so it would be hard to convince a new group of people to be the majority, to move in a bunch of people who will become the majority otherwise, and it seems much more easy to just leave, even if one has to hitchhike out of a place, and start a new life elsewhere.

I might also not mind if a lot of people decide to leave America altogether, maybe not directly regarding this issue, but just in general, seeing as how unstable it has seemed to become, how polarized, how crime-filled and dangerous it seems to be, it just might not be worth living there anymore, except in very out of the way places without much action or social interaction. It is extremely difficult for people to leave the country though since other countries don't typically allow such a thing, but people should definitely try, even if it takes measures such as marrying people in other countries or whatever is necessary, even illegally entering those countries potentially, if it is a decision between living in poverty in some crime filled place or getting out and being free from America and the scary state it is currently in (for the last decade basically, and really since Bush Jr.)."

Kangaroo court is a branch of the tableland and needs to be burnt to the ground the country dose not need gun  loving court and hates woman and children and they love guns and kill the separation of church an state minority rule in America they made it great again for the men and the religious cooks fuck them all
"I can personally say that I'm happy that the people who support abortion will rally together to continue to support it. I do not support it and I am happy to know that my tax dollars are not going towards the funding of something I, personally do not believe in. As an American citizen it's my right. As an American citizen it's also the right of the people to rally together to support the causes that speak to them personally. The media always makes one side louder than the other. I would like to hear from the mothers who have struggled and despite their struggle honored their belief not to abort their children and have still persevered. I know them personally. They spent countless hours studying for degrees, working at strip clubs, doing hair etc., so they can take care of babies that they did not plan for. We never seem to hear from those women. I'm sure single Parenthood in general is not easy but we all have our choices to make. Whether they're right or wrong it's not for anyone to judge but it's everyone's right to support the causes that they deem Worthy."
YES!! Yes!! Yes. Thank God.

"Ironically, the same Democrats who pushed mandatory vaccines and decried grievances against the 2020 election as the ‚Äúend of democracy‚Äù are complaining about a real return to democracy.

‚ÄúWe thought that was democracy and yet the very people who‚Äôve been lecturing us for years about democracy ‚Äî ‚Äòit‚Äôs the end of democracy‚Äô ‚Äî are horrified by the return of democracy,‚Äù Carlson said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre telling us the legitimacy of our institutions is at risk and yet they cannot allow voters to have a say in how they live. What does that tell you? It tells you they care about power, not popular support.‚Äù

Since the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling, over a dozen states have already banned abortion as a result of ‚Äútrigger laws‚Äù on their books. California and New York lawmakers, on the other hand, have vowed to make their states ‚Äúsanctuaries‚Äù for abortion access.

Democracy is already in action.


Leftists Freak That SCOTUS Has Overturned Their Ability To Kill Unborn"
"‚ÄúRoe was one of those decisions you never heard anyone defend on its own terms. Lots of people want legal abortion, but no one‚Äôs ever explained how exactly the Constitution guarantees that,‚Äù Carlson explained. ‚ÄúRoe was a political document. It was not a legal opinion and for that reason, its existence degraded and undermined the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, one of our country‚Äôs central institutions. It was poison.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe purpose of the Supreme Court is simple. It‚Äôs to determine whether the laws that politicians pass are consistent with the United States Constitution. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all the Supreme Court does.‚Äù

Carlson explained that the issue of abortion is now left up to individual states, exactly as democracy and the American political system is supposed to function.

‚ÄúWhat the Supreme Court does not do, what it cannot do and should never do is make laws and it should never do that because a court making laws would be, by definition, anti-democratic,‚Äù Carlson noted. ‚ÄúNone of the nine Supreme Court justices has been elected by anyone. All of them have lifetime appointments. If you cared about democracy and wanted democracy to continue, you would demand that all laws in the United States be passed by elected legislatures. Again, no matter how you feel about abortion or any other specific issue. In a democracy, voters have the final word on how they are governed. That‚Äôs what democracy is.‚Äù

Which means if some states want abortion, their legislatures can vote for it. If not, they won‚Äôt, the Fox News host said.

‚ÄúNow, after nearly half a century, voters have had their rights restored on the question of abortion. If they like abortion, they can vote to legalize abortion. If they don‚Äôt like abortion, they can vote to ban abortion. That‚Äôs not shocking. That is how our system is supposed to work, not being a monarchy and all. So, what‚Äôs the argument against this? Well, there isn‚Äôt one, really and we know that for certain from the dissent in today‚Äôs Supreme Court ruling.‚Äù"

"The Silent Scream

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This Documentary Is Not Recommended For Sensitive People!

The documentary, 'The Silent Scream' released in 1984 contributed to the abortion debate in the 1980s.

Dr. Bernard Nathanson's classic video shocked the world. He explains the procedure of a suction abortion, followed by an actual first-trimester abortion as seen through ultrasound. The viewer can see the child's pathetic attempts to escape the suction curette as her heart rate doubles, and the fetus (girl) opened its mouth in what Nathanson calls a ""Silent Scream"" as her body is torn apart.

The clip begins with an ultrasound of the fetus (girl) who is about to be aborted. The girl is moving in the womb; displays a heartbeat of 140 per minute; and is at times sucking her thumb. As the abortionist's suction tip begins to invade the womb, the child rears and moves violently in an attempt to avoid the instrument. Her mouth is visibly open in a ""Silent Scream."" the child's heart rate speeds up dramatically (to 200 beats per minute) as she senses aggression. She moves violently away in a pathetic attempt to escape the instrument. The abortionist's suction tip begins to rip the baby's limbs from its body, ultimately leaving only her head in the uterus (too large to be pulled from the uterus in one piece). The abortionist attempts to crush her head with his forceps, allowing it to be removed. To ""dehumanize"" the procedure, the abortionist and anesthesiologist refer to the baby's head as ""number 1."" the abortionist crushes ""number 1"" with the forceps and removes it from the uterus.

"It's about time there was term limits set on abortions in the states. It's absolutely sick that up until now, there were no term limits and they could abort babies up to 9 months. Americas abortion laws were the same as North Korea. So I'm glad that there are now term limits in place."
The 6 week/ 15 week abortion bans are not okay! What if a women doesn't get regular periods and doesn't find out until later that she is pregnant
Abortion I do not support that it's not right to do abortions so women should be more careful now with their bodies get marriage and make babies give them good live remember who's said abortion if ur parents did the same u would not be in this world now some sacrifice their life just to make sure their babies lives so what wrong

Yeah it's a mans world don't expect the courts to enforce child support payments though just because they expect you to have the baby and tolerate the abuse that accompanies that.  Not sexy at all.

The problem is if we believe in God who said you shall not kill
"It is totally rational,it should be the state to regulate it depending theirs citizens choice!"
"so for the 95% of people that are crying about losing the right to abort a baby, not because they were raped or there are some extreme health problems, but because having a baby is inconvenient for them. Here's a fun fact if you're worried about getting pregnant. DON'T HAVE SEX!
Problem solved, If you're that afraid of having a baby don't risk making one. Or get your eggs removed or whatever, don't blame someone else for your lack of control. And if you do have an abortion and it goes wrong because you chose to do it somewhere illegally, well that's on you, no one forced you to do it, you decided on that choice yourself.

Name any Article or Ammendment in the US Constitution that directly states abortion as a Constitutional right? Oh it doesn't exist?

"Perhaps these same Judges should pass a law which states that ALL men/boys have a vasectomy unless they are legally married. You can bet that those same Judges would NEVER pass this as a law. You can also bet there would be hundreds of thousands of men who would loudly protest. The laws should be equal for women & men. Plus what are these same Judges going to ensure that American men take care of the children they have already created? How many single women are out there financially taking care of their children but the men of those same children are not forced to actually pay the child
support they are required to pay."
ABSTINACE! AND CELIBACY! WOO! HOO!.
"If women are in positions where they want or need an abortion but legally can't, and the man who got her pregnant doesn't want to keep it or help raise it...he should automatically be given a vasectomy.  It takes two to put an unwanted child in a uterus. Apparently, conservatives are saying that the door is kicked open now for going after same sex marriages and contraception. The conservative ball has started rolling and America is soon to be obsolete on the world stage and moving back towards McCarthyism-thinking with a heavy dash of fascist rule added to it."
"Ok men get the snip what is that a No then stop forcing women to go ahead with pregnancies that you wouldn't stay around for, what about all the unwanted abused kids in state care where is the love there ffs, ok then it should be made illegal to get a woman pregnant and fuck off then stupid world"

 It's something no wants to do, but for the world to be better, we need this right for women. The mothers need to be priority. A child can not be supported if the mother is unable to support themselves. We need better Sex Ed, so this isn't an issue(contraceptives too). The fact that this is illegal means so many people will go to jail over the unborn, who have no voice, and will not appreciate, or disagree with the gesture. It's depressing that people can be born into this world, and wish they had been aborted."
Haha. All the Thots and Slewts are upset and losing they‚Äôre minds. I‚Äôm loving it! Most these dingbats get abortions more than I get McDonald‚Äôs. They‚Äôre all gonna get yeast infections over this. Finally the republicans did something I agree with. Never thought I‚Äôd see the day.

The legacy of Trump in the US will have consequences for decades to come and not in a good way.
"It is funny they fight for killing babies using abortion but the only reason any of them are here is the fact that their mother did not abort them.
This is an issue that has been pushed to control people. It is a lie, it puts the issue back to the states. It is not in the constitution. 50 million babies have been murdered, it is eugenics pushed on our black and poor communities and now Bill and Melinda Gates are building abortion clinics in Africa. It is the will of the people, Roe vs Wade was a fake ,it was planned and used to push Planned Parenthood, she never had an abortion, her daughter is alive today even though her mother gave her up. You are only shown these few instances and not the evil side of abortion. These people are pushing abortion at the moment of birth and allowing the mother and doctor to kill the child while it is alive. It is a for profit organization that earned $1.9 billion last year and received $528 in government money. They sell the fetuses to labs for experimentation and the clinics and doctors receive money for it. What about the dumpsters of aborted babies. Stop pushing propaganda. It is totally out of control. My body, my right is not true, it is not the mothers body it is the childs' body. The left and our education system has brainwashed all these young people minds for decades. it is about money and control, not womens health."
Its almost like someone wants to keep us fighting with each other

"They're going to build a better world with more unwanted or under cared for children...I guess. This means the states can choose to outlaw abortion even if the mothers at risk. I hope most states have the foresight to protect women from potential harm, but I don't have much faith in red state legislators. They care more about the unborn than they do about those of us who are here right now.

Trump and the Republicans had a chance in 2017 to change our lives for the better when they had full control over Congress and the Presidency, but chose to focus on temporary tax relief for the poor and middle class while giving the wealthiest like Trump and his family permanent tax breaks, and packing the SCOTUS to overturn the right to an abortion. Let's not forget about their ""2nd Amendment right"" to kill children who are alive and breathing once again showing they don't care about us."

Once a person has destroyed his or her own child he/she has destroyed a piece of his/her own soul... The pain leads to drug use, alcoholism despondency and destruction.

2 Peter 1:-10 
New Living Translation
So, dear brothers and sisters, work hard to prove that you really are among those God has called and chosen. Do these things, and you will never fall away .
Harvest ( fruits must be there we should not be beating around the bush,,)and sufferings are two eyes of a christian life ,,
An easy way to get sufferings.
When will you get sufferings,,? 
you will get  more sufferings if  you have to put on the full armour of God
When you do good works like christ or take the armour of God (Ephesians 6:-
12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,(D) but against the rulers, against the authorities,(E) against the powers(F) of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.(G) 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God,)
1 john 2:-16 tells us not to love lusts eyes lusts of flesh and pride of life ( our achievements,,)
Because we have to continue to do good works until we die ,,,,,
Good brotheren christians tells this avoid second time ,,( seeing a list ,,)
I couldn't understand that,,,
God even forgives our sins ,,
He called us when we were dead in our sins and lawlessness,,,
But  Christ raised us from spiritual death ,,
We may have no money ,,
We may have no own üè† house,,
But our aim should not be a house or money ,,
This world is not ours ,,
We have no permanent city here ,,
But we should know that without us the world will be dark and saltless,,
But when we lose our saltiness ,,
Matthew 5:13 
‚ÄúYou are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.(
So if are bad christians the world we will be thrown out)
Sufferings are different but saltiness is different,,
We will have sufferings,,
1 Peter 4 
Being Faithful to God
1Christ suffered here on earth. Now you must be ready to suffer as he did, because suffering shows that you have stopped sinning. 2It means you have turned from your own desires and want to obey God for the rest of your life( it means you should take armours of God ,,)
2 Peter 1:-10 
New Living Translation
So, dear brothers and sisters, work hard to prove that you really are among those God has called and chosen. Do these things, and you will never fall away( so we must know in a running race about our speed or we will win the race or we running with real winners or we must closely run with successful evangelists or victorious christians ,,)
Philippines 1;-22
But if I live, I can do more fruitful work for Christ. So I really don‚Äôt know which is better.( It means when Paul was doing ministry he had lot of harvests ,,this is a sign of knowing that God is with us ,,)
When you are doing good works like Jesus (automatically) you will be getting lot of sufferings,,
It is not that we are inviting TROUBLES or sufferings,,,but doing good like Jesus did healing the sick and helping people,,( so automatically you will get sufferings or opposition,)
Or a ministry of  God ( this you can know God's will in your talents and gifts ,,)
Successful christian life is different from ministry of God ,,
You can know your calling of a ministry only by your fruits or results in ministry. üëçüëçüëç
Those sufferings would be helpful to you from sins ,

"How about telling the truth for once? You do know this doesn't make abortion illegal right? It leaves it up to the states to decide. Of course you know that, but you need ratings."
This country would be better if we executed all conservatives.
1:30 personal level? Obviously the product of a failed abortion. Too bad their parents failed
Lets be explicit: The US is not divided on this. 75% are pro-choice (so against this decision)!!!
Thank you Jesus I‚Äôm so tired of seeing women having abortion parties and tired of them getting abortions just for fun tired of see women get abortions just to make their boyfriend mad  my neighbor had 7 abortions I asked her why so many abortions she said she enjoys getting abortions and she do it for fun when she heard the news abortion she stuck a metal clothes hanger up her private part and I called 911 smh
separation of church and state needs to happen right now.
"In a Democrat state that allows abortion up to 9 months, isn't that murder?  
If I were to kick a pregnet woman in the stomach and she lost the unborn child I should be charged with assault ONLY because under their logic the unborn child is not a life. But in those very same states there are people in prison for murder for killing a unborn child. The hypocrisy of what goes on in some liberal state's is unbelievable."
What happened to All Lives Matters
"Anti-abortion is mostly Christian/Catholic belief. However the United States Constitution states there should be division between the state and religion. Even Jesus said ""Give to Caesar what is due to Caesar"". Leave the issue of the state, to the state. Do not meddle. You are forcing your belief to Atheists, Buddhists, Muslims, Jews, Hindus of this Country. Because you are FORCING them to follow Christian beliefs, they will go away and think of Christians very badly. Jesus NEVER forced anyone to convert to Christianity nor follow the commandments. HE PREACHED AND SHOWED LOVE TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN."

Murder is not a right. But sometimes a tragic necessity.
use a condom or drink a pills or abstain from sex but do not go around killing babies
It‚Äôs crazy to see women who are pro life üò®üò®
Good
Yay good news! So glad for this! Children deserve to live!
"Imagine being one of the idiots in the crowd chanting.

This ain't a good thing because abortions will STILL be done, just now much more painfully and unsafely."
What if it was your preteen daughter? she could die from giving birth. Yet America gave more rights to guns than women
Weird the BBC did a whole show on abortion but wouldn't show the procedure or aftermath. I wonder why...
Why are women making a big deal out of this change? Women get pregnant somehow. Right?  Just have some self-control and everything should be just fine.
The constitution DOSE NOT give women the right to an abortion..  Democrats just keep spewing that LIE.  Show me where in the constitution where it says that. It does NOT.
If the chick dies that‚Äôs on her
"Millions of children in the United States are getting the constitutional right to live, after the Supreme Court overturned its landmark Roe v Wade ruling of 50 years ago, which take the children the right to live."
I wonder if those women are going to take care of the abandoned childen or they are just celebrating over nothing
Democracy is going to die in America n india. All the best future citizens üôÇ
This is the most perfect law in US. It will save a lot of people lives and will make women take more responsibility of their pregnancy.
They are not pro life they are pro breeders
"It's hilarious that these people think they had anything to do with this.  The Supreme court didn't do this because these people  changed their mind, they did it because a bunch of conservative cronies with too much bible and not enough brains, put in by another cronie with no brains, made a very very stupid decision.  

Pubs are ALWAYS bitching about paying for people that are in poverty.  Just wait until they see how many more of them there will be now.   A pregnant teenager will now have virtually no chance as a life.  And science is NOT on your side, little girl, science clearly shows that MORE population is the LAST thing this world needs.  But soldier on, idiots.  When other aspects like the environment really start to go South I can tell you who will be bitching most, too.

All I can say is anyone with three working brain cells to rub together better have a few morning after pills set aside."
"No abortion, no sex before marriage,"
"Finaly something good happend in America! 
Satan is very angry and furious, it can be seen on the faces of the people who are indifferent to killing children."
Oprah is the most hurt by this.
What this shows is that the president is not the most powerful man  in the world
I believe this is a subject where men in politics are in no position to have any say.

Right to kill?
"1:40
this lady said that she saw the devastation that that abortion does on a personal level. well has this lady with the red hair and the glasses had a abortion herself? if she hasn't that she needs to keep her mouth shut because I personal level means she had an abortion herself and she knows what it's like to have an abortion if she knows what it's like to have someone rape her but I doubt it that she's ever been raped and I doubted that she's been ever chosen abortion because she's never lived in fear because if she did choose abortion and if she was raped she wouldn't be in that Riley saying yeah now those children are going to live in property congratulations Miss red-haired I know what it's like to have an abortion know you don't"
"I don‚Äôt agree with total prohibition on abortion just as I don‚Äôt agree with legislating abortion from the bench. Congress should do their job and pass a common sense abortion law. Prohibiting all abortions is extreme just as allowing late term and mid term abortions. I doubt the average person cares if an abortion is had in the first trimester but I doubt they‚Äôre ok with it at 7, 8, 9 months. Common sense and compromise must return or we will tear ourselves apart."
Abortion is murder.
"It is Not woman taking woman's rights away but Seven MEN , Just like they did in the past by our ancestors!"
This is almost totally driven by religion put America back 100 years what they going to do next start burning witches bunch of god fearing idiots
"There will be illegal abortion, and this will endanger women more.Think about poor women who won't be able to achieve it . Think about the women who get raped and get pregnant and don't want the child? Think about a woman who got pregnant accidentally and who can't afford a living for herself? Think about the cost of living ? The world is changing more recessions, poor women will suffer the most."
"We are in a new age, not old custom ages. Women should be allowed to choose. Pro-Abortion does not make any women get an abortion, only if that women chooses too. If they don‚Äôt want to give women right to choose then let‚Äôs also go back to the Stone Age and hit women on the head with a stick pull their hair and use them to mate, just because these things were done by cavemen does not mean we still do it. Give women their respect and allow them to choose."
VICTORY üéâüéâ
"the real solution is Flirt with the Right Person, or dont get knocked so easy, why is that so Hard?? learn self defense early so you dont get knocked either, if we are powerful woman why we get knocked so easy? deal with it if you do, properly. Let's all start new, do not be weak, you dont need this law if you become Wise! Flirt with the right person, even if it takes you till you are old! Clean slate for America! Besides, think where the fetus ends, potentially in the mouth of the elite rich for food, gross but investigate, why feed them more?"
"she lift a sign ""my body my choice"" 
how about the Human in your womb 
did you give him his choice to live !
f*** devils
you think you own his life just because he was in your womb !
ridiculous d****heads"
Imprenant the pro life ppl with multiple babies then deny them abortion and take there job and beat them and then tell us what you think
"And then they vote to allow more guns to kill the children when they are no longer an embryo, but real children."
"Zambia appreciates the decision of The US Supreme Court, NO Abortion. We celebrate with you. Amen. Zambia."
"BBC this is disingenuous, it isn‚Äôt radical or of an evil oppressive nature, the US Supreme Court hasn‚Äôt stopped women having an abortion, they have handed that responsibility down to individual states legislature, were if your representative doesn‚Äôt align with your beliefs or moral code, pro choice or anti, you the electorate can elect them or not. Cherry picking at its best."
It's unconstitutional to say you can't get an abortion it goes against you freedom of choice

"The Silent Scream

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This Documentary Is Not Recommended For Sensitive People!

The documentary, 'The Silent Scream' released in 1984 contributed to the abortion debate in the 1980s.

Dr. Bernard Nathanson's classic video shocked the world. He explains the procedure of a suction abortion, followed by an actual first-trimester abortion as seen through ultrasound. The viewer can see the child's pathetic attempts to escape the suction curette as her heart rate doubles, and the fetus (girl) opened its mouth in what Nathanson calls a ""Silent Scream"" as her body is torn apart.

The clip begins with an ultrasound of the fetus (girl) who is about to be aborted. The girl is moving in the womb; displays a heartbeat of 140 per minute; and is at times sucking her thumb. As the abortionist's suction tip begins to invade the womb, the child rears and moves violently in an attempt to avoid the instrument. Her mouth is visibly open in a ""Silent Scream."" the child's heart rate speeds up dramatically (to 200 beats per minute) as she senses aggression. She moves violently away in a pathetic attempt to escape the instrument. The abortionist's suction tip begins to rip the baby's limbs from its body, ultimately leaving only her head in the uterus (too large to be pulled from the uterus in one piece). The abortionist attempts to crush her head with his forceps, allowing it to be removed. To ""dehumanize"" the procedure, the abortionist and anesthesiologist refer to the baby's head as ""number 1."" the abortionist crushes ""number 1"" with the forceps and removes it from the uterus.

Unwanted peasant babies! Yay! I'd rather be aborted
So men: sue planned parenthood for the baby they killed that was half yours...without your consent.
Just remember that a unborn baby is still a like. If you don't want your baby then adopt it out.
loose sex in USA
Banning it isn‚Äôt gonna make it go away. Some women may be desperate enough to do it unsafely. The system is already flooded with so many kids & VERY limited resources. I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs going to look like with this ban.. everyone should have the right to choose
"All those mad libtards, burguers are funny ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"""It means that tens of millions of women across the country no longer have their right to ab abortion guaranteed by the Constitution."" THEY NEVER DID! That's the whole POINT! She's talking as if they wiped it out of the Constitution... Freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, the right to keep and bear arms SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED... Oh, there it is.... The 153rd Amendment the right to an abortion. Gee, how did I miss THAT? I guess I skipped it. What are they going to strike down next? The 10,256th Amendment... Right to free ice cream on National USSA day? What about free coffee to commemorate us putting down the robot uprising? This is a NIGHTMARE!"
"Yesterday was a victory not only for Republicans and Conservatives, but for all of life, when I see children being thrown into garbage cans because of abortion and I see people defending abortion as if it were normal, as if one had the right to speak for a life that cannot defend itself, and that I realize that the human being has not learned anything that the life of the next is disposable, my regrets to all the children who were killed due to abortions and had no one to defend them, more Yesterday justice was done.  congratulations republicans you proved that some people still have a conscience, thank you very much."
"I mean they are technically living the American dream, considering most of them dont seem to even be awake.
Abortion gets re-illegalized if that even is a word, Free Healthcare something that SHOULD BE A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT somehow is being Politicised and I bet you 500‚Ç¨ they'll try to chip away at the VERY RECENT law of legalising Gay Marriage because when a basic right like abortion is stripped away, there is a 50/50 chance they'll try to do it with other Basic Human Right Laws.

Dem states will still kill kids and Republican states will save them. They will never win this fight. It's so time for the left to realize what they are doing not only to America but the world. Biden will not not save America. He will destroy America. This is his plan.
"They say, ""We're letting the States decide. We're delegating that authority to them.""
I've got a better idea: how about the States delegate that authority to the INDIVIDUALS, and let them decide?

For the record, I loathe the idea of abortion, but a) I'm not a woman, and b) if I was nobody could've forced me to have an abortion before, so this is just basically people wanting their personal views to have the force of law over others'. As for protecting the rights of unborn children in the in-utero stages, until there is a clear, agreed-upon universal consensus on when a fetus is considered a living human, then the law has a constitutional interest in erring on the side of individual civil liberty. What pregnant women choose to do with that liberty concerning the health and vitality of the fetus and the consequences thereof is and should be their responsibility to bear."
People are becoming more and more retarded by the time...
Real question is on what basis did the same Supreme Court upheld abortion for so long? GOD IS GREAT
Stop just sleeping around with everybody then u won't be able to aborte simple  it's maybe that sex is now easy

"babys lives matter, i dont think people realize how many people want children . they are willing to pay thousands for them bear.  while i feel rape and health are ok for it but, i'm tired of people playing god  in more than just abortion . we have a democracy so we can choose who better suits that party and their own beliefs . everyone deserves to be married i'm ok with that. why is it the same people wanting to murder babies protest dog shelters from putting down dogs because no one wants them? why is it the same people put likes on stories of premature babies that survive the odds and grow up to be beautiful people."

The young Republican Congress party is also taking its orders for the USA people,it comes from the Crazy Nazis Satan church and it's pastor's.
The Bible doesn't talk about abortion,no where in it, God has nothing to do with what happened on 6/24/2022 the Nazis Republican party"
"What a misleading title, abortion was never a right outlined in the Constitution to begin with, the Supreme Court simply ruled that the power be returned to the people within the individual states where it belongs. Many Americans are too stupid and lack the wherewithal to understand how their Representative Republic was designed to operate, not realizing that 'state's rights' won this victory, which is a beautiful thing. Removing power from a centralized Federal entity and placing that power back into the citizen's hands is what seperates America as a free Republic from countries elsewhere in the world where citizens are actually subjects under centralized authority, as an American myself I'm thoroughly embarrassed with most of my countrymen who do not even understand that they live in a Republic, crying for government tyranny just so they can feel as though they are safe under a nanny state's control mechanisms...so pathetic...!!!"
Isn‚Äôt it just up to the states now? You can go to another state...it‚Äôs not like they made it nationally illegal-just no longer a federal issue.
The problem with america is too much extreme freedom
bbc's sex education should not go to waste
People wants to so much rights to escape accountability and responsibility. Prior to 1973 the abortion was illegal unless the mother's life was in danger. Make sense to me. You can't just take unborn life when you want.

Well you better have great social services because orphanage will sure have alot of customers to serve soon.
"Right to abortion struck down by US Supreme Court - False.
US Supreme Court supreme court decision reversed Federal Law and turn abortion back over to the States Thats it thats all this does. The Headline is Propaganda.  Abortion is still legal in 35 States with some states have some restrictions. 3 more states and Dems can pass a Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing it as a Constitutional right. But Democrats want a wedge issue to win elections .
Roe Vs Wade was Court decision made into law circumvented the Democratic process .  Roe Vs Wade was illegal . Courts in the US don't make laws Congress does. The Courts making law  is Anti-Democracy . 
So Regardless if you're for or against abortion the Federal mandate was unconstitutional.
If Dems don't get off their Bums Conservatives will use the law to go after Gay Marriage in the same way. Gay Marriage was made into law by Executive order. Not by Congress."

No it will not.Theirs going to still be a lot of abortions.Just not done in a medical office.But it will still happen.Who are them to tell women what they can and can't do to their body's.Our body's should not be in their hands/White house vote.My choice My body I choose.

No it wasn‚Äôt.  It was put in the hands of each state to decide.
life has indeed won! praise God
"Just because someone decided to abort there pregnancy doesn't mean it's easy. It's one of the hardest things to decide for yourself. It can be mentally draining, but if they feel like it's still the right thing to do then they should have THE RIGHT!!!!!  To decide if they want to do it. People who think it's just killing a life, aren't thinking of everything else."

"As usual, the BBC has got their facts and their opinions all twisted. 
1.  The SCOTUS did not simply out law abortions across the country.  What they did is leave the decision to do abortions up to the individual states. 

2. There is NO PROVISION IN THE US CONSTITUTION GUARANTEEING THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION.  

What has happened to the BBC!?  Did you get bought out by CNN??
Get your facts straight, report only the facts, and stop trying to stir up fear and anger with your wild, unfounded opinions."
Now there will be millions of homeless  hungry babies
Great day for all those unborn children. God bless the Surpreme court.
"Recently, the CCP began to use its diplomatic power to explain its own faults to the world, and then demanded sympathy from all countries, and once again lured and bribed dignitaries from various countries. Don‚Äôt you know the essence of the CCP?  When he retreats, it is in exchange for time and space for the next attack. As long as he is soft-hearted towards him, he will have to move forward. Have you ever seen the gangster society?  As for Trump, if he takes office, he will bring the United States with him.  .  To hell, because he is a selfish person, he does not understand liberalism, he does not understand the spirit of the founding of the United States, the founding of the United States and the establishment of the Constitution, and can only say that he is a businessman.  And Pompeo is the future president who will truly lead the United States to the right path. For us foreigners, he will be a good president. He can maintain peace in the entire world because he has a righteous heart.  Today, China's banks and real estate are bound to each other. They have a set of funds, which they transfer around and support each other. As long as the people withdraw and run on the money, there will be a series of thunderstorms, because the CCP has no money and all bad debts.  It's all fake cover up."
Stop freaking out.  It's up to the states not completely abolished. BBC STOP SAYING THE RIGHT TO ABORT IS STRUCK DOWN!
"God bless u all , keep growing , 
Unite eachother

Maybe if the Democrats didn't want to use abortion as political football they would have codified this during the Clinton Administration or the Obama Administration... I've heard political operatives say they would never pass it because it's too useful a weapon to use against the right.
"Reminder that this wont drop abortion rates, it will just mean more women die from unsafe abortions, and that's exactly what republicans want. Having this type of power over people makes these justices feel important."
"I‚Äôm not about abortion being used like candy but at least have exceptions like R word, insests, if having baby can kill the mom- like health situations. I‚Äôm sure women are would be more inclined to go for that. This is all population control - control that men are trying to get back. Cant believe being a woman is so hard today. This was a great way to move backwards. üòî"
"RED PILL FACT: If 'some' women were more responsible with their bodies, had some self-respect and respect for the unborn, abortion (minus rape/incest) would never exist. Mic drop."
Oh my god thank god I'm not living in the states I feel sorry for women who are now going to be forced by law to raise a child for all we know could be the end result of a rapist having his way with some poor girl imagine that looking at a child and seeing your attackers face! completely moronic country and the people celebrating that verdict only highlight that stupidity they have no idea what they've done IDIOTS!!!!
Anti-abortion is better than destroying the future generations of humanity.  Maybe our country will finally grown stronger again instead of weaker.
Those anti-reproduction rights gender traitors will be haunted by the deaths of women and children that this will cause.
you still van get them
US is the most advanced country in the world compared to the Europe because it does not cater to feminists hoes
Good job. Women with bad morals are protesting
Oh shut trump up.  He's only campaigning for votes.
I support the baby killers
"I want to hear how they are going to help the unwanted children, shelter, food, medical, education let alone family love. To grow up unwanted b& possible abuse"
So now I'm the criminal what you going to do charge me you going to charge me are you going to charge me for trying to push your asses to do the right thing make me a criminal at least I became a criminal for the right reason
"Bruh at least report correctly on the issue, Abortion is not federal banned it is now up to the States to regulate the issue."
Why is this headline news here in the UK. Who cares what the USA does. Dont see much coverage by the BBC of those that support the removal of the laws in question. Just another biased BBC low quality piece of journailsm
"the ruling simply puts the LAW to local  (state) lawmakers  ,  what  most news is NOT SAYING is the DEMOCRATS  control ALL 3 houses to MAKE LAW , but instead BLAME the JUSTICES who READ the LAW , why are they not doing what they preach ????"
"We are acting like these beings are an item u can cancel on Amazon. What determines your death? No pulse, then what should it determine at the beginning a pulse (heartbeat) it‚Äôs not a baby out the womb it‚Äôs been a baby since the heart beat.  These crazy people makes me ü§Æ"
First step to a responsible society  üëè
"Too bad the title of the video is entirely misleading, they are not banning abortions, they are leaving it up the to the state to decide. Which is fair because some places believe that killing babies is ok and same don‚Äôt. California wackos want abortions up to 9 months don‚Äôt know if anybodys seen a woman 9months but she‚Äôs about to pop at the that point and you can kill it then. When are women gonna take the responsibility of  either wearing protection or don‚Äôt sleep with everyone. No common sense with these people. U can be poor and take care of children just fine I have several kids don‚Äôt make a lot and they are all happy and fine just gotta sacrifice. People that are for abortion up to 9 months is sickening. Do y‚Äôall‚Äôs homework and grow a heart"

"I'm so mad at this and i don't even live in America
I wanna choke every single one of those people who are defending this decision."
Decision as big as this decided by 9 people. Why do we have voting and elections? seriously
"Tens of millions of women in America do not understand where babies come from?
Contraception is cheap and available everywhere.
I'm sorry but abortion is NOT a form of health care nor contraception and those are still available to women."
Final justice for the  millions of unborn babies sacrificed to The Devil
Finally killings babies are over
"This is like the beginning of The Handmaids Tale 

Looks like we‚Äôre on a one way trip back to the dark ages"
"Paying to travel to a state where abortion is legal, is still an option. And much cheaper than 18 years of raising a kid. So if you want an abortion, remember the pregnancy was your ‚Äúmistake‚Äù, accept the responsibility, fork up the money and stop bitching. By the way I support government provided contraception 
to all, NO government funds for abortion."
But at least I became a criminal for the right reasons
And my kid nobody wants to bring her to me nobody wants to give it to me and nobody wants to tell me whatever this I don't know what this stupid s*** is here I don't know how you guys shit works and since nobody will help me walk her to me something tell me what's going on I will become a criminal
President Trump knew what he was doing Biden is trying to cause conflicts with those countries no let's make sure that we unite those countries let's make sure that we unites everything that they wanted to cover up instead of making conflict with those countries let's all get in it together we're all the minor minority

This f****** administration they are covering up war crime sex trafficking they are covering up an international sex trafficking ring that is being fueled and funded by government agencies and offices
You kept my kid away from me for three years because you wouldn't give me my kid cuz you wanted a political insurance hits a surety bond 13 companies Miller real estate five star because you wanted to cover up your corruption but most of all you want to cover up covidian
"Sooo.....America makes abortion illegal because they argue they want to save the lives of future children, but yet America doesn't care enough about those children to change gun laws so they don't keep getting shot in schools. 
Got it."
Nary a word by mainstreams Dems about the children‚Äôs life in the womb.
I have an email where I believe was five to seven million dollars at States for a hit on me because it would appease many people in offices but they went to a bike to do it they just didn't know the minority is the majority you kidnapped my kid my kid you used because you were too worried about your corruption and your baby sex trafficking well don't worry you got the right one four and a half years didn't you lock me up send me to prison throw me the mental institution have the police beat me up because you wouldn't give me my kid
and i thought church and state was supposed to be seperate in the U.S. ....
Republic of GILEAD here we come..under his eye.
Don't I have that email
The fact that religious views of some has had a lot of influence on this massive decision is regrettable
Biden you should have did something about this board and you shouldn't have tried to hit me didn't you use a bike didn't your offices administrative level pay five to six thousand million dollars within your administrative level to put a hit on me to shut me up
This is the ugliest thing I've ever seen and I've never seen a goddamn administrative level office cover up something what I witness every f****** day my f****** kid has been kidnapped for 4 and 1/2 years because they wanted some goddamn money they wanted a political insurance hits
About time one step foward for conservatives
Do you know how many men are involved in this sex trafficking ring at the highest levels do you know that the southern district mayor of New York authorized for these people and these offices these Congressional offices to sleep with these women that were an institutions and then raped their children and this is all in a book and it is said that if it ever was to get out it would be politically controversial
The negation of abortion rights makes me feel as if we're moving backwards rather than forward
HAPPY DAY!!  WHAT A HAPPY DAY!!!  there is absolutely nothing in the actual US Constitution that expressly states a person can wholesaley murder a child!!
My kids are important and all these kids have been extorted sex trafficking thousands thousands of kids that have been killed at the hands of the administration at our borders that they have failed to do anything about it
"Yeah she HATES BLACK PEOPLE  and she KNOWS blacks make up over half of all abortions. 
Since 1973 over 19,000,000 black babies were aborted ... if those 19 million blacks were allowed to love then reproduce just imagine HOW MANY MILLION MORE BLACKS WOULD BE IN THE USA!!! probably enough to make half the population of America black by now... but deep down these politicians and crazy chalky ladies DONT WANT MORE BLACKS ALIVE"

"I don't understand today's generation.... People have normalised sex and it has become a way of enjoyment. People nowadays take sex so lightly that it means nothing at all. If we consider sex as a holy gift of God to be enjoyed by married couple then there won't be any issue at all....
Abortion is mostly done by people who goes around having sex for enjoyment... In some cases, it's done by rape victims but mostly by people who take sex as a means of enjoyment.... If you are doing for enjoyment use protection. A condom won't cost you much. But for me having sex with multiple partner is not necessary at all... And sex don't prove your love for your partner, so say no to sex before marriage....
I am a Christian and I truly believe that sex is holy.

And the protesters here are not victims of rape or medically unfit to have babies.... They are protesting because they want to have sex with multiple partner and in case of pregnancy they want to go for abortion.."
why should a rape victim go through months and months of dealing with a pregnancy that she didn‚Äôt even want. women who wants kids talk about the struggle of pregnancy but they‚Äôre happy because they actually want the child so its a little easier to deal with everything that come with it. a child is a beautiful thing don‚Äôt get me wrong but for a rape victim they‚Äôre not gonna be thinking i have a miracle baby. no woman should ever have to conceive a baby that way. all they‚Äôre gonna think about whether they give up the baby or not is the fact that it‚Äôs a rape baby. and then what if it‚Äôs their very first child. idk bout you but i wouldn‚Äôt want my first child conceived by being a rape victim and forced to take care of it or give it up‚Ä¶that‚Äôs traumatizing‚Ä¶just saying.

Good job US. You're turning theocratic with every passing day.
There was never a Constitutional right to abortion you biased disgusting so called new organisation
"From what I can see, the point that is completely lost in this whole issue is personal responsibility.
If you check the numbers, one percent of abortions are a result of rape and half that for incest, next is medical reasons. That leaves irresponsibility for the rest. 
So, instead of threatening violence for the right to kill an ""unwanted"" baby that YOU created, how about being responsible with your body and your choices and don't get pregnant?  Not getting pregnant is very easy."
How dare these people in position of power think they have any right to tell a woman what to do with they own bodies ! Don't force religious beliefs on individuals wars have been caused by foolish people who claim they do things in GODS name if abortion is now illegal will every man going to be out in prison for masturbation cuz shit that's killing thousands of kids every time we orgasm pro life people are blind to the truth they constantly contradict themselves and in outlawing abortion they themselves raised the suicide rate pro life equals pro death smfh
And just like that the Democrats know what a woman is!
abortion mean killing/ murder and who support that it is satanic generation?
"If you don't want to have babies, don't have sex. Sex was designed primarily for procreation not for fun."
Still waiting for Am√©rica to go full Nazi and invade Europe
"BBC is another liberal media which is known for distortion of the truth. First and foremost abortion is not enshrined in the american constitution. Secondly the judgement insist that abortion matters are solely states not a federal issue. Thirdly the judgement never banned abortion rather is specified a time frame in which abortions are permitted.
Why is BBC changing the narrative?"

"Hm...I don't care one way or the other, really, but dropping Roe doesn't seem like such a huge deal to me.  If you have so little personal responsibility that you can't keep from getting accidentally pregnant, just move to a state where the revolving door at the local abortion clinic is still open--easy fix."
"I noticed generally that no one is discussing the actual case, which I find a bit odd.  The draft opinion says regarding Roe:

‚ÄúIt relied on an erroneous historical narrative; it devoted great attention to and presumably relied on matters that have no bearing on the ‚Äòmeaning of the Constitution; it disregarded the fundamental difference between the precedents on which it relied and the question before the Court; it concocted an elaborate set of rules, with different restrictions for each trimester of pregnancy, but it did not explain how this veritable code could be teased out of anything in the Constitution, the his- tory of abortion laws, prior precedent, or any other cited source; and its most important rule (that States cannot pro- tect fetal life prior to ‚Äúviability‚Äù) was never raised by any party and has never been plausibly explained.‚Äù

‚ÄúRoe and Casey represent an error that cannot be allowed to stand.‚Äù

No one‚Äôs discussing the actual decision.  There is no right to abortion in the constitution.  It‚Äôs not a constitutional right.  The decision is logical.  It makes sense.  We can‚Äôt just project laws onto legal documents that aren‚Äôt there."

Its easy dont shag or use prophylactic's.
Looney left media does not report all the facts.  Abortion laws will be left up to individual states.  California and New York it will be abortion as usual. Nothing will change.  Read the United States constitution before you report. No amendment on abortion right shall not be infringed upon.
There are other ways to deal with unwanted pregnancy than to kill a baby! Killing is not the answer! Killing is not the answer!
"Glory be to GOD, the victory is the LORDs. Any female who wants to get a botched abortion deserves to die as they try to kill a defenseless baby, hoping they get caught and all who partake in it, go to prison you evil murderers. Just remember GOD always wins and you will reap what you sow."

"Years from now people will be denying they ever supported mass abortion deaths and stealing credit of its defeat from Christian movements, just like with abolition and alcohol regulations."
The only reason a woman would be against abortion is because she was brainwashed by religion. I just cannot see how that makes any sense whatsoever..
"Sarah Smith says the Court's decision, which she has obviously never read, is ""radical.""  If anything, Roe was the ""radical"" decision.  It propagated bald-faced lies about what is in the Constitution because seven male justices wanted to pass their policy off as part of our basic law.  The Dobbs decision is a simple retreat from that fraud.  During its five decades, Roe was never accepted by a unanimous Supreme Court, it was partly overturned in 1992, and the only thing shocking now is that three justices still claim it is partly sound."
Use condoms and birth control your liberals idiots
What God do you serve? God is against abortion!
Pro lifers want you to have the kid at any cost but you better not ask for social support services after the kid comes.

I dont know much about US culture but if abortion is legalised for medical reason if mother's life is in danger and not for women who cant keep their legs together and act responsibly then it should not be a problem.
'Right to abortion struck down...' That's one way of putting it. But how about 'Right to life for babies upheld..'  ?
as a society interest it's better not doing abortion but as individual it's high cost - unless we start to be more care for our actions and the government will help us  and close the gap
Are those women crying because they can't murder babies anymore?(disgusting human beings).
Teach young women to protect themselves if they don't want killing babies is not a choice is murdered.
"This is a great news.
Acknowledging the sanctity of life."
"Government are all for abortion so They will overturn this, give it a few months. It‚Äôs just gonna have women‚Äôs feel more accepting of it when they bring it back. Leading to more abortions than ever before! Shocking political tactic going on!! Dumb shit"
"Many ways to avoid children get your tubes tide, or use a condom. Killing a human is not a choice is murdered."
No abortions I agree 1million percent and I hope it happens all across America.Too all the fools protesting here you are marching the streets because you were not aborted even if life growing up was tough still here you are alive and well enough to march for killing an innocent child.If you women marching don't want children then remove your wombs and become a condom.No abortions is correct and jail time to the people causing these crimes.‚úä‚úåÔ∏è
"Abortion is bad! Protect your sex, if you do not want kids."
"Abortion being banned in half the states, the same states who won't pass better gun control laws. So they're for life unless it's taken by a gun. ü§°"
Abortion shouldn't be illegal
It's hilarious to watch all these baby murder  getting upset and also don't forget to do your peaceful protest
clear to see whos side the bbc is on
We are DEVO
Forcing a woman to have a child Is wrong but I don't agree to kill innocent babies
All these signs were made over night? ??
The least safe place in the US is in a mother's womb. 1.5 billion unborn children have been  aborted in the whole world.
21 and scared of what?
Haha fuck that country
family is blessing

These idiot women  will never  win .The LAW have thec duty to  protect  the  baby üë∂üöºüçºü§±ü§∞ if you were not  RAPE.
"Maybe contraception would be a better option than a vile abortion .My body my choice no that s gone ever since the vaccine green pass ,when their was no choice for those who wanted a choice ."
Implement consequences for people who are making these unwanted children over and over and maybe they'll respect sex more. I fostered a little girl who was her mother's 7th unwanted baby. I believe she needs a forced hysterectomy.
"Good. Why should judges make laws? In a democracy, the people elected by the voters should make laws. But the truth is that our elites don't want that: they consider the general population to be too stupid to make these decisions."

"Hey Joe Biden - how about fixing real problems, using this as a shadow to cover up the real issues impacting US Citizens today......
Biden says you ""US Citizens"" feel better today - how about the main voting population, retired - how do you feel now that you have lost 50% of your value / retirement funds, gas cost over double, food double, housing cost and interest rates out the roof, crime - all better right...
Inflation - All Time high in US History.
Fuel, Diesel that moves America - Highest in US History - DOUBLE - Remember Biden said he was going to shut down Fossil Fuels ""work it out"" - All Biden needs to do is Open up USA Energy 100% - Keystone Pipeline finish it, message it, reduce taxes on Oil and Gas, reduce limitations and regulations, promote and build infrastructure, new pipelines, refineries get going on this and message it, it will drive down futures cost of Oil per barrel / cost per gallon - no need for Tax Holiday or Gas Card - do your job...
Transporation / Production / Farming Cost up 100% due to Fuel Cost ""Diesel"" - this is just passed onto goods cost which you ""US Citizen"" pay...
Supply Chain Issues - never in the past have we had such issues with supplies, store shelves are empty / critical items gone or in very short supply - and with Fuel Cost so high, Truckers, Truck Companies are parking their trucks that will only add to the Supply Issues - AND JOE - Don't blame shipping increase cost 1000% - that is what it takes to fill up the tank with Diesel and that cost is passed onto goods that consumers purchase - called ECONOMICS, something you and Obama failed in....
Taxes - Joe looking to raise Corporate Taxes, where do you think Corporations get money to pay their taxes ""The sale of goods"" so if taxes go up, the cost of your end goods goes up ""Inflation"" - Biden does not understand Economics...
Interest Rates going up to all time highs which will just add to the Inflation as it will cost you more to purchase.
Joe going to pay off College Student Loans - 30% of the US population / making 70% pay for people that can't pay their debt - what do you get for free, do you get a check if you went to Trade School, or if you paid your college debt off in the past, what check will you get?
Border WIDE OPEN - Criminals just walking in, drugs flowing into our country harming our children / 200,000 deaths this year due to Fentanyl OD's, uncontrolled illegal immigration adding to the US deficit - No Border, No Nation - not enforcing the laws on the books - Cross at a ""Non"" entry point, that is ""Illegal Immigration"" go back to Nation you came from if you do not follow the process on our books - its call the Law that US Citizens have Voted for - Biden Enforce our Laws.
Crime out of control - DA's allowing criminals out on the street same day or days after committing a crime, Biden allowing this, US Citizens are not safe, Biden and his crew Defunding / Restricting the Police from doing their job...want to fix gun crimes (Do a crime with a gun, do the time, no early release, take someones life with a gun, you do life or death penalty, no release at all) this sets the example.............
Stockmarket crash - if your are retired, or looking to, well just keep working or go back to work, Biden does not care, you have lost half your funds thanks to Joe and his miss-management of the Economy.
Your Children - Forced CRT / BLM / Trans Sex Therapy / Trans Education being forced onto them at Schools without Parents Knowledge or approval - you have no rights, only the Teachers do....
International Standing in the World - at the bottom / Nations will not return calls to Biden...WOKE Military has shown Weakness and we now get no respect...Thanks to Joe..........
This is Biden's World that we are living in."
Simple things to deal with. Let every state to decide if it is ok ! This kind of thing can never be an issue in China and cannot image why it is so tricky in USA
"Shame on the Supreme Court.

KILLING BABIES IS NOT A RIGHT LADIES !  WHAT WOMAN  HAS A RIGHT TO MURDER BABIES !
"I don't really understand why most ppl seem to be against it. Even though there's still 15 weeks for ppl to decide whether they want the baby or not. 
it's not 15 days, it's 15 weeks, almost 4 month. the baby would grow up to human shape and be able to move inside the uterus. How could anyone even consider doing such horrible thing? if you really have difficulties raising children,use protection. if it's an accident, hey you still have like 3 months to decide starting from tje late period.
if anyone consider himself/herself    a human being, start to act like one. instead of shouting for the 'freedom' that you wasn't supposed to have as a human being."
"Pretty obvious that Brits do not understand our Constitution. Since abortion is not mentioned in the Constitution it is not one of the enumerated powers granted to the Federal government. Therefore, under the 10th Amendment abortion falls ""to the States or to the people"". This ruling is actually MORE democratic that the arbitrary dictate imposed by Roe vs Wade."
"They could at least have made exceptions for victims of sexual abuse, incest, and when doctors know there is like 90% chance of Downs syndrome.

 But honestly i am not so sure normal healthy pregnant women should have a right to free surgery for a self inflicted condition that poses no health risks. How can killing a healthy fetus be part of the Hippocratic oath of treating the ill and doing no harm? If a woman have a right to an abortion a doctor should also have the right to say no, id rather spend my precious time treating cancer and bullet wounds than perform unnecessary surgery on the healthy."
Thank God üôèüôè thank you for delivering little baby's from the hand's of monsters
Human Rights should include all humans. And for those who would dehumanize the unborn...you're one step closer to being dehumanized by others who think you have no value.

Hi
"Once I was Pro choice,  As I become older however, I became aware how precious the  Life is. I saw the people dying in combat, I saw the people dying in this Pandemic covid-19, especially youngone that they can not help themselves. I realized that LIFE is PRECIOUS and is given ONLY ONCE, and need live it to the FULLEST. In that regard,  I rethought of  the value of life, that everyone, even unborn human being called FETUS has RIGHT to live, and giving a CHOICE to them to choose to live or die, that is the True Pro Choice. I am now Pro life. I have message for pro choice women and  If one is against unwanted pregnancy, first and foremost use caution in mating, and if that did not work or was in  a situation, it can't be exercised,  consider adoption rather than killing a baby unborn child. Yes we need change the law but not the legalizing a murder.  In that regard, we need  make it easier for mothers with unwanted child (and up to child under 5 )  to put up for an adoption and make it more easier in general adoption. That is responsibility of Law makers, up until now law makers; they choose easy way out by legalizing murder. Now they need gather and go to work."
Anyone else noticed that the two women at the beginning are ones that no man would ever be physical with
So glad Trump decided to elect those three judges! #LifeWins #AdoptionSavesLives #BabyLivesMatter oh and by the way.. with great pleasure comes great responsibility!
"I m from Brazil where abortion is prohibited since always  thousands of women do illegal abortions without safety or healthy care,thousads are arrested more than 50 thousand a year. brazilian press never talk about this subject  something like ""dont  ask dont tell"". The problem is not going to disappear women will keep seeking abortion too much hipocrisy and religious bullshit.thats a men world we know since early childhood.Free women around the world!"
"This is a strike against women. Period. It's about power and control, solely. The right to freedom of choice, for anything for women - let's be honest, is devastated by this ruling. Ugly. Gillead in on our doorstep."
What we will never hear is Biden say that something has gone his way.
What I don't understand is why are they over turning this. How bad was it that they need to overturn it? Was this really a problem now days?
"Why does the law in the USA consider the murder of a pregnant woman a Double Homicide if an unborn  baby is not yet a ""life?"""
"How many of these woman protesting against abortion will (or have) adopt a child from an orphanage? Reality is if woman who cannot (or mentally refuse to) take care of a child, now that they can't make an abortion they'll just leave the kid. And unfortunately staticaly not a lot of children get adopted and the ones who don't are kicked out of orphanage at the age of 18. Unfortunately statistics for these young people is not good. So yes sure protest for life but this decision will lead to a lot of young people having not so good of a life."
I love Europe!
"everyone has the right to move to another state.if abortion is important for you there a a dozens of states that are better suited for you. 
please respect the courts ruling. it was a democratic decision by a bipartisan elected court."
"Oh God. More fact lite partisan bullshit from the BBC. Color me surprised ü§£ 
REALITY CHECK : MOSTLY FALSE. The SCOTUS has ruled that the Federal government has no right to impose this poorly written, unconstitutional law. It's up to individual states to decide. In California, New York, Oregon, Alaska you can abort your baby right up to the point of birth. As its head emerges you can cut it off b/c it's still not human. Most US states had laws permitting abortion up to 30 weeks. Now they are free from Federal control. Allowed to set the limit themselves. People can actually vote locally to change those limits. It's called DEMOCRACY."
"I can not understand the government!

In Germany it is so, that one may carry out an abortion only then,
if since conception (fertilization) no more than twelve weeks have passed. 
This corresponds to the 14th week of pregnancy.
The meaning behind it is, that namely after expiration of this period, the protection of the unborn child takes effect and must be ensured. (according to the Federal Constitutional Court)

Now the discussion about the deletion of paragraph 219a of the Penal Code (StGB) which then allows doctors on their website, to advertise for abortion to be allowed to perform, and accordingly.

With the new government since 12/2021 in the office is and not from conservative members consists, I am sure the paragraph 219a is abolished.

It belongs as I mean, to a liberal society that one may feel freely about it.
But it is also due to the principle of protection of the unborn child, as soon as the 14th week of pregnancy passes. 
This should not be changed.

I am happy that we have here, as one of the few countries in the world, a ""Federal Constitutional Court"", which alone has the right to decide on such morally difficult questions.
Also private persons can sue for their right.
As the highest court that stands above all courts, its judgment is unchallengeable.
One talks in Germany also of ""residence/city of the right"" or ""there I go up to Karlsruhe"" (in order to assert its right) (Karlsuhe = name of the city where the court is).

Poor people and mentally deranged should not have babies period...i know this firsthand...however the const really does not say anything about abortion so the roe law had no basis...which is why they reversed it. And now each state will enact their own laws which is how it should be...if u don't want kids...2 options...close your legs or drive over state line like CA and they will do it for free i imagine so they can take the fetus and do stem cell research on it for their miracle drugs.
Killing black peoples is murder.  That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt listen to YP.  They say abortion is murder but killing black people isnt?

"I find it funny how even after banning abortions, conservatives never had a plan to prevent possible situations where abortions are needed from happening like free contraceptives, more and better sex Ed in schools, funding families and mothers who didn‚Äôt want a child and can‚Äôt afford one, improving the foster care and adoption system and making penalties for rape more severe especially if the rape results in an unwanted child"

That is the point where the fetus thereafter gains consciousness and the point where a woman is able to assess elements like drug addiction, health, social climate or whether her child should be forced to live in dirt poor poverty and low-life quality, etc. Now that Roe is struck: population will Explode in ranks of those already poor who are already struggling and/or unable to have basic human needs and facing homelessness at it is now, let alone there being any hope of their kid going to college and prospects for anything other than existence' and being dirt poor and on welfare from birth to death. Once upon a time centuries ago it was OK to flood the Earth with population unchecked and now this population has wiped out the rain forests and I predict the strain on 'water will be the next; As human population increased to today's level God gave abortion to man to remedy & control his numbers.   take a look at the situation with Lake Mead for instants then 'go ahead and crank out another several million babies beyond the capacity of our planet."

"WHAT IT MEANS TO FOLLOW CHRIST IN IRAN:
The Iranian government is among the most oppressive regimes in the world. It is illegal to leave Islam, and Christians face the constant threat of imprisonment and being falsely charged with ‚Äúacting against national security‚Äù for owning Bibles or even talking about Christ. Christians are routinely fired from their jobs, and it is difficult for a known believer to find a job or rent a home. Many Christians gather in secret fellowships and receive teaching through Christian media smuggled into the country and through broadcast media. Several Christians are currently imprisoned, and many others are under house arrest awaiting sentencing.

ACCESS TO BIBLES:
It is illegal to own, print, import or distribute Bibles. Since they are so difficult to obtain, Bibles are treasured by Iranian believers. Few have their own copy of God‚Äôs Word. Give Bibles"

"The country is riddled with problems like homelessness, drug addiction, and poverty and these sanctimonious judges have no idea how the overturning of Roe vs Wade will impact on the lives of millions of women. They're a bunch of dinosaurs, idiots  who turn a blind eye to an obviously corrupt ex president and his cronies and claim to have God on their side in making this decision. 
They are bible thumping,  heartless and privileged. They didn't need to do this. They did it because they wanted to and because they could.
  Only a woman forced to make a choice when confronted with an unwanted pregnancy can understand the consequences of and bear responsibility for an abortion. It is a personal matter. 

Government should not intervene but give every assistance possible to help women who find themselves in the position of  having to make that choice come to the right decision, do what is best for them.
Is it harder for a woman to give a baby up for adoption than have an abortion? Perhaps.

Many wealthy  couples in America who have fertility issues will be clapping their hands because there will be more babies available for adoption. For sure there will be a market for discarded offspring. Whose interests are being served here?"
"I do not agree with an abortion ban, nor do I side with feminists who honour an abortion. I am against a blanket ban or a complete authorisation for abortion.

Aborting a children at the first trimester should be legal, after that should be banned. Most of the abortion happens before the 12th week anyways.

At the time, the child is not really a child yet, and it gives the women the rights to choose.

The left and rights both have their agenda, which I loath. But this overturning should be expected because it has no legal ground of that, the state should‚Äôve made legislations in the past."
I feel sorry for the rape victims and those at medical risk. But the fact that you can just get pregnant and then kill a life that depends on you for survival is wrong.

This is simple‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about the court saying the abortion issue is up to the States. Each state shall determine how they want to manage the issue of abortion. If a state wants to limit abortion to medical emergencies then they have the legal right to do that.

A nice step back toward the stone age .. Good job america.. maybe the Condom mafia got too strong..
SCOTUS is both cruel and unusual..unamerican
"Honestly love the BBC, they report impartially and from both sides"
"The US is the most fucked up country on the planet. A country where armed police will not enter a classroom of kids being shot, but happy to let 6 bigots choose what women do with their bodies. Laughing stock of the world."
Democrats have never been so mad since they took their slaves away üòé
Damn and i tough my country was bad  . . . America 0 - Romania 1
Women should just have sex with women then.
"Life wins, life has the final word. Abortion kills innocent lives. It s not about women's bodies, it s about the body of innocent little fetal infants.  Those who are chanting 'my body my choice' on abortion are the very same who refused to chant ' my body my choice' on masks and vaccine. If only logic was what they were after. Abortion is murder, stop it!!"
The only right that will remain is the right to shoot 8-year-olds. Crazy country.
are democrats now usingbunborn children to get the power to outlaw courts and emotional manipulate to vote   for them in the midterms ? anyway timing is perfect just before midterms
"But you can kill kids in school with guns in the U.S. and nobody really cares, Idiots still have guns."
What's right with America these days? Nothing.
We do care that's why murder is illegal
are the pro-lifers carrying guns?
They only made it legal to cut back on black ppl and save money on state aid
Women are not happy cause they cant terminate pregnancies due to inconvenience. You have to now think about before you shagg someone
"These babies get to be born into a country as poor, aimless, health system-less people with a gun in their hands waiting to be shot at their schools...good job America...."
Just reading this comments. Reminds me i made the right choice not to ever live with you guys. Enjoy your next 20-30 years of full orphanages & broken families (broken both economically and emotionally) I‚Äôm italian still you guys beat us on retro/Cristian mentality‚Ä¶
"Fake news! The supreme court cannot grant rights or remove them.  The infants constitutional right to life ,liberty and pursuit of happiness was upheld."
Fu joe
A life has a right to life
Noooo all the womans have the right to kill their own unborn childrens!!!!!
No more murders
"USA IS THE DUMBEST AND THE MOST STUPID COUNTRY IN THIS F. WORLD
AND I KNOW A LOT  STUPID COUNTRIES
How can a country be so technologically advanced but at the same time live so much in the Stone Age?"
Not true
If that's to control the raising amount of early teen Pregnancy then its good.
"very sad people can't take care of themselves they want to kill the unborn, abstain if you can't take care"
"As Clarence Thomas already stated in his opinion, I'm afraid, this is probably only the first of many serious blows this court will hand out against civil liberties in the US. Everything is at stake: gay rights, contraception (meaning every single form you could think of), even voting rights as a whole and civil rights of minorities. And the gloating demeanor of Republicans about this rule leaves little doubt that this is about anything else than domination and throwing the other side into unconditional submission. They will evidently stop at nothing to achieve this, and they literally got away unpunished after attempting a coup."
"ITS NOT TOTALLY REVERSED BBC. IT MEANS THE INDIVIDUAL STATES NOW HAVE THE POWER TO BAN OR KEEP  ABORTIONS. 
UNLESS THE PERSON  WAS RAPED, ITS MEDICALLY NEEDED, THEN LEARN TO HAVE SAFE SEX, THERE IS CONDOMS,  SPERMICIDE GELS,  MORNING AFTER PILL ETC."
The religious freaks are on the rise and have the initiative. The fight back must begin.
"Brilliant news, if u dont want children then don‚Äôt have sex out of situations where you don‚Äôt want children. If u are raped or incest I agree in abortion but only up to 12 weeks as it is murder."
"As Abraham Lincoln might have said, now is the time to heal the wounds and help women and children."
I am supposed to take a woman wearing a cat costume with spikes around her neck seriously. Halloween is in October. Just saying...
United States of Islam. No rights for women. Take the vote away from them.
"Welcome to North Korea, oops, I mean USA, where unelected 9 that stay for life can strip away human rights from half of the country‚Äôs population. How embarrassing!"
Those American judge who voted for disqualification of abortion respect God.
Repent before its too late
You are alive because your mother did not choose abortion.

Abortion is still legal. It's up to each state what is legal and what isn't.
"Stop the industrial levels of infanticide!  Well done, SCOTUS!"
"Abortion is not a constitutional right,  it is upto personal interpretation. Gun right is (2nd Amendment)."
Death is not the worst of all evils
"These days, American exceptionalism means moving away from what the civilized world considers progress."
America is a hell of a scary place. I will never visit such a pro gun and anti women country. Ya‚Äôll are backwards.
If safe sex was practiced there would be little need for so many abortions. Ironic how freedom means freedom to have casual sex and also freedom to abort babies. We've lost all sense of self control.

‚ÄúSo this is how liberty dies‚Äù - pademe Star Wars
All the pro abortion are storming the Bastille now ....attacking government buildings in Arizona and other states ..
Only woman has full right over her sexual organ and consequence of its usage...
"If you can afford to pay for an abortion as often as it seems most of you have abortions you can definitely afford to drive to another state if your state has restrictions. If you don't drive, buy a bus ticket, it's a small percentage of the cost of an abortion."
America a country of dangerous religious nut jobs.. if only they had oil so we could all invade and liberate them
Fuck me just pure delusion glad I‚Äôm from the uk where if an innocent girl is raped she doesn‚Äôt have to keep her abusers baby
Idiots ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"Well, the title is so misleading. The right to abortion is not struck down by this ruling. What this ruling means is that the decision (whether to ban or limit the term of abortion to a certain number of weeks during pregnancy) is up to the states' legislature to decide."
Stem cell research had come along way from abortion
America fucked!They must have the dumbest populace on Earth.
Doesn't the US have more pressing issues than abortion?
"America‚Ä¶ a truly backwards country, one day it shall fall"
"‚≠ê""THE TRIVIALIZATION OF WHAT MUST REMAIN FOR EXCEPTIONAL CASES IS NEVER A GOOD THING"" : ""FOR ALL THOSE WHO TRULY BELIEVE IN GOD THE RESPECT OF THE SACREDNESS OF LIFE MUST ALWAYS PREVAIL AND MUST BE ALWAYS BE PRESERVED FROM THE NEFARIOUS DESACRALIZATION OF LIFE"" ... ""AMEN"" !"
Pro life üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ yet they are not protesting to have gun laws changed the things that are taking lives in schools
Wow wow wow wow wow. This is the decision from the Lord against the innocent blood that is being shared
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ how usa will now lecture the on human rights and freedom
America's version of Christianty is closer to extremist islam/cathlotisism than any semblence of humanity.
Your country does care about you moron's it just isn't letting people with multi coloured hair tell them what to do.
They loves unborn babies as long as they're not Mexican
pregnancy is extremely dangerous for humans compared to other mammals. the reason so many women die from child birth is not the Abortion it is because it is quite dangerous for a woman to give birth. and alot of women do die in child birth even when the child survives.
"If you're 'pro life' you should also be a vegan to make sure you're not contributing to the suffering and murder of innocent animals who are considered life and have nerves like people so they can feel pain. You should also be living off grid in a self sustainable commune so as to make sure you don't contribute to an economy that relies heavily on the destruction of eco systems, not to mention our planet.

But no, it's nothing to do with protecting life, it's about being a religious nutcase."

The BBC should be pro or against abortion but the BBC is clearly pro abortion and that is not news it's pure and simple activism.
What the hack is going üò≥?
Trump‚Äôs strategic planning is on some next level
There trying to take our freedom rights and what‚Äôs next we already keep track of us but yet millions of people are homeless children being abused left behind in currupted foster care and people keep buying guns and killing taking peoples life‚Äôs you tell me what‚Äôs wrong in this picture
"The reality is that this decision is from the Supreme Court.  They are the final arbiter for the entire country.  This cannot simply be repleaded like a Bill in a special session of Congress, or a revoked with a Executive Order.  It can only be reversed with another abortion case from the ground up in a local court.  In other words it will take years for this to actually change."
Fu** sake why are these people trying to kill young babies.
The left and Democrats don't like it when it doesn't go there way and they cry üò¢ about it.
America needs to start tackling real problems like Affordable Housing Of which there is none for minimum wage single men. Women only have to have kids and they are set up until the new born is 18 yrs old. Sort out free hospitals like the rest of the civilized world. And make social housing a real thing that is accessable to the homeless. The mentally Ill poor and the poorly educated become homeless. It is not only predictable and a should be a human right to a place to sleep. And dont get me started on guns! Holy shit!
Enshrined !!??? clearly not !!!!!
The problem with America is its full of Americans
Quite likely something to do with the rights of the child. BBC you need to report news without bias.
America is a broken country
"Why do they always focus on the absolute minority? Ie incest, rape etc. The overwhelming majority of women getting abortions are sleeping wrecklessly with men. They should stop being a slut and get their priorities straight."
All women in the USA should stop having sex until this law is changed.
this is a woman's problem and should be left up to the woman and man should ask them self's  if there wife was giving birth and they where ask it is the wife or the baby's life which one would they save ?
"Sorry but your country is going backwards, when mostly men, and some of them are that old they wouldn‚Äôt have a clue what sex was about, decide that it‚Äôs illegal to have abortions then there is something sadly wrong. What a disgrace."

Choose two methods of contraception? Choose to not sleep with anything and everything? Choose life? Lots of choice still out there‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Where does it say in the ‚Äúconstitution‚Äù that women have the right to murder their unborn?
Republicans desperately hoping stripping peoples freedoms away will give them some whataboutism ammunition whenever Jan 6 is mentioned. The simple fact they dont care about living people proves the concern about the unborn is a lie.
Based decision
Conservatives have blood on there hands
"They pretend to save (unborn) lives while risking those of the living mothers. And once those children are born, all those politicians applauding the most now could not care less about the poverty and violence many of these kids will grow up in ... until they get shot at school."
There is finally a glimmer of hope in America...murder of innocent babies can never be right
"A small group of old white Christian men dictating to all: Jewish women, Muslim women, Buddhist women. Oh America ? What have you done ?"

Some of them shouldnt when they use that as birth control.

"Gun violence, police brutality, gangs, corruption, lack of freedom for women, etc, etc. America is just going backwards unlike here in Europe."
"This is just going to promote more death and hurt for babies. Abortions are painless, safe procedures that guess what, kills *nothing* 

But now women the victim of rape or incest will be made to carry their child, and those women might even just murder the baby from the postpartum depression, I mean they would have gotten prosecuted if they got it as an abortion anyway. 

Women who‚Äôs babies are severely disabled in the womb and wouldn‚Äôt live more than a few hours are going to have to spend months carrying a child only to hold them in her arms while they feel the pain of failing organs and death, when they could have been given that mercy without the traumatic experience of birth. 

Many women will die from dangerous pregnancies that they could have survived from by just getting an abortion and living to have another child.

This isn‚Äôt a win for life, this is a win for the continuous suffering of women and children. These people are disgusting"
"Abortion is not now, nor was it ever, ‚Äúin the Constitution‚Äù Stop reporting falsehoods BBC nonsense. Stick to your own country...you got plenty of issues to deal with to keep your ratings up. Thank GOD for this decision! States now, as they should, have control, and power back to the people!"

You created a child. It‚Äôs not like adopting a puppy and giving it back.
"Perhaps this will force people from using abortion as a 'form of contraceptive'. This ruling of course does not erode the various exemptions for abortion neccesitated by rape, incest and medical emergencies. Stop reporting this news as though this decision automatically bans all abortions."

Allowing abortion is controlling poor masses who lack SEXUAL responsibility.... Blacks and Latinos I mean Democrats Will now have large unplanned families which can be exploited by the labour sector by rich white supremacists and also they will provide armies for advancing external aggression because of unemployment

I've seen left wing activists protesting in Manchester England to protect women's rights to kill a baby . They're so concerned about it they even protest for women in another country to kill a baby.  Yet at the same time they can't or won't tell you what a woman is.  ?????
History repeats itself.. as someone whom studied history we are a powder keg.. once there is a spark.. it‚Äôll get ugly.
Yesüëåüëåüëåüëå
I hope the religious freaks who forced this are prepared to raise those children. I wonder if AMerica has gone down the shithole so much it will present each newborn with a gun.
Production for adrenochrome and demand for fetal material will be in a crisis.  This is more than a women's right this is a challenge to  big business.  I guess when they start to abort a fully formed child at term even God himself had to step in.
They're alive so they aren't in position of talk about abortion let the aborted babies tell about it
"Pro-life? I hope they're willing to look after unwanted children, and not just take joy in seeing people suffer for their mistakes."
America is actually fucked

You experiment on your own people (MK Ultra) treat black people, minorities and immigrants like dirt, you make health unattainable for many of your people and you probably have the most crooked, profiteering health systems in at least the developed world, many of you still fly a flag of slavery, the KKK have been allowed to persist, the majority won't even consider the slightest of gun law changes and if I wanted to get shot I'd think first warzone, then America, and you have caused nothing but misery, woe and destruction around the world. You also elected an illiterate, narcissistic ableist, racist who incited an act of terror, but of course we won't call it that because he's white and claims to be Christian, which by the way you force down everyone's throat and use to signal virtue, even though most pretend commandments 2, 3, 4 and 10 don't exist.

"I will be exposing my case of child trafficking whereby I was trafficked to Tom Cruise after writing to Jimmy Saville asking to meet Tom Cruise,¬† thereafter my Aunt (my main guardian) was misdiagnosed and murdered by the NHS I k by monarchy due to the fact she exposed depopulating and debilitating tactics used by the uk monarchy upon children whereby they distributed milk cartons which contained poisonous ingredients¬† to babies in nurseries and those who lived on council estates which led to infant death and deformities.¬†

After my Aunts death I was trafficked to france frontignan 1995 to Tom Cruise assaulted (hosed down with a firehose) and molested whereby he exposed his small genitals.¬† Ghislaine maxwell was in the resort as was Nicole kidman.¬†

Thereafter upon returning to the uk I was systematically assaulted terrorised and raped by various freemasonic individuals who were involved in paedophile networks and sex rings led and protected by the uk monarchy.¬†

I had 3 children from 2 of the men involved in this criminal network. All 3 have been trafficked to paedophiles,¬† my elder son Lushaan aged 12 has been trafficked to a male who is not related to him and has been tortured and terrorised by both the criminal paedophile working for the uk monarchy and the authorities. My younger son aged 6 Mohammed Ahsan being abused by his grandfather who is a known paedophile this family were known to the authorities and working for them. My daughter Yasmeenah has also been subjected to severe abuse which includes food deprivation and a humiliating torture. She has been unlawfully adopted and I have not seen her or my younger son since 2019.


This email will be circulated to every country to spread the TRUTH and spread awareness of what the uk monarchy are engaged in daily.

And no, adoption is not an option that should be a default. Every child in the adoption system deals with trauma regardless of the age they were put into it (yes, including if they were a newborn). It is not an option to easily default to."

"I understand extreme cases for abortion and agree with them but what about the hundreds of thousands of women globally. That basically use abortion as another form of contraception,. No thought or responsibility for your actions ?. This is what we really need to be speaking about in society. As for Biden and the Dems. This was the guy and party, that was supposed to unify the USA. How's that working out Joe ? Your political and ideological rhetoric, has over half of your population convinced some form of civil war is coming. Cessation of states from the Union is definitely on the horizon. The show trial that is Jan 6th. The Dems using the DOJ/FBI  to persecute your political adversaries an in doing so, demonise about a third of your population. Hitler did this during the 1930's and we all know how that turned out."
"I‚Äôm a Christian woman who is 21 weeks pregnant and just because I have moral biblical beliefs, that doesn‚Äôt mean my beliefs need to be forced upon others! The US is NOT a Christian country built upon tyranny! That has been completely forgotten!

Jesus is üíØ about free-will, choice, love, forgiveness of sins, mercy and treating others how you‚Äôd want to be treated. God never, ever forces others to obey His commandments. He always gives people the choice to choose. It is SATAN HIMSELF that forces people to bow to him and to conform to his twisted will."

"These stupid gullible women that think god is real and voting to ban abortions, are they trying to say if they were raped by some disgusting evil ugly man that they would willingly have that baby and love it and they would not look at that child and be reminded of what happened every minute of the day for the rest of their lives bullshit and the leaders of these groups deserve it happening to them then see them run to the nearest abortion clinic as nobody wants anything to do with them after being raped pregnant and happy about it. This is a sick law and anyone agreeing with it is a mindless sick individual."
"Taking away rights from people that have had those rights for more then 50 years will not go well ! Then threatening to take away more rights will absolutely guarantee that you won't live in a happy country no matter which side you're on !  Taking away rights against the wishes of a large majority and doing it in the name of God by a financial right wing of Catholic judges will only turn millions more against the church . That will get even worse and unrepairable when women start dying ! 
Add this to their ruling that anyone can carry a concealed hand gun in New York city and congress still allowing 18 year olds to buy assault rifles and it's the beginning of a dying country."
If woman have the right to abortion. Man should  have the right to deny alimony
"they seem to think a woman is SIMPLY NOTHING BUT A CARRIER for the next human life that is to appear upon the face of this earth, therefore a female who is raped or has been incested her feelings is not consider

There are 3 times more abortions then Rapes every year and we also know that only a small percentage of those get pregnant.

Another person saw a cave with millions of spirits crammed in the dark....screaming, weeping and wailing.....an angel nearly 8 foot tall told them: not to step back in there, or your be in there for eternity. Other people report seeing a lake of fire 15 miles in radius, and spirits burning inside the volcanic flames. Another who,s lifestyle revolved around alcohol, was told: this is where we send people with your lifestyle when you die.....and he was in a moon like landscape being attacked by demonic creatures.  No one knows for certain if it is true.....BUT, what If  it is.....and you are sent to a dreadful place for eternity ?

"Women have the right over their own bodies and when one(male) takes advantage of that, the woman has to carry and so this is emotionally, and mentally, and physically demanding to a woman and so they make the decision for their health to have the bubble break and be removed. Woman DID NOT CONSENT to having their bodies invaded. Men do not understand the depth of making this decision and if male had made this decision over Woman, then stand fast ladies and fight a global fight. Woman understand women.

Adultery and Formication should also have punishable results to limit women getting pregnant in the first place‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not rocket science
"Ok to all you pro lifers. Let me give you a little analogy. I am a woman of which has an abusive and violent husband. One night my husband comes into the bedroom yelling and screaming at me because I forgot to do something. He then proceeds to rape and violate my privacy. A few weeks pass by and something doesent feel right and I discover I'm pregnant with my violent and abusive husband's child. Now let's say that this ban has been put into place. I should be forced to endure a 9 month nightmare carrying the child of someone I am begging to get away from and throughout the pregnancy he still continues to be violent and invasive. One night, i go into labour and i am rushed to the hospital and things arent looking good. My blood pressure is through the roof, I'm passing out every few minuets and waking up screaming in pain. I come close to death itself. I then have to raise that child whilst their father continues to abuse me and possibly my child which can cause trauma in that child's life or teach the child that it's ok to hurt people. They then grow up to be a violent person and cause more crime in America.

Should I still have to have that baby? 

Let me add that even when this ban comes into place, PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE AN ABORTION! They are gonna resort to the illegal, unsafe and possibly deadly forms of abortion because to bring that child into the world will bring them an unholy amount of trauma. SO WHATS THE POINT! Let me give you another example of why this ban is pointless. Murder, is what you call abortion, well murder is illegal everywhere its banned but people STILL DO IT. Your arguments are unbelievably invalid!

You argue that a clump of cells is life and it's wrong to do so. Well everything is a clump of cells and you've probably stepped on an ant or some form of insect. You destroyed that life why limit it for humans."

Reeeeeeeeeeeeee welcome back Q
"Lets make this a bit more transparent.  The Supreme court in the USA deals with the constitution, they are custodians and there to uphold it.  They have deemed, after retrospectively looking into Roe v Wade, which was a controversial decision at the time, is in fact not a constutional right - nowhere in the constitution does it state, or be interpretated, that a women has a constituional right to abortion.  This will mean that indiviudual states will have the right to make their own laws around abortion - some may ban it outright, while others will allow abortions up to 40 weeks - as Governors are elected they are directly accountable to the people.  More conservative states will probably have stricter laws whilst liberal states will not - but would probably be inline with the will of the people of said state."
"There is no constitutional riggt to abortion, as abirtion was not even mentioned in the constitution.
The decision simply means that each state has the right to democratically decide whether or not to allow abortion on demand.
As for Joe Biden, he professes to be a Catholic.  By supporting the killing of babies in the womb, he has shown he is not."
"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING !
THANK YOU CONSERVATIVE AND RELIGIOUS CHRISTIAN FOUNDAMENTALIST !
TELLING WOMEN WHAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO WITH THEIR BODIES AND LIFES : ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!üò†"
ROE so dead ü§£ü§£
Well loads of people are out of a job now
yo supreme court  ban guns that kills both adults and kids
America is the most backwards first world country in the world
"I think now only 2 things that Supreme Court must make it Ilegal üòç
1. GUNS
2. SAME SEX MARRIGE"
Great day for state's rights.
liberal melt down loving it defundthebbc
I actually agree with the decision. Life over death
This is like Trump's booby trap he left after leaving office. What a sad legacy from a selfish man.
"USA is going backwards, this is so disappointing."
"Knuckle heads seems there are no freedoms any more, but there are plenty of countries outside of the USA that one could easily travel to these days"
The last time pelosi had a period it was in the triassic!!!
The legal murderers need to find a new job. Vile criminals
"Wtf this 2022 anything could happen pandemic, ban on abortion, alien and world war."
If a country mandates vaccinations then making abortions illegal isn't a surprise because both are done in the belief of doing the right thing even though everyone may not agree
"Victory for the innocent, unborn children üëèüë∂. If you don't want to have children, keep your legs closed."

The bbc opens with lies.. it only means very late abortive crimes..
Criminalizing pain relief is what it is. Ridiculous.
Haha all the baby killers lost today.....
The words right and abortion should not be used in the same sentence with a straight face
I wonder if all the women celebrating anti abortion would feel the same if they got raped on their way home and fell pregnant.
"This is horrendous news, I'm so sorry my lovelys.

Come to Australia.. you'll have more rights, better healthcare and best of all.. no guns üëå"
END THE KILLING OF CHILDREN.
"Hehe, do you notice most anti-abortion activities are fat and urgly."
"Do these people realize the children abandoned because their parents literally couldn't afford to feed them, have to go somewhere
Death is the greatest gift a man can achieve, and not being born in the first place is even more of a blessing"

The uk monarchy encourages abortion through the vile NHS. They and my non muslim mother who ironically works for the NHS forced myself  when I was most vulnerable before I Reverted to Islam. Witches

America please bring back all of Gods laws
Typical disingenuous BBC i see
Well it's far from perfect here but compared to the USA its paradise here.
"40% of UK abortions are to someone who has already had one. That's quite careless to have been ""rape or incest"" impregnated at least twice."
I'm hoping to see riots.
"It‚Äôs ok, calm down everybody the Evil Democrats will have baby kill centres in all the states that ignore this ruling."
"can't we humans strike a balance... when it should be done and when not. if it is life threatening for mother then existing life should get preference over life yet not born. other extreme is girls take relationships so casual that every second month there is a b.f dumped and a baby that is bad and must be stopped. laws must distinguish between extremes. better is to apply and get permission from court before abortion. however no one can stop emergency abortions, it will continue as per existing situations (pragnent woman meeting accident may need immediate abortion even before her other surgery is performed). what about rape victims? i don't know how people on such big position try to apply a broad brush..."
"BLM






Babies' lives matter"
USA: mass shootings at schools solution is to ban women who get sexually assaulted from getting rid of an unwanted pregnancy. Gotta fill the schools up for the next shooter
Time to disband the USA
"*Abortion is murder, if you don't want the baby give it up for adoption.*"
"The protester said this will lead to botched abortions and many women will die...well if she is willing to kill her baby..then what is the problem, could it be a life for a life at all..."
The first city to be distroyed. Is New York City.{russia).
Wow the US is so backwards
America really is a massive cesspit
So Victory is taking away a woman's rights over her own body that's not victory that's overbearing control when that child grows up and kills somebody whines up in prison or wind up on disability runs our country girl broke then tell me
"Legalised Murder by the State hasn't been banned it has been put back for The People to decide in individual states which is where this decision should be ! WITH THE PEOPLE !
This perfectly highlights the left to a T. When they can't get enough people to vote for something they turn to the politicised courts to get their demands met by either Banning it or allowing it. 
When President Trump told people they should peacefully protest at the White house they demanded he was charged with trying to foment Insurrection yet listen to the open and clear threats of violence to come from the Left and the sitting President and you get Silence"
I just don't understand why women want to kill their babies? Can someone explain?
Glory!
"I would just stop having sex all together. Let the blue balled men overthrow those out of touch geezers.
Oh, I hope that there will be huge riots. What a shit show ü§Ø"

"It‚Äôs crazy to me that, United States doesn‚Äôt have free healthcare, free education, free child care, or free birth control and yet they want to ban abortion?"
A backward-arsed country in so many respects but this and their inablility to act on guns just ices that cake.
"‚ÄúDevastation that abortion brought on us‚Äù? If you want to save the children, you should stop guns! This is ridiculous, you‚Äôre making it more dangerous for all the women that will go through abortion in some illegal clinic. America is not being progressive example to the world anymore, more like back tracking into dark days. The best is that men are voting what will happen to a woman‚Äôs body!?! I‚Äôm sorry for the women, sad times üò¢"
"Well done America, taking a life as a method of contraception In order to live a hedonistic lifestyle is never acceptable."
God bless America and to the Unborn üëç
I find it atrocious I really do
"I wouldn't actually mind people revisiting the idea of gay marriage.  People tend to forget that developed nations were doing pretty well without it.  In fact, it's in diametric opposition to another protected characteristic; that of faith."
When you law and country is built on the bible don't expect it to just stop these people are bat shit crazy this is why China is taking over from the USA
"They have struck down the right to kill another human being. 
Praise be the Lord!"
"When the beeb and the rest of their pals want you looking at this ‚Ä¶. Just know something else is being done far worse to the people without them knowing it, yet."
"What a rag tag mob.  Not a normal person to be seen.  Lezers, fat ugly enforced celibates, women without wombs and men without winkles, day release mentalists, vegans with secret sausage fetish and finally the lush Pelosi and her alcoholic husband."
Protesting because you want the right to murder? I give up
"The ruling on abortion was given back to the states to decide for their own.
That‚Äôs it. No one banned a thing. The right to abortion lies with each individual American state.
Jesus Christ. How dumb are you lot. These comments are embarrassing. Go read the ruling for yourself. You can‚Äôt trust these liars. They just whip your emotions by not telling you the truth.
Right to abortion struck down‚Ä¶wow. More like right to abortion decentralised from man in government back to states, back to local opinion."
"An innocent child doesn‚Äôt deserve to die because of the actions of the abusive father, who would beat the mother. Let‚Äôs help the women in these situations find safety, treat them with love and compassion. Killing her child is another violent act towards her. Let‚Äôs work towards a nation that serves women and children and families in need. There is a lot of work to be done. Let‚Äôs fix the foster care system and the adoption system. Let‚Äôs fix our family leave so woman can have up to a year or two with their newborns. So much needs to be done this is the beginning."
The result of DT‚Äôs nominating of supreme court members..
What's the differences Urhcraine killings or abortions.
"People need to go home and get on with their lives all this judgement of vulnerable people by People with nothing better to do is ridiculous,
Rape and Incest aren't a problem but abortion is apparently ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"You're lying: the overturn simply means that it is up to individual states to decide what their stance is, and not the federal government."
The world is fucked
Usa supreme court is right
A lot of babies conceived by rape and incest will be born from yoke to prison and warped lives. Only religion can take a woman‚Äôs right over their own bodies.
"NOW EVERY OTHER COUNTRY NEEDS TO TELL AMERICA WHERE TO GO WHEN THEY ‚Ä¶ COME ALL HOLY TELLING OTHERS HOW TO RUN THEIR COUNTRY AND TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY‚Ä¶ THEY ARE IN NO POSITION TO SPEAK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION WHEN THEY ARE ERODING EVERY TRACE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THEIR MESSED UP COUNTRY.
PEOPLE NEEDS TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHO THEY VOTE INTO POSITION OF POWER BCOZ IT HAS LONGTERM CONSEQUENCES ‚Ä¶ TRUMPISM AND EVIL SATANIC PPL STRIKES AGAIN.
THE LEADERS OF THE DYSFUNCTIONAL STATES OF MADMERICA SEEM TO WANT TO CONTROL PEOPLE‚ÄôS LIVES ..TELLING THEM WHEN TO EAT AND WHEN TO SLEEP.
THESE PPL ARE BARBERIC AND EVIL THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND UNFORTUNATELY TIME DOESN‚ÄôT CHANGE PEOPLE WHO WERE TAUGHT TO BE EVIL TO THE CORE FROM A TENDER AGE."
I find it funny how none of the comments on here mention the rights of the baby
About time America had some good news. It's been incessant evil for a long time
"Imagine thinking you could keep pushing for later and later abortions, even some saying after birth termination should be the mother's choice, wanting all that power over another life without responsibility, changing the terms from rare cases like aborting the product of rape/incest to an on-demand and at any time service, and not expect there to be pushback. 

The Pro-Life movement is majority women by the way, so abortionists can keep trying to blame men, it won't stick, especially when an on-demand abortion culture benefits men."
Medieval America.
Baby killers unite.  ‚ÄòThe most dangerous place for a black man is in the womb‚Äô (source unknown).
The news is a big part of causing violence. Supreme Court did not strike down any right to abortion. They gave it back to the states.
"good decision before""american blood"" goes extinct."
Another proof of the states being a third world country
And return to back street abortion. Well done America. üò¢

"These protesters should practice and preach, contraception, instead of murder for a better world. God gave Women the responsibility of the continuation of the Human Race. Do not abuse that sacred right. Life is a precious gift. Preach to your sons and men the against sexual exploitation and trafficking of humans. Preach to them against greed of money and power being the root of all Evil. Preach about egalitarianism for a better work."
Why does this remind me of breeding grouse for those with guns to shoot them
"The right to abortion was given to the people of the states to decide.
Why lie?"
I despise these religious morons who oppose there BS on to everyone else. America is the land of the free. Please!
"It's devastating. Abortion won't stop, only safe one will. People who think this will save more lives are complete idiots."
"‚ÄúI've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.""
President Ronald Reagan"
There's so much emotion in the rally that it will rip any man masculinity.
"I wonder if Sunday church will soon become mandated. Shortly after, working for your lord every Saturday."
"A country steadily heading into the dark ages...yet more laws that cause harm to people, pandering to relgious fantasists and extremists."
I wouldn't want to carry  nor raise a brain-damaged child. That's too much to ask of most women. The righteous always think emotionally and religiously instead of reality.
Just what the world needs....even more Americans
"The insane Christian Taliban won't stop until they turn America into a theocratic dictatorship, and they force us all to live as they think their imaginary sky daddy wants.

We must FIGHT BACK (peacefully and legally) or they will thrust us back into the Dark Ages."
"Keep your legs closed. No problems. And ask your self ""what if my mother aborted me?"""
So women will end up having back street abortions and unwanted kids will be neglected and abused this is so backwards üò°
"Time to riot burn loot kill injury and destroy people's properties businesses and cars , well ...... that's if your a unhinged left wing Marxist commie that is üëçüèº"
This woke snow flake world is absolutely fucked????? It's like living in the twilight zone!!!!!
Inshallah.
Just keep your legs shut - abstinence is the best form of contraception.
"Bullshit The House needs only a simple majority to impeach a Supreme Court justice or any federal judge. To convict and then remove the justice or judge, the Senate requires a two-thirds majority."
It is victory to godly people and a death blow to satanists the abortionists.
"I do not know why they are celebrating? the choice to abort or not it still belong to the woman, if they choose to have an abortion they will do it wether is legal or not, and that probably sometimes will cost two lifes."
"Pro life deluded morons, the land of the free, not very free is it."
Finally the tide of moral decline is turning. Praise God
It's still legal in most progressive states though?!
Praise be to God. I am grateful and thankful we still have righteous politicians.
From conception to The time they turn Gay.
Btw I‚Äôm not sure why some guys are boasting about this? Do you understand you get almost zero access now? It‚Äôs still their body. Their choice so this doesn‚Äôt stop access to anything. It just makes it unsafer now and makes it harder for you to get laid. Calm down üòÇüòÇüò¥
I'm grateful I'm neither female nor American. This is disgusting.
"right I‚Äôm unsure what this means, can they have abortions upto so many weeks pregnant or certain circumstances or is it just a no straight from the start?"
It is horrifying that this is happening in 21st century America. Several states will not even have exceptions in cases of rape and incest! It‚Äôs evil. Shame on all of them who voted for this.
"The republicans will turn America into Afghanistan if they are not stopped. Womens rights mean nothing to them.
I wonder how many of Trump's girlfriends had abortions in the past?"
"This is not a federal ban on abortion. It simply returns the decision to the states.
The court is meant to decide the constitutionality of laws, not make them."
Why are these anti-abortion people all so fat?
A woman has the right of ownership over her own body
ÁæéÂõΩÁâõÈÄº
"Most people dont understand what happened in US. They want the court whose only job is to uphold the law as it is written and understood, to make laws. That is for law makers! So if you want any rights laws then choose representatives who will give you what you want. Meanwhile use a condiment ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
Such decisions which effect huge sections of ppl should be done through referendum.
Yeah these are the ones who have sex and get pregnant. And get abortion to lose those innocent tiny babies. What a shame.
"So it's OK for babies to die, but not women? 
What about girl babies, is it ok to murder them?"
"When they are permitted up to 9 months and including birth what do they expect. It was never safe, legal and rare. Both men and women need to start taking responsibility for their actions."
"More baby girls are aborted. This saves femicide.

Just behave responsibly, do not go for 500 partners simple and do not jump in the bed of every imbecile that calls you. Now you will have to behave, not be reckless and irresponsible. 

The world is going to suffer from population collapse in 2100 according to a BBC report."
What the AF is happening to America??? üò≥
The dawn of the fall of USA :)
"from the reaction of these fascist women in the footage it looks like ALL women in USA were obliged to abort for 50 years. in that case I would understand these sort of reaction. but nobody want them to abort. it is more that them, as fanatic believers, want to impose their credo on other people. and off course the shadow of the scum of trump is still there.... poor USA!!!! poor America.!!! continue voting the republican. good luck"
"No woman may be allowed to kill. Exceptions are obviously acceptable  in case of rapes or serious health problems. Nevertheless, every human being must be respected while, on the other hand, pussies may never be faced as a ""green card"" to murder innocent human beings because responsibility inheres to women's liberty."
A lot of unwanted children will be trafficked. That's what they're really celebrating. So sad üòû
"America, the newest third world country..."
Well there goes womans rights ya bunch of psychos.
Murder != care
"Why is this a big deal?  It seems it‚Äôs only the hill billy states doing this. Sorry for my ignorance. I‚Äôm not from there but I don‚Äôt see the big ones doing it. It seems it‚Äôs those religious, hill billy states."
No one has the right to kill an innocent foetus.I support the supreme court
"Fuuuuuuck üòÇ I'm genuinely in awe of this... The utter ridiculousness that America, what is considered to be one of the most leading nations in the world, would do something like this."
I can't believe this happened in the USA....
That country is headed for a civil war. It's actually terrifying how divided the U.S. is on so many important issues. Take care my American friends. ü§ç
"It‚Äôs right , abortion is murder and also if you don‚Äôt want kids strap up"
"Shame on you America. You have put the rights of unborn babies before the rights of living women. Take away their reproductive rights, but put assault rifles in the hands of mentally Ill 18 year olds. Shame on you. You are taking your country backwards into the dark past. Shame on you."
"Great biased reporting once again BBC. You never fail, keep it upüòÇ"
"Why do the nations(CNN MSNBC etc) conspire and the peoples plot in vain?
The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying, ‚ÄúLet us break their chains and throw off their shackles.‚Äù 
The One enthroned in heaven laughs;  the Lord scoffs at them. He rebukes them in his anger
and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,  ‚ÄúI have installed my king in the Supreme Court."
Stupid backward congress. This ruling has set back America 50 years
"Its about time people took responsibility for their actions.  When a woman says ""my body my choice"",  that isn't exactly true is it.  If you're pregnant then you've got another body in there, one without a voice.  The only exception I would allow is when there is a medical risk to said woman if the pregnancy would proceed, or if she was raped.   Being drunk or promiscuous is not an excuse to murder an unborn child."
"Great step! Moving away from the devil that covered people's eyes by the name of ""Right"". It is weird that people march in support of killing a human being.   Banning abortion and improving workable protection system for women and girls must be among the priority agendas."
"America is such a fucked up country, how a western democratic superpower like this would have such little rights for their people and control people‚Äôs bodies in this way while having no safety nets for people, no healthcare, no protection; they are in no way ‚Äúthe leaders of the free world‚Äù, they are a tyranny against their own people"
Sluts are worried now üòÇü§î
"In today's world, only two countries issue new laws against freedom and liberty, Afghan Taliban and America."
It was never a constitutional right as it is not in the constitution  why are the BBC reporting fake in accurate  news
"Such a ridiculous ban!! Their bodies, their choices!"
The fat creature saying ‚ÄúI won today‚Äù has she got something wrong with her ?
Just use contraception
"Murica, where life is precious until the second your born. Then your on your own with no universal healthcare, workers rights, and you can get shot at school. I hope those policy makers enjoy living in The Republic of Gilead"
People should just deal with their consequences instead of killing their fetus and living their life with complete ignorance of what they have done
Well the US government has made a backyard butchers job legal now congrats idiots!
If the bbc aren't bias then why are they reporting this like it's terrible news?
"They don't get so hysterical when the West genocides the Third World. Spoilt, self-centred women who cannot face up to the fact that the biological female can get pregnant when she has sex."
"The media so biased. There is obviously an agenda being displayed here. 

Respect the decision as we would have had to if it was the other way around and shut the f**k up."
Congrats. Give people with mental health guns and now take away a woman's rights to a choice.
Thank God.. No more killings of innocent babies.  It is murder....millions of babies have been killed..... get contraceptive then..
Defund the BBC
Imagine being forced to carry your rapist child
Is it just me or do them women seem mad?
merica is a mess
Its simple they just want their name written in history. Even if its on the wrong side.
Thanks to Trump's appointments
That guy with the colourful umbrella yea he ain‚Äôt got no kids and he wants kids but nobody wanna have kids with him so if abortions get ‚ÄúCancelled‚Äù he can definitely have a kid when he hurts another women !! W t heck bro
"The Christian nationalist judiciary will change the law to suit their vision of a society ruled by a Reactionary Elite, a society with a preferred religion and a prescribed code of sexual behavior, all backed by the coercive power of the state."
This is excellent news. It will stop the murder of thousands.
Do you mean they stop killing baby
"Is the Catholic Church running the USA ? Women now will have to have the rapist baby and what next no contraception, no sex before marriage good grief. I feel for the unborn but really there are over 7 billion of us in this small world, nations are starving, wars are raging, the planet is over heating. I feel for the unborn but they could be the lucky ones, now before saving the unborn, get of your lazy backsides and make a world worth living in."
Keep the ten commandments and we would not have problems with this.
"The BBC, so unbiased!!"
America is in shambles
Abortion is MURDER! We stand for Life!
Shocking and Biden just sits back and stumbles a few words out. Make America pathetic again. Another choice lost
"How can one nation be so detrimental to its own well-being. Aborting a child is wrong but allowing them to grow and be shot up in a school is just part of life. If the preservation of life is the most important thing, then the death penalty should be struck down"

Well done.. American women crazy
"Christian fundamentalism governing politics, similar to the Taliban."
"Sick, divided society governed by greedy uneducated psychopats."

Best news ever! God wins!
"There is a Brexit parallel here. Control of abortion has been returned from Washington (Brussels) to the individual States (UK).

Democracy at the State level will show us what the will of the people really is."
Doctors are criminals. Court decision almost 5 decades is appreciable
Excellent news‚Ä¶ if people followed the word of God we wouldn‚Äôt have these things happen if your that bothered about being selfish for your own pleasure be prepared for what comes after that‚Ä¶. Man and woman should not sleep around before marriage it should be in love and true harmony
Man there‚Äôs going to be a LOT of back alley abortions and deaths.
All glory to God

"I‚Äôm just worried that these pro-lifers are going to take this thing to its logical conclusion, and call for an outright ban on masturbation!üò≥"
BBC is the new CNN. All fake news all the time. This is not at all what you falsely report. There is no ban on abortion it moves the decisions to the individual states..  abortion is not birth control as it is being used. BBC SUCKS
How embarrassing
I swear the US is gonna have another civil war soon
"I saw some ridiculous girl on the news singing ""Jesus loves the little children!"" Oh sure he does, and now the little sweeties can go home to parents who didn't want them to begin with, out of mind of the authorities (who consider they've done their jobs by 'Jesus') and wait to be neglected, starved and abused to death!  Sometimes I think the Americans, as a race, are about as intelligent as mouthy school kids!"
I am pro life. We need more kids so that we can send them out to war....to die. Pro life/pro war. Makes sense?
"If u dont want a baby, close them legs"
"One aspect of the US constitution I did envy was the separation of religion from politics...."" the Establishment Clause prohibits all levels of government from advancing or prohibiting religion"".  What happened?"
"Question: if a woman was forcefully raped by a psychotic serial killer, she would still have to keep the child but that man would, by US law be put to dead. Is that what is happening? 
So a woman that is forced to do something against her will, should be once again forced to do something against her will. One person that forced is sentenced to death and the other paid a salary? 
Is that not insanity?"
I'm so glad I live in a country where people can destroy unborn babies without any consequences üòç
About time. This accepted genocide has been going on too long. Mass denial of this because you want to spread your legs.
The number of these idiots who needed to be aborted themselves is staggering.
The number of these idiots who needed to be aborted themselves is staggering
"What kind of reporting is this? Leslie Rutledge saying the doctor doesn‚Äôt have any facts, and no push back? Despite decades of facts. Just air it as an opinion?
Also most people in America support womens rights to have an abortion, nowhere is that said in this report. Also nowhere is it said that this is an infringement of human rights. 
Is the BBC just an ‚Äòopinions‚Äô show now?"
"Many who are outraged at this Supreme Court's decision little realize how blessed they are in America. For none of them would want to live in a society where human and divine law is no longer respected. That experiment was already tried in ancient France, and horrific were the results. Thus, those who are outraged are exhibiting that they, whether they realize it or not, have accepted the lie the god of this world continually propagates of ""Do what thou wilt."" Yet, those consumed with impulsive anger over this decision are acting thus because they, whether ignorantly or willfully, have abandoned the Creator God's plan for marriage and sex, and that is complete abstinence until wedded in holy matrimony."
"Fuck Pro life, I hope your daughters get raped with no possibility to abortion."
And this is the country shaming the taliban for making their women to wear a burqa ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
try taking responsibility for yourself     then you dont need to get upset or happy about this
"Welcome to America 2022 where you can walk down to your local Walmart and buy a high-powered assault rifle to help 'protect' your family. Someone could use that rifle to go on a rampage killing innocent people. Nothing is done because of the 2nd amendment and the powerful NRA.

Yet a woman who has become pregnant through either rape, abuse, incest or even is not mentally capable of supporting a child can no longer have the right to an abortion. It is a crazy situation to be in. In some states, women even risk being tried for murder.

All this has done is open up backstreet abortion clinics and there is a high risk that a lot of women could die as a result of this. 

America is turning into Gilead more and more each day."
Let's just faces it the US cannot be considered a free country anymore
The US leading the way for babies's rights.
"Fifty three years ago, Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon and made the famous quote: One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. Now the American Supreme Court has just turned that quote on its head. This is a second giant leap... only this time it's backwards. How in the world can the US of A, the so-called Land of the Free, be trusted to oppose dictatorships like Russia when they're intent on cracking down on liberties like this? We in Britain should have been reducing ties to America instead of Europe at the rate things are going."
Very good decision. üíùüíùüíùüíùüíùüíù
"If only these women had access to condoms, contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch or contraceptive coil

People are upset that they are reducing killing of life? üòÇüëèüèæ I think it's great as women use abortion  as contraception these days hopefully it will make ppl more sexually reserved and wise.

"LIES! ‚ÄúTens of millions do not have a right to abortion?‚Äù It is state by state. They are free to travel to get an abortion. Leftist propaganda, all of this."

I think they should consider regulation of guns first rather than mobilizing crowds to act more violent .
"Same old lying BBC! It's nit been struck down, banned or anything like that! Tyw Supreme Court has just given the decision to the States!

America willingly marching itself back into the dark ages. What a silly childish move.
There is irony in the fact that nineteen children were shot to death in their classrooms and the same people who claim to ban abortion to protect unborn children refuse to ban the military-type weapons that kill real children.
It's time for us men to do our part and stop treating sex as a recreational activity and letting our hormones get the best of us. Sex is for mature men in committed relationships; and thinking otherwise already debases women into sexual objects and unequal human value. I know because I have been there. But we can learn from our mistakes and do better. Let's treat women with the respect they deserve.
These people are crazy! Just sickening I feel for the woman of this country I hope they find access else where

So they make abortion illegal but make it legal to carry a gun that can take more life's. So when they commit suicide as cannot get abortion I hope these people realise they have killed 2 people
I don‚Äôt understand why can‚Äôt they just go on the pill or use condoms

It is not ‚Äú the right to abortion ‚Äú that has been struck down - typical miss reporting by the BBC. All that has happened is that each state now has the power to make its own laws concerning abortion.
"And with an outpouring of misinformation the BBC yet again demonstrate to the world why they should be shutdown completely.

Judges don't get to make up new rights and grant them to the citizens in any democracy, because that makes it NOT a democracy.
If Amerircans want the 'right' to abortion, they're gonna have to get it via democratic representation, not via misuse of law to have an unelected, appointed branch of government create and grant it, like a Taliban council."
"because its was found that roe vs wade was based on ironically ""a woman telling lies"" due to that, law is clear the case must be overturned. 

so now if they want to murder their babies in utero then they have to go state level. 
still can't avoid, baby helping to kill mother, may still have a chance for rape babies. but either way, today is a good day because all the women who are protesting want is the right to both screw and cheat without consequences.. don't want kids 2 things you can do.

Life is the most precious thing and although I understand the desires of females to kill the fetus life is the most important thing. The unimaginably precious baby is the most important thing and although the desires of women to want to have wonton sex and not have to be a mother and be obligated to the baby is understandable the right to life of the baby supersedes all other human desires or wants.

"For abortions to be legal both the man and woman should agree to the abortion. The choice was made to conceive when you were ragged all over for 15mins. If you were raped you should also be allowed an abortion.

The Supreme Court misinterpreted back in the early 70‚Äôs the 14th Amendment of the  Constitution which as of yesterday was rectified.

Very happy news. Killing is not a right.
I wonder if Jesus will feed them as he loves them so much. This makes me so mad. Is it not better to terminate a pregnancy when the parents can't look after it. I really don't understand this decision and it has definitely made America seem more backward in the eyes of the rest of the world.

Women and girls who have been raped will be forced to have that baby. The foster care system and orphanages are already overwhelmed and underfunded. Pro lifers don't care about these babies after they are born.
"People are upset because they can no longer kill their own baby in the womb. President Ronald Regan famously said - ‚ÄúI've noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.‚Äù Over 60 million defenceless babies overwhelmingly Murdered in the womb for convenience in the USA alone, and from people who were given the chance to be born.
When a woman has an Abortion, she's not killing her own body, she's killing someone else's body."
"Again, BBC fake news, not all US states will ban abortion. This is a victory of good over evil so naturally the BBC is pissed off."
Anyone else sit on the fence on this? Could argue both ways?

I am not religious. Just consider thinking something. 

If you come across a child with terminal illness, consider asking her whether she would have liked to die before she was born. I think you know her answer. She'd be glad to being able to see the world albeit in pain.

When a life is conceived, without forceful intent (say rape), you no longer OWN that life. Just like a human/animal has every right to live, an unborn baby, who has no capacity to take the decision on their part, should not be killed, UNLESS she is killed by natural reasons or is a risk to her mother's life. 


Please have common sense before starting to exercise your all entitling attitude."
"I get this but also don‚Äôt, people getting knocked up left and right don‚Äôt deserve abortions but if it‚Äôs life threatening for the woman then I feel it should be legal. This is a horrible decision. They should‚Äôve made laws to abortion like it it‚Äôs life threatening let them get it but if the child is healthy and the woman won‚Äôt suffer from said birth I feel they shouldn‚Äôt have an abortion. I also feel if they get raped they should have the option."

"This judgement is not just about the right to abortion. It is the removal of the right to destroy a child, right up to the moment of a full term, natural birth. An abortion, as we know it in the UK, is the termination of a pregnancy where the Foetus does not have a heartbeat and is incapable of independent movement. Overturning Roe V Wade was removing the right to murder viable children. Also, the 'rights' to abortion enshrined in Roe V Wade were in the process of being expanded to ban police from investigating and prosecuting infant mortality of children under the age of 28 days (after birth). Abortion law was never in the purview of federal Government. The US constitution demands that anything not specifically covered in the bill of rights should be adjudicated at the state level, where the time limits will be set by elected representatives and local electors can influence the decisions. The BBC know this. Presenting the decision of the SCOTUS as an infringement of the human rights of women is a deliberate act of deception. It is nothing of the sort. It is about preventing the willful murder of children."

But overt Christophobes. Attack Christians knowing their non-retaliatory stand. Imagine if the majority community becomes violent and rebels 

Atheists destroy the good work great institutions do or doing. But have no alternative or willingness or motivation or intention or reference to help or do themselves. Good at destruction, not construction. 

Living in prosperous cozy Christian foundational non-retaliatory countries and becoming celebrities. 

Atheists if you have spine go live and criticize Islam, and other religions in their countries and become even more popular. 

Atheists please show your credentials by moving to and transforming undeveloped or Islamic country in to a prosperous country. By make legal immigrants as illegals. Open the borders. Drug traffickers, Muslims, Islamic supremacist, illegals are welcome, and protected. Zero rallies/protests against Muslims or zero legal actions if they are against LGBT or refuse to bake gay wedding cakes or refuse to sell pork. Zero investigations on Islamic institutional child abuse. Zero criticism of Muslim hypocrisy. Laissez-faire. Burning and looting businesses are peaceful protests, not crime. Christophia is constitutional right. Defund police to non-existence. Global cooling. Create utopia. Without copying Jesus Christ principles of equality, human value, human dignity. Then rest of world will have bragging rights to praise you and undying respect for atheism. 

Atheism already destroyed Soviet Union, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela etc. Wants to destroy every country. Atheism is proven failed ideology. 

Atheists Hitler, Himmler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, Ceausescu etc killed millions of own cirizens. 

Have no morals as reference point, should have no right to make decisions affecting majority. 

Praise celebrities shamelessly cover their dirty deeds and critize every other. 

Discuss a problem with 'expert panel', blame vehemently all others, but ignore the root cause ie evil pre-existing in everyone. 

Have the conclusion written first to blame a target group, and then find favorable witnesses to pretend justifications. 

Atheism never produced a line that is comforting on a death bed. 

That's why I left atheism. 

Reject marxist atheism. They transform communities to worst than third world countries. 

And remember old times, original godly roots and foundations, there is profit in it. Each individual is fallen, broken to core already and needs healing, purpose, meaning, acceptance, forgiveness, hope, eternity which are available for free."
50 Years of murdering babies.
"in america, woman are considered to be ......nothing"
"No abortion allowed? Good, then gentlemen, please sterilize after you have a satisfactory number of children"
Imagine a women whom got rape and is deny abortion!
"""Right"" to kill children in the womb struck down by US Supreme Court."
"So if a woman was r*ped, then she has to deal with 38 weeks of the baby growing. Whoa"
Another ludicrous piece of legislation by the US ‚Äî what a bunch of emotive fatbangers.
"But what if a woman is raped? Just imagine the awful experience of having to look after that child or having to sadly give the child away. Also imagine the awful increase of population.

It‚Äôs better to remove it when it‚Äôs inside the woman then to kill it when it‚Äôs and fully grown and released. To think so many mothers will now end the baby‚Äôs life as it‚Äôs released into the world as they are now unable to abort it.

To think these children will now grow up much worse and in much more awful experience as foster homes increase and of course violence will arrive."
These are sex mad they will kill for it!
Trump wins even when not in office.
"there's no constitutional right to abortion, once again the bbc lying and twisting the truth, the bbc side with baby killers."
"""care"" = killing children according to this report"
"The problem here is that woman can't make decisions on whether they want to have a kid or not any more, for someone who doesn't want kids, why force them to have one, yes, sure don't get pregant, dump that guy, blah blah,  but things happen yet we don't get to decide what we can do any more. For women who are living on the street, or drug addicts when they have babies, the babies will be drug babies, they will have behavioral problems due to drug abuse from the mothers..If a drug addict doesn't want to keep the baby, she should have her own right to do abortion safely, I don't see anythign wrong with it, it's cruel to force someone to have a child when they don""t want .....Some hypocrites just simiply thinking killing a fetus is wrong, but forcing someone to have babies is wrong too! Not mention there are other reasons...it's never black and white.. regardless, taking away this option , is not right.."
How can they chat and cheer for life when their gun reform laws are a total joke. The right to kill if you think person was worthy of dying. So corrupt. Absolute stupid logic this. It‚Äôs all about pissing the demos off and vis versa. All about funding their individual states. Raging at this. Absolutely raging.
"Thank God, their right to murder has been withdrawn!"
It's hard to defend abortion and also hard to be anti abortion. One side it could kill the mother and on the other your killing a helpless baby so fucked all around really.
"disgusting that state court DOES NOT fulfill the will of the MAJORITY. 

This is only the will of the few - career polititions and overpowered JUDGES.

@$#//%"
All the anti-abortionists deserve to be raped and impregnated by paedophiles.
"Well, since life begins at conception, how can a person scientifically and scriptural deny that it is not an embryo. You see dead things do not grow. It is that simple. When Jehovah God was speaking with the prophet Jeremiah, he told the young prophet in Jeremiah 1:5 that when he was forming Jeremiah in the belly of his mother that ""I knew you"". Jehovah could read the ""spirit in the bones in the belly of her who is pregnant"" (Ecclesiastes 11:5). In the book of Romans 9:11-13  Jehovah read the ""spirit"" in the bones if you will, of both Jacob and Esau. In Psalms 139:13-16 King David wrote about Jehovah saw even King David's embryo. Life starts at conception, cause dead things don't GROW. If two men got into a fight and in the process of fighting they caused a pregnant woman to have a miscarriage and the fetus died, one or both of them had to forfeit their lives (Exodus 21: 22-23). All these scriptures show how the Creator, Jehovah God views the growing embryo in the belly of her that is pregnant. He views them as a living human. Human life. Human child. Killing the child inside the belly of her that is pregnant is from the Creators standpoint, murder. To see what the Bible says on the topic of abortion, and so much more, simply go to the totally free, most translated website on the Internet, no sign in or out, no registration, no information gathered on you, all browsing and downloads are free, private. Please go to JW.org"
Finally the mass killing of unborn babies ..is STOPPED.  The US is  now a better country today.
use contraception its not that hard
In reality women really want abortions as a safety measure for the bad decisions they take.
"Just think about how many kids there are in foster care, or who are not wanted and are living a shitty life. The mothers dont abort the child because they find pleasure in killing children. What if the mom seriously cant provide a healthy life for the kid? There are already enough kids in foster care, abortion is not murder.

Edit: Plus why the hell are people worrying about other people buisness and abortions anyways? It aint your child or buisness so stay the heck out of it."
"Close to million babies are murdered by abortion every year in the USA. 
That is horrific, there‚Äôs no reasonable argument that can defend this casual destruction of human life"
They always try to use black people abortion is not a black issue. It's a white woman issuec
"Psalms chp127:3, children are a gift from the Lord the fruit of the womb a reward."
This will end up in South Park
"yes, it is very extreme to rule that murder is not a ""right."" It is extremely good and virtuous."
Democrats are going to lose a lot more if they don't start paying attention to black people's needs
"It seems your right to life ends when you leave the womb, enter the schoolrooms and get a bullet in your head from a Far Right extremist that likely preached at one of these rallies against abortion."
"Turkey do hair transplants, dentist work and now abortions. The care system is about to be overwhelmed by kids being dumped on them and expect the suicide rate to increase.  The fact someone could be raped  then forced to carry a child is going to have serious implications. America is about to fall"
Weird how the people that scream about saving the planet say that the future generations to come don‚Äôt deserve the right to life??ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

US always was lying cretin and agressive country. Punishment is coming for mlns killed people in the world.
"Just phrase by the news lady ""guaranteed right to abortion"" killing a young child is a constitutional right?, i get there could be exceptions like when it saves the life of a mother, but to phrase it as a right is no bueno üòê"
Abortion is not healthcare. It's murder.
This is why I have never wanted to move to the US. The evangelicals which Trump has piled into the courts will destroy that country.
"Trumptards: dont restrict my rights to guns!

"This is a Great Victory for Men & for our Female Warriors ( who want to be men too ), for they have struck a Great Blow towards the destruction of Democracy & the ability to choose for ones self.  HURRAH !  For Men Rule Women That Bit More Now.
If I could become the elected leader of thinking women ( who want to stay women ), I would recommend they no longer have Sex with Men until the Movie 'Suffragette 2 ' is released !   Where the plot has been changed to remove Womens ability to Vote !.......... Dun Dunn Duuunn !

There will be no Limits to the amount of absurdity I could unleash on the General Population.
1/  I would create Laws to force Men to pay child support for children they didn't want & couldn't afford.
2/  I would create childrens homes to look after all the unwanted children, that even the ' Anti-Abortionists' wouldn't look after, this in turn would financially cripple the cities.  Where America would eventually F&*k themselves into financial ruin.
3/  Arrest you for being a Murderer when you leave my State for another to have an Abortion there.   Don't Come back if you leave.

Everyone knows, There's Nothing More Democratic than Voting to have your Medical Options taken away from you.
I would feel the need to sit back and watch the Movie that Hollywood makes out of it all...  Starring the Old Cast from the original ' Look Who's Talking ' Movie.

I will order my Popcorn now... And prepare for the New Era which will come to be known as... 'The Great Times of Mazturbaishin'."
"Banning/outlawing activities or goods doesn't make them disappear, it merely makes them go underground (and it greatly increases the cost/risk). It's not a question of letting abortions happen vs. not happen, because they will happen regardless. The question is: Should they be safe (legal abortion), or should they be dangerous (illegal abortion)? Think of drugs, even alcohol, and the toll society has paid when substances were rendered illegal. It boggles the mind that the U.S., at least a part of it, is still living in the distant past compared to the rest of the modern world."
Don't like the verdict? Keep your legs closed. UNBORN LIVES MATTER!!!!
It is a great day...at last the unborn defenseless babies have protection from being murdered...
98% of all women aborting got pregnant as a result of sex before mirrige aka adultery.
"Everyone has the right to live, especially innocent life."
Abortion was never a right. It's not in the Constitution anywhere.
"A good time to watch ""Junior"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger is this weekend."
"For normal  women and girls who consider having an abortion it‚Äôs  very traumatic to have an abortion. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone is having an abortion lightly. But in some situation, like pregnancy through rape, poverty, illness, etc. it should be there as a last resort and as early as possible. Making that decision for others is unfair. Are the people making that judgement also happy to foster, adopt, support poor mothers.
Plus the system as it is is atrocious, getting worse for most Americans, especially children. Crap education, housing or even homelessness, crime, violence, rising living cost, lack of employment, abandonment, abuse by their carers, failing social child protection services. And there seemed to be far too many children abused even killed."
Use and demand a condom to prevent pregnancy
"Before it gets out of hand realse the federal right was struck down. So it's like England, Wales, Scotland and N. Ireland get to decide individually on abortion. That's it."
Right to kill!! I mean US has abortion mills and that is the nation that want to tell muslims how to behave.
"How about encouraging abstinence , responsible relationship choices and marginalising the  casualisation  of sex 
They will reduce cases"
It must be awful waking up each morning and realising that you are an American.

got to save them in the womb so they can die in the classroom
It‚Äôs ironic that all those pro abortion were never aborted themselves.
The USA- land of the backwards
"America leaves Afghanistan, now half of it is run by the Taliban. Ironic?"
"You can feel sorry for them all you like- but the left wanted FULL TERM ABORTION. Yes, that‚Äôs killing a fully formed baby that just hasn‚Äôt been born yet. Some leftist states had even aborted babies after they had just been born. That‚Äôs murder no matter how you dress it up. No one has a right to do that."
There will be anarchy in the streets.
World is getting f**ked up everyday
"American has too many right and it better to cut some off to set boundaries . Use protection if you desire to have sex and if you are rape the innocent child isn't the victim here . People should wake up .

Smoke curtain to draw attention from what is going on."
"The ironic thing is, this will lead to leftist rioting, looting and burning in leftist states, where in those states abortion is still legal. They are going to literally burn their own stuff down."
USA just a third world country wearing a Gucci belt
They are evolving just backward ü§°ü§°
BBC fake news. Abortion is not in the constitution and the supreme Court has only relegated the Abortion decision to state levels. This is a great win for Donald Trump üëè üëç.  In Trump we Trust.
"Wrong!

SCOTUS did not ban abortion...

It gave that ‚ÄúDecision-power‚Äù to the States...!

"Get ready for a summer of leftist (see fascist) idiots in their monkeypox masks (easier to hide from the CCTV) protesting (see rioting) in various cities across the US. Obviously, this won't occur in their own back yard as their leftist cities will still allow abortions regardless of the ruling as they are state controlled. Expect death threats, violence, damage to government buildings and local businesses. Oh and of course let's not forget the killing of babies too. Tolerance at it's finest!"
there seems to be  a lot of supreme court  justices when asked about the Roe v wade question simply lied.

Abortion rights for trans women !
"2:17 ""I am 21 and I am terrified"" 
Hmmm...you are not terrified killing a baby but you are terrified cuz your right to kill the babies is taken away? Oh my...what on earth is going on?"
Murder is murder!
Now women learn word - responsibility
"America:No abortions
School shootings:thoughts and prayers 

It's a joke they value ""life"" until it comes into the world"
"The Supreme Court did not make abortion illegal. The ruling was to say the Supreme Court did not have the right in the first place to make this law. They were correcting what was in effect and illegal law at the time in 1973.

The Supreme Court are basically saying you in the Congress must pass the abortion law. It was not the responsibility or the legal right of the Supreme Court to create a law that permitted abortion in 1973.

Joe Biden of course is squirming away from his responsibility as the president as are the Democratic party. They are blaming the court when they as the elected party, can immediately table their bill to legalise abortion across all states.

It's the classic cowardly politician a bit like what happens here in Britain, where they want to point the finger somewhere else when in fact it lies with the elected government.

The principal would be as if our own Supreme Court in the United Kingdom wrote a law and implemented it without Parliament having agreed to the writing of the law and without the Supreme Court having the power to implement the law.

Once again, we see Poor journalism from the BBC who do not represent the truthful facts of how this issue has come about but simply advocate for abortion. It doesn't even get into the deep moral issues around the rights of a child. Remembering that in some states, the abortion law allows the killing of a child right up to the point it leaves the womb where effectively, the child would otherwise be viable outside of the womb had it been born naturally.

we should also remember that there are a wide range of contraception which should prevent pregnancy in the first place if a woman wants to manage her risks in a more effective way. I recognise that in America, there may be challenges around that given that healthcare is not free at the point of provision.

we should also recognise that we are actively killing a human being. The deep challenge of course is when does that collection of cells moving towards fetal development become ""a human being"".

The ethical problem is that we are saying women's rights are greater than those of a dependent child when women do actually have the alternative contraception options to prevent the pregnancy in the first place. Of course, there should be exceptions such as rape or criminal abuses towards women where abortion should be in place along with all of those issues of clinical risk. 
The rights of the person who is not yet born versus the rights of the woman who has power over the unborn person is the stress test of society. it feels to me that ""abortion"" has become more like another contraception option where a woman has failed to make proper contraception plans to prevent pregnancy in the first place.

and yes, God forbid, I am saying that women do have ""responsibility"" to manage contraception. Responsibility in today's world seems to be something that belongs to someone else."
"So what about a woman who has been raped? Should they be forced to keep the child? Yes it is not the child's fault but it is not the woman's fault neither - she did not ask to be raped, so therefore, she should have the right to an abortion."
Quick one as Im the other side of the world. If you can travel state lines for an abortion legally if it‚Äôs illegal in your state. Does that mean they can now cross state lines to buy cannabis for the same reasons?
"Remember when alcohol was banned in the early 20th century? It didn't stop people drinking alcohol. People illegally made and sold booze all over the place. Same thing's happening here. Banning abortions will not stop them, it will only make them more dangerous by being preformed by people who aren't trained doctors."
"1. Prove its not a baby and just a cluster of cells and I would agree with abortion. 

2. If it has a heart, a brain and can feel pain (after 8-9 weeks) there is no logical reason why anyone should be allowed to kill a baby particularly when 99%+ of abortions are preventable and 100% are preventable after 8 weeks when a baby can feel pain by doing just 1 pregnancy test a month (¬£6 max) when sexually active.

3. If you are having protected sex and do 1 pregnancy test a month (¬£6) when you are sexually active, no baby will need to feel pain for your sexual pleasure. How could anyone not do that? 

4. At least before 8 weeks you won‚Äôt be putting a baby through pain. 24 weeks in the uk or later in special circumstances is ridiculous. You can have a baby at 23 weeks and it has about a 50% chance of survival. Obviously killing a new born 23 week baby would be the worst crime imaginable but if the baby is in the exact same state and just hasn‚Äôt been delivered yet it‚Äôs seen as a great thing vital for woman‚Äôs rights?

5. If you are prepared to have sex be prepared to have a baby, no one should suffer for your sexual pleasure. 

I should also say that before I looked into it I was pro abortion but I think more people should be concerned about putting baby‚Äôs (or foetuses) through pain when this is preventable. We are living in a society of 0 accountability."
"These pro-choice devil's are the same animals who go round telling people that eating meat is murder yet they have no problem killing children

"Good! Abortion isn't your plan A!

In a perfect world people could have abortions out of necessity - but over 200k abortions a year is a complete joke. Accidental pregnancies with condoms and the pill are individually 15/100 and 1/100 respectively - combined that number should be VERY low. But 200k accidental pregnancies a year, people are looking at abortion as if it was a right instead of a privlidge and a lot of inhuman animals abused the system by killing babies.

Good riddance, now you dogs will have to actually practice safe sex. The horror, right?"
Just take necessary precautions to not get pregnant. All acting like it‚Äôs inevitable that you‚Äôre going to get pregnant. About time woman took responsibility for once

In parallel to my WW3 scenario witch is caused by a Stock Market Crash witch consequently triggers a Global Financial Collapse the Coronavirus began.

"I am only alive because my mother‚Äôs back street abortion was unsuccessful in 1945. She hadn‚Äôt been raped or beaten when she got pregnant - to her, her pregnancy was simply a mere inconvenience.  Yet, in spite of the efforts to dismember me and kill me, I survived‚Ä¶. just. I died at the eventual birth but was resuscitated.  Even then she didn‚Äôt want me.  I am so grateful to be here 76 years later with four children and ten beautiful grandchildren who would never have existed if my death had been successful.  The unborn cannot speak or plead for their lives. It‚Äôs not just about ‚ÄòMy body, my rights‚Äô that pregnant mother‚Äôs body has another body/person inside her and that little one has no say. Now, thankfully, someone has spoken up for them to protect these little ones.  Its murder to kill another human being, whether that child is in the womb or out."

Good. Stop murdering babies it's disgusting. The fact people actually advocate to end babies lives is disgusting to me. The future generations will see this abortion culture one of the worst atrocities in human history.

"Abortion was never a constitutional right and actually violates the 4th amendment. It was an illegal act by the SCOTUS in 1973 by making it a federal law set right today and set the abortion issue back to the state legislatures, where it can be voted on for each state.  SCOTUS in 1973 only was to interpret the law, not make law. And that's exactly what they did, and it was a violation of the purpose of SCOTUS. Women have a choice with their bodies, not to have sex; since abortion is not birth control. Here in America we are giving the LORD all the glory for this victory."

"It's very upsetting to see this happening. I'm pro choice and I believe that women should have the option to have an abortion. But on that same note, if women have the right to say ""my body my choice"", I do believe that there must be discussion on what a prospective father has the right to say as well (ie: my wallet, my choice). With abortion being legal (as I said I believe it should be) women can choose to abort a child, even if the father doesn't want them to. And assuming the woman wants to keep the child but the father doesn't, the woman can still have it and get money from the man. So, obviously the discussion of abortion is a topic concerning women, but it also concerns men as well. 
I agree with this outrage, but I just wish there was more outrage like this when fathers can't even see their children (who are already walking, talking, and conscious and where there is no debate as to whether they are ""alive at conception"" or ""a clump of cells with no consciousness yet"") due to spiteful spouses and court systems that treat men terribly. All I'm asking for is a little consistency, because, let's be real, as a whole, women's issues get spoken about significantly more than the challenges that men face (and there are PLENTY), whether it be in mainstream media or just in our social lives. Women and men both have issues, and just because I ask for attention to also be directed at the other side does not mean I'm saying take away attention from the other. But I shouldn't hold my breath, I doubt anything will change. My mini rant is over lol. (also, I assume most people won't read through this unfortunately)"
"GOP to announce their next political goals:

"Nobody had a legal right to an abortion in the first place, but nothing is being taken away from anyone or being banned. All they're doing is letting states decide for themselves if and when an abortion would be performed, letting elected officials decide for their constituents. In some states for example, abortions will be allowed up until 24 weeks, and in others they won't be allowed at all, but they're not making it illegal to travel to another state. It's incredibly simple to not get ""accidentally"" pregnant though if you're in such a terrible situation that you can't afford to raise a child. Perhaps this will encourage people to be more responsible, instead of treating getting an abortion like picking up a prescription."
Why are pro abortionists so transphobic? Don‚Äôt they know men can get pregnant too?

"They didn't take away a right, the right to abortion was never constitutional. They gave the right to decide to individual states, as it should be.

In those cases, there is hardly any personal autonomy left, if you have to care about a child although you did not want to.

The perfect example to show that women are extremely privileged regarding the societal empathy they receive. Where were all the protesters fighting for men's rights of family planning/life planning/personal autonomy? Have you heard, my dear feminists?"

"Abortion has never been guaranteed by the Constitution.
   About  the only right guaranteed, would probably be the Right to Refuse to Abort. 

Should abortion be considered as a legal option... sure.
   But in 95% of cases where abortion happens in America, there's no Medical or Rape issue. 
   There may be considerations for supporting the child after birth, or concerns about the hospital costs of giving birth. 
But that's unlikely to be the case for more than 10-15% of cases at best. And adoption, or pregnancy centers are a thing. 

And realistically speaking, *the supreme court would have probably considered the outcome of some woman taping some guy...*
_And then insisting on aborting said baby._ *Against her victims wishes.* 

Abortion on demand, is wrong. Abortion on having a Need... that's something worth discussing. 
   I would point out that if only 0.001% of all Abortions resulted *directly* in death for the Mother... that  would be around 800 deaths annually.  And we know from antecedents of situations where the Mother to be, dies but it is not attributed to her abortion even if investigations by family reveal probable links. 

California, for instance, doesn't even report what information on abortion they do collect. Let alone try to track the so called back alley Abortions that happen in their state.

Simply put. If people want universal abortion access, they need better & more reliably researched arguments for it, than emotional arguments based upon the Mother's 9 month inconveniencing. _(Especially when so called abusive boyfriend's, are just as likely to Coerce their girlfriend into Getting an Abortion, if not more so._ _I know from stories former planned parenthood workers tell, that this happens._ _Frankly  speaking, it seems more likely. )_

It doesn't really help the pro abortion argument, that prior to this overturning...
North Korea & China, were amongst the few countries that could match America's abortion access standards. 
   *Most of the 200+ countries worldwide, restrict abortion access in some fashion.* To a greater or lesser degree."

"""As a child, did you imagine this alot?""

Yeah as a 6 year old girl I can imagine she was so excited and passionate about murdering an unborn fetus in a strangers stomach who she didn't even know anything about and who had nothing to do with her let alone the story behind the pregnancy or the reasons for the feeling of needing to get rid.

I'm sorry but what a STRANGE group of people Americans are lol"
It was never a Constitutional right. Any rights that are not specifically written into the Bill of Rights are left to the States to decide. i.e. Cannabis
why do women protest to kill their children? great decision from the Supreme Court.
Y'all will see what hell is like
American women sleep around too much. What willl happen if women do not have any lasting relationships and keep aborting babies that are from casual affairs? Don't they know that many societies look down on them? Being a superpower is not enough. Have family values and take care of your babies.
"Funny how abortion seems to be an issue and CHILDREN GETTING SHOT AND KILLED EVERY MONTH, IS NOT. MAKE THIS COUNTRY SAFE FOR CHILDREN TO LIVE IN, FIRST."
That's what's wrong with this country stupid asses like them dumb asses
"People are saying ""use protection"" until a woman gets raped multiple times by multiple people. Until certain details  about the pregnancy lead to the death of the child and the mother. Until they start finding children dead due to the irresponsibility of an unfit mother/father .  Until they see hundreds of underage sexual abuse victims die during birth because they're bodies can't take it. Not everyone deserves to be parents.. not everyone planned to even have sex. What is wrong with this country"
"This crazy where the world is heading, all thanks to fasist mentality people"
I wonder how these animal women who are cheering like idiots wpuld feel if (god forbid) any of them individually was r##ed by an awful man and now was unable to abort that baby and have to live with that reminder and pain forever. I wonder if they would still be cheering like animals then. They would deserve a massive crowd of people screaming in joy as that individual is left broken and terrified yet unable to get help for what's happened.
"Europe might need to liberate the USA from fascist rule somehow please .i am not trying to overthrow the government , just shame the hell out of Republican tourists and ask them why they are so racist and stupid . every time you see an American on the streets ask them if they are  Republicans ? and if they are ask them why ? and ask them if they are fascist and or racist .and then tell them to f*ck off. and you don't need their money and go home ."
"something people are ignoring or intentionally missing out, is the fact that roe v wade was based upon testimony of a woman being raped which was later admitted to have been perjury, so its based on lies and as such has no reasonable way of being upheld in court. stop treating this like an attack, its not. its how the law works."
"Praise God, Jesus is the Righteous Judge and He is coming back, repent while you have a chance! You wicked people fighting against God, only foolish will fight against God."

"Pi$$ off with your lives matter! Honestly it‚Äôs not selfish or disgusting of parents to end up getting an Abortion, what is selfish of a human is having a baby knowing FULLY well that you cannot support or raise that child to the best of their abilities and potential, knowing that food is short, housing is a struggle or knowing that you couldn‚Äôt afford school fees or clothing! 

All these a$$holes fighting this nonsense, remember you live with mommy and daddy! They pay everything for you and the only reason you have anything on your back or in your hand, so get out of mommies basement and go get a real job!"

"Men have been treated like secondhand citizens when it comes to their children for years. Men have had no rights whatsoever when it come to their children if they wanted the mother to keep it or not yet they have to pay child support, any custody cases men have been treated like dirt.

"Certainly Jesus, son of Mary (the servant and messenger of Allah ), peace be upon both of them, will descend in Syria - Al-Manara, on two angel wings, wearing two dresses of cotton, his face dripping with water as if he was coming out of a shower, his breath reaching the tip of his fingers at the length of his arm, killing everyone who entered his breath except¬† Muslims, he breaks the cross, kills the pig and accepts only the religion of Islam, he prays with the Muslims in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, then he will kills the Antichrist, then he and those with him hide on Mount Al-Tur for fear of Gog and Magog { Gog and Magog :

A people who have been imprisoned by Dhul-Qarnayn under the ground, and he said that they will come out when Allah wills.

They will kill everyone on the earth except Jesus and his companions and they will eat the green, dry and inanimate opjects, then Jesus prays to Allah to kill them, so they all die because of a flying worm that enters¬† in their noses, then he would rule the earth for 40 years in which love, justice and much prosperity would prevail even children play with snaks and wolves guard the cattle , then he would die and be buried in Muslim cemeteries.

[4:171]
O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning Allah save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His word which He conveyed unto Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and say not ""Three"" - Cease! (it is) better for you! - Allah is only One God. Far is it removed from His Transcendent Majesty that He should have a son. His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is sufficient as Defender.

[4:172]
The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto Allah, nor will the favoured angels. Whoso scorneth His service and is proud, all such will He assemble unto Him;

[4:173]
Then, as for those who believed and did good works, unto them will He pay their wages in full, adding unto them of His bounty; and as for those who were scornful and proud, them will He punish with a painful doom. And they will not find for them, against Allah, any protecting friend or helper.

[4:174]
O mankind! Now hath a proof from your Lord come unto you, and We have sent down unto you a clear light;

[4:175]
As for those who believe in Allah, and hold fast unto Him, them He will cause to enter into His mercy and grace, and will guide them unto Him by a straight road.
19:81]
And they have chosen (other) gods beside Allah that they may be a power for them.

[19:82]
Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto them.

[19:83]
Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound them with confusion ?

[19:84]
So make no haste against them (O Muhammad). We do but number unto them a sum (of days).

[19:85]
On the day when We shall gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, a goodly company.

[19:86]
And drive the guilty unto hell, a weary herd,

[19:87]
They will have no power of intercession, save him who hath made a covenant with his Lord.

[19:88]
And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son.

[19:89]
Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing

[19:90]
Whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall in ruins,

[19:91]
That ye ascribe unto the Beneficent a son,

[19:92]
When it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should choose a son.

[19:93]
There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as a slave.

[19:94]
Verily He knoweth them and numbereth them with (right) numbering.

[19:95]
And each one of them will come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection, alone.

[19:96]
Lo! those who believe and do good works, the Beneficent will appoint for them love.

[19:97]
And We make (this Scripture) easy in thy tongue, (O Muhammad) only that thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off (evil), and warn therewith the froward folk.

[19:98]
And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Canst thou (Muhammad) see a single man of them, or hear from them the slightest sound ?

39:4]
If Allah had willed to choose a son, He could have chosen what He would of that which He hath created. Be He Glorified! He is Allah, the One, the Absolute.

[39:5]
He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth. He maketh night to succeed day, and He maketh day to succeed night, and He constraineth the sun and the moon to give service, each running on for an appointed term. Is not He the Mighty, the Forgiver ?

[39:6]
He created you from one being, then from that (being) He made its mate; and He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds. He created you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, in a threefold gloom. Such is Allah, your Lord. His is the Sovereignty. There is no God save Him. How then are ye turned away ?

[39:7]
If ye are thankless, yet Allah is Independent of you, though He is not pleased with thanklessness for His bondmen; and if ye are thankful He is pleased therewith for you. No laden soul will bear another‚Äôs load. Then unto your Lord is your return; and He will tell you what ye used to do. Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of men). ‚Äî‚Äî-----------------------------------‚Äî----------

I don't understand how people can be anti abortion when there's multiple situations this could happen in. For example a woman who was raped and became pregnant. The woman shouldn't have to carry the trauma through the rapists child. Also accidents with pregnancy can happen even with contraception. America is taking away one of the most important human rights. CHOICE. The US has gone backwards and people need to wake up that this is unacceptable

"The left is so accustomed to killing the unborn that it's normal to them.  Murder is still murder.  God bless the Supreme Court and Donald Trump.  God will deal with them.  The Trigger laws were in place to take effect as soon as Roe was overturned.  Abortionists don't realize what they've done because of their selfishness.  The right to abortion is NOT in the constitution.  It was a big mistake to legalize abortion federally.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself said the decision was ill advised upon reviewing it.  Norma McCorvey (the real name of Roe)
regretted heavily her involvement in the process and spent the remainder of her life trying to make up for it."
Christo-fascists now own America.
What?
ABORTION = MURDER
HAHAHA!!!
Unborn baby s saying..thank you...I hope nobody gets hurts
America is Awful an F'd up! They have literally taken away women's right and gone backwards. Like does America not understand that some women don't have enough resources to care for children. And some are even teenagers who maybe not even be ready for raising a child. Like this is literally just Disgraceful. Like Bruh!
"god can't stand Americans, why is nobody fighting for middle of the road European policy on abortion. Consciousness begins at 24 weeks and that's when abortion should be allowed to after that its no longer just ""your body"" but another lives."
Your body your choice well take responsibility ladies because you can't be having unprotected sex with random guys then complain when you get pregnant when you should know your own biology.
the devil is going to be very rabid these days
it is not the right to abortion it is the right to have a law to kill a baby in the mother's womb

The decision is correct.  The constitution does not guarantee a right to kill the unborn.   It is up to the legislature to create such a law to provide such a right.
"The BBC will probably delete this but the fact is, the BBC haven't done their research and are lying again. The Supreme Court did not strike down the right to abortion. It simple restored the Constitution, which clearly states in the 10th amendment that any power not mentioned in the Constitution is reserved to the States or the people. In other words, States make local laws."
".Women have been finding ways to abort fetuses for thousands of years.  By the amount of children that are sold into the sex trade,  and murdered and tortured by their parents it seems that abortion is the least cruel of them all.  There are millions of people who do not want to be and should not be parents.  There is no birth control that is 100% effective and abstinence is very rare."
God is coming back to the heart of America! Reap it!
Fake news media. Abortion has simply been relegated to a state level. It has not been abolished in the US.
I truly hope they pass the law to ban gay marriage and stop this pride nonsense
"Doctors need to stop saying no to sterilization. If you want abortions to stop, then allow women to be sterilized the first time they ask."
"Do they really think that killing is ""Healthcare""? Unbelievable..."
"Tragic. I hope this can be reversed as soon as posible. 

Although our society is not perfect and we have so much to rectify, it is ironic that we mexicans had gained more rights and liberties, as time goes by, compared to our northern neighbours."
How can Americans care so much about unborn children yet not bother at all about killing their children with guns?
Why the hell people dont wear condoms....right to abortion is same like giving a right to kill a human being....just because you enjoyed sex and in your emotions you were not able to control....you shouldn't have a right to kill someone.....freedom to kill is not a democratic right

Seriously if the US does not do anything soon to try to fix it's fuck ups both on National and Local it seems that the ""once great nation"" will now cease to exist. 

Now the chance of States leaving the Union is at it's highest in years, if this keeps up not only will the anarchy from BLM come back it might get worse."
Abortions are NOT illegal in all US states‚Ä¶it takes away government power and restores it back to the states.
"In the US (a nation where more women die from complications of pregnacy and childbirth than in any developed country, where hundreds of thousands have died in a pandemic from lack of healthcare or poverty, and where historically females were bought and sold as breeders to enrich slave owners) forced labor is an established national tradition and reproductive rights are another example of human rights that were never guaranteed for the poor."
"Discarding thinking about genuine failures of contraception; this should lessen the instances of ""random sex"" in America, as ALL women are noe responsible.
I'm going to enjoy watching the YouTube videos of American guys saying ""... but my girlfriend wouldn't let me..."""
"Again, more mis-information by the BBC. There was no right under the constitution that allowed for abortion. That is a law by STATE and no judiciary, in the UK OR the US can make laws, that is by legislators. All that was done was overturn and set right the constitution. The decision was that Roe v Wade was flawed as it meant creating a new right under the consitution, and that can not be done by ANY judiciary OR legislator, laws and rights are very different. Judges do NOT make laws both in the UK OR the US. It is still law that States can decide what is allowed, when it is allowed, for abortion. 

The decision does NOT mean abortions can NOT be done. Abortion is not a right under the constitution. The fact is, ending a life is murder and people can try and twist it all they like, it is infanticide and even goes back to sacrificing children to Mollock. Personally, abortions should be outlawed. Arguments for it are flawed by nature, biology and even science itself. That being said, the States in the US can still make their own laws as it was for a long time. Roe v Wade is not constitutional and that is ALL the decision was, it changes nothing on abortion laws and those laws have always been state level. 
 
Quote the constitution where it says abortions are a right. You will NOT find it.
 
Abortions are alloowed and STATE legtislator are responsible for making those laws ion those STATES. I am an Englishman who knows this so Americans who do NOT? you should be ashamed.

The decision does NOT mean an end to abortions no matter which side you stand on.

The Beeb needs to stop mis-informing people.

So yeah, abortions have NOT come to an end in the US, Beeb are lying yet again. Propagandists. Get your facts right BEEB. The right in the constitution has NEVER existed and Roe v Wade could NEVER be right, that was a State level decision and SCOTUS should have thrown it out then and told the State to make their decision. There has NEVER been that right in the constitution. IF the state law exists then they can have one so what is the issue? stop gaslighting people.

RIGHTS and LAWS are NOT the same thing."
Great job US üëèüëè

"You as a woman can have the right to Abort a baby as long as the man can have the right to not financially support the baby if he request you have an abortion and you decide you want to keep it.

"BBC isn‚Äôt getting this.  The court has merely said it‚Äôs not a right in the federal constitution, which means the question goes to the states.

Even worse, what about women who are raped and just want rid of the kid so they don't have to have that memory every day, that they were forced against their will to have a kid.  I am a man myself, so please forgive me if my views are unjust...  But I do believe there's a few cases where you should have the right.  Obviously people will disagree with this view and that's fine, we all have the right to free speech, well within reason of course."
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe"

Hardly surprising that most of these people are religious zealots, using their dusty old pile of paper to justify doing whatever harmful evil they want by pretending it's ""god's word"". üôÑ But it's not just religious zealots either, some of them are also conspiracy theorists who think that by forcing people to have babies, they'll stop the ""great replacement"", which is absurd since the ban affects the immigrants too, and who do you think are ""knocking boots"" more? Duh. üòí"
How much more sane the pro-lifers seem.

"This really isn't that big of a deal. Go to another State or Mexico etc that's all this does. I'm a right leaning guy who doesn't have much of an opinion on Abortion really, only that banning it doesn't stop it it just makes the woman get it in unsafe means like traveling abroad etc but all these people protesting... why? Not a big deal, so you need a road trip to get it done, very tiny inconvenience."
Having illegal abortions hmmm okay go to prison lol üòÇüòÇ it's actually classed as murder go to prison .

"Please wear a mask... nope, constitutional rights. Please get vaccinated.. nope, constitutional rights. Let's ban untrained 17 year old minors from carrying semi automatic weapons in public... nope, constitutional rights.  Let's make this 15 year old rape victim give birth to her rapist's baby because of my religious beliefs ... sure, screw the 1st amendment.  Let's let the border patrol assault citizens in their own yard..  ok, the 4 amendment isn't important.  So while we point to a constitution written by slave owners for a country built on land stolen from the natives they slaughtered,  let's consider renaming this country for what it is,  The Oligarchy of Hypocrisy."

"The constitution doesn‚Äôt mention abortion. The courts have restored democracy in America with this ruling. 

Now states can vote for those that share their beliefs on abortion, and the majority will prevail. 

That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs meant to be."
9000 IQ move. Give anyone providing or getting a abortion (that was legal yesterday) a presidential pardon‚Ä¶. Is this technically illegal? Yes. Is it for a good reason? YES.
"This is fantastic hahaha now all of them women who make BAD CHOICES and can't control their mating skills, will have to WORK HARD at doing exactly that hahaha hopefully this begins to put the ACCOUNTABLITY bad on women to make BETTER CHOICES. I really wish this would happen in the UK. The single mum problem is actually an epidemic. The same in the USA and that's why this is so IMPORTANT. Thank god something has finally been done :)"
"Killing anyone including a foetus in the womb should not be part of any constitutional ‚Äòright‚Äô! 
The screams of the women in the streets who somehow believe that ending life is empowering for them just shows what‚Äôs wrong with society! These women literally are opposed to what femininity is ultimately about! 
Abortion should never be a ‚Äòright‚Äô. Human rights (which I support) is about something very different! And again ... in horrible bias of the media shows it‚Äôs ugly face right away, these commentators and journalists aren‚Äôt even trying to stay impartial but must berate us with their personal political views! I for one who has 
passively experienced the horror and aftermath of an abortion am glad that the termination of life in the womb of a woman can no longer be celebrated or downplayed with euphemisms like abortion!"
"The incestuous Abortions that were missed 60 years ago are now making decisions for others, what a freak show !"
"I always hear ""my body, my choice"" but what about the unborn's body and their choice. Oh I forgot, the left hates life."
Noooooooo!
"From this video, what I am seeing is all abortions are illegal in America. If that is so then the country has some serious problems. If not then there should be cases in which abortions are allowed, such as serious mental illness, rape victims, if the child in the womb is deformed or stillborn, if the mother continues it will lead to death of both or either the child/parent, and any other serious issues. 

If a female doesn't want to have a child while having unprotected sex, then plan B works fine. Abortions should be the last measure a female has to take to abort an embryo, imo I think she has almost till 4 months to know if she wants the child or not. The partner of the woman should also be conscious and aware what kind of responsibility he is handing his partner with having unprotected sex. He should learn to either use a condom, pull out, or finish with oral or external way. 

With all the technologies available to prevent pregnancies why would people be happy with a last resort, abortions. I do know some people don't notice their pregnancies until birth but those are rare."
"Today I have never been more ashamed to be called an American, 2 3rds of our country considers themselves democrat or liberal leaning, our Supreme Court is wrong. Today the louder Conservative minority won. We cannot allow our nation to be controlled by screaming, rageing bigots who think they speak for all Americans"
Hahaha! Life is LIFE!
'At what point is it okay to take a human's life?' abortion is murder.
Hope there's life on Mars. To much death here.
"I can bet a lot of those pro life girls and women will want to have an abortion when they gonna have a baby, for one reasons or another. Not all, but still plenty. And if somebody would like to ask me "" well how can you know that"", look around for stories about pro life people getting abortion. It happened many times in the past and will happen again and again in the future."
Looks like life in America is becoming worse and the country is getting in a downward spiral. Biden is to be blamed.
"USA is Pathetic!!! They ban abortions but WONT ban automatic military weapons that kill innocent ppl every few seconds in USA ! Shame on USA shame shame shame USA is a horrid country
Men should have reverse vasectomies so then abortions don‚Äôt need to happen !!!! Use your brains JFC forced vasectomies on all men pass that in your USA government 
USA s u x"
"Just a note, the vast majority (like ~80%+) support first trimester abortions, and the vast majority ~(65-70%) support some second trimester abortions. This is not the will of America."
Why should mothers have the legal right to have others expertly kill their unwanted children.
"Whatever happened to condoms, birth control, or chastity until marriage. There are other options besides genocide of the unborn. The left is obsessed with sex, murder, and revolution. Us Christians are winning and will  continue to fight until this is a Christian nation again. Praise our lord Jesus Christ."
"Abortions are not banned in the US. The court ruling simply hands decision back down to the individual states. Some states are not affected like CA, NY, VA, etc. The states that have banned abortions have exceptions like rape, medical issues, etc. üá∫üá∏‚úåüèæ"

"Great news for the unborn, for those that cant defend themselves and for those who love life. To the rest of murders, f yourself"
Why did you have to post two videos on this irrelevant issue?  The next law they need to pass is castration (and maybe a forced sex change plus throwing them into men's prison for life) or outright death penalty for rapists.
America really is a sh‚ù§Ô∏èthole isn't it?
glad that the murder of babies in some states will not be allowed
"No sex = no pregnancy.
The anti-abortion rules really make pathways to the rise of LGBTQ in America. 

You will not get pregnant if you are becoming lesbians."
"This just allows each state to set its own abortion laws. Abortion isn‚Äôt banned, some of you people need to calm down. If you want unrestricted abortion including post birth abortions then move to a deep blue state like California or New York. If you don‚Äôt want abortion used as birth control then move to a red state like Idaho, the Dakotas, etc."
"Honestly if there is ever a time to storm a government building, it wasn‚Äôt Jan 6th. It‚Äôs now. And the Supreme Court"
OMG where will Big Pharma get its immunoglobulin now?

They are forcing rape victims and victims of incest to have their abusers babies or go to prison in Oklahoma. This shit is wrong on so many levels

"Disgusting. There's no way you can call the US a first world country. Some of the most stringent abortion laws in the world and no change to gun laws, it's exactly like George Carlin said they care so much about the unborn but once you're born you're on your own."
waitaminnit! How...HOW are the infant sacrifices to the androgynous god Moloch going to continue? How are these Marxists in DC going to get their adrenochrome?
1 out of every 6 American women have been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime. Lots of women are raped in the us and now they are forced to have their rapists children. These vile disgusting men should keep there laws of women's body's.
Hat's off to those people and the supreme court who decided to stop the abortions.... Loved it!!!!
Claims to be a pro life country but endorses gun laws which culminates in having the highest gun death rate in the world - what a backwards country!!
Sweeping and long overdue change.
"There are of course very sad situations that pregnancies come about and for those my heart goes out to.
However it's about time that people took responsibility for the decisions they make,if you don't want to get pregnant don't have unprotected sex!! Its that simple."
Good! It isn't in their constitution so it's a State matter. If you don't like your State then change it via voting or leave. End of.
Grossly misleading.
What the fuck
Well American is going to become the next China with way to much people that you'll probably have to put a law to make sure everyone only has one or two kids
Radical Christians
If you don‚Äôt like this country then GTFO! Bye Felicia!
"Yeah all the women wanting to keep abortion legal are the Ho's that don't want the consequences for their actions, just my opinion but that is what it looks like. I agree if a crime was involved options should be allowed but if you opened your legs, you have to accept what comes out of it, I totally agree with that. Life should always be protected."
It‚Äôs so funny. The fantasy of one right has been destroyed by a belief far more powerful one. One that the left have no control over.
Up Next: Liberals Pause January 6th Hearings To Call For Insurrection
There is no right to abortion guaranteed by the constitution. The founding fathers would have considered it an abomination.
"I am not even in US, but I feel so terrified!"
Please tell me if a woman dies from not being able to do abortion who's fault is it?
"What about post roe v wade? Are there any plans to help women who may have sought a medical abortion? What will happen now if women will have to birth ""unwanted/unplanned"" babies? Will ""pro-lifers"" step-up to provide loving, nurturing, supportive, homes and care for the babies born from the abolition of abortion? Who will help women and babies from this reversal?"

"The US government finally degraded under Biden. In their own country, they cannot deal with social and economic problems, but at the same time they climb into Ukraine. They transfer tons of weapons and billions of dollars for the corrupt Ukrainian regime. There are so many hungry, poor and suffering countries in the world. But no one is helping Africa or South America. But there were 40 billion dollars for the war with Russia."
"Abortion is murder, plain and simple.  A beating human heart has rights."
"Don't be surprised when the racists, white supremacist and the conservatives who believe authoritarian ideology now work to continue their efforts to overturn the 14th ammendment and all civil rights gains for blacks with an aim of making racial segreagation the law of the land again."

"Testimony of Jeremy Thomas Robbins:
When I was a young man I enjoyed what most young party going men liked, such as girls, beer and drugs. I would have sex with any girl, any time and anywhere. For so long I am not sure how many I have been with at this point. I had little to no morals nor cares about anything really. The only thing I held onto was my word as I was taught when I was a child, that a man is measured by his word and to keep your promises. So, IF I said I was going to do something, I did it no matter the cost. That being said, one night I awoke from my sleep. Sat up in my bed and vocally promised myself I was going to read the bible. Not sure why, to this day I still have no understanding as to why I made this my word. But I did, so I read.... and read and read more. Turns out the bible is a rather large book and it was taking me some time to do it. But I gave my word and I kept on reading it and as I read it the words where convicting my soul. I could feel something in my heart start to turn and became uneasy. Then one night, when I was asleep. I awoke to a presence in the hall at the end of my bed. I could see something was there but I was not able to see what it was. Then I heard a disgusting noise coming from it and I told it. 
You're disgusting!!

Then out of the silence, out of the darkness I heard.

YOU	ARE	       TO

And it grabbed me.

Then I awoke not knowing I was in a dream as the entire dream was where I was and how I was. ""Never had a dream like this before and never had another like it again."" 
The crazy part.... I still felt right where ""IT"" grabbed me, as if the tightness of its grip was still on me.
To say the least I have seen something that is not normal nor good. There are evil things in this world we can not explain nor understand but I know as true as the air in my lungs. Spirits are real and so is God.
This is my testimony."

Latin America slowly legalizing abortions over the last few years and the US now banning it after having had that right for 50 years. How demoralizing this setback is.

"Due to some family history I'm not pro-abortion. Not because of religion (I don't have one), not because I wish to control women. It'd be a long explaination, but basically I am a ""liberal leftie"" who has different views on this one issue.

But I recognise that this doesn't outlaw abortion, it outlaws safe abortion. Women are going to get desperate and take unregulated medication and even go to back street abortionists who may butcher them.

I fear that the US has just traded one lot of issues and problems for another lot. If there is a God then may God help any woman caught up in this political battle."

Finally all this evil nasty women need to be  lock up.
"Many women WILL DIE! 
Thanks to the trump ADMINISTRATION and these f*cked up SCOTUS'S!"
Abortions are evil. How you can pull your baby apart in the womb is disgusting. You wouldn't do it to a dog.
"Unbelievable.  America is being held hostage by the Christian right.  Abortion won't go away.  It will go underground and, in the process, become more dangerous.  The fact that they bristle about any attempt to introduce sensible gun control regulations but are perfectly willing to restrict a women's reproductive rights tells you just how pro-life they aren't."
"I used to look at BBC as more objective than other media until it stated ""right to abortion""."

"No one actually understands what this decision is. It is an excellent legal decision.

The whole point is that the SCOTUS is NOT a political institution: Roe v Wade gave people a right that was not legislated. If you want a law, such as ""legalized abortion"" then the proper path is to ask you law maker to pass a law, that involves due process.

Roe v Wade had no due process and yet it performed the function of law making.

the decision simply deemed it improper and ask that if the public wants that right, go and ask your law maker to do it, because the function of SCOTUS is to interpret the law and not making them.

And here are people throwing a big tantrum simply because they heard some people saying they ""overturned the abortion right"" when it is nowhere near that case.

If you want abortion, vote for it, don't ask judges to do a politicians work."

"Too many people are claiming the right to abortion is not included in the US Constitution. Although it's true that the actual word is not used, it is included in the right to privacy. Body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy, in fact, which is protected by the Constitution‚Äîas decided in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shimp (1978), and of course Roe v. Wade (1973)."
"Here's how to avoid the need for an abortion: stop having casual sex!
If you must have casual sex, use contraception.
If you still manage to get pregnant (contraception fails, rape etc), you still have a wide selection of post-coital  contraception options (most/all are free in Western nations):
# Morning-after pill
 # IUD (99.9% effective at stopping pregnancy if used up to 5 days after sex)
 etc"
No! The right to murder innocent speechless babies has been struck down. Since when is murder of the innocent okay for any reason ever?
there's a lot of inexpensive birth control out there why isn't that talked about.
"The unborn‚Äù are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don‚Äôt resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don‚Äôt ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don‚Äôt need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don‚Äôt bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.

"Put it this way if you think they truly care about the Unborn, Charlie Kirk a prominent pro-lifer said if he knew a women who had an abortion he would feel sorry for he. If he truly believed it was murder on what planet would he feel sorry for a murderer..."
Of course they call them trigger laws because that's what they want the whole right side to have your finger on
Do they realize its no gonna stop anyone from having one.just because  its ileagal doesnt mean its gonna stop.dont like abortions dont have one
The Supreme Court just went full Order 66 on the libs.
When roe vs wade was passed the morning after pill wasn‚Äôt available.

There should be better options üòå people should not be using abortion as birthday!

Handmaids tale.
The real dark day in America was when roe v wade was passed.
Biden is powerless. Period.
Unwanted pregnancies cause tax payers a lot of money.
my state is new york and any woman who is being forced to go thru with anything they dont want to is welcome here. hateful comments will not be responded to.
Expect bloodied coat hangers to be found in ally ways in states who got rid of abortion. That‚Äôs all I have to say.
"Every child is a precious and sacred gift from God #President Trump‚Ä¶I‚Äôve noticed that everyone who is for abortion have already been born #President Reagan..‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èIncomprehensible that since 1973, 61 million abortions done in the U.S.üò≠üò≠"
There are very few sane people on either side of the issue.  Just look at those women.  FYI: This case was about a Mississippi law that banned abortions after 15 weeks.  Women in Mississippi can still get abortions up until 15 weeks.  The media's characterization of this is misleading.
still the state decides ... so the people of the states decide ..which is still balance and good
"Bless the yanks, the majority of ""anti-abortionists"" in america using the argument of ""murdering babies"" are the same people who will bite your head off for trying introduce stricter gun laws to reduce the amount of murdered babies..."
good maybe now the std rates will go down
There is no baby for these people to save. The life isn‚Äôt made yet.
I guess In the case of a medical emergency you can claim the that rape has lead to mental illness opening a case to perform an abortion. That‚Äôs just me looking at a loop hole instead of mass riots as this decision went through all the legal paths.
Only sl*ts and manh*es be disappointed. üòÅ
"It‚Äôs not as if it means abortion won‚Äôt happen anymore either. It‚Äôll still happen but it will be a lot less safe and bad people now have an opportunity to make money from it. 
And not the first time a U.S. law has had these effects, might I just add."
There are enough types of birth control and the morning after pill maybe young women might be more careful with their bodies. Abortion is not birth control. American women uoto now could abort a baby right up til the week before it was due. That shouldn't be allowed in any civilized society.
This is a great day! No more abortions!!!!!! Thank god!!!! God bless America!

"this is a decision to let states legalize abortion, what is the big deal?"
"The non-aborted humans in the future thank the Supreme Court. Abortion should only take place when the mother‚Äôs life will be in danger if she gives birth. 

Terminating a fetus because it will inconvenience your lifestyle is immoral and demonic."
Very good. We're going back to our roots in America. A proper conservative country.
Voting matters.
Great news for USA from these Low life creatures - enemy from within worst than ISIS - the Demon RATS
"The ignorance of the protesters amazes me. Do they not realize the only thing this overturn does, is to put the abortion rights back into the states? They can still get their abortion, that hasn't changed. It is still legal in the majority of states, especially in cases of rape and incest."
Never go to America.
The sport of killing humans a law is needed for the woman.
Let the accountability start :-)
"This subject shouldn't even be up for discussion. I had a friend who got raped when she was 15, her parents were idiots like these people and forced her too keep it and carry it for 9 months. When they could have allowed her to abort it since it wasn't even alive yet. She dropped out of school in order to take care of her baby. When she turned 18 her lovely parents kicked her out of their house. My mom let her live with us and took care of the child for her since it was painful for my friend to even look at the child since they so closely resembled the ""father"". My friend died in her sleep 2 years ago, she was only 19. Her whole life was ruined. She felt sad and tired all the time. And was left with a lot of inguries after giving birth since her body couldn't take it. She was such a sweet beautiful girl. I truly dispise all the men and women who are ""pro life"" what life are you talking about. It is a fetas. It has yet to develop. Unless the lady is already 5 months pregnant where the child can feel then it's none of your concern if the she chooses to abort or not. The only life is the womans who is going to be ruined. A child should be a blessing and a choice. Not a consequence. These people scream privileged and uneducated. And I wish the pro abortion people would actually bring up scientific facts and peoples stories instead of stupidly shouting ""my body my choice"". That ain't doing shit to help anyone."
"women says it will lessen the violence in her country, but the guns are fine"
"What will be next ??? Same sex marriage? Mix race marriage? What the F next ? Having cops in your f  bedroom? You can only slow down the change, but you can‚Äôt stop it."
So now what? Prohibiting guns THEN blaming on unaccessible abortions?
"Abortion should also be banned in the UK
It goes against the core principles of Christianity and Judaism and Islam but more so .... humanity"
Amazingly balanced reporting.  It is sad that ‚Äúbalance‚Äù in news reporting seen as remarkable.
As a citizen of the US from birth. I an deeply ashamed of this country. It is on a collision course to either another civil war or conservative dystopia. All in all there may very well be bloodshed before the end.
I see potentially HIGH risk of GUNLESS females
Great news :)
Nice!
the US politics is so bizarre. Normal things in other countries are polarized and politicized in the US.
"This is not about abortion.
The ja6 will be forced."
The dishonesty of reporting is scandalous. SCOTUS simply corrected a wrong. Roe was unconstitutional.
That has to b a complete violation of womens rights got to be!
"@5:26 you thought this country would still allow you and subsidise your child termination, got it."
i hope all the S lags and S luts arent too upset
"Glad I was able to help my 15 years old friend when she wanted a termination.
I was her only friend and brother figure ,and she needed an adult.

Only thing we had to do was travel to Manchester because someone could have recognized us in Newcastle."
"This is not really about abortion. Everyone is missing the point.  It's about judges that are biased. I don't know what people expect. You know the judges are biased, and you expect them to make a fair unbiased ruling ?"
When someone gets raped and forced to give birth abd they don't want to have it. ALL I can say is wow  good luck
I wonder if the BBC is the most hated corporation to ever exist? certainly is mt top choice
NO they lost the supposed right to make me pay for it.
As a Hispanic immigrant that came to the United stated I‚Äôm very happy for this decision. If people want to have abortions let each state decide if they want to be participant of murderer.
No it's not. It's now up to individual states to rule on the subject.
This country is dying üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"its not a constitutional right......your getting mixed up with the carrying a gun laws......which is an ""actual""constitutional right"
"00:08 - Abortion was a ""right"" ???   WRONG !!!  The ONLY Rights that Americans have are those enumerated in the US Constitution and its Amendments.  Americans have no other Rights but they do occasionally get ""favors"" from their Masters, the Social Security System being a prime example."
Thou shall not kill!  It's a commandment that has been overlooked for a long time. The unborn finally got their day in court & justice prevailed.
This is some taliban 3rd world shit.
America is the most divided place in the world...in my opinion.
Do America know how much of a meme they have always been to the world? What a backward place.
"I wonder if there's a statistic that shows how many pro-lifers in USA are also NRA members. Oh well, look on the bright side, more kids means more targets!"
"Now, US Supreme Court forces Americans to stand with Taliban together? US Supreme court is trying to prove the power of a religion over laws, just like Taliban? This is unbelievable. This is making US a barbarian land. So shameful! It is not other countries beat US down. It is US itself drag itself behind the world."
Are they going to have insurrection are these people going to have an insurrection against the government because abortion rights was shot down wow you better watch it people the FBI's going to throw you in jail like you and throw away the key if you're going to try to over the government what you did try on the supreme Court there before it was passed you better watch out cuz you're going to get locked up if you happy insurrection against the government because of abortion right was passed by the supreme Court
wow what an impartial report lmao.........the people are awake now......we see through the propaganda

"Get your molotovs ready, my boys. It's time to burn some judge's mansions."
Strange that country which is so hyped up on 'freedom' allows unelected officials to make decisions that impacts millions of people.
"The report was bias.  Noone was shown celebrating their choice to keep.  No mention, some people abuse Roe v Wade, to use abortion as a last ditch contraception, due to unprotected sex.  I dont trust non-official statistics on how many US women choose to abort during their lifetime, but a safe bet will be 10%.  I would believe among those maybe 10% were due to rape, medical, or other trauma.  Lets say 9% overall used it because of unprotected sex.  This is acceptable to keep it legal, to me.  However no mention that some people believe much more abused it.  I found stats claiming it is as high as 30% instead.  I know pro-choice and pro-life issue is so loud mainly for ideologically, political and religious reasons, not on moral ones.  Actual arguments for and against on moral grounds, matter less, and used as tools instead.  The fact, this is kicked back to the states, where abortion can be legalized one day, isn't as emphasized relative to how bad that it was overturned.  Mind you the SCOTUS issue, is not abortion legal or illegal, but who should handle this, if the abortion is a constitutional right or not, not weather it is criminal.  This report was bias, pro-choice.  No judgment, maybe for them it was impossible to represent both sides equally.  I am protesting unfair representation, not the ruling.  Dont know there, my flavor for today, pro-choice constitutional, but i am not against letting it swing, if it was legally done.  Being fair to some in their perspective, in this case, will be unfair to others in theirs."
"@2:21 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 21 and I‚Äôm terrified‚Äù use condoms or other form or contraception if you must, that should do it :-)"
"Good it‚Äôs changed. Lot more men an women now will practice safer sex. No brainier, makes me happy this news üóû"
"So misleading and one sided it‚Äôs unreal. If you know the facts. How about it‚Äôs un done many years of  a unconstitutional overhaul of the legislative process in the states, now the power for people to make choices is back with the people to decide when life Begins is a decision for the people . Trying to claim abortion is a god given right is ridiculous. If California wants to keep theirs laws so be it now red states if they choose can change their laws. Not so much for freedoms of choice when it‚Äôs other peoples choices."
"I bet the Communist BBC is sick as about this. i personally dont really care.....but the more lefties and commies and BBC staff hate the news.....the more i love it.

This sucks‚Ä¶
"Perhaps they don't want to cancel abortion, only fix that old ruling that served as a platform for wider rights of woman.  Hope I'm not mistaken, but now they can start a completely different procedure, giving back abortion rights to woman based on plain scientific facts. That couldn't ever be overruled because science doesn't change with time. 
But first science must make it very clear there are no other people living inside a woman body."
So do I still need to pay child support üòÇ
Its a sad day that the unborn child cant be slaughtered ( joe biden )
They care about babies lives and at the same time not do anything about kids being killed in schools makes sense

"In China,  an unborn placenta is not yet identified as life,  it's just mother's property and the mother has the right to give up the property, which is her freedomÔºåIf abortion would endanger the mother's life, then no hospital would perform the procedure, because the right of Life  is first."
F***ing Arkansas
Women that travel from one state to another to have an abortion is nothing short of premeditated murder.
"The ""pro-life"" crowd are the same people who would deny asylum to desperate people fleeing warzones and abject poverty, they're also the same people who want to allow unstable teenagers access to assault rifles, and they're the same people who support Trump's immigration policy, tearing families apart and caging them. They must think were stupid if they think they're fooling anyone into believing they care about strangers unborn children. To them, this is simply about attacking feminism, upholding ""Christian"" values, and winning one over on the ""libs"". That's how petty and backwards these people are."

"So if a woman get's raped and get's pregnant from that, she will have no choice but to keep it even if she does not want it. So much for a free country....."

I love children and all people. I am so grateful for the results determined by the Supreme Court. I believe in human rights. This protects the human rights of the unborn child.
1 in 4 pregnancies 'self abort'. For these religious extremists does that mean their God is an abortionist?
For such a new country not 250 yrs old. To actually force someone else's recent religious ideals onto non religious ppl is NO democracy. Recent? Coz didn't the nuns used to abort teen pregnancies? For all we know they probably still perform these on convent girls now..... holier than thou....
"100 years behind civilised society, including gun laws"
"It looks like the BBC doesn't understand how the US constitution works.  The Supreme Court can't and didn't make abortion illegal.  It simply said the constitution doesn't protect it as a ""right"".  That means that each state can put it to a vote.  This is called ""democracy"".  Rights are not put to a vote, and nowhere in our constitution is there a ""right"" to an abortion.  If a subject is not stated as a ""right"" than according to the 9th amendment of our constitution it is a matter for the states to decide by VOTING.  This is why the US is a constitutional republic using democracy to settle matters the constitution does not address.   Read the US constitution.  It is a very short document, and no where is there a right to abortion.  The word does not even appear in it.  This is where democracy plays a role in our constitutional republic.   In California they'll be killing their kids right up until the age of 18.  In Texas killing your kid will be illegal.  That is how a republic works."
Hallelujah for the unborn babies!!

it simply means the states control abortion.
Good if you don‚Äôt want children put a johnny on it
CANADIANS WILL HELP AMERICAN WOMEN WE ALREADY SAID.  YOU CAN COME HERE AND GET A ABORTION ANYTIME.  YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY BUT AT LEAST YOU CAN GET ONE HERE DON'T WORRY.
Sorry you can't kill babies some Men can't even have any
The supreme court didn't ban abortion. BBC doesn't understand how the U.S. system works.
Now we need to fight to ban same sex marriages
A victory for humans.
"THEY KEPT THEIR GUN LAWS, YET THEY LOSE A RIGHT TO ABORTION? CRAZY USA"
It is a shame to see such a modern country act so pathetically with regard to human rights. They base their constitution on their being oppressed but do no more than oppress their own people.  So you cannot abort a  child even from rape but we are fine with a teenager owning handguns  and driving cars but they cannot drink until 21 they allow TV evangelists whonprey on the weak and poor and are ok better than thieves themselves and then without checking anyone can own an assault rifle. What a ridiculous society

People you better pay close attention. The prison camp walls are being built getting aid from the Supreme Court. They just made a moral decision. Not a legal decision. That's not their job. This needs to be looked into. This is a warning shot. First in many. In plan to rewrite other laws to their benefit.  All in moving America backwards. No regard for the majority wanting this law to stand & what's brazen is they knew what the majority wanted & carried this out anyway. Little side not for you guys out there. Your fucked now. Do an oops and your life as well as the girl is really fucked. Advise? For your sake get a vasectomy. You could get stuck with a woman like who's interviewed here. God the mental immoral minority are yelling through a megaphone.

The best news in 2022. God bless United States of America. Abortion is murder.
"Sections of the US of Americans love to kill, by hook or by crook.
By all types of guns murdering the young 'uns,
If not before birth, then before they see earth.
Women supported by the men causing impregnation,
To have pleasure and without any procreation,
Better as justice to the unborn give the couple sterilisation."
"Well this means they can change the gun rights, right? üòÖ"
American politics needs an overhaul. The system is broken. First you have the Trump fiasco and now this. Maybe they need to adopt the Westminster system. Hard to call what they have now a democracy for the people. Come on guys sort it out.
"MASTER TIP: I now understand why my childhood friends said women that believe in abortion are unfit for marriage and should be for recreational use only. If a woman is so heartless as to murder her own children, think of what she will do to you when you no longer serve a desired purpose. It‚Äôs simply a good vs evil and light vs darkness spiritual battle. How can any moral person justify demanding the right to murder someone with impunity. What a shame?"
"Yes this horrible. These babies will now be birthed and immediately start carrying guns provided by the SCOTUS ruling! Theses babies will  be wanting payback because the Birthing  Persons wanted to abort them but SCOTUS has put a worldwide ban on abortions. Gangs of newborn babies will be roaming the streets of America armed with with AK-47,s and AR-15,s looking for the new Chest Feeders that reluctantly brought them in to this lawless world!"
The majority of woman who get abortions do so because they got pregnant by not using protection. Or just not having sex at all. I understand why woman who have been raped are upset. Those have my sympathy. But most of you need to learn responsibility.
"The problem that arises from more millions of Americans as refugees from the failed GOP states -- like for California that handed Joe Biden 5-million of the popular vote, that he did not need to win California -- is that it entrenches the disruptive power of a death-grip on the country, that the Republicans hold, by way of the Electoral College system. The majority of Americans, as appealed to by Joe Biden, must give the Democrats the commanding majority in both Congress and Senate, with which  set things right. If they refuse to do that, this 2022 and 2024. the US is on a Daytona-fast-track, track, to becoming the Former Democracy of America (FDOA) under Trump (or similar), like the Former Democracy of Afghanistan (FDOA)  that Trump handed over to the Taliban."
"Almost 50 years passed before the Supreme Court of America can see beyond the clouds. Now you get it, change has come to America."
"For the United States, this over turning of Roe v Wade, continues the rocket sled ride back into the times of ignorance and cruelty. I see this dilemma as a women's issue, it's best left to them to make a decision that primarily effects them. No exception for pregnancy resulting from rape or incest flies against the tenons of a descent and supportive society. Drawing on religion and the words written by ignorant, ie primitive Middle Eastern desert dwellers in a world we think of as being enlightened yet has no humanity for others, Americans pray a lot, cast judgement on other people, yet whose military is responsible for wickedness so egregious, so vile, that even God will deny you all  entry to the heavenly kingdom where most of you are certain exists.

"Every idiot out there for those of you who abuse people with conditions, when much applies to you, you will not be helped, for you bash people with conditions then get one yourself.

This has nothing to do with the American Dream to that of life is uncivil or perverse. And for the government to be involved to force pro-life people and blame republicans is unacceptable when they took up the case to choose to that of they had the house through a corrupt means. 

If it were up to the president though he argues in the case of women, it would be used as a ploy to score political earning points for democrats that turned the nation upside down or divided it even more. The fault is the democratic took it up and yet the high justices made their decision with clarity and hopefully not politically motivated tough confused some people by their decisions.

Why are people so committed to murder outside the womb and by that, I mean women - aside from the fact they did not want the child? They should think about that before they think about sex is what others would have thought to that of the vital heartbeat bill is important to determine if the baby is functioning or alive. If so, it gives people the right to choose rather than to sacrifice for intentional murder then, so life is justified or somewhat satisfied. Though I mean there should be a limit of time to get that procedure done anyway? - They forget to include that rape and incest is a matter of abortion rights as well and it does not explain this validity of rights or wrongs in the constitution but amended. 

To it has to be the Morales of humanity is screwed up before the face on both sides. 

One to argue for life and the other for murder. In this case 
I would claim give the baby to the caring mother and not that of the one willing to have life and kill it. - An ancient example that time forgot.

Though I have to admit, this is actually good to teach people a lesson about the abandonment. - By that I mean people who continue to give birth and persecute on a purposeful means. What the democratic of idiots in the government to the president do not understand to a point is that it should have been chosen by the states to begin with, to that of the lady should also have a right to choose based on case-by-case scenario in defense of whose body it is - referring to the lady's wants. So technically Poloski in one case is right and wrong. This is actually a step forward for what is right for the lives of others to that of also a blow against those of anti-life.

It should not be up to the states to pay for illegal abortions or intentional murder. It does not advocate for murder but to justify for life. So, I am unsure if this statement applies knowing I do not know the case too well."
"Overturning Roe v Wade simply moves the issue from a federal level to a state level, the amount of hysteria in these comments goes to show that many people don't do any research when giving their opinions."

Realistically?
"This title lets me know BBC is mega Left and heavily uninformed, abortion now isn‚Äôt banned it‚Äôs just controlled by the state nevertheless killing babies for selfish reasons is morally wrong and a sin"
"Let's be honest. The majority of people who want abortion is not because of the welfare of the baby, even though that's what they are preaching. It's because so they can have sex without the worry of giving birth. It's about them, not the baby..it comes down to desires and their lust. I would say perhaps 5% of them? And I'm being generous here, would probably do the abortion for the welfare of the baby."
"What's the point us having a president/leader again? Doesn't f***ing work does it, he can't do jack shit by all accounts, unless you mean endanger human life in afghanistan, then he is your man. Of course he didn't make that decision either."
Please don't come to California Jesus Freaks......
"Arkansas law protects the life of the mother? WTF! She should be forced to carry even if she dies.  why is her life more sacred? If the law was fair it would let her die, put her on life support and the baby delivered when viable.  All men who rape should get the same sentence as the mother who can't choose abortion - life imprisonment.  Fathers who abandon their children should get the same sentence as the mother forced to birth and raise the child - life!"
It is understood better from a female put in that position.
This will teach irresponsible females to be wiser with their bodies. Don‚Äôt have unprotected sex.

"It should never of been in the constitution you idiots , ps its now in the public legislators hand where it should be, abortion is not ileagle ,the people of each state can now decide"

"The 9th amendment states: 

""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.""

This means that are human rights that are acknowledged, but not stated in the bill of rights and that the constitution cannot be used to infringes upon the rights of the individual just because it's not explicated stated in the constitution. 

The banning of abortion at any level of the government is a clear violation of one's 9th amendment and 14th amendment right that promises equal protection under the law."
Sad day for women. People should probably care more about the actual kids being murdered in schools and stuff but sure change this law instead
"Lol President Biden thinks that letting the elected officials of the people decide their own rules and regulations is extreme.

"We exist in time! To understand ourselves means to reflect on time. To understand time, we need to reflect on ourselves. The book Your Brain Is A Time Machine by Dean Buonomano, he states that your brain reacts with the passage of time and establishes bridges between the past, present, and future. If someone throws us something to catch, we move our hand to where the item will be in the future. We plant seeds to grow crops in the future. We invest in scientific research so that in the future it will result in knowledge and technology. This being between past and future events is central to our mental structure. From the book The Order Of Time by Carlo Rovelli. What I get from this is that the evolution of the brain from before the Cambrian times to the present around six hundred million years, this is how the brain functions. What is happening today in America is that the majority of American Homo sapiens are not connecting the past with the future. They just want to live in the status quo of the past, becoming stagnant, never creating knowledge or learning. Their past is a white supremacy state with racial divide and a fascist state in which some dictator tells them what to think and what to do as they sit on their couches eating barbecue, watching sports and reality tv shows. The only future they are interested in is the next sport event, reality tv show time, and reporting for work. To them it's a crime to have education, critically think for yourself, and question authority! Proust in his novel Remembrance Of Things Past states that reality is formed by memory. Which is so perfect in American society today! False memories constantly given to the people by propaganda channels like Fox News, OAN, Epoch Times, Breitbart, and other radical right wing fascist channels are creating this nightmare of a reality we face now! This stagnation is the death of American democracy and America! Other nations will advance in science, medicine, education, and the arts. While America degrades into warring villages and states. Hint! Study the Islamic empire from 1000 to 1400 should open anyone's eyes. The insurrection and Reversing Roe vs Wade are just the beginning! ‚ò¢ ENDS ‚ò¢"

Woman should have the right to there own anatomy my body my choice I'm Antinatalist against bringing kids in to exsitence having kids is worse than murder
"The bottom line is that restricting abortions will lead to: more single mothers who are not financially supported by the state sufficiently, greater birth rate of children with disabilities - also consider women who were alcoholic or drug addicted prior to getting pregnant (that could have been previously tested for and aborted), more young women unable to go on to college and be independent, miserable upbringing of unwanted children especially those with disabilities from parents who take out their frustrations on the child as they see it as ruining their youth or independence financially. It‚Äôs really difficult to end it when there are definitely good reasons for it. I am sure even a pro lifer wouldn‚Äôt want to have the child of a man who raped her! This should be a personal choice between a woman and her doctor but set within a definitive time line. And women who abuse abortion having had multiple ones (3+) should be sterilised."

I'm actually personally in favour of abortion being legal but with a limit of around 18 to 20 weeks"
"If you don't want a baby ,stop having sex. it is simple... God be praise!!!"
"I truly believe that until a fetus has been grown for 24 weeks, and can survive outside its mother‚Äôs body, it is not a completely separate life. It is a human soul tethered to its mother‚Äôs body, and she has the right to choose how she proceeds with this part of her life and her body. Whether you like it or not their rights do not outweigh the health and sanity of their mother‚Äôs. Late term abortions (post 24 weeks) should only ever performed for serious medical reasons. Women who are having late term abortions are only doing so if their baby will not have any quality of life outside the womb. It is unfathomable for me how any politician let a bunch of narrow minded ideological driven so call Justices of Law can believe that they understand more about a woman‚Äôs health, and survival, than the doctor caring for her."
Didn't mind when they were telling people they had to have the jab. Fuck off BBC. How about telling the real truth about the grooming gangs?! Lying by omission is still lying!

Making it illegal will not stop people doing it. It will force them to do it under unsafe conditions and will cost many young woman's lives. It is hard to believe that this is really happening.
Gay marriage next

If u don't want kids why have them?

Right to Abortion??????  There is no Right to an Abortion under the American Constitution.  Get some education
2:39 don't  you mean  birthing  people  ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Fuck them they better adopt some of those poor kids in the system if they really pro life and take care of all of them and not complain about it but what do they do nothing about those kids in the system just care about those unborn babies. Shut up and take care of the poor kids there are right now.
If  woman who are sexual assaulted and cannot have an abortion then the person who also created that child should pay for the child It is unfair for woman to go through that alone
Those same morons will be banning contraception next.
Women still have FOUR options - abstinence/contraception/motherhood/adoption. That‚Äôs plenty.
"make the world a better place what a joke
they just want the women to go to private clinics for abortions so
they get more money"
About time the evil of random abortion was challenged. God only knows how many souls never made it
Bro that lady with the face paint has an iq beginning with a .
If we really cared about children in our nation we would have banned assault weapons but no people want their god damn ak-47 instead of protecting kids
Pact up and move to a democrat state!!!! point blank and period...or go see your doctor and get on some good birth control!!!! That is before you lay down with the scum!!!!!
"Life won today? What about the woman's right to her life? Pro life usually ends when the baby is born, and the mother gets no help. I wonder how these
young women will feel when birth control is banished. The Taliban is here in the USA, disguised by judicial robes."
I Don't kniw what us wrong with them I was part of the NOW thus makes me ANGERY and a lot if women are going to suffer and die because of this my body my right so am suck and tired. Or other people telling me what I can and cannot do as a women
Great victory for the Constitution and basic decency.

COPE AND SEETHE."
"So women can go get pretty much free abortions but for those women who have trouble getting pregnant and want a child it cost outrageous amounts of money. Ya in certain cases like rape or incest the women should have a right to an abortion but for those who just go out having sex and have had multiple abortions, well better strap up now."
"As a capitalist country it only makes sense they would do this, they need more people who are going to be put into horrible situations that will work the jobs no one else will at close to nothing in terms of pay."

Stop aborti üëâüî•‚õîüî•
The funny thing about Conservatives praising this is that the majority of these babies will grow up to vote Liberal. It‚Äôs like turkeys voting for Christmas. We won‚Äôt see the real effects for 20 years or so but it will happen.
Great
And most states in the United States they've got six weeks to get an abortion I don't understand why they don't think that that isn't enough time to go and murder a little baby when in New York they allow even post birth
Well done üëè  America
"SPA = when I was a mere child although supremely wise, there were only 4 things that I could not over-stand = here r 2 = Abortion &  homosexuality but now than I am gifted with supreme enlightenment I have come 2 over-standing the reasons & the whys the creator gave it living creations the magic/creation wants of vagina and penis = so the question becomes = If the creator gave I life and the abilities/magic to give or take life? Then tell I who or what religion, government has the right to trump the  gift/abilities/magic given to I by I creator to chose or not to chose that which I do onto I own self, even 'taking my own life ?
Personally for she who has aborted could never bear suns or moons for I not because of a wrong or right = simply because I know the chi-effects associate with said action but at no time should I or any human being be so stupidly demoniclly audacious to think that their idea of how I, as an adult human being, should trump my god given right to chose that which affects my body of mentally or physically in any way, whether wrong or right.

Women with men should replicate, Black Lives Matter with a more power and effect 'Women Lives Matter' = It's a great time and season for this act of True American Ideology  SPAdotcoms.com"
I bet everyone of those who have been fighting to take others rights away have never known a hardship
I wonder if all the people crying out to stop people having a choice are helping all the homeless and foster kids in the country as well.

"So let me get this straight from the UK, the US do not allow women to have a right to choose whether they can abort or not but gun rights are for everybody to choose? Just trying to keep up!"
This is some 3rd world stuff going on. It reminds me of how women are treated in the middle east.

It's just gross.  And so are the people who say this is a good thing and the SCOTUS should keep going.

Move over Taliban - there's a new caliphate on the block.
"All the court did was recognize it was always a states rights issue. 
Democrats can still kill black babies but only in democrat run states."
"What should happen now is that woman that can not keep their babies for whatever reason they think they cant keep them, should be left at a church and they have to pay for their education, safety, and make sure that he/she is successful and loved since they fought so much on Jesus name, that should be a law actually. Abortion will not stop, these woman will be butchered,
And they call themselves the greater country in the world. Do something about your politicians US people or they will deep fry you and eat you."

Good news
It`s funny how hard women will fight to have no accountability for their actions...now maybe they`ll start actually taking that one pill a day to assist in not getting pregnant during a Tinder hookup...
"I agree with ruling , abortion is actually murder , you might say its only an embreo and its not human ""yet"" i think they are completly wrong . If it is not aborted it would have grown to become a person and a human is a human from the moment of his conception till the day he die. This  is my personal opinion and since we live in a free world we can all say our opinions!"
The world is over populated already and the world's resources are running out so basically fuck the planet with no abortions we all die sooner as a whole
"Surely whichever side of this you fall on, this isn't good. It's the same issue that the US had in the 1930s with prohibition and the ongoing debate about legalising drugs. The cat is out of the bag and you can't get it back in. If women really want abortions they will get them, legal or not. Seems to me all this will do is lead to a sharp rise in dangerous backroom abortions."

"There was never a ""legally enshrined right"", there ever was a ""right to an abortion guaranteed under the constitution"".
It was never in the constitution, or the bill of rights.
The original argument to abortion was a privacy right, which made no sense at the time, and continued to make no sense.
A better argument would be bodily autonomy under property law, but even then, it's not only your body the decision effects."

"The pro abortion group is all for bringing children into this world to stand back and watch him starve to death. They call that Christianity. Sounds like pure evilness. These women who are pro-life, they have been beaten down to where they don't think they are human any longer so they are against all other women who has rights. That they have allowed their preacher or their men to take away from them, by putting them down. And brain worsham to believe that pro-life is the way, when it only really allows children to go hungry in the United States because they don't care about them once they are here on Earth. If that's what they call Christian. I wouldn't want no part of it sounds like pure evil. They claimed their Christians, but they violate their own beliefs. Their beliefs are only for others they want to have control over."

"According to the bible: ""righteousness raises up a nation"". A great tribute to the Supreme Court of the USA.

By the way, let's do a little analysis together: There are about 354 million people in the United States, let's say there are 150 million women who are able to procreate, let's say about 30% have an abortion every year. So, you could say that US infanticide kills about 45 million children every year."
Great news
"As usual the BBC misreports the facts.  This reversal does not make abortion illegal, but mearly puts the onus back onto the individual states, where it belongs.  Yes there will be a few states that may outlaw abortion and even a few of those will have exceptions to their particular ruling.  Most states will have laws allowing abortion and if the state you live in doesn't allow the type of abortion you want, you can drive to another state to get one.  The Pro-abortion crowd destroyed themselves when they started pushing for abortions that would allow babies to be killed after the babies were born.  Sounds crazy, but the discussion was out there."
"Conservatives:  Desperately protect the laws that have made shooting school age children a national pastime in the name of freedom.

"So in the matter of a few days that extremist kangaroo court has made it even easier for Americans to keep killing each other and now they‚Äôre insisting on women birthing children whether they want to (can do) or not. I have us citizenship but will never, ever move back because it‚Äôs become a sham democracy with politicians picking their voters, an elected unaccountable king they call a president, it‚Äôs violent the likes of which would be unthinkable in any other developed country and it‚Äôs a dystopian society with all the worst parts of capitalism leading to such incredible wealth for a few and such poverty for millions without even basic healthcare. It is a shame the most powerful country has become an example of how not to run a country but for the rest of us in the west, we can separate ourselves from being too closely linked so their twisted vision of religious supernatural nonsense and bigotry do not infest our societies. Children & the elderly should be able to ride public transport without fear and go to school without passing through metal detectors, women have a right to decide if they are ready to have a child, humans born gay are still people, people with a different skin colour are all the same under the skin, and everyone has a right to believe in whatever god(s) they want to or not without having it thrown down their throats by the state. These are basic things any developed civilized country should be able to guarantee without question. Sad day, especially for Americans, but also for the west in general because our most prominent member disgraced itself so spectacularly."
This thumbnail is very misleading to people who don‚Äôt live in the US. As an American who was born in 1993 I can assure you‚Ä¶that the future is not anti-abortion in the US & the majority of young people are outraged by this.

"Abortion should be legal to anyone who wants it, but to ban abortion completely even in instances of rape is barbaric. Wait until you see; instances of rape will increase, but reports will decrease. Anyone who gets pregnant through rape will be reluctant to report it, as that will mean they'll be known to be pregnant and therefore cant get an abortion. These laws are not prolife. They are pro-rapist, pro forced birth, pro maternal death. Pro lifers do nothing to help with the very gun laws that kill the babies they are forcing afabs to have, or the formula shortage."
"It's nothing about pro life. Because if it was they would be taking care of the ones that are already here on Earth that are breathing air. But instead they pretend like they are pro-life just to watch the children be born into property, and no rights as a human being in United States of America. This people who say they are a Christians, but allow children to be abused sexually, and be starved to death. If they are so pro-life then why have they took care of the people who live on the streets that are homeless and hungry? Because it is not about their caring heart, it's about Church's controlling the people of the United States. Churches need to be made to pay taxes. Because they have violated the agreement that they would not get involved in politics which has been nothing but a lie, to the people of the United States. Churches have continued to shave their false belief down everyone's throat. The Bible was wrote over 100 years after Jesus Christ was sacrificed. And the ones who wrote the Bible were nothing but men who wanted control of others. They have took Jesus words and twisted them for them to be able to have control.
If there was a election today between Trump and God guess who they would vote for? Trump. Because, religious christianities believe that Trump is their God.

Are you going to adopt and feed the hundreds of ""babies"" that would've gotten ""murdered"" to give them the crappy life thats already set out for them? This just screams the unsafe ways women will try and get an abortion, even if their life is at stake. Pro-lifers make me sick. I'd rather die than bear a child I did not want to have."

It's a pity they overturned it  but it's not guaranteed by the Constitution. This is a common misconception. And the flimsy construct put together by Justice Blackmun back in 1973 is the reason and the tool for today's SCOTUS decision

"Very good to hear, a step in the right direction."
"The SCOTUS gave women the right to choose to live outside of states with state sponsored child murder. Don't worry lefties, you'll still be able to murder unborn children in half the states of the US."
Just look at this pro-abortion crowd. What are they woried about? The only way that these hags will get pregnant is by artificial insemination.
People who are close minded or extreme will never be right whether they are pro or anti abortion.  In this day and age it‚Äôs hard to understand how there can be unplanned pregnancies in the first place.  There may be good reasons for some abortion but we shouldn‚Äôt be backing abortions for convenience.  People need to be responsible for their actions and make better decisions.

Girls get your wedding dresses ready cause if you cant be free to choose neither should he if he get you pregnant he your husband!! How many women would have kept their child if the Man married her ? You cant have one without the other .
"In the end this issue will be decided by young women. 

Remember, the US has much higher labour mobility than we see in the UK with people far more prepared to move across the country in search of a better life. If access to abortion is as important as people seem to say then young women (and especially the more talented ones who have more options) will choose to locate in States with more liberal abortion laws. Talented young men will follow. It won't be long before some corporations start to leave States who restrict abortion because it's easier to recruit and retain talent in States with a more liberal attitude. 

Alternatively, maybe young women will prefer to live in places with restrictive abortion laws because this will engender a culture with less pressure for them to have sex before they really want to. 

But whichever way it goes, in the end, it will be young women that decide."
"Exactly the right thing to do, Also if you are with a partner/ husband,it should be a joint decision,in other countries.   Woman that take drugs whilst pregnant should be charged, the baby should not have to be born a crack cocaine or heroin addict, then they should be sterilised"
Men would rather play video games than have sex and deal with feminist so whats the big deal.
America won't have many more chances to turn back to God... Women should think about the consequences before laying down and conceiving these little innocent babies and this so called ten months abortion outside of the womb is murder plain and simple....
"The header should read ""Right to abortion passed back to the state legislators, as opposed to Right to abortion struck down, it was not struck down."
21 & terrified  lol üòÜ ya.
What else are they going to take away?? This is just the beginning! This is not about saving life this is about exercising power over people and tell them what they can and cannot do. God gave us the right to choose Good and Evil. Are we becoming a little China? Were the government tells us what to do as far as reproduction? Are they prepared for all the adoptions that are going to happen? As far as Free Will and freedom of choice I'm disappointed in America! But like the Bible says they will start acting like a beast exercising powers over people
Anything that allows abortion with Bidens offspring is a good decision
This artice aims to enforce people's lack of knowledge of the law and our rights. Be careful and know your rights. Wherever you are.
Sure wish everyone would hurry up and die already the human race is just pure shlt anymore.
America's a strange place
Everybody forgot God performs tens of millions of spontaneous abortions a year.
"Lessen the violence of abortion, but increase the violence of guns. Pro-file before you're alive, anti-life once you are. They want to ensure that you are born, and then don't mind handing someone a gun to shoot you dead once you are."
Oh boo hoo.  Sick that these women cry when they cant kill babies
"The left - banning legal abortions will only result in illegal abortions!

Also the left - banning guns for the law abiding shall stop criminals using guns illegally!"
"This issue and the other decision made by our Supreme Court related to guns make me ashamed of my country of origin. This is a sad day in the US, sadder for our daughters."
Too bad none of these protesters could trouble themselves to vote in midterm elections.  Their indifference is the reason this has happened.
Maybe the states should make the penalty for rape a cutting ‚úÇÔ∏è off the offending parts too would be helpful
And insulin is still high and L.A. Is still in a crimewave.

"Ah yes, freedom"
Insest still ok in royal & elite circles
"ROE V WADE  is Not a Constitutional  Right..it was NEVER intended to be used as birth control ..if Law enforcement  rules that if a drunk driver accidently kills a pregnant woman and fetus its A DOUBLE HOMICIDE..but if a pregnant woman INTENTIONALLY  kills her unborn baby its her right to choose..YOU CAN'T  HAVE IT BOTH WAYS!! There is nowhere in Scripture where GOD gives PERMISSION  for women to MURDER their unborn child...in fact..he gave a Commandment  that "" THOU SHALT NOT KILL "" it did not say only if its an adult"
"^SUPREME ""Justice""  CLARENCE THOMAS is a RACIST!             He will NOT ""Kill"" Unborn BLACK BABIES.                   peace"
"For everyone that‚Äôs ever had an abortion, remember this. You went against your biological programming to protect your kid, and then you killed it. You murdered your child, nothing can change the fact that you went to a ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù and you paid them to rip your child apart while it was still inside you."
This is the future of something isn't done. + The courts can't just decide things like this....
Never met anyone on the pro-death brigade condemn their parents for not extinguishing their life in the womb.
They won't change gun laws which will save lives but will revoke abortion rights that will ruin lives
"21 and terrified lol.  Not terrified enough of the irresistible trouser snake, evidently."
America the most backward 1st world country
Where is people‚Äôs right to overturning the Supreme Court?
"Pretty sure even 3rd world countries are able to offer this minimal human right. What has America become now, a 4th world nation?"
Bruh how
"They will force you to carry a pregnancy to term, but don't give a crap if that same child is shot to death at school. Think about that."
Would genuinely hate to live in America for so many reasons
"This proves that America is not a free country, banning abortion is removing freedom of choice from women."
"85% of Americans support abortions being legal in most cases.

Welcome to the death throws of modern conservatism, the last dire swings before the next generation snuffs them out with pure disgust at their oppressive nature.

Don‚Äôt like abortion? Don‚Äôt get one. Land of the free my ass."

Now states can ban it! SCOTUS don't want GUN regulations but want to regulate WOMEN!
Victory for the babies and Jesus. Thank you Jesus for this victory
"There is no ""Right"" to abortion in the U.S.A.  ... I thought this was the BBC?!?"
"Looks like the fall of civilization.
So now we'll begin to see the rise in back street abortionist parlours, meat shops run by the unskilled

Or worst still, a rise in the birth-rate of the unloved and hated, given a living nightmare that would have 
otherwise been called a childhood.
Well done America."

How stupid are you to think America care about anyone but the rich.

All it did was return the issue to the states.   People can vote for state legislature that lines up with their beliefs and the clinic that you featured has had women die . I know this to be true because I work in the emergency room at the local hospital
Religion dragging the world back
"The white, evangelical, conservative right ruling the Republican Party and courts will not stop at abortion. Next up gay marriage, with some wanting to even ban contraception and sex education in schools."
"""I'm 21 and I'm terrified!""

Well if you keep your legs closed,  you won't have nothing to worry about will you sweetheart."
I guess the  media  doesn't  understand... all the Supreme court  did was give the power  back to the individual  states.... The federal government  should  have never had this power  under the Constitution.  Now if you feel like it empowers  you to murder innocence  babies  so you want be inconvenience...that is on you..... a baby if a gift from God
America is mental now back alley clinics will be all over well done
Why didn't someone ask these pro-life women how many homeless children have they adopted?  How many young mothers in need and without jobs have they helped?
Liars!!!!
"This is a minority imposing their personal and religious beliefs on everyone. This is wrong, and it is clear that the Supreme Court is no longer a neutral body, but yet another political tool to be wielded by whomever can stuff their ‚Äúside‚Äù into the most seats!

I honestly blame Harry Reid. He was the one that ‚Äúwent nuclear‚Äù and dropped the 60 vote threshold for court picks!"
"Easy, or even subsidized access to the morning-after pill may constitute a compromise solution agreeable to both sides, as it prevents procreation."
"Abortion is Murder. A baby from the moment it's conceived to birth is a human being. Even if you still say that abortion isn't what it clearly is(killing of Unborn children and the extermination of Human life(which by definition is murder)) is a denial of the basic facts. ""My body, My Choice!"" isn't even valid because you're not making the desicion for your body but for the inoccent unborn baby in inside the woman(The baby is a whole different entity to the mother just the same as you are an indivisual human being). You and everyone else that advocates for this foolishness are degrading children from human beings to objects or inconvenices that can be disposed of . If you say it's just a clump of cells, that's not even evidence because you are a clump of cells and every living being is a clump of cells. You would know that if you payed attention in 8th grade biology. That baby will grow up to be a human being just like you and me. What if you're mom was to abort you, I bet then that you wouldn't be advocating for the murder of unborn children (unless you see yourself as worthless). If you state that you can kill an unborn child then it's the same as saying that you can kill anyone or that I can kill you and by all means is a violation of human rights and basic moral princibles. It doesn't matter about what stage the child is in or what other factors lead to the impregnation you still do not have the right to kill a human being. If you can't take care of the child then give it up for adoption instead of outright killing the child. Murder: the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another. By definition, Abortion = Murder. And saying that you could kill a child after it was born is even more trifling. The child at that point is a living and breathing human being (even in the womb it's a living and breathing human being). In conclusion, Abortion is murder and there is no evidence that you can give that can prove me wrong. Not only because it is facts but there are no valid point that can debunk the proven biological fact that a Human Fetus is a Human Being. Genocide: the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group, the group in question being children. 628.9k children are aborted/murdered every year which is by definition called genocide. Abortion is not only murder but genocide. Case and Point."
"America has become a nation dominated by bigots and fascists.
How embarrassing that they speak English over there."
Empathetic ProLife supporters versus pro abortion psychopaths.
The US supreme court has just signed the death warrant for 100s of American women every year. All thanks to Trump. Man that guy was in power for just 4 years and he still torments us.
My country doesn't even take care of the children once they are born. All because a few religeous freaks want to have more babies to adopt~~~
"Can we please put in a law to stop certain people coming to or visiting the UK.
It would be those coming from the USA that are pro life and still think its a right to not only carry a hand gun, but also a given right to let 18years old have an automatic weapon,  that kill multiple people in one go, including children. We have enough or our own idiots without allowing any more coming in."
100 millions of babies later. After 50 years on concentrating clinics in African American communities controlling the population.  BLM! Justice will come!
"Damn, it's like no one's ever heard of birth control"
"the supreme court with a majority of Right Wing dedided to Overturn Roe V Wade mainly impacting all Women in the USA, now All Women in the USA have less privacy and abortion is harder to get!

This again was decided by the all the Conservatives which are the Majority in the Supreme Court!

Biden needs to add 3 Liberals to the Supreme Court Now! To have Balance and Real debate about issues like Roe v Wade instead of letting the majority rule just because they want!"
"I have not been enthusiastic with the abortion on demand concept, the ""right,"" for many years since its inception. As birth control methods multiplied, abortions did not decrease. Abortion was merely the birth control of ultimate last resort. I think the right to safe abortion was misused. But now society faces the magnified problem of defective and/or unwanted births. I am absolutely certain that conservative Christian men and women are not going to step up to take in this population of outcasts, nurture them and see to it that they are provided for. Nor will they require of their political representatives that there be incentives for society to the job. It is fanciful and delusional of me to think that females will take the responsible step to protect themselves, and prevent a disembodied soul from emerging as a being who is unwanted."
"Woman will die, millions of children will be unwanted because their mothers were raped. Late abortion is not right but if a woman is raped she has every right to abort."
The world's gone mad.
if u can abort i as a man want not pay child support
USA once again proves itself to be a nation of fools
The Best Thing That happened in America after a very long time!!!!!!
"How many of the Anti-abortionists, women, mothers and their teenagers daughters,  have had abortions, already!!"
This is absolutely wonderful news.  I hope the Cult of Death weirdos who think only of themselves cry themselves to sleep tonight.
People who want to impose their views in such a controversial subject are intolerant and non democratic people and not other way around. There will be a space for every way of thinking and living in USA as always. But it is important to fight this narrative.
"They just took away my daughters right to choose, and Thomas said he is coming after birthcontrol? I am ashamed to be an American~~~~ Love and light world~~~"
"Once again showing they're a completely uncivilised place. They will force a potentially unwanted and unloved child into the world, but won't protect them from being killed in a school shooting. The US is the cesspit of the entire planet."
"The whole System is Divided the Supreme Court, the Congress the Senate and the Church maybe it's time to change the name of America from United States to Divided States lol üòÇ"

"No such thing as the ""right"" to kill a child, neither outside the womb nor within."
"Never mind, at least you can all carry guns eh"
A reckless court abandoning of past Supreme Court Justice Ruling is the downfall of the United States of America Courts.
"If you don't want to get pregnant don't have sex.
If you have sex and get pregnant be an adult and take care of your responsibilities.
Seems some women want a free pass on taking responsibility for their actions.
You can spot them a mile away they act like children and are abhorrent people,woke feminazi's and such."
Absolute stupid decision.
"Western women and men are too promiscuous, that's the problem. Abstain from sex before marriage or use a condom or morning after pill."
Nobody speaks about the father's right in that Holocaust of babies.
What is going on in America? Pakistan and Iran will have more liberal abortion laws than large parts of that giant lunatic asylum across the Atlantic. Trump's appointment of three crackpot religious fundamentalist Justices has caused the Court to go off the rails. The decision doesn't even guarantee abortion rights for women/underage girls who are victims of rape or incest. Individual states will be able to force them to give birth to a rapist's baby against their will. It's barbaric and isn't the end. They will push on for the same thing in relation to access to contraception and gay marriage. It's as if the Puritans had just landed.
"If the unborn child could speak: ""My body, my choice"""
I'm delighted! The BBC is hopping mad!
"From the comments I've read, they are missing the mark massively, the real point is as a woman you no longer have rights o we your own body. America has taken several steps back into the dark past. I'm ashamed and embarrassed for the US. It's now a backwards 21st century country, well done you republican clowns."

abortion is murder
not even incest or rape will allow you to have an abortion. That‚Äôs disgusting I pray for America
Abortion in the case of Rape n Incest is OK but Abortion shouldn't be like a piece of cake. It's not healthy for the Mothers.
It will still be legal and safe for the woman. Now it's up to the states to decide when to limit it for the child's sake... NY says up to and even shortly after birth. TX et al says at heartbeat.
how about British? Is it legal for woman do abortion there?
Every baby should have the right to have a life.
Lunacy!

Such a retarded country. 2022 or 1900‚Äôs. Get a grip America. I wonder how these activists who were against abortion would feel if they had been raped and got pregnant or carrying on with a pregnancy that would have massive health implications. Bet they would feel different then. Sometimes it‚Äôs necessary.

"You are not a developed country because you make abortion a norm, it's called moving backwards. How can people call themselves civilized people but find normal to kill babies? I have never heard a pregnant woman referring to their unborn child as  a ""thing.""So why do stupid creatures think abortion is a human right?  And they are able to utter their nonsensical opinions only because no one chose to abort them, foolishness! How I wish all the pro-abortion creatures were aborted!"

Get raped and have rapist kids. Cost of a abortion vs have rapist kids and live off government tax dollars for life. Logically abortion saves more tax money long term. Who wants to keep rapist gentic line going anyways?

"States already made their own decisions regardless of what these Judges say. Arkansas I know because I live here has allowed abortions until 6 months ago then Asa Hutchison changed it to emergency only‚Ä¶. So see how these people lie because apparently abortions where still being preformed in the US.
Now there showing Arkansas like there proudly doing away with abortions as if they hadn‚Äôt already said they done so lying to their citizens‚Ä¶.

I don‚Äôt approve of abortions‚Ä¶ but who remembers babies tied in garbage bags in garbage cans.
Or backyard doctors doing abortions where women paid thousands then died because they bled to death‚Ä¶.
I don‚Äôt know what the answer is 
I believe we all must answer to a higher calling somebody, regardless if you believe there‚Äôs a God, 
There still is a creator of all things regardless what you call this creator.
So should we not all be responsible for our own decisions. 
I‚Äôm not for abortions but I remember the 70s there where so many babies found dead In garbage bags, so many young women found dead next to coat hangers 
Is this the world the US wants.
I know I don‚Äôt, I think it‚Äôs a personal choice the US got it wrong today‚Ä¶

Something too, I think these Judges was part of a bigger agenda here. To help provoke chaos rioting possibly shootings in the US‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs what Joe and his Nazi regime wants‚Ä¶.
What good is being a president if you don‚Äôt have the final say‚Ä¶
Something is fishy here. It really is..
The majority of people support abortions in this country
These judges aren‚Äôt supposed to bring their personal beliefs into the mix so what prompted the change‚Ä¶
I think it was Democrats wanting a uprising in the US is who"
Statistically a poor decision.
Absolutely wonderful.
Thank you yankcels. China and Russia when?
wtf its Healthcare
"Seems like an unnecessary feud to say the least. I wonder how many anti-abortionists care about climate change or the damage big pharma, big tech and the military industrial complex is doing, or poverty or racism etcetc.... not many I'm guessing."

This is not about pro-life; it‚Äôs about anti-woman.
"I think there should be more programs of safe sex and stricter sexual crimes laws as it solves the problem of abortion. So I am happy for USA with this decision. Congratulations

If someone really needs abort sure they will find it. 

Its right that is not default as there should be no situation where family would even need to think about it. If there is, the root of the problem must to be found and solved not this genocidical way. Unborn kid is not the root of the problem"

Stop opening your legs !!! Pretty simple

"Banning abortion is awful and a disgusting thing to do, but the possibility of banning same sex marriage is simply a red line! If these bunch of stuck in the past bigoted groups of extremists honestly think they can turn the clock back to 1950 without consequences, then they are truly and unequivocally insane. When America turns into a second rate power, let there be no doubt that it was the extreme far right GOP that caused it to fall."
Liberals suddenly know what a woman is.
America is officially a Christofascist sh!!thole.
"As a woman  who is mother i would not have the corauge to have an abortion and the issues that it implicate but as a mother of another woman i have no wright to rule about her ideas and believes...i not own her and her body is her choice i can only love her no matter what or wathever.

"Abortion in Ireland is regulated by the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018. Abortion is permitted in Ireland during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy, and later in cases where the pregnant woman's life or health is at risk, or in the cases of a fatal foetal abnormality. Abortion services commenced on 1 January 2019, following its legalisation by the aforementioned Act, which became law on 20 December 2018. Previously, the 8th Constitutional Amendment had given the life of the unborn foetus the same value as that of its mother, but the 36th constitutional amendment, approved by referendum in May 2018, replaced this with a clause permitting the Oireachtas (parliament) to legislate for the termination of pregnancies.

Abortion had been prohibited in Ireland by the UK Offences against the Person Act 1861. The Eighth Amendment was added to the Constitution by referendum in 1983, after concerns that laws prohibiting abortion could be found to be unconstitutional based on a right to privacy. In 1992, the Supreme Court held in the X Case that a thirteen-year-old girl who had become pregnant as a result of rape could be permitted to obtain an abortion in the state because there was a risk to her life from suicide. There were unsuccessful constitutional referendums in 1992 and 2002 that aimed to preclude such grounds for abortion in future cases. Between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2018, abortion in Ireland was regulated by the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, under which abortion was illegal unless it occurred as the result of a medical intervention performed to save the life of the woman.

In 2012, Irish abortion law received worldwide attention on the death of Savita Halappanavar, who had been denied an abortion while suffering a septic miscarriage. This increased calls to repeal the Eighth Amendment. The constitutional and legislative provisions were discussed at a Citizens' Assembly in 2016‚Äì17, and at an Oireachtas committee in 2017, both of which recommended substantial reform and framed the debate of the referendum in May 2018."
Regardless of conception once pregnant it is no longer only about you thus I support this.
Now they'll overturn Brown v. Board of Education
"About time,what a medical abomination."
"0:17: In case you didn't know: It was never "" *guaranteed* "" under the constitution in the first place, in fact the constitution doesn't speak for or against. So, it is disingenuous and a misnomer for legacy media to characterize it so. Plus, for the neutrals, perhaps it would be fair to put this in context Think about this number: 63,000,0000! Yes, you read that right, over 63M+ abortions! From 1973-2017! Before now, ONLY the women got to decide who lives and who doesn't. But now, except in the case of extenuating circumstances like sexual violati@n, this ruling to return jurisdiction back to the States might perhaps even the playing field and foster accountability."
Well America has to do something to keep it's schools topped up with victims.
Abortion is disgusting and never should have been legal
So if abortions are banned can we have the right to assisted suicide for the ones who didnt want to be born?
The Republican Taliban has more to say on women's rights. Birth control is the next one.

The BBC should realize abortions are not guaranteed in The Bill of Rights. Abortions are not healthcare it's mass murder. No female has died for the right to have abortions

The decision was to allow states to come to their own decision by the people voting in each state. This is the most democratic way to do it rather it being left to a handful of judges.    Typical BBC   misleading biased reporting.  There will be plenty of states still doing abortions and plenty of people and groups ready to pay your expenses to go to these states to have an abortion.

"The decision just means states can decide if they want it to be legal or not. And this is essentially better. It lets a gay get married in California and a polygamous life their live in their own terms in Utha. A group of people imposing their ideas to oder it is good only if you think like them. Abortion is going to continue in many of the 50 estates of the United States. If no central authority can control our lives, everybody can live their lives in their own terms. We are loosing the essential values of democracy and freedom."

"It's sad but true, abortions will continue regardless many will be unsafe. Many women and children will suffer because of this, women dying from poorly done ""backroom"" abortions, women inflicting self harm onto themselves trying to get rid of the child, domestic violence from partners who don't want the child, more abused/abandoned children from parents who don't want them etc.

Both outcomes suck, however legal abortion was the necessary evil to prevent suffering in many circumstances."

"In 1973 Roe v. Wade literally made up a fake ""Constitutional right"" to abortion which is found nowhere in the Constitution. It's the same thing as happened in 2015 when they made up a fake right to same-sex marriage which is found nowhere in the Constitution. Justices are supposed to uphold the actual text of the Constitution, not make up new legislation and force it on the states. Constitutionally, both those questions must be left to the individual states to decide via the legislative, not judicial, branch of government!"

The rich lobbyists don‚Äôt care if a child grows up in an impoverished environment so long as such can work whatever occupation in future for cheap. Think supply and demand, high supply of poorer people and they have to compete for your position and get lower wages, less supply of poorer people and you actually have to pay them and treat them well to get them to work for you."

Abortion is not banned it‚Äôs left to each state please do not add to miss information maybe ladies and gentlemen can take precautions to stop a pregnancy and even in states where abortion may be restricted for rape victims 65 million babies where terminated last year please bbc tell the truth don‚Äôt add to the destruction at least tell all sides you may get more people to watch

Gotta love hypocrite conservatives. It's only my body my choice if it comes to a vaccine. This isn't saving lives. Women will get back alley abortions and be forced to birth rape babies. Pro life. Bullshit.

When the suit is brought against it what will the Supreme Court say,   STATES RIGHTS  ?"
"People should look into the other rights we the people have that aren't part of the original constitution, like the right for women to vote.

"Abortion only should be allowed if the woman/girl  has a 
life-threatening medical condition, been raped, or pregnancy by incest. I think there is 
just too much abortions done. There are options such as adoption. Live and 
let Live."
Abortion won't be banned completely it will only be allowed for rape victims
I'm so proud of Americans today
Only on the federal level. It puts it up to each state to decide whether it's legal or not. So stop spreading false narratives!!
Sounds Error üòÇ
It was never a constitutional right.
Liberals and leftist 5 minutes in the sun is over and more to come all them lives taken and no chance at life not they have that chance
Republican party politicians ended the right to abortion to increase the population of white Americans and control the population of black and brown Americans because they fear that white Americans are becoming the minority.

"I'm American. The damn Republicans did this now to distract from the January 6th Committee exposing Don the Con Trump as a criminal.  Twice impeached Trump was the worst US president in history for many reasons. #1) Trump committed an act of treason against the US by inciting a violent insurrection on January 6, 2021. #2) Trump‚Äôs incompetence regarding his management of the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic between January 2020 and July of 2020. Thousands of US citizens died as a result Trump‚Äôs failure. If Trump had a proper immediate response to the pandemic the way that the South Korean government did, then thousands of US citizens who died would still be alive today. #3) In April of 2019 Trump vetoed the resolution to end US military support of Saudi Arabia's GENOCIDE of thousands of innocent civilians in Yemen! Trump was using the US military to support GENOCIDE in Yemen! #4) Trump violated the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution for his entire 4 years in office, then in 2019 Trump verbally mocked the US Constitution. The foundation of the USA is the US Constitution, that is why the presidential inaugural oath includes to swear to protect and defend the US Constitution. In January 2017 Trump publicly swore an oath on a bible at his inauguration ceremony to protect and defend the US Constitution. In 2019 Trump mocked the US Constitution by publicly saying the words ""phony emoluments clause"". #5) Trump misogynistically and adulterously said of women: ""Grab them by the pussy.""! Trump committed adultery with Stormy Daniels and then tried to cover it up. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was in prison for crimes related to Trump's cover-up of his adulterous scandal with Stormy Daniels. Most Republicans claim to be the moral party and/or the majority Christian party, but hypocritically enthusiastically want to give an adulterous Donald Trump, another 4 years in office. If a US president who was a member of the Democratic Party did the terrible things Trump has, of course, the Republican Party leaders would be screaming for his removal from office. #6) Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice. #7) Trump committed crimes of trying to tamper with elections, especially in Georgia. #8) Trump's attempted abuse of power regarding Ukraine. #9) Trump committed tax fraud in New York State, which is partly why Trump hides his tax returns. #10) Trump practiced corrupt nepotism as he appointed unqualified members of his family into positions of power in the executive branch of government. #11) Trump illegally destroyed documents and illegally took documents with him after he left the office of president. 
There are many other horrible things about Trump. Here are some of them: Donald Trump is a dumb corrupt businessman which is why he hides his tax returns. Donald Trump is not a self-made man, he benefited from nepotism. His daddy Fred Trump gave him millions of dollars to start businesses many of which have failed! Donald Trump's failed businesses are many but include: Trump Airlines, a Trump Casino, and Trump University. With his failed Trump University, he defrauded hundreds of students. In Trump's many construction projects he failed to pay some of his contractors. Trump committed fraud with his non-profit in New York State which is why Trump recently transferred his residence to Florida. Donald Trump is too stupid to write his own book which why he hired a ghost writer to write ""The Art of the Deal"". When Trump was in high school, he hired another boy to take his SAT college entrance exam. Trump claims that he is smart, but he refuses to show us his college transcripts. Donald Trump's daddy bribed a physician to write that Donald Trump had bone spurs and therefore could dodge the Vietnam War draft. Donald Trump and his dad also practiced racism in who they would rent properties to in the 1960s and 1970s. That is just scratching the surface of the long list of horrible things about Donald Trump."
