Amen! glory to these Americans love from Armenia ☦
"""Abortion hurts women"" 🙄 These greenhorns have really no clue what they are talking about."
Gotta love a man leading this group.  Just one extra piece of irony.
I am proudly one
"Pregnancy should be planned, it's an immense responsibility, a life threatening risk, and something that you personally would pour all your life and resources into for the next two decades. It is a great sacrifice, and should only be done willingly. They talk about killing a fetus, but nobody EVER talks about prenatal and postpartum suicides and/or life-long depressions. Mother's mental health should be considered just as much as her physical when it comes to abortions. Nothing worse than growing up in a family in which your mother simply resents you."
"I'm a pro-lifer and I commend these young people for speaking out, and I commend the interviewer for having and showcasing a fair conversation. I can see that the people in the comments are already persuaded, as am I, but this is an important conversation and people don't seem to be willing to have conversations like this anymore."
Seriously if you make a mistake and get a girl pregnant why should you be forced to be a parent
Notice how they all look happier
More Children More Strong.
I care more about my Wasted Tax money
Delusion. Especially those who give bs religious arguments.
Greatest injustice to occur to women in history? That young person in the intro should read up on the history of women's rights...
this is so embarassing
7:23
6:29 does she even know her own history.....clearly she hasn't read the constitution!
"So why should the government be able to force someone to get vaccinated, but when it comes to abortion, it’s my body my choice?

It seems like the shoes on the other foot now"
"If a woman doesn't want to use her body to feed a toddler and the toddler starves that's fine because  it's her body! She didn't want to use her body to prepare and serve food for her toddler. I would use my body to feed a toddler but I can't make that choice for others. 

It's insane that she would go to prison for that. It's her body her choice!"
"I would tend to agree with President Clinton's views on abortion...

And also Bill Burr's...

And also Dave Chapelle's when it comes to fathers who don't want to pay child support..."
"What about MEN??? There are quite a few abortions that wouldn't happen if women had the support and commitment they needed from the FATHERS of these unborn babies. I didn't hear any mention about the MEN at this rally...just a lot of people saying that ""women can do it"" and ""there's support out there."" Why are the fathers being held accountable for abandoning these women after discovering that they are pregnant?!?! There are also quite a few ""men"" who will pressure and push a woman into an abortion...because THEY don't want a child, and THEY don't want the responsibility of paying child support for that child. Abortion is NOT just about women being selfish or not believing they can take care of a baby."
"I'm LGBT, and sometimes, when I see Republicans and successful straight people so happy, I think, am I doing it wrong? What if they are right and their way of life is the best, all of us have strayed, and unconsciously, we're fighting for the right to live lives that are unhappy in the long run. Ugh, but I don't want to marry or have kids ughhh"
"When asked about the medical necessary abortions, they don't even have a real answer. I want to say FU to that woman who said pray. The one talking on the conference, also doesn't give an actual answer cause her ""we can take care of both"" is a lie, but they can't say, we don't care if the pregnant woman dies"
"What specifically do you think the government should do to promote the rights of pregnant women and the unborn?  There are valid answers to this question without incorporating religion, but neither side is addressing it adequately.  I'm a Christian myself, but somehow I manage to get annoyed listening to people on both sides of this issue based on how they are presenting their views and demonizing the opposing side."
"So if a woman is at risk of dying if she carries on with her pregnancy, pro lifers think that prayer will solve the problem. One word springs to mind, deluded."
"Ah, the joys of lifelong religious endocrtrination"
"This is the uniquely American approach to public policy, called ""flip-a-coin"" decision making. It's accurate  50% of the time and it's very speedy."
"XD people realy wonder about this look at what you call ""woman"" the left pushed way way way to far and to hard and now the big pushback will come"
"I understand the need for people to express their views, but once you try to make things into law, you are imposing your ideology on everyone and you need to consider the impact that has. This topic is decisive, but it is at the root a moral based argument. This is why it should not enter the legislative sphere. How can you support a secular nation moving into a booming diverse nation by imposing biblical - based moral related laws? THIS IS A MEDICAL CASE BY CASE ISSUE. If you want to allow your wife's life to pass to save an unborn fetus, you can go ahead and do that. But DO NOT tell me that is what I have to do."
This gives me hope
Is it truly that difficult to respect women and their decisions..?
So many people damaged on their heads.
"Abortion is evil.  Abortion activists lie to women about what a pre-born child is and what abortion does to that child.  I think that anyone who realizes this and still supports abortion ""rights"" is deceived and has a piece of their soul missing.  Science shows us that from the moment of conception, a human embryo - zygote - fetus is a unique human person with unique DNA that has never been before and will never be again.  That person, from the moment of conception, is worthy of equal protection under the law and has a fundamental right to live, just like all other people.  To deny the pre born of that right is evil."
"A mother intentionally killing her child is a tragedy. It's wild to me that abortion isn't seen as a human rights issue by the ""compassionate"" left."
"Even though The Guardian tried to spin this as concerning, I feel really encouraged that movement continues with the next generation. People need a hardcore attitude shift about babies before abortion will end."
"""I am pro life, my daddy/church told me so"""
"It is never medically necessary to have an induced abortion. Though, early delivery may need to happen, other procedures can take place such as a C-section. You can do early delivery without poisoning, dismembering, or starving a child."
That march for life guy with the beanie gives off major sociopath vibes.
A compromise allowing some abortion is justified.
Praying hard for their continued success to protect and build a culture of life.
"The world would be so much better if people stopped caring so much about what other people do in their lives, and stopped utilizing religion and ""patriotism"" as a way to justify it."
"Why is it a ""my body my choice"" issue when the unborn are more than obviously not her body? If the unborn d1ies, she doesn't, if she moves, the unborn doesn't if the unborn is born, she isn't. The unborn only shares blood flow, just like two headed people."
"If the left is so pro-choice, why can't it stop its agenda on increasing regulation on every aspect of economy and politics? Are they hypocrites? And are they hypocrites for denying the opportunity of future choice for the incoming unborn?"
"If our civilized species is superior to other animal species due to self control and refrainment from impulse, why is it wrong to ""train"" and impose manners on hypersexual, non precaution highly instinct driven individuals who are kill1ng uborn, potential self controlling and highly functioning individuals?"
People who save innocent lives are heroes! Pro-life for life!!!
"Some people should be parents. Some shouldn't. Being a parent should be a choice, not because you can't get an abortion."
"The role of government is to protect the vulnerable. Abortion is so controversial because there's two vulnerable populations: the unborn and their mother. 
Both sides try to downplay the other, but really a college mom is just as vulnerable as the baby she carries.

In Iowa we have legislation coming through that will limit abortion, but also provide funding for programs that help pregnant mothers get the help they need, before and after birth. I think that's the best compromise"
I'm Christian but I think they're hypocrites. Immigrant children at the border are being trafficked or deported. This is not about the children but hypocrisy at its finest.
Insane!
David Duchovny age
Hahaha. 😅 They certainly have that look.
"Reading the comments I only can think about that all people here who are for abortion are alive. 
And let's not forget the pain a baby suffers while being 'aborted'."
"I wonder when motherhood went from something beautiful to being seen as a burden. Is it because of the poor economy? Single motherhood? Was it a cultural shift? Every child has limitless potential, they are the future of your nation, regardless of the stance you are on every abortion is a tragedy. So why do so many young woman feel the need to do it(This is excluding those who needed medical intervention, no woman should be blamed for losing a child to circumstances outside of their control.)."
It is truly disturbing how people in these comments justify killing innocent babies. These people are blind to the truth..
America can No longer call themself the land of the free when woman dont have freedom over there own bodies
"This is what infanticide called abortion looks like:
""Abortion procedures: 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters."" (YouTube)"
so many white ppl
Remember guys if your life is on the verge of death just pray and all your problems will be solved
They aren't Pro life they are pro birth
Based pro-Life
So much nonsense falling out of their mouths that I hardly believe they truly believe their own bs.
I find it hilarious that people will put so much energy into trying to ban Abortions when there's multiple wars happening (and that have happened) that genuinely devastated the earth more than abortions ever will
If you don't agree with abortions then don't get one! Stop forcing your narrow minded beliefs on everyone else. These people aren't pro life. They are pro birth. Once the baby is born they could care less about what happens to it.
"Warning, this comment section is filled with bots stating their views changed from pro choice to anti choice."
They don’t want abortion until they need one
These people are so misguided
"“if i didn’t stand up for the defenseless, i couldn’t call myself a man” *goes home and eats defenseless animals."
"4:32 For those overlooking the simplistic solutions and seem to have no real idea what actual families go through, here’s the time stamp to “Just Pray”."
"Reminds me of the Cultural Revolution in China. The young people were mobilized by the leadership. And many later regretted it when they had more information. 

The same kind of people supported slavery and genocide in US history. 

Banning abortion doesn’t stop it. It only makes unsafe abortions more likely. 

Not to mention potentially criminalizing half the population. 

Denial of access to medical care is the greatest injustice to women. 

Monks don’t get to decide. Neither do young people who know little about life or the impact of unwanted pregnancy. 

The presume there are adequate resources. In a county where a large percentage of people cannot afford medical care or go bankrupt due to illness, these people are imposing their beliefs on others."
These people seem to have little clue about biology and childbirth.
"26k rapes in Texas since ban!  26 thousand unwanted pregnancies!   Will you run the orphanages?  Americas foster care system is broken, child protective services is broken.  When will your religion fix these?!"
"There is a lot of people who believe in abortion for forced situations and medically dangerous situations but do not support just terminating because that is what was convenient to you. If you don't want to have a baby then don't do what makes babies. I was told by a pro choicer that abstinence is an ""unrealistic fictional solution""."
We should abolish freedom of religion.
This nation wasn’t founded as a Christian nation. It was founded on the blood of the native population.
How is abortion a presidential issue? Isn't it up to each state?
Make men pay for their children even if they're not married
I hope they’re also marching right now for the children in Palestine
"They can never stop abortions, just safe abortions."
"How many of these people support things like free education or healthcare though, things that actually benefit everyone and ensure kids grow up safe?"
"America will soon be joining the ranks of Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and other theocratic states.😅 It's time to go back to the Middle Ages."
"If prayer can heal women who need an abortion due to their life being at risk, then that should be the case for any medical needs. We shouldn’t have doctors or hospitals in fact. Because prayer apparently can heal us. Religion should not affect laws, especially considering that not everybody is Christian."
I have one question for anyone who supports abortion.  Are you thankful your mother didn't get an abortion when she was pregnant with you?
"""This nation was founded as a Christian nation"" 😐 0:09"
Go feed and provide housing...oh wait they actually don't care about human life.
"If u love people so much, take the homeless into your house"
"They are not pro life, they are pro fetus"
Show these guys(the activists)how Bangladesh looks like and let me tell you this guys will change their opinion in seconds.😂
"11:07, If it wasn't for that one guy they looked like handmaidens...."
Hypocrisy and ignorance. USA is becoming like Iran.
Religion shouldn't have any rights in a modern society. Pro-chooise for women is equality! Shame on people for restricting womens rights.
Blessings and Gods protection for all the unborn souls yet to be born
W women
they are all well-off white people. who would have thought.
Heaven forbid people take responsibility for their actions
Talibans🤮
Så det är här man kan hitta en fru
"I think that they should just legalize the cases where someone's life is in danger. 

according to the law in *some* states, any removal of matter from the uterus is considered an abortion, there were cases where some women couldnt get cancer-like growths removed because the law technically considered that abortion. (no, it wasnt an actual child, not made from egg+sperm, just some weird, but dangerous growth. still illegal to remove under some states's laws)"
Pregnancy hurts women. But I guess that doesn't matter😂
"child   =   a young human being below the age of puberty or below the legal age of majority.
embryo    =   an unborn or unhatched offspring   /   a thing at a rudimentary stage that shows potential for development   
birth    =   the emergence of a baby   /   the start of life   
FOR   BEFORE   YOU   WERE   NOT   KNOWN   TO   THIS   WORLD    """"""    =    HELLO   ????"
"WHEN  THERE  IS  """"""  SOCIETAL   INJUSTICE   """"""   ?    =   PROVES   THEY  ARE  INDEED  RUNNING  A   SOCIAL   ENGINEERING  CAMPAIGN    =  YES   =   THAT  IS  INDEED  WHAT  THAT  IS  CALLED   !!!!!"
"""Abortion is the greatest injustice.""  Inarguably true"
"These young women haven't faced a terrifying medical emergency yet. They may change their tune. Ultimately this question should rest with the individual. Each woman may choose. I would not agree with late term elective abortion (not medically indicated), because she had enough time to think about it. If the pregnancy is quite advanced, the fetus could survive."
They should allow children to have abortion's without showing proof of r*pe. Btw kidnapping is a 5 year jail sentence and you cannot prove r*pe that happened 2 months ago. There will be 12 year old that would give birth and 5 years later her kidnapper gets released and is looking to have another kid with her.
"I want to see these same people protesting children deaths in Gaza, but that would never ever happen, would it?! That's how you know they are just being worked by their local church."
Do what you want but dont  impose your beliefs  on another human being.
Based pro-life generation. Glad to see that this younger generation is waking up and recognizing the science and morality.
Why are they selling merch? Is it going to fund the mothers and children?
"praying is like a coping mechanism to anything a christian either doesnt have an answer for, or they know deep down is morally wrong"
The irony.. in campaigning against abortion they make us wish their parents had one..
This is why religion and politics should should not mix. Its ok not to agree with something but you should not inforce your beliefs onto people. I hope these people learn from history
People who say that having an abortion is killing a child must also think that eating an egg is eating a chicken.
"These people should go and adopt all the children who are living under bad conditions. Then they'll understand the strain and stress and misery that a child goes through when they're born into bad circumstances. 
It is well known that throughout history, times when abortion was legal have led to lower crime rates and happier families."
I wonder how many of these people care about the babies that are being killed with their tax money right now.
Too much free time
At least half of those younger folks are trolls
"Most Americans  - including in some Red states that have had referendums like Ohio and Kansas - support abortion availability. But about 25% of Republicans who are pro-choice nonetheless vote Republican. The Democratic party should make an effort to win some of these voters over, but that might require compromises on other issues."
Pray your baby away.
"Hello I am Liza Laxamana Mangubat, I Support Covid19, Social Distancing face mask. Planet Global Earth Sun Moon Sky. I want to work together Engineering Technology. Medicare Healthcare Innovation Sciences Technology. Thank you Lord"
How was this ever a controversial topic? Killing innocent unborn babies is...
"Those in favor of abortion, Bunch of young non knowledgeable of life, wasting their time and energy carrying an flag of something that could ruin theirs whole life. Does anyone asked how a woman feels after an abortion ?"
They were there for a whole afternoon and only came out with 11:07 worth of content???
"These guys have the best manners and attitude, everyone was so positive."
The interviewer was outstandingly professional. I know I would't be.
That Virginia Tech student is a strong man.
In the end this is all a subjective moral issue anyway. Let people have their own beliefs. If you don't like the diversity of values in America then move to a non-democratic country where your side reigns supreme.
you gotta give pro-lifers one thing.....they got pretty women lol
"These religious zealots have the same mindset as other religios extremists. 
As for men telling women what to do with their body is mysogynistic control. How has the US become so backwards."
"Ah, another day, another nonsense."
"I can guarantee that these same people also scream and pout about their tax dollars being used for social services specifically for low income communities and how people who use social services are just “leeching off the government”. 

(which those people who are forced to give birth will most likely end up relying on said social services)"
"“ABORTION HURTS WOMEN”…

What about the children who are born unwanted and given up by their parents and grow up feeling a sense of neglect and loss and that they were never wanted 🥴"
This will never change… EVERY WOMAN SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE A PREGNANCY AND BIRTH A CHILD… OR NOT!! ITS THEIR BODY!!!!
"- I got a high-risk pregnancy and need and abortion in order to don't die, what am I supposed to do?
- Just pray lol"
"They look like the type to get a ""dream internship"" over the summer and come back 10 lbs lighter."
Not enough for the right; not enough for the left. Maybe there is room for a negotiated compromise.
"I'm a pro-lifer, but I dont agree on total abortion such as in instances when the mother is in danger during labor. There is something called therapeutic abortion in which the mom is given a choice to abort her child in moments when both of their life is in danger and she has to choose which life is to save: herself or her child. Therapeutic abortions usually happen when the child to be born has very little chance of living and mom is also at risk of dying due to childbirth.

Obviously, I'm against the abortion due to inconvenience or having no medical reasons. I don't believe in the excuse that bringing a child into a financially poor life would make the child's life not worth living. When there is life, there is hope and possible opportunities. Cutting a child before that experience is totally just an excuse for the mother to get away from the consequences of having a child and her newly imposed responsibilities."
Hypocrites. 🟥⚡️⚡️🟥
America Was Founded as an Agnostic Nation.
"Its not imposing christian believe, rather limiting human for not wasting unborn lives just for pleasure..."
"When there are some situations where there is a 0% chance of the babies survival and all it is doing is threatening the mother’s life, and the mother can’t legally get an abortion. That is no longer pro-life. All that is doing is making the death of the mother more likely."
"I hope that every woman has a choice.

If she wishes so."
As a pro choice person what I am taking from this is that we on the left maybe need to rethink our “the younger generation is overwhelmingly progressive “ narrative. We have been making this assumption and while it is has validity we cannot ignore that there is a conservative undertow.
Funny
Those who believe in 'Praying' over medicine can't be trusted with policy tbh.
saltines..
"I don't get the argument. The lady says about getting her abortion ""I didn't want to watch her suffer, it would have been very hard. She would have been placed directly onto hospice."" OK, so what is more dignified and less suffering, providing palliative/hospice care for the newborn where the family can be together and grieve, and the baby can be made as comfortable as possible, or literally ripping it limb by limb and disposing of it in medical waste. There's such a disconnect. The lady in her own words said it would be hard for HER."
The youth id doommmmm
The most stVPiDd people ive ever sennn
Left 💩💩🤢💩🤢💩🤢💩🤢
The young 1di0ts 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
"this makes me physically sick. To say that MEDICALLY NECESSARY abortions should be denied because ""prayer fixes everything!"" is so, so wrong, and so, so hurtful. 
These people have no idea what they're talking about."
У родителей брать не смешно
Денег нету
"What if your child is born with no legs and arms and a deformed face and you are an alcoholic. Ya, the best advice he can give you is just pray. Sorry I try to keep an open mind but I just can't. You guys have to worry on the pro-life side about religious people. It is a hard sell from my perspective and I'm only going to listen to pro-lifers from the fringes of society. I'm not against religious people as much as I'm against atheist even though I'm an atheist. But you have to reason things though and not just tell us that praying is going to solve everything."
These people are infuriating.
"Abortion forever, abortion is freedom 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
I was pro-life before I became a Christian! I’ve been pro-life  for three years and Christian for two years. I didn’t know abortion existed until I started seeing the protests then I did  my own research and was immediately heartbroken and shocked.  Why is this okay? It’s is the biggest crime against humanity! The absolute worst injustice ever! I love the movement and can’t wait for abortion to never ever be a thing or even a thought ever again!❤
What does this world even have to offer those unborn children? Nothing much. Only slavery
Now ask these people who believe in the sanctity of human life if they condemn the genocide in Gaza
brain rot
"So they pray over the mother and the baby til death, right?"
Who are YOU to tell ME how to live my life. My abortion does NOT affect you. It's more than having a baby--babies are a LIFELONG change.  STOP.
I didn't realize that there are traditional women exists in America who care about human life and value themselves❤
"It should be both legal and banned. Legal for the first trimester. That is enough time for a woman/couple to make a decision. After that, tough cookie. There are plenty of great couples out there who are waiting to raise a child if the mother doesn't want it. The only exceptions should be if the fetus is unhealthy or the mom's health is at risk."
These people are not aware of science. They should talk to gynecologists and patients... And stop trying to impose their ridiculous ideas on people.
"Well then, if a woman has to keep a baby. These people can raise the child themselves."
Because a woman decides to have and becomes pregnant a baby gets the death penalty
"so I watched some of the barbie movie now that the hype has died down a bit and I thought it was alright, for the most part. It had some very clear themes that I believe are relevant and after hearing carter speak about his role as a man in the pro life movement, I can't help but laugh at how the movie portrayed the patriarchy because he sounds exactly like one of the kens that learned about patriacrchy"
"I think Abortions should only be allowed as a medical intervention instead of a service. And I don't accept the rational of all life need to be protected at all cost because what of the mother? Moreover, that kinda similar to the rational of calling everything racist that the far left does because it ignores the realities of life, the extreme use cases where it is needed."
If they are so pro life go support the people of Palestine.
"an easy way out is abortion even in extreme circumstances, but this an infinitely small number compare with abortikn at will... the problem witb abortionist radicals is making this as a religious issue.. it is not, abortion is violent and more vile thing to do to women who have thought they made a mistake.. women should realize that they have the power to choose to stand for the baby thats in her no matter the circumstance of the baby's conception... easy way out yet afterwards post abortion is the most hurtful experience... killers are liars!!!"
Abolish abortion!!!!
I find it incredibly cringe when men comment on abortion
I'M SO PROUD OF MY FELLOW PRO LIFE AMERICANS! WE ARE THE PRO LIFE GENERATION! LET'S MAKE ABORTION UNTHINKABLE!
"Wait, where are the tats, body piercing, purple hair and entitled pronouns?  Oh.... these are the future taxpayers and the employable individuals of tomorrow we never see."
"""This nation was founded as a christian nation"" this nation was built on slavery, you want that back too???"
Fabulous to see these young people passionate about saving the tiniest of babies.
"Do these people adopt children, do they work at soup kitchen's, do they support laws that support the community?

Or do they only care about a baby being born no matter what?"
"1:56 ah, abortion is more 'injust' than poverty or inequality"
"No, you won't ""abolish abortion"" any more than prohibition controlled alcohol. Women will always go to desperate lengths to end pregnacies they don't want. Always will and always did. Causing harm to themselves and their families. The abortion industry is indeed dodgy, for a start it is linked in with transhumanism and biotech, but that's not a reason to totally ban abortion. Driving abortion into the backstreets, where profiteering would be further complicated by illegality and blackmail is not the answer. As they used to say in England ""The rich to Harley Street, the poor to the backstreet"". Please don't let us go back to those days of knitting needles and septic deaths. Prayer......is simply not an answer at all."
"women against babies, men for babies - i have seen it all now"
I have no time for immature children who lack life experience and wisdom.
These young Americans look like they work and contribute to society much better then the ones who do t work and call off to work to riot and shut down bridges I think I’d rather listen to what they have to say
Sky daddy fandom go wrrrrrr
"Pray pray pray...
and pray and pray 


Such complexity reduce to such stupidity it's depressing, but I know what you would say to me...

just pray..."
"""What are the fighting to achieve?"" Acceptance from their families and peers."
Bravo! I stand with you 100%
Abortions should only be allowed if the mother’s health is in danger or if there was an assault.
Abortion problem would magically disappear if women had to pay for it.
Those poor indoctrinated people
just say you dont know... instead of saying prayer will fix things
Abortion is horrible
Hmm. Lots of -murders- pro-choice people in the comment section. Kind of suspicious you only are okay with abortion after you've been born. Makes a person think.
"Even if medically necessary abortions were the only abortions allowed, the vast majority of pregnancies would not fall into that catagory"
Unsafe for wanted pregnancy
"step 1: Have your baby and be all saintly about how pro life you are
step 2: Mistreat your child."
All these people were denied various things in various places in their personal life and needed a collective scapegoat to vent their frustration.  The real thing to pray for is that this won't get out of hand like pogroms or something.
What  about   if woman  don't  want  baby  ...
People in this video hurt women. Unbelievable…
There are a minority
"The main question is: ""is embryo human life"" .. we think it is .. and that is the thing. As everybody protects a child since birth, we protect it since conception :) simple as that :)"
"1. “It’s her body, her choice.” No, as a matter of biological fact, it is not her body.

2. “You better be pro-life once the baby is born!” We are. Is that supposed to be a gotcha?

Do pro-choicers seriously not have anything else?"
I had to see this cuz I didn’t even know there were that many ppl my age who are anti abortion.
"Abortion's evil and wrong, but the GOP is running hot garbage as their candidate, again, so if he loses in 2024 for a 2nd time, expect liberals to claim it was because of abortion."
what a hellscape.
She can ban it for herself. That is her business. WHY do these people want a theorocy!?
"No problem , you will also of course pass laws in every State to provide the Social service these kids will need . I am sure will do that enthusiastically , along with pay the extra taxes to pay for it ..."
"This nation was not founded as a Christian nation, quite the opposite actually."
"I wonder what percentage will change their minds in the next 10 years as they have ""accidents""?"
End abortion! Once and for all
How about these people put as much effort into laws and efforts to reduce the occurrence of rapes and acts where the unwanted pregnancy was created through violence?
There are really always people that want to go back. it's incredible
i just wish couples can control more of their urges.
Christinaity is love for humanity born and unborn.

"Pro abortion is NOT anti life, injustice is what these hypocrites are doing, to stand up for justice is to NOT have your own point but to ensure PEOPLE have rights and medical and scientific principals apply. It is immoral to suggest abortion is not moral."
"This is misrepresenting the pro-life community. The majority would agree that if the mother was in a life or death situation, then we have the moral responsibility to try out best to save both. That would include considering a premature birth if possible. Immediately jumping to abortion for the means of convenience is what most people fight against."
America was founded on zero religion
be hanno capito che se loro esistono è perchè la loro mamma ha avuto coraggio e amore...
"I had an abortion at 18. I remember getting screamed at by pro-lifers as I walked into the clinic. It was awful. I didn't make my decision lightly. 

I've always gotten the feeling that pro-lifers think that women are just thrilled to get an abortion, “Yes, an unplanned pregnancy! Can't wait to for my abortion.”

Pro-lifers are so obsessed with the fetus/embryo, that they- perhaps willingly- forget that there's a woman at the centre of this. A woman with responsibilities, dignity, and humanity.

If any pro-lifers want to have a cordial discussion, I’m happy to have it, but if you're just gonna call me a “murderer”, don't waste my time. I've heard if before."
THE USA was purposely found NOT as a Christian country
"Abortion IS evil… but don’t like it, simply don’t get one. Shouldn’t be a legal clamour."
There is hope for the future yet!
This comment section is an example of what's wrong with our country.
6:20 to 6:37 👍
Wow look at all the single mothers
"The only argument pro-abortion people have is “what if this, what if that”"
I am  not pro life. But I am not for abortion. Abortion is a heartwrenching personal decision. Too many people go through this life unloved. Do not force your beliefs on someone you know nothing about. If there are no legal abortions there will be illegal ones.
They are living in a medieval era.
a bunch privileged people with no real problems to tend to .
It is called baby killing not abortion
"People keep spouting misinformation about  America being founded as a christian nation. It wasn't!  To know our true history. read  ""
A People's History of the United States "" by Howard Zinn."
Abolishing Abortion 100% agree!
Yet these people are okay with actual children dying in gaza. In fact they advocate for it. Hypocrites the right to abortion is a women's choice or the women's choice you know the one having the baby. These people are as genuine. As The ones pretending to care about homeless People. What they truly seek is control.
disheartening to see so many women supporting this wth...
I am glad people are standing up against abortion. It is sick that people will support abortion. Although I don't agree with most of the religious thinking and Christian beliefs.
And who gonna represents the babies?
Modern edgelords. I'm soooo impressed
But they also want to prevent access to cheap contraception means as well...
2:10 ummm its half a mans baby as well? This is the problem with the whole judicial system that hates men adn takes away their children. (i however do agree that woen are better at raising children)
"Kiddos, you've all just gone and given yourselves a reason for your kids to hate you 🤣"
I'm shocked
Basically they are misogynists...
Teenagers are the best
Praise the Lord ❤
BAN ABORTION!
"So, we go extinct by 2030 from the loss of Arctic Sea ice. And.... we're having kids for.... what????"
"This is fine if atleast America had a proper welfare state. Let's be real most people who want to get an abortion would just give their child up got foster care or adoption if they couldn't get an abortion, so if you want to remove abortion, you have to start with better funding for schools and food banks which starts with higher taxes, which judging by the fact that most of these protestors are conservative, they wouldn't want."
More people are killed each year by abortion than by cancer.
Just an astounding lack of empathy
Abortion is a medical treatment just like euthanasia i suppose 😵‍💫Abortion is racist. Abortion is ableist. Abortion is classist. However until welfare is fixed i dont think we should be throwing children into a severe lack of resources. I think the resources for post birth babies need to be fixed first. I think condoms need to be more accessible too to prevent pregnant people/couples being in that situation in the first place. Heres hoping history continues to favor activism for those deemed not human by society.
Ok im against abortion but in some cases its justified. If its ending a mothers life or potentially going to cause serious health probalems. Or in the case that the baby also wont survive.
Thank you youngsters  For keeping Yahweh law❤❤❤❤
someone has to give the unborn a voice
Women want to lose their rights to choose if they want baby or not.
"You must be Born Again.

⚠  You have been informed."
"If potential brain-damage was a lawful reason for abortion, these people protesting against abortion wouldn't exist... 
Stop telling others, what they should do, with their bodies!"
Am against late term abortion in a fair society we must protect those who can't protect themself with laws.
"Ugh I lived through the 80s wave of this but we still kept abortion legal in many states.  These people are deluded.  Even when I was a Christian, I didn’t think it was my right to tell someone else what to do with their reproduction"
Half the country wants a theocratic strongman dictatorship while the other half wants a socialist welfare state. Would be happy with George Bush or Obama at this point.
😂😂😂
Next step is to abolish abortion by criminalizing it.
"Then you also need to adopt socialism, free education, free healthcare and mandatory adoption. If you are demanding that every child is born."
Like slavery in the US in the 1850s. Human beings treated like dirt and eliminated.
America is healing
"Why are we still having this discussion in 2024? Keep abortion legal but limited unless in life or death situations. I think up until three months or 12 weeks in plenty. Done let’s move on. Don’t ban abortions but also don’t allow late term abortions unless medically necessary. This is very simple. I partly blame the left for this extreme push back against abortion now. If they had not been pushing and getting laws passed to allow late term abortions like nine months, then I don’t believe the anti abortion push would be this loud and fervent."
"Im Filipino, abortion is illegal in our country, living in this earth is a miracle and blessing, killing babies is evil."
"CGTN The Point-Hub-Heat, Universal Healthcare-Pharmacare-Maternity-Paternity leave-Poverty alleviation... China has amazing family friendly policies.."
Yes Abortion is bad. its your body? so dont give it out to hundreds of men.
"I'm pro choice, but that doesn't mean I think abortion isn't treated in this disgusting, non-chalant attitude, completely disregarding and denying the gravity action you're taking. The longer you wait, the less ethical it becomes."
"fight all day for the ""unborn"", but they couldn't care less about the already living people suffering in the world"
Wow! Morals 😊💖✨
Wow I didn't know The Guardian reported positive news. Keep up the fight America! No one should be killed just for existing!
They are wrong because abortions are going to happen no matter what
Don't be fooled. Most of these people aren't really in it for saving babies. They're in it for the control. To tell you how to live your life
these poor women lack self respect to a depressing degree.
"I hope each of these girls finds themselves if the truly heartbreaking situation of wanting a baby but something tragic happens and the fetus ends up not viable 

But they aren’t “sick enough” in the eyes of the law to receive the life saving care they need. 

Amen"
vile
They are free to pray when their loved ones lives are in danger.  Let the rest of us practice our freedom of choice.
It's like watching a flat-earther convention.
Eesh lots of redditors in the comments
"This group of people are also anti-Women
anti-Black
anti-democracy
anti-medical care for all American Citizens 
Anti- social benefits for poor people and thise in need

Yet they do support immediate capital punishment without getting concrete evidence"

"I don’t see many minorities in bad areas harassing us in the streets like this about abortion… 

That’s telling."
The constitution is not a religious document 😂
"""...but this nation was founded as a Christian nation."" THAT IS SO TRUE. 
A LOT americans didn't know their history. they dont know that...men and women were viewed differently. men were the primary parents, protectors, providers, leaders of the home, and teachers of the home and the world! while women were their helpers/assistants. men were the one who had custodial rights over their kids and voting rights. that change with women's rights."
"What about the agnostic people that are against abortion? Their are people I myself included, that think unaliving unborn babies is wrong based on rational moral thinking. The left like to lump this in as wholly a religious issue. They are wrong."
"Your body, my choice...  I like the sound of that"
Abortion is the termination of a human life
"Obviously, Google and Wikipedia are triggered, tagging information about Abortion."
"if you have medical complications, pray. 
like no one ever did that before.
and, using their logic, haven't prayers been answered through medical advances?"
"Based. That's what you get when most of the abortion are because they can't be bothered with a child , not because they got r*ped nor victim of abuse. Abuse the compromise and the other will not put up with it any more , it's simple"
"this is why i love americans, not perfect but fight for the weak people and human right for everyone"
I think we need to fund more initiatives to support child care so that the decision to NOT abort is easier.
"Great, they can all get in line to adopt children, if they have time to hold up signs then they have enough time to go adopt children, you know because they need protection."
Finally
"The Peo-Life moment speaks truth.
It's difficult for Guardian readers to stomach, as they've been fed sweet lies, and truth is difficult to digest for the weak of heart."
8:05 scam😂😂
So glad to see young people standing up for the unborn.
I approve and appreciate young Americans fighting against abortion.
Scary.
That's right!
"If you're young, female, not cis hetero, not of the ethnic majority, and/or not rich, and you're right-wing, you're doing something unnatural."
"I wonder how many of these ""March for Lifers"" have donated blood."
"Abortion isn't a ""right"", it's a drastic measure. Exceptions are possible, but normalization is not."
"Let's get pregnant then.
5:12 FUTURE UNWANTED KID"
Nothing wrong in supporting an abortion ban 😂
wonder how many going take care of children  in  foster care
Who’s taking care of the unwanted kids who were born?
"No one calling themselves Christian can support abortion other than in the cases of a serious medical condition. The fact that over 250,000 are carried out in the UK alone each year would indication there is either a massive medical issue with millions of women or it is being used for simple birth control."

"I’m a Democrat, and I’m proudly anti-abortion."
🙏🙏👍👍🙏🙏
"""I dont want to impose what we believe on others"" Well, then just stop doing that. Big hypocrite."
"Condoms. IUDs. The pill. Vasectomies. Abstinence. If ppl were more responsible, millions of unborn children would be living their lives right now"
"_It is my body I can do what I like!_ ... Actually, the DNA shows it is someone else's body."
At last some great news.
What’s wrong with condoms and the pill?
Lol
"I dunno...its a tricky one. Under certain cirumstances, i would want my future daughter to have a choice"
"""She's loved and supported, just not in the one specific way that will actually support her in staying alive"""
There's a weird squinty look these people have in their lower eyelids when talking about their beliefs. It is kind of uncanny. Anyone else notice that?
It's so weird that it's also an election year isn't it?
Delusional people telling us what to do
I think personal responsibility is better option than abortion. Plenty of contraception options out there
"Yall keep on fighting and protesting. The birth rates will continue to fall completely off a cliff. Check the perfect Asian cultures you rave about. No dating, No relations, No babies."
Praying doesn’t heal wounds medicine does‼️✔️💯
I urge all to watch Dawkins speak on her Youtube channel. She is very factual and knowledgeable on abortion.
A lot of people don’t realize that abortions aren’t just about babies. A tumor removal from a uterus is also classified as an abortion. So by wanting to ban abortions they are making necessary care inaccessible
How the turntables
"3:32 It's always hilarious to see those Glowies out in the open at protests. They never speak to anyone else and always hide behind their full face masks. Plus, they always get into unmarked vehicles. The fact that a Federal agency will have it's agents trying to slander people and cause problems, is cause for concern. They use taxpayer money to try and foment hostility and political tension between citizens."
Another step closer to the Handmaid's Tale future! This is sheer lunacy!
"How beautiful to see all those young women fighting against abortion, there is hope!"
PRO CASTRATION
"Nobody force this people to have abortion. 
If you are pro life,  be pro life and don't tell others what to do with their bodies."
y’all do know that they’ll make a video with the people that sound most crazy so y’all believe that the pro-life people  unintelligent? Just in case.
The issue with abortion is that it risks leading to female led eugenics and to the commercialization of human life.
This comment section failed the Vibe Check
"What a joke: Trying skip over dealing with rampant child abuse & neglect, aiming right for banning abortion to feel like hero’s. 

What about the children that are born and suffer!"
"Let's be honest, these women know most abortions are done on healthy pregnancies and they use edge cases to argue for the majority"
coat hanger sales are through the roof
What a surprise Patriot Front was at that rally....
The Christian Taliban.
"No one has the right to ban it. No one. Just cos you don’t agree with it, it’s nobody’s right to ever tell any woman she cannot have control over her own body or her own life. The End."
End abortion now and forever!
this hurts to watch
The amount of suffering these people cause and they don’t seem to aknowlege any of it
maybe they'll just march off the edge of that christian flat earth
"""My body my choice, except when we want to force you to get the jab"""

This how Gilead starts.
"They love the unborn until they're born. Then it's ""who cares about you, fend for yourself"""
Terrifying!
"this whole Ban is only to make people feel better. if a woman wants a abortion and the Country makes it illegal if shes desperate enough she will take a more dangerous option than a medical professional. I bet these Bans will cause more deaths than if they were not in law. they would have to lockup every pregnant woman to be able to enforce the bans. not to mention it would create Sketchy clinics who charge a fortune.

TLDR this is a pointless fight that is impossible to enforce. the woman could just hit herself in the stomach over and over and nothing could be done. Stop creating more dangers than it saves. its a pointless law."
Actually this country was built on the principle of freedom from religious prosecution.  Hypocrite solopsism rampant and unchecked.
“Abortion should be illegal” but some of these crazies say that women who need an abortion should be punished with the death penalty 🤯🤯🤯 Is that really Pro-Life???
Why is it in the constitution that there is a separation of church and state if the country was supposedly founded on Christian values?
Make abortion in available and then lose lives of mothers who cannot carry the fetuses to term 🙄 so much for Pro Life
"""...but this nation was founded as a christian nation."" Nope. 
The First Amendment's Establishment Clause prohibits the government from making any law “respecting an establishment of religion.” This clause not only forbids the government from establishing an official religion, but also prohibits government actions that unduly favor one religion over another. This nation was not founded as a christain nation."
Are there any non-white people there opposing abortion?
Legal abortion for all States 2024 /
"Why don't these anti abortion people focus on contraception, which can prevent abortions,if they are so gung ho about ending abortion!?"
Tiktok first...then natural rights of unborn children.
"6:28 Wrong, separation of church and state. Credibility of your movement, gone."
why do all the prolifers look the same? doesn't seem like they'd have a wide range of perspectives.
"The right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is based on religious morals. It’s not just religion, but also the US constitution which should protect the life of both a mother and a child."
This was a refreshingly neutral report by the Guardian. Thank you
"amazing how they're outraged at abortion but the not the children being bombed to death in gaza with their tax dollars, their ""pro life"" stance is just bs"
A man fighting for a choice he will never have to make is ridiculous
I thought this is a country of freedom! Why so many people trying to pose their opinions on other’s body?
"Just google Project 2025, enough said…… they’re literally admitting their plan of an overhaul of democracy"
"That girl right at the beginning who said ""abortion is the greatest injustice to ever happen to women in all of human history"".... how much of the world have you seen, really?

also, why don't they pray hard for poverty to end?"
I dont agree with abortion but then im not the one going thru that life changing decision. How about each of these people sign up to adopt a child after an unwanted birth? Then theres no need for abortions. Step up and put your money where your mouth is.
"Okay hold on a minute. Legalising abortion does not mean a woman is told not to have a baby, it just means that the option to abort is there for her in the worst of scenarios! It is her right to decide what to do with her own body. And saying that abolishing abortion is giving freedom to people simply doesn’t make sense, you’re diminishing their freedom."
"it´s not abortion per sé   it´s the whole spanning industry behind it which is anti natural 
anti nature anti human and evil by default"

A small but very vocal minority.

Mind your own business.

"That lady just believes that Christian should be the default since she brought up that America is a ""Christian"" country."

It is so simple her body her choice like when it is your choice to take vaccine.coming from a moderate going to vote Republican 😊
These girls are very beautiful and seem homely
keep men and a book out of the argument
they really should fight to take care of all abandoned kids. instead of forcing their ideas on others.
"OH😮 THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE,  people have the Right to choose."
"- But what if pregnancy is threatening health of that woman?
- Well... The prayer can help her out!"
This people are lost. This country main principle is the separation of church and government.
The comment section says it ALL! We want the RIGHT TO CHOOSE!
Separation of church and state.
"6:10 Which are the religions of America residing people that DO NOT oppose abortion?? 
I'll wait...

Apart from that, i did not expect actual impartiallity in a video of a hot topic, which is super rare in todays media landscape. Pleasant surprise to see proper journalism."
Religion is holding America back from moving forward in time. It's like I'm looking at 1960 or something!
The women in tan and orange at 2:54 look like handmaidens (from The Handmaid's Tale).
"Any women who does not want her unborn child should sign over her rights to that child to give it up for adoption once it is born and the US government should pay the living costs for that women and child to live until the day the child is born.  If that women engages in risky behavior that causes damage to the unborn child, then she should be charged with child abuse.  Every human being has a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in this nation guaranteed by our Constitution.  This includes babies."
And these people vote
"It’s insane that Us had legal abortion up until birth. There were mothers going with big stomachs 20 plus weeks, oh my boyfriend left me, there you go your pill, don’t look in the toilet….

I love you already"
"Stagnant wages, climbing home prices, opioid epidemic, innovation slowdown, rising national debt, and this is the issue certain young people are devoting themselves to?"
These people are nothing more than enemies
I'm fairly pro-life but the bit baout medically necessary abortions to just be answred by prayer that was ferral
Those 'pro life' are the first choose the abortion if they need to.
"these types of people aren't new, it's always been a type of thing."
feels a bit negligent to gloss over the presence of fascists at the event ( 3:32 )
"Everyone is pro choice. When you choose to take care of your own children but not other children, that’s pro choice. When you choose which child to adopt, that’s pro choice. If the government mandated every open pro life individual or organisation to contribute significantly to raising abandoned children, they’d drop the pro life label in a minute."
Then don't have one.

"Polska- jesteśmy z wami całym sercem. Niech skończą się te kłamstwa. To nie jest ciało kobiety. Aborcja nie ma nic do decydowania kobiety o swoim życiu, to decydowanie by odebrać życie swojemu potomstwu przed jego porodem. Rozrywanie ciała tej młodej istoty to strach i cierpienie dla niej, w taki sposób jak pojmuje ono to na swoim etapie rozwoju. Psu jak płodowi nie można przypisać abstrakcyjnego myślenia i operowania na pojęciach miłości czy strachu. Mimo to jedno i drugie odczuwa to całym sobą. Mówmy prawdę, bo czas skończyć z tym terrorem na świecie, gdy jednym wydaje się że mogą decydować o życiu drugich"
"the most interesting part is always how shallow their opinions are yet their feelings are this strong. I would rather read a 5 page essay on one persons actual opinion where they contend with themselves to figure it out for themselves instead of 1 mob opinion. every time they start speaking they start with ""i feel i am right, therefore i am right and you are wrong"" instead of ""hmm, let's see"" and make an argument. call yourself a journalist when you dont even care or try to figure out? i came for answers and i found empty shells trying to fill it with some cause they havent reflected about"
There are so many contradictions about their politics
I want to know if they will have the same response/reaction if their life or a loved one's life was at risk and needed an abortion.
Question how many children have you adopted or given donations to unfortunate parents talk is cheap why don’t you turn your churches into save living quarters for single mothers like I said talk is cheap‼️✔️✔️💯
There not pro life there pro poverty.
These people are absolutely okay with their own abortion
"A man saying that abortion is the greatest injustice to ever exist in America is absolutely insane. This rhetoric is so deeply rooted in misogyny and entitlement. Let a woman choose what she does with her body during the time frame that she was permitted to. 

Crazy that there is even a timeframe graciously allotted to women to make decisions..."
Land of the..... nevermind
Pro-Life Team ❤️
They make me scary
Just Donald Trump alone is my argument in favour of abortion. Vladimir Putin would reinforce that argument.
"So...if politically the country doesn't abide by your beliefs, political rallies, and marches, (actual physical and social actions) are necessary ways to change things. But if a woman is caught in a life-or-death situation...prayer's enough. Why is prayer (a supernatural action) selectively effective?"
The abolition movement means a full ban. They don't believe that there are exceptions for the mother's life. If you die it's 'God's will'
"It's wild to me how few Americans have their facts straight about their founding fathers. They were progressive thinkers (for the time - I know, I know) who were didn't believe that religion had a place in government"
“I don’t mean to impose my beliefs on anyone but I’m here advocating to impose my beliefs on everyone” 😂
Do people change their opinions when presented with counter arguments? Do people ever change their opinions and what causes it to happen?
6:25 This is what listening to pretend Christian Trump looks like
You can also match to end gun violence and try to adopt some babies.
I wonder how many of the natalists in this video are pro-death penalty?  🤔🤔🤔🤭
You mean the forced bírther anti survívor movement. Abortions being illegal is literally emboldening (child) predators.
"The founding father made sure this was not a Christian nation,pure ignorance behind that statement."
"America once stood for enlightenment, democracy and civilization. Now religious fanaticism, the disastrous school and education system and the unbridled free market seem to be making these achievements recede. The pro-life movement, for example, is a symptom of this organized stupidity."
"It's kind of terrifying when faced with the realities of the situation their response is, ""just pray about it."" If the mother and/or fetus ends up passing away, then it was a god's plan for that to happen. If the fetus manages to live but has life long complications, it was god's plan for that to happen. If the fetus survives but the mother dies, it was god's plan for that to happen. Meanwhile, apparently if the mother had alternative plans they are irrelevant."
"Yeah, she has two other kids already, and an abortion would save her life, but they want her to just PRAY??? What about HER life??? HER life IS SACRED, you mouth-breathing virgin. 😡"
"Rhythm is a dancer, religion is a god damn cancer."
"Abortion was legal for years in the beginning of America! Benjamin Franklin wrote a How-To pamphlet on abortion, for crying out loud. 🙄"
lol this is NOT the majority lol
"Women have aborted, abort and will abort as long as humans are around. You can’t change that. Having a child is an enormous responsibility and not being wanted by your parents is tragic."
"Oh look, a religious group celebrating forcing their beliefs onto others, while not being cognizant of what they're doing. 

*shocked pikachu face*"
"""I don't think Christians should impose their beliefs on others, That's why we need Christian laws."" Even if I agreed with this nonsense, that thinking makes no sense."
"I hope they are all out fighting for healthcare for all,safe neighbourhoods and against child poverty and homelessness and against violence and #ape against women,low wages,paternal/maternity paid leave,support for kids in care,wealth inequality,gun laws restrictions,mental health support....and all those other things which enable a life of dignity and REAL choice and freedom.
What the hell do any of them know about bringing up a child in poverty or without support and why don't they go and stand up for better healthcare,education,housing,wages,childcare......telling women they ""can do it on their own..there is support out there .."" also they care so much about the taking of a life..what about protesting against selling of arms to corrupt regimes who use them to destroy innceont lives including thousnads of children"
These beige+orange looks are CULTY!!
Churches need to pay taxes.
Abortion is healthcare. Praying is not. Simples.
How many of these people have ever had an extended conversation with someone who has terminated a pregnancy?
"I know it's an old argument, but the guy at the start says he wants to 'fight for the defenceless' so I'd ask if he will continue to fight for these fetuses once they become children, to make sure they don't live in poverty, get health care - you know all this but just needed to say it once again."
American christians love forcing their dog shit down everyone's throat.
"6:16 girl, I’m a Christian too but you can’t say the country they are in was founded as Christian when the land was taken from the indigenous!"
"Few things as gross as telling someone with a life threatening illness that the solution isnt medical intervention, its ~ to pray ~"
"Straight white Christians forcing women to carry an unwanted fetus to full term, even if they were raped or if it kills them from the inside? That’s America for ya. Freedom for some and justice for none."
End abortion
"Hey look....opinionated white people! Republicans feigning support for children...until they're born, then any semblance of social assistance like welfare or a school lunch program is leeching off tax payers."
Good. Now we know thier faces.
Nice to see young people who still care. 100% of the babies who were aborted would have wanted to be alive. Dont take that opportunity away from them. Don't have sex if you're no ready to have kids. It's that simple.
"For every abortion they stop they should be made to adopt or pay to care for that child OR pay because that woman is suffering bad mental health or is unalive do to her legally not being able to get one and then was bleeding out ( for example)❗
Also all these peopeo are of one shade of people and could be very well off. ❗
I promise you. No amount of government support is gonna give a kid a father or their mother back. Kids are not always a blessing in some situations. They could be born very sick and suffer.
 A woman said she would not abort a couple's child as a surrogate because she vould feel them kick. She even asked for more money when they offered to pay 5k-10k. She left the state. Gave birth. Dumped the poor kid with someone who was blind, deaf, couldnt speak, smile, or react to any stimulus. They child lived until 8. Literally a vegetable. 
A mom wanted her kid born even though he had NO brain or little to NO brain!!!! Like maybe 1-9 percent. He did nothing for almost 2 years. 


Pro life doesnt care about those here other wise they would take prisoners off death row, kids would have nutritional foods to eat, single parents would be HEAVILY supported and not wait up to 5 years to have a housing, a choice of any daycare of theie choice paid for, education for rhe child is paid for as well as her cause they ""care about moms"" and MORE ❗❗❗"
Absolutely they are imposing their values and religion on everyone and the US was NOT founded on Christian values.
"Abortion is the woman's decision, not the state's."
Weird 😶
"It is fine to have an opinion and do what you can in your power to empower those around you and galvanise pressure and votes.

The thing that seems tricky and dangerous is when the person/s equate morality with religion. 

This is because you can be moral or immoral without religious values telling you what to do 

And especially because religious values can be interpreted, misjudged or even abused or indoctrinated. 

This is especially the case of imposing values that are thousands of years old on issues of the current era which can lead to both an interesting discourse or a misleading one"
Fanatics...
"The USA is in a very very bad place now, it is the beginning of the end if any of these Christian nationalist  get their hands on the football they will throw it, it'll be their holy war they have yearned for for centuries also remember they think they have an escape hatch they call it Heaven."
"Wow, none of those kids have any idea what the real world is. All wrapped up in their privilege and indoctrination.  
Not one of the children asked that hard question was able to give a real answer. Oh, we would pray with them and support them, but not agree to letting them be saved?
Every day, the news coming out of that country makes me more and more grateful I wasn't born there. 
And that dreadful female claiming they don't mean to impose xtian values on non xtians... but this cuntry was founded on xtian values, so.....
Don't they realise that xtianity is just pure unadulterated gaslighting? And how dare they ignore victims of rape, they want to force women to carry their rapists child to term? They want to deny those women the morning after pill because it might kill a few cells that might turn into a child? 
They don't have any answers for the consequences of this foul campaign, they're just having fun screaming for a law that denies women control over their own bodies. At least half of the girls in those protests will grow up and realise the in the worst possible way just how gaslit they actually were and how vital reproductive health services actually are for them and having access to abortion is vital."
"This country was founded on freedom of religion, some of these people are nuts"
And none of them are willing to adopt
"Kristan Hawkins is highly unlikely to experience the consequences of her actions, she looks as if she would have insulin resistance minimum, which makes conception hard. She also does not look like the kind of person to suffer a date rape."
"Abortion is the Ultimate Control Attempt by Men over Women, nothing to do with saving a life, etc... "
Anyone have a translation for the woman at 5:30?
"Abortion is healthcare. As a woman i am happy to live in a pro choice state. 

States that ban abortion will lose talent and women. As someone who works in healthcare do you think i will ever move to those states ??? Absolutely not.


Abortion not for you? Your choice. I respect it. Please respect everyone elses choice.


P.s. prayer will do little to bring a person back from sepsis/dying. And we should respect all religions and their beliefs. Not one above  another."
Anti - abortion to produce soldiers.
"""When there is socitial injustice you cant care what people think, so long as you fight for the right cause"" 

Genuinely a terrifying logic in my opinion.... I just find all these people's logic baffling, who are these people to say what people can do in a supposedly free country. They dont have to have an abortion but why should they deny others?"
They are rich so they can afford kids.
"Seriously, extreminist Religious women are destroying the European and Americans movements for feminism for the last centuries. 

Women in the past would revive form their grave if they knew modern women are these nuts.

Anyway, people have tendency to be unempathetic if they did not experience the pain and sufferings of being rape, and among other things. Heck, They did not read the history 

As a man, its very frustrating to proect gender equality if there are some women who are buts to abandon their rights for their misguided sense of justice. 🙄😅

They were like western Muslim women who taught Muslim are for women and lgbt are for Muslims.
Sorry to break it to them but all theocracy hate women and that's a fact. 😂😂"
This shouldnt even be a debate. How many of these people eat meat for example? Why is it okay to kill a lamb or a chicken and not an unwanted phoetus? Life is life but it has to have dignity. And coherence.
america is beyond help at this stage
All white….so funny….
"Protesting is not the most efficient way to bring down the numbers. These people don’t even really care, but celebrating themselves. If women are criminalised some will turn to medically unsuitable places and methods."
The Handmaids Tale is a rom-com for America’s religious rightwing.
"My question is simple: ""Who do you think you are?"""
Those old asses denied rights for WOMEN. A great injustice
"Where’s the help? Instead of saying there’s help out there show were single mothers can get the help they need I’ll wait‼️✔️ the homeless rate are rising, we have a failing 😢 adoption system, these kids are being forced out at 18 becoming homeless if she gets rape she will be forced to keep it how about women who are at risk of dying is that okay? If you want women to keep there babies than make laws the support families instead of sending our taxpayer dollars to fund wars overseas, maybe you should save the lives that exist now."
"This is some cult-like stuff, banning abortion is the most stupid thing."
"Hitchens was right: religion poisons everything. Keep your imaginary friend and your mythological delusions out of politics.
Christian nationalism is an highly dangerous and extremely toxic neo-fascist ideology. 
It is a fundamentalist far-right ideology, based on a strategic alliance between the far right and the fundamentalist Religious Right, aiming at establishing a US theocracy. It advocates for a society in which minority rule by white, conservative Christians is enshrined, democracy be damned."
What would you do if someone's life were in danger if they continued with the pregnancy - I will pray with her .  NO!  these people are crazy
the level of the stupidity makes this cringe af.
America has become feral
GLORY TO CHILDFREE 🏳‍🌈 GLORY TO ABORTING🏳‍🌈
"Under-educated fools, religious bigots and the US far-right. The result of decades of anti-scientific disinformation and religious indoctrination."
Yes... Yes... And .. YES.
"Fucktards, all of 'em."
Look at all these crazed individuals.
They don’t wanna terminate the pregnancy but they don’t wanna do anything for raising the unwanted child. Kind of sad. These women don’t have health insurance so they can’t pay for prenatal care they can’t pay for delivery care they can’t pay to raise their child hypocrisy of these individuals is astounding 1:31
