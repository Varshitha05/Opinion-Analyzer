DEMOCRATS DON'T ONEY LAWS
ABORTION is MURDER
"Good, abortion is killing babies adoption is a better option"
As a Canadian I’m extremely glad we have a choice and the issue is that everyone should have a choice for example what if a young girl gets raped
It's about time.
if you don’t want nun in life stay SINGLE
Sick
How discussing dissatisfied  and  horrible  horrible  behavior  of Republicans now as we the person of the United States of America we have to stand up for ourselves  and voter  blue and see what Biden  will  do  for the United States of America we the people 💙 women  vote blue  💙 😊😊😊😊😊Republicans  don't  care about  the United States of America we the people woman  at all dearly 💙 hearts 💙 😊😊😊😊stand up for the rights  💙 😊
Liars! Which states made abortion illegal? Y'all suck
"Pro choice indirectly supports grape culture. Women use abortion as the ultimate birth control. So women go out for a night of fun with friends, never with the intent of getting pregnant or graped. But put themselves out there to be targeted by evil people, which there seems more today.  In 2019 alone, over 625,000 abortions occured. Ranging from 5 to 12 weeks old and 1 to 5 inches fetuses. In that year alone, how high and wide would you stack these dead children? Enough to fill 6 diesel truck trailers!!!"
"1) Abortion bans do nothing. Women will always have the option of abortion, whether it’s banned or not. 
2) Abortion bans actually increase the number of abortions, ironically. So I guess you people really aren’t about saving fetal lives so much as virtue signaling.
3) Fetuses now have a right that no other human being has, and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another person’s body to stay alive. No other human has ever been granted that right. Even if you stab someone and they’re bleeding out, and you have matching blood types, the government cannot force you to give them your blood to keep them alive. Or if you use a mask, gloves, etc. but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organs start shutting down, the government cannot forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organs. You used protection, so the chances of giving this person the disease that you’re a carrier for were very low, but it still happened, and now they’re dying because of you. Guess what—the government does not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive. That’s exactly what an abortion ban attempts to do, however. So I’m not sure why fetuses should have that right when no one else does."
Wow. This is really fucking sad. Maybe our voting rights will be gone next. This is why history is important.
Terrific to see the rights of the unborn finally being respected. We need that in Europe as well.
Easy Solution Ladies… Do Not Engage in Sexual Relations with any men in these states…ask for ID residency
The Democrats are furious they can't control the black and Latino populations in these states. Margaret Sanger must be rolling in her grave.
I am so happy that they are banning abortion it is wrong and should never be done human life’s are precious and should NEVER be aborted and you cant say that I am wrong
Wait so they’re banning abortion completely? I guess girls better make sure you don fuck the wrong guy now.
"But why can’t I chop up my own baby?!?  Seriously my only defense for baby chopping (I refuse to use the pretty word abortion) is that if a potential mom can do this while the baby is inside her for protection, then maybe that beast shouldn’t give birth.  You realize they cut your baby up inside you like you would a whole fryer chicken, only not as nice, right?  Hitler thought he should be able to pick and choose who should live.  You’re all a bunch of mini-Hitlers"
Abortion should be banned
Use your vote America. Don't fuck it up or they will go for contraception next. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
How can you call abortion murder if you cannot prove there is a child
THIS IS NOT HELPFUL REGARDING STATES(11).  NINE CITIES.  I INQUIRED AS TO THE 11 U.S. STATES.  WHY SO SECRETIVE?  INCLUDE THE DRUG COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE THE ABORTION AND MORNING AFTER PILLS.
"Keep your pants on if you don't want a Baby, MUDERING is STILL WRONG, there is FREEDOM there's CONSEQUENCES, these women may not believe in GOD,  But we will find out at some point, GOD declared, that"" THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH"" so good luck"
Lmao
"Abortion bans KILL women! Ectopic pregnancies! Sepsis if forced to carry a dead fetus! Forcing a child of incest to give birth whence her body isn't mature enough to carry! And where are those who love abortion bans! Where are they paying for funerals! Would they want their daughter to have forced birth for rape or incest? Where are they? They scatter like cockroaches in the light! They run away from the consequences! And those people are the same ones who have a fur ball if criticized saying ""don't you tell me how to raise my child!"" yet want others to give birth to unwanted, unloved kids! Pathetic!"
stop hating eachother bc you disagree the irony!
Ban it also
If they need it let them get the abortion😊
"Ok here’s why, some people need to get abortions If they had the baby they would die so they had to get abortions"
Why not
We can’t ban abortion
I just saw a sign to legalize abortion from conception to birth. Why have we criminally charged women who killed their newly self birthed their fetus?
Yes ban all abortions . im sick if seeing women get abortions they want to keep giing around spreading they legs and want to play but not pay for it  fuck that them babies deserve life what if that was you in a belly and ur momma wanted to abort you. ! And rape is sad i understand but give baby up for adoption let it atleast have chance and incest again if its incest and no rape then like i said before keep your legs closed.
People kill babies and feel nothing
So women will have to take responsibility now?
"These bans put in another notch in the belt of women who just can't win for anything in this sexist society. A man doesn't want to marry no problem. She doesn't want to marry she's called a lesbian or a man hater. Single moms everyone says the kid needs a father! Single dad? No one says the kid needs a mom treating moms as irrelevant and unimportant, at the same time demanding she BE a mom!  Man has a lot of partners no problem. She has a lot of partners she's called names. She abandons her kids she's considered an awful person. He abandons his family no reaction. Well if you have an abortion you'd make a lousy parent some would say  but are silent about deadbeat dads who refuse to take care of their offspring.  Well if you kept your legs closed you wouldn't get pregnant some say. But just me says to him no one forces you to jump in. No one is forcing you to do it with her. You're yelled at if you have an abortion, you have a kid it's oh no here we go again another Welfare kid! Well life begins at conception! But then you have those who have no idea how long it even takes for the sperm and egg to meet acting like women can control that. It can take days or weeks for the fertilized egg to attach to the womb. There are a lot of barriers to cross. And then of course you have the problem of an ectopic pregnancy the ignorant don't have a clue about. The egg attaches to the fallopian tube and grows and kills mom when it ruptures and she bleeds to death! Abortion is murder people tell her! But say to her no problem if you abort with a genetic problem most of which can be managed. Prosthetics for a missing limb, lots of help to learn things if you have Downs Syndrome. They can learn just like everyone else. So abortion is ""murder"" selectively. Abort the imperfect, keep the perfect you don't want. Essentially women can't win no matter what. But no one imposes anything on men. Pure sexist hypocrisy. And of course the pro lifer will never take in a pregnant woman, nurse her through 9 months, be there at labor and birth and be a surrogate relative helping to raise the kid. They're not there to personally find child care. They don't care if mom doesn't get paid maternity leave but get upset if fathers don't get it! They don't care that schools stop their lunch programs because parents are too damn lazy to wake up an hour earlier to give the kid breakfast and pack a lunch but have no problem feeding their own faces! Wonder what the politicians would do if unwanted babies were dumped on their doorsteps. You wanted the kid born now you take care of it! Those against abortion call themselves experts on the subject who've never been in the situation. Abortion is different for people. For some the decision is easy but tough to go through, for some the decision is hard to make and hard to go through. Contraception is also sexist. It's all dumped on her. But he runs if offered a condom. Pathetic all the way around the way society tries to control women it just doesn't like. And oh yeah! The ignorant assumption that she makes babies. No sperm no baby. We don't spontaneously create babies. Not only is there ignorance about abortion but human biology as well. No abortion? Then there should be forced neutering of men. I bet  that would drive men crazy. Shame that will never happen so we can hear men tirade about denial of reproductive choice!"
"Abortion bans are just another form of sexism and stereotype and hypocrisy. Sexism comes to play because no one puts bans on vasectomy. He can do it for any reason no questions asked. He can control his reproductive decisions without government imposition. Same old crap. He can we can't. No one yells at a man demanding she get an abortion, she wants it suddenly doing it is awful. The stereotype remains in that women must have a kid because that's her lot in life. If she's a lousy parent boo! He's a lousy parent or doesn't even stick around, silence. The hypocrisy comes in by those who want other people to have no rights but it must never happen to them. Gun nuts are a perfect example. They don't care of your right to vote is suppressed. They don't care if a woman's right to choose when it comes to having a kid is interfered with. But take away their guns? Even suggest it? They have a hair ball tantrum!"
"I always thought abortion was a need, not a want. Only to prevent the child from suffering if there was something seriously wrong with the baby, I even understand that. So why is having an abortion because you want it okay? I agree with a portion of abortion if it’s a need, to prevent the child from suffering or in a way to save the mother from jeopardizing her health. Why else would abortion be okay if you want it and not need it? Know what I’m saying?"
Ban the shit
"Effective immediately, ALL states that have “BANNED ABORTION” are REQUIRED to collect DNA, of ALL males, ages 12 and above. Since 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice has maintained a nationwide forensic DNA database known as the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). Today, the federal government and all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, contribute profiles to CODIS.Jan 20, 2021"
"Wait I thought most of these pro lifers  are Christian? Which is weird because in the bible it says life begins at first breath. So which is it, either the bible is the word of god or the bible has some errors in it."
"I would never have an abortion, but if they can live with it, then it's not my place to judge. This is really setting humanity back 100 years."
"Hello !
Every doctor swear to follow the Hippocratic oath :
The Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians. It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear, by a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards. The oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the Western world, establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today. These include the principles of medical confidentiality and non-maleficence. As the seminal articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice, the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value. It is enshrined in the legal statutes of various jurisdictions, such that violations of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oath's symbolic nature.

"FYI:  Leader of major Texas Anti-Abortion group arrested for soliciting a minor
MARK FRAUENFELDER  2:14 PM THU AUG 25, 2022
Luke Bowen, the Political Director and the public face of Texas Right to Life, was arrested earlier this month for solicitation of a minor. The forced pregnancy organization fired Mr. Bowen on the same day he was arrested."
That's not right that's killing innocent babies
Well after the Roe v wade was demolished now its getting control over the women and soon it will be illegal to be transgender and that will be a great day for our nation
I'm so happy for this new law it's awesome
"Oh no ... these poor women will be forced to consider birth control methods like , God forbid ,  the pill or condoms ... the inhumanity of it all ..."
"Pouring gasoline on the fire of rage against religious extremism and the march toward theocracy.  85% favor legal abortion.  If you don't show up at the polls and choose representatives who support you then you are the problem.  Vote, it's our only recourse."
I like the fact that the bitches and gold diggers need to get a proper job now instead kill little angels for living
These 11 states have my full support
"This just make people hate the churches even more and not trust their government because they know the governments are influenced by religion. I don’t agree with abortion because to me it all falls under being irresponsible and therefore also making you a murderer. No matter how you see it. but people need to live with their own consequences so it should be legalized. Women saying my body my choice is selfish because it takes 2 to make a LIFE. Not 1. You didn’t make that baby on your own and any guy who support your decision is a murderer like you. Some guys are going support your wrong decision just to get laid. To make themselves look good. But of course you women know that. But as long as they are on your side you don’t care. Here is my solution. Legalize abortion, anyone who gets it under 3 months gets 1 year of federal prison on charges for 3 degree murder. Anyone 4 months and up 5 years in federal prison. Only women who were kidnapped and forcefully rape should get physical and mental treatment and paid by the state. Solution solve. You’ll see how abortion goes down."
"Watch: birth control pills are still effective way to control birth:
https://youtu.be/wbajNTXBdtc
Even in States where surgical abortions are now prohibited, contraceptives can still be used for birth control."
"Contraceptives are an attempted way to stop the babies birth:
https://youtu.be/EcQSwtMR55E
Even in States where 'surgical abortions' are not allowed, 'contraceptives' can be used to control births."
"so rape victims have to keep there baby
or the college student"
"I see this Republican insanity over a woman's right to choose, biting them in the arse, soon."
"Losing rights to kill a baby and shutting down gay parades , finally God is getting His justice."
"WHAT ABOUT ILL WOMEN WHO WOULD DIE WHILE GIVING BIRTH
WHAT ABOUT RAPE
WHAT ABOUT INCEST
WHAT ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS

God that is why Canada is better."
"what happens when a child gets raped is that child supposed to keep that baby if they get pregnant huh? you can't seriously get a child to give birth and lose their childhood because of a man thinking they own OUR BODY I'm am not sorry this is an insult to humanity even the men are thinking this is PATHETIC. or even a woman that gets raped and can't keep the baby due to religious beliefs. OUR BODY, OUR CHOICE!!"
AMAZING ABORTION IS MURDER
When the ugliest women support abortion even though they never had sex
"I think it's great that all these old white rich men are making decisions for these poor black young women, since they are the majority who get abortions, mainly due to financial and health reasons."
"Heatbeat, fingers curl,
A hand out to stay the blade,
Why care, inhuman?"
"Heatbeat, fingers curl,
A hand out to stay the blade,
Why care, inhuman?"
"Democrats kill babies, vote Republican!"
I’m not american but people should know that abortions will always exist now those decisions  will just cause more unsafe abortions that will harm both the woman and the unborn child. Let’s not forget bringing unwanted children that may grow up criminals and do damage to society and increase crimes rate. 👏 thanks and congrats to boomers for making more genius ideas to ruin this world once again.
Get these religious fucks the fuck out of here. God tells them not to judge but they sit on earth doing nothing but judging.
"So does that mean men can't have a vasectomy either?? Or are Republicans just really after women 🤔
The sperm in our scrotum is a living organism before it even gets to an female's egg 🤷🏾‍♂️"
LETS HOPE THEY BAN ALL ABORTIONS EVERYWHERE.WOMEN CANT BE LEFT RO MAKE THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS.THEY JUST ARENT SMART ENOUGH
I think it's fine .There should be a few exceptions tho like for rape and incest .They also need to take care of the unwanted babies properly
This ban is like a christian religious law...since when does the governments do this
cool
"In South Korea, women can have abortions anytime for no reason.
Korean women can abort even after six months of pregnancy and need no reason.
Korean women say That's what the U.S. does
Is it right?"
Abortion is evil plain and simple stop having sex if you can't handle a kid and if your raped give it up for adoption do not kill babies it's evil no matter how u look at it.
Crime is going to skyrocket in those states. By people who literally should never have been born. What do these pro-lifers think was going to happen
Why do men always care about the things that wasn’t born yet lol

"Republicans are pandering to evangelicals, America's Taliban in order to widen the base from just white supremacists. the separation of church and state has fallen. Evangelicals believe in the biblically ordained submission of women. So now women in red states are being stripped of their rights to bodily autonomy and contraception, as part of the plan to subjugate and control women. The country is going off the rails to a mideval puritanical theocracy. Vote blue that's all we can do. Republicans are vicious misogynists!"
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe"
"Many bioethicists warned the ""left"" over the past year that supporting Vaccine Mandates will open the door for other forms of medical totalitarianism. Now we witness the takedown of Roe. Next we will see other examples of medical totalitarianism like Crispr or Nauralink being mandatory for the 4th industrial revolution. The ""left"" is consistently simple minded and unstrategic in their analysis.  So embarrassing."
"Ad the District of Columbia to your list where abortion is at risk.  There’s no state government, it is the jurisdiction of the Congress and if Republicans win the midterms they will outlaw abortion in DC…while sending the congressional aids they routinely rape to New York for abortions"
Abortion shouldn’t be banned it should still be legal under certain circumstances if the baby isn’t going to survive if the mother can’t physically have the baby safely if the pregnancy is threatening the mother’s life or if the pregnancy was the result of rape those are real legitimate reasons for abortion where the mother would actually need it.
Finally
not your body not your right who are you to take someone elses life and im athiest so dont get me with no religious bs
Love will end abortion. I hope you guys know that the pro life movement helps women who are struggling to take care of their baby.
🤣🤣🤣 you lot can't kill babies no more .... Goooooood
"✨✨✨The FBI is taking away people’s judgment and controlling pregnancy rates.  This is one way to do as they please to the people.  The FBI is targeting young women and have been for a very long time.  This is one strong way to derail their lives causing them to have a problem.  The FBI ruined mine repeatedly.  They chased me down after college making sure I wouldn’t have what I planned and had many attempts of set ups for a fall in life.  Individuals aren’t what they use to be.  Their frontal cortex of their brain has been picked apart in many such ways through some government mind control where this effects their judgment.  Judgment is hindered, which can lead to many other types of instances, such as pregnancy.  When the prefrontal cortex is disrupted mental illnesses develop, such as schizophrenia.  We had many cases of schizophrenia in the past two decades.  ✨✨✨The FBI does not want to see young women succeed.  They like to make them fat and ruin their lives.  People might not care for these individuals cause they were brainwashed not to at first.  But, if the FBI targets you as a women it is very uncomfortable to live.  And you have many downfalls.  You just have to act like you don’t care about all the horrible things they cause and keep going.✨✨🐇"
Is there any exception in regards of rape victims ???
"Welp let this be the last moment abortion to be ban cause this day modern women have no morality to kill thier own child even if its came from incest and rape which that its a crime to murder and rape. 

People are blinded to thier sin of pride, lust and anger.  May God forgive thief soul cause they don't know what they we're doing."
It was never a Constitutional Right. Please report the news and not opinion.
"When you speak much about speaking on women's right and right to choose, consider these too; 
1.)Like toddler or adolescent, the terms embryo and fetus do not refer to nonhumans, but to humans at particular stages of development.
2) No matter how much better it sounds, “terminating a pregnancy” is still terminating a life.
3) The one-time choice of abortion robs someone else of a lifetime of choices and prevents him from ever exercising his rights.
Exceptional case must be dealt with separate law, like medical emergencies, rape etc. Abortion just because convenience should be stopped by law.."
I am so glad this finally came through this is truly amazing f Abortion
“My body my choice” lol the baby ain’t your body hun just becuase there’s a long tube connecting you to it.
All ima say is make the best choice and don’t have fucking sex! You don’t like this abt abortion getting banned in states don’t have sec don’t fuck each other and rapers need to stop to maybe tapers get the fact that we! That we struggles we are just incubators we carry babies for 9 months right and left women carry’s babies cmon bro just don’t have sex and be cautious on your surroundings m..
"Remember ladies...when you are 6 weeks pregnant,
You can now...

So y’all out here trying to ban abortion but yet don’t wanna take care of all these foster kids in the system ohhh ok🙃
America land of freedom. But we FORBID you.
Ban abortion? Why not increase tax on meat because it against constitution. And most Conservative party(Christian) should fast on Wednesday and Friday forbid to eat meat. I bet that those Republicans out of control to eat meat on these days because they only interest in politic!!!!

GOD ALMIGHTY BLESS THE ANTI-ABORTION TEAM. IT'S high time to stand firm against this decades of murdering innocent helpless babies. U.S. will thank them when time to come face to face with your GOD CREATOR who hates killing innocent babies.
"All abortionists and those who wants abortion should have been aborted by their own mothers. Then,no one would be killing their own  innocent helpless unborn babies and make excuses to sexual immorality.no brainer. FREEDOM HAS A HIGHER LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY.MATURE HONEST  PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS PRINCIPLE VERY WELL."
"interesting fact:     
 In 2005, the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UN HRC) ordered Peru to compensate a woman (known as K.L.) for denying her a medically indicated abortion; 
this was the first time a United Nations Committee had held any country accountable for not ensuring access to safe, legal abortion, and the first time the committee affirmed that abortion is a human right.[39] K.L. received the compensation in 2016.[39]
 In the 2016 case of Mellet v Ireland, the UN HRC found Ireland's abortion laws violated International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights because Irish law banned abortion in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities."

"Just because a state bans abortion, don't think for a moment that doctors won't continue to perform them. In the world of medicine, it's all about coding a procedure. The use an alternate procedural code to bypass insurance companies who will pay for one procedure (deemed medically necessary) or another code that isn't. I worked in a hospital in the medical reports department and noticed a rise in a procedure called a D&C. After reading through the pathology reports, I figured out the hospital was doing abortions."
What Are The 11 States ?
First of all that was not a constitutional right there is no place in the Constitution where it says abortion but a lot of Americans are having their second amendment rights in French to bond by these red flag laws by the communist Democrats and the absolute trader Republicans that should be kicked out of the party
"See YouTube don't want to admit that anything that says jwoke to the left gets 10,000 thumbs down and only one thumbs up and anything to the right gets $20, 000 thumbs up and maybe two thumbs down"
Ban the damn thing everywhere
"—— We need to work together, give better sex education on period of ovulation and when the reproductive system is most likely able to conceive. Social media also has to stop telling women that being pregnant and having kids is disturbing. We need to help more women and men with mental illnesses too. Miscarriages and deadly ectopic pregnancies are not abortions under the law, you can’t compare them to actual abortions, where the mom intentionally end the life. Some women actually don’t like that people compare or mix their miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy with abortion. It is not and should not be about winning something, but about saving the mother and the kid’s life. Abortion was never safe, and as higher risk then actually giving birth. True that banning abortions is not a concluding solution, since even if it is ban in certain states women can still go to other states, and people are actually creating organizations to help these women get abortions. And some on TikTok are also telling them to use hangers and papaya seeds to end the innocent life. 


—— We should work on the base of the issue if we truly want that the baby and the mom live and have a safe environment. Of course we can’t change everything, but help the people that need and want to be help and try our best. But in order to do that people need to also help pro life charities, that are not represented enough. I also believe that some pro lifers need to be and stay humble, truly care about the life and be dispose and prepared to help these women. Everyone should. People also have to stop saying that helping a women make a better decision, is wrong. Some of them don’t even know that it’s alive. We have to stop letting social media control us and just agree like that with something, just because everyone else does and without even knowing more about the subject. Pro lifers need to stop calling women who had abortions murderers or killers, it doesn’t help. We have to keep calm and truly advocate for what we say, with care and truth. In front and behind cameras or people. Addiction, is also a base of the issue that can lead to abortions, we should give more care to them and people will also have to want to change and work hard to become better. Poverty. Charities need more founding, to help homeless mothers. We have to do what we can, to save both life, republicans or democrats."
So happy the murder rate will be reduced in 11 States.
i never agreed with thanos more than i do now
The fact men were fighting shows the state is Wack!!
Im glad its banned

Chain Of Command. The President, The Congress,  Senate, The Doctors, The Attorney General's, The Recipient The Mother. All

Could have Been Me; But Grandma Wouldn't Let It Happen. We Would Both Live Or We Both Die. My Grandmother Would Have Been My Due Process And Equal Protection Of The Law.
Under The 14th Amendment Of The United States Constitution. The Babies Should Have A Fair Trial Before A Death Sentence Is Executed On It After All The Babies Is A Person Made By Two People.
These Mother, Are Yelling To Kill Their Babies; Like The Crowd Yelled For Jesus Crucifixion, And In The Early Days Of America When The
Lynch Mob Hange You Without Fairness Of The American Constitution.

In The Womb For Nine Months And You Didn't Drown
And He Made You A Human Being, In His Likeness.
You In His House. Breathing His Air, Drinking His Water, Eating His Plants And Animals And Living Under His Temperature. He's The Same God; Who Brought His People Out Of Egypt Into The Promise Land. Life And Death Is In The
Hand Of GOD. Stop Killing His Babies. Satan Lied To You, Like He Did To Adam And Eve.
Satan Had You Thinking You Could Kill God's Babies With A Law From The Government.
Well Will The Government Protect Your Soul From Hell
Can They Pass A Law For That. Answer. No Satan Tricked You Women For Fifty Years, Going In To The Years Of Slavery In America. This Time Its Self Enslavement.
God Have Mercy. America Repent And Beg God's Forgiveness.

"Let's blacks makes it,  we need safety"
Blame the dumocrats ...... Jane roe lied about being ganged raped and they paid her.... And they pushed for late term abortions .... And they arguments are outdated their from the late sixty ...... Before google.  Sell phones internet ultrasounds ... Medicines that can save the life of premature born and low birth weight . premature babies in 1970 survived 5 % now its up to 75 percent ...dumocrats are just using outdated argument ..... We have ultrasound !!!!!!! We can see the the baby one to weeks .. Their pushed for late term abortions that was that was the last straw ..... Im talking 7 8 9 months
Why y’all got that women in the red suit reading a script for y’all
Murder is not a right just because it’s convenient to you.
"life must be respected in all of its forms. Whether in the womb or outside womb.
It's not a wise decision to promote abortion laws by raising the issue or rape, medical emergencies and teenage pregnancies etc. Real truth is 90% of abortion kills healthy viable babies just for the comfort of couples or profit of hospitals or companies."
"This is what progress looks like, I’m not American but this shows that they are really getting somewhere"
If it takes 50 years to take it back that’s a lot of lives saved 🙏🏼
This is TERRIBLE. Some women’s lives are threatened due to pregnancy. And those babies die too. Would you rather save a life or kill two?
Oklahoma rules!
"God bless those states, I am so happy. The happiest I’ve been, we have stopped those baby killers, child murderers! These people are real hero’s #godblessthem"
I'm thinking travel bans for anyone who is pregnant could be next to prevent crossing state borders where abortion is still legal.
There will be a mass exodus out of those states
"Hallelujah!!! Abortion is nothing but murder and child sacrifice. We will continue to push back on this murder excuse...bring the fight on, we are ready for you too, both spiritually and naturally. Saying this as a proud believer in the Lord Jesus Christ"
Way to go TN!☺️ Overturn P8!
"Wow
Usa

Wow"
How sad that the important thing about taking rights away from your women is the next election.
"i find it funny how westerners argue about democracy all the time and when the majority side wins, they cant handle it and ""protest"" againts their decision. you call it abortion, others call it murder. it wouldn't even be a problem if people didnt have sex before marriage."
"Abortion especially on demand is one of the most demented yet necessary things in this world. I consider women who decided to keep their babies to be greater than those that didn’t, but once again it is their choice.  In an ideal world no one should and will never have an abortion out of their own free will. Since abortion will be hard to criminalize and I doubt that it ever will, it should only be allowed up to a certain point and in the earliest possible time if done so electively."
Right? Killing is right? Instead be mature and make a serious choice before getting pregnant(life is not a joke or casual stuff)whether you kill 5 year child or unborn child it’s the same thing murder.
if you personally dont like abortion dont get abortion. i dont see why it bothers you what people do with their body and personal life choices.
dumbest shit i ever heard
Killing babies is okay!!!
I'm angry I can't kill babys!!!! NOOOOOOOO
39 to go
I mean America was never great. I petty the people there
*Casually drinking liberal tears*
"I can’t wait to vote Republican this time around because it’s insane to think the the obviously failing Democratic Party will do anything for my people. 95 percent of native black Americans whose ancestors died and bled while building this nation got nothing in return! Out of the 60,000,000 babies that Plan Parenthood murdered 1/3 of them are native Black babies! Margret Sanger designed this to solve the “ problem” of annihilation of disabled children before they enter the world and had a chance, and Black children because she deemed our lives worthless because we are born non white! We all know that because white will be the minority in ethnicity in this county that they are not killing their children at alarming rates! These clinics are in our neighborhoods with the full intention of making it easy for silly young women who can’t seem to pop a pill, say no or use some form of birth control! Our people need to wake up! The Biden/ Harris ticket has been a nightmare for our people and where are the Reparations? They use the Race card, play on your emotions and tell you that they are your friend! They don’t care anything about Black women so it’s time to wake up! Stop lying these well to do White women are pisses because in all their privileges they have nothing else to do! Cry about this or that when their “ many rights” are being shifted but the truth is the mass numbers of Black women need Reparations maybe then they could afford houses, day care or a nanny to keep their children! Many of our young women need to stop using murder as a means of birth control"
"Anortion is a crime not a right. I’m glad they finally prohibited it. Also abortion leads to less population. Look at Arab people, they are the hugest race in this world. Keep your race, don’t reduce it. Another thing, if you are with abortion, don’t even start being pregnant. Have sex only with your husband. Don’t have sex with other men, get pregnant and have STDs then you say it’s your right to kill a child!!! You are afraid of having a baby, don’t have sex till you are ready to have a baby cuz sex leads to pregnancy. Sex not for fun. You are horny, go masturbate or have sex with toys or watch porn and use your imagination, don’t do stupid thing then you say you don’t want to be a mom. If you don’t want to get burnt, don’t be close to fire. You don’t want to get drown in a sea, don’t swim till you are ready and you want it. Glad they illegalize this crime. It’s a crime not a right. No one has a right to kill a fetus. Killing was never a right. Just cuz that fetus was inside your body, doesn’t mean it’s your right to kill it. Exactly like having a child, you abuse it, CPS take it from you. You have another human being inside you, it means it has a right to live then this fetus after she or he gets born and become an adult can decide if they want to keep living or not. You still don’t want your baby, send it for adoption bunch of women wish they get pregnant and have babies. Just talk to the nurse and let her find the baby a mom to have it once it gets born. It happens in Middle East. If the mom has too many kids and can’t have any more and she hit pregnant she gives it to her sister who wants more to adopt it."
Oklahoma is now where the baphomet statue is. That’s the first thought I had when he mentioned children. Children are next to the statue. I started my cycle around 13 some start earlier. The government/states continuously fail female victims of all kinds of heinous crimes but to not being given a choice? Pedophiles not being charged more or even at all… kids possible being victims. All kinds of things could come from this
"Judaism is the world's oldest monotheistic religion, dating back nearly 4,000 years. They say that Life begins at birth. ISLAM says that life begins at 140 days. Both have abortions exceptions for the health of the mother, rape and incest. Republicans say ""We don't follow Jewish law"" But the rules against GAYS and everything else they deem deviant comes from the OLD testament That's JEWISH LAW.. Which only proves that MAGA HAT EVANGELICALS  just make shit up..."
"The only reason abortion is being banned is MONEY. It costs $10,000 to have a baby in a hospital in America. Babies = Money.  America is enslaved.  'Nuff said."
I feel I am back in the 70's...
African American women who rely on abortion sounds crazy. That’s why the black population is still the minority.
"The joke is abortion was secretly a way of keeping the leftist population down.
Who is the sexy black woman at the beginning ?"
there never was a constitutional right giving you the right to kill another human being that was the product of your irresponsible sex. it is actually hard to believe that people thought they had the right to do this. you f****** ghouls.
"Non-constitutional right, good riddance e"
The pro life movement wins !
Mandatory vasectomies .. life begins at Ejaculation !!!
MANDATORY VASECTOMIES!!!
If you don’t want a baby don’t have unprotected sex!
We want civil war if this isn't solved soon to give us our life back
"It's not unclear oklahoma bans travel for it already,  they're set to murder us. Alabama and Texas already refuse rights to women to live by denying them D&C procedures and ectopic pregnancy removal there's articles on it already"
U should have the right to choose but other should have the right to scrutinize.. freedom of speech baby
I don’t care about y’all bannin abortions but why yall banning birth controls nd plans Bs im Confuse
No they didn't. In the past few years the media has started existing in an alternative reality.
"Before exporting democracy to other countries, apply democracy to your home."
They never had this when was little girl
Sad to kill babies
"Both extreme positions (banning all abortions and allowing abortion up to moment of birth) do not have majority support. Allowing abortion until the detection of a heartbeat is NOT ""effectively banning"" abortion. Allowing abortion in the first trimester is NOT effectively banning abortion. Allowing abortion up to the moment of birth is gross. That is the killing of a full-term baby. Most people support limited abortion. The media is lying about this issue."
"YEAH!!!!! Roe Wade is dead !!!!!     Women's rights???!!! How about the rights of all the women these women murdered !!!  We women have plenty of reproductive rights --- right to decide to have sex, right ti decide what form of birth control to use, right to decide to keep the baby or place the baby for adoption.  What about  women's RESPONSIBILITY to the child they CHOSE to create!!!   I am a woman, and i believe abortion is reprehensible!!!  Quite calling it women's rights. Most women 
( who know what what the horror of abortion truely is) find abortion UNCONSCIONABLE !!!!"
So six People literally determined for millions that if raped a woman cannot abort Lordy lordy
Some one abort the Supreme Court or make a meme of it
What else would you expect from a developing country like USA
Thay about to make the childe and the woman life a living hell the kid will get out into a adoption centre left alone the woman will either sucide or  die while giving birth .good job USA
Good.

WE AS WOMEN ARE NOT GOD MYSELF AS A WOMAN I HAVE 6 kids 3 are my step kids 2 are mine and my blood middle child got adopted by a wonderful family that tried for 10 years to have a baby and failed WE AS WOMEN SHOULD NOT HAVE THE ROGHT TO PLAY GOD YOU KNOW HOW MANY WOMEN CANT HAVE KIDS OF THEIR OWN AND HOW MANY GAY AND TRANSGENDER WANT CHILDREN AND A FAMILY BE PRO ADOPTION AND DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE INSTEAD OF BEING RUN AROUND SALLYS LOOKNG FOR AN EASY OUT WITH MURDERING A CHILD
Pro choice is something I’m glad to see get banned is a great thing for me and y’all that are fighting for pro choice are an honest embarrassment of women PERIOD
"Its one unfair judgement. Whoever made this decision, not wise to lead the future generation. Protect children? how about children who were rapped and got pregnant? What happen to family planning too. Not a good decision."
"Do fetuses have the right to life?

The argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong.
I will simply assume, instead of proving, that your murder is seriously wrong.
I will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder.
Finally, I will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issues to which this analysis of abortion ethics may lead.
The symmetries arising from the analysis of the main arguments on both sides of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult.
Consider the following standard argument against abortion: Fetuses are both human and alive. People have the right to life.
Therefore, fetuses have the right to life. Of course, women have the right to control their own body, but the right to life goes beyond a woman's right to control her own body.
Therefore, abortion is wrong.
The fetus' right to life does not include his right to use someone else's body to preserve his life.
However, an opponent of abortion may point out that a woman's right to use her body does not include her right to end someone else's life in order to do what she wants with her body.
In response, one might argue that a pregnant woman's right to control her body is not much, if it is wrong, to take any action that ends the life of the fetus within her.
However, an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus' right to life does not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses.
The consequence of all these symmetries seems to be a stalemate.
But if we have an attitude, then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of rights, a fetal right to life versus a woman's right to control her body.
One could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control one's own body in the case of abortion, because the loss of one's life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control one's own body, a respect for nine months.
Therefore, the right to life prevails over the right to control one's own body and abortion is wrong."
"All these people who are pro abortion should have been aborted, waste of air"
"Bro who cares, it’s not a real human yet let a woman abort it if she wants. I don’t understand why it’s illegal."
Boo hoo yall wont be able to get away with murder anymore
Move to California and watch your life go to shit. I'll give you leftist a ride
"Can someone tell me why tho? Like why did they just decide to get together and take away this right??

 Was it out of the blue or was this a work in progress over the past couple weeks, months or years..

 it just seems outta no where. Like even the president doesn't agree w this decision so idk. Ik I sound dumb but I'm just out the loop under a rock lmao. Just seems stupid imo. 

Takes up time, money, resources, causes strikes and riots.. it only makes space for a fat mess tbh. So much for ""land of the free""..

even if u don't agree with abortions the choice should still be yours to make.

Hec, this world is fastracked towards overpopulation eventually and this don't help that cause either."
Fake news it says nothing in the constitution about abortion
"a woman carries a child at the cost of her health and future, so only every woman can decide whether to have an abortion or not, and not the state. by banning abortions, you will only put women at risk, abortions will be done anyway. a woman is more important than an embryo. and by the way, at the stage of abortion, someone is not yet a living being."
"Thank you Jesus Christ our blessed Lord for hearing our prayers and answered .Amen . The spirit and the Bride say ,Come Lord Come,amen."
Yes sir
"Woho , finally:) No more easy killing in womb 🙌"
White have more abortions than blacks period so they just trying to save there own but using blacks for an excuses
Im surprised there are so many abortion rate in America and they are banning abortion … God bless America. Guess people need to take more responsibility in having sex!
and rape victims ????? they live in hell and she doesn't have a consent what the actual ....???
"Good job. We've saved innocent lives now. Next is, lets get every state in the US to ban baby murder. God's army will always prevail. Then finally we can start imposing new processive laws like no dating in school until 24 or until young adults can prove their financial stability to take care of a new life they eager to create. Fact is, the more people are educated, the less sex they crave. The problem is, most highly educated and smart people dont want create children to pass on their superior genes while most lowly educated and not so smart people always want sex to create more children. Hope we can address this issue as well."
Good! Ban Democrats next!
U should study Indian constitution...
American constitution is too much rigid....we Indians are 400 ahead than American constitutional rights...
Oh excuse me your all atheists so God has no bearing on your pitiful lives OK got it
Uh well hmmmm God says sex outside of MARRIAGE IS A SIN so what part of that don't u dummies understand??? If you make wrong decisions then pay the consequences or just keep it zipped up and locked geeez what infantiles you call yourselves adults sure lololol
Also you can only adopt at 21 but a 12 year old is capable of raising a baby!
Big up to backstreet abortion and adoption
"Okay so why aren’t men getting their ability to pass sperm blocked  until they are able to conceive, notice how women do all the hard work but it’s never the man who has to make any sacrifices. Women should go on strike and not go out their houses and anywhere near men and kill the population off :) see how they like that"
The funny thing is liberals want to ban guns because of latest killings. But want to be a able to kill thousands by abortion. So it you kill a woman who is pregnant you can't be charged with double homicide. Right because the fetus isn't human by liberals standards.🤷
Think of all the black babies that will be saved
Each state is like a country in Europe
"I got one for you CNN

Res. 261. Section 1. Neither the United States nor any State shall deprive any human being, from the moment of conception, of life without due process of law; nor deny to any human being, from the moment of conception, within its jurisdiction, the equal protection of the laws.

Now I understand your not very versed in the constitutional law of our lan and that’s ok I’m here to help. Basically under law the fetus is it’s own separate entity from the mother getting all of our rights and freedoms from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg. I’m sorry to tell you it’s not your body and the only abortions protected under law is do to rape and possibility of death"
I hate the influence of religion on politics.

Ohio republican lawmakers said 12 year old rape victims will be forced to have babies. Please keep you 12 year olds away from Ohio lawmakers they are sick men and they are making laws to help themselves and child predators.
"Hmmmm so women can we need a rule that says,”Men needs to get castrated so women doesn’t get pregnant!! abortion problem solve. Or have the kid and drop them off at the pro-life doorstep. The right to judge does not belong to Humans. Ye without sin cast the first stone. We are all flawed. How many of these pro-life speak out against the death penalty? Govern yourself accordingly."
"Most complaining so far seem to be from liberals, people on the left, but basically states who want to cam just decide that you can abort even in the 9 months soooooo... Should not right people complain also for this potential atrocity ?"
"Guess you better be responsible.  Keep your legs closed.  I’m not imposing my religion.  I’m not religious but I think abortion for birth control is an abomination.  And I live in a state where enough people agree.  If you don’t like it, frame an argument and win over a majority to change opinion.  Otherwise, keep a rainy day fund to get scraped in California, ho bag."
"Why do pro=lifers still eat eggs for breakfast? I got billions of unanswerable questions, but I am just lobbing one to show you live in a world with 0 consistency."
Why they ban abortion?
"“I could feel the baby being torn from my insides. It was really painful....Three-quarters of the way through the operation I sat up....In the cylinder I saw the bits and pieces of my little child floating in a pool of blood. I screamed and jumped up off the table....I just couldn't stop throwing up....”

I know two people who were scheduled to be aborted- one was adopted by the social worker and the other’s parent missed her appointment. One of them has founded a charity that has helped over one million people. I wonder how many others were aborted that could’ve brought positive change to this hateful world.

"It’s okay to kill little in school with guns ,"
"I REQUEST ZELENSKY 💙 OR PRESIDENT  PUTIN💚 or any christian in the world ❤️ TO ALWAYS THINK  THESE ,,,A,B,C,D,E AND Fs in your life , for a great future 👍
God bless you
Logic of  joy or peace in Life is very lies in a very moral knowledge of  life style.
That's as below
Everytime or every moment  or always when you do not love  ( careful that someone watches you ) the world ( eyes flesh lusts and pride )
You have lot of 
Peace 
Courage
A) God’s Children have no fear of death 💀 
But we will not die unless it is God’s will👍👍(great peace  in times of diseases or fearful journnies in life battle ,)
B) We shouldn’t be worrying about anything a lot because everything works together for good for those who love GOD ( marriage or death  or any good or humiliation or a great permanent honour,)
C) we must sacrifice our life at least for our children
The world is not  life  to us 
Imagine will a father be happy if he gets some privileges but not his children 👶 
Never 
So something if you don’t get 
Or something dangerous happens to you deliberately is for good 
Because we live for a fellow Christians or a christian family and children and overall for the  kingdom of God in earth ( government)
D) we must know that
Our heart ❤️ is filled with fear and guilty conscience for many reasons
1) for not following according to 1 john 2:-16
2) our unbelief ( jesus could not do Many miracles because of their harden heart and unbelief)
3) Our blind eye ( we don't avoid or cut our relationship with a bad CHRISTIAN,,) towards a bad companionship,
E) IF FOD DOESN'T COMFORT TOU WITH A BIBLE VERSE ,,,WE CAN NOT KEEP IT AS OUR POSSESSION,,
Invite shames to you  Before( you ) expecting a miracle we forget brotherhood and PRAYERS ( God will be glorified amongst brothers and church ,)
So tell your problems to the congregations MEDIAS ,people or governments,( but miracle is God's 😁😉😁)( In any situation what we can do we must should do it  never expect God to do what you should do)( Honour God respect God )
But life is God 
For example 
Lazarus death 
The news reached Jesus ( this means to prayer  and brotherhood )
Rolling down of the stone Take away the stone ( take off the grave clothes) John Gospel chapter 11;39 and 45 
Untie the bandages,,
For example
We got some shops in the middle of a city here ,
But managing to keep it with respect as a owner is very difficult,
But God comforted me with a verse 1 corinthians 1:-31
This shops to us are from our hindu ancestors so though God is helping us to keep it but we get lot of insults ,
Every time when I get a problem I pray God and go according to his counsel,,,
29 so that no one may boast before him.(BG) 30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus,(BH) who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness,(BI) holiness(BJ) and redemption.(BK) 31 Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”[d](BL)
So what 1 john 2:-16 
Says about not to love 
Lusts of the eyes ( because people or enemies watch it make it a issue as sin ,this we must be careful everytime at home and outside holy ,it means do not love sights ,do not turn back and see ,do not listen to what they speak even,)
Lusts of flesh 
Pride of life ( insults)
You must know that there are TEMPTATIONS common to all men ( PAUL TO CORINTHIANS ABOUT SINS OF ISRAELITES IN WILDERNESS,)
F) 
NEVER FORGET ALK ARE SINNERS
ECCLESIASTES 7
G) ALWAYS KNOW BA FACE OUR LIFE IS ETERNAL
NOT IN THIS EARTH,,
BUT HERE TOO GOD CAN RAISE HONOUR YOUR HEAD ,
Philippines 4:-8
Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things.

Anyone who did vote for him, or does so in the future has dooming your nation back to being an unmitigated failed experiment where half if not more of its citizens will see rights eroded away more ans more."
So the hand maids tale is actually what those Christian’s and republicans are aiming for. You can’t say this wasn’t obvious.
"I'm just wondering if the people on the other side of my computer have any idea how much they are going to suffer from here on out? It's more than just a slap in our faces, it's a violation of our civil rights."
"But it should not be decided at the states ""Through the legislators and reps"" as some are saying. It should be dicided at the state level through the people via a direct vote in ballot initiatives ""do you support abortion? Yes or no? Governors should not be deciding for everyone because lets be honest you can have more individuals in support of abortion, or gun laws, or whatever at the state level. However, gerrymandering can allow a republican like Ron Desantis to win and hence a enacting laws that the majority of the people do not want. All the republicans from the top down for decades have been passing these gerrymandered voting maps. I have never seen a more maniacally unfair, cheating, dishonest, group of so called Christians in my life."
It has always been evil to kill babies. Women’s rights? The unborn babies also have rights. They have the right to live. Jesus is king. Jesus will have the victory at the end.
"Abortion is wrong. Abortion is murder.
Anything I can do to help make ALL abortion illegal in EVERY state, I will do.  This is worth fighting for."
It's a slap in the face to all society that Nancy pelosi's husband put people's lives in danger because he chose to drink and drive. This woman needs to go hide in a hole and never come out
Yet these hypocrites didn't want the rest of the world to have bodily autonomy with their vaccines
"Onlyfans, instagram, ticktock, twiter """" models """" and cheating wifes are not longer able to hide their irresponsible acts aborting innocent lives. What a shame... They cant keep selling their bodies on social media or hide their affairs to their husbands.. Now they have to be very very carefully.
We finally coming to sense in earth with what we doing. I am happy this has happened 👌🏼👍🏼"
"How long has murder become a right?
Fuck feminism."
I am so happy I don’t live in america….
ban pride and save peoples brain cells
"I come from a ex communist country where abortions were banned for years. I tell you this, many women have died, many children were left in the dumbster and nobody was happy about that. If in my country you try to ban it against all the people would go to the streets, no exceptions."
"Run these slaughter houses out of your states! They are responsible for 60,000,000 black babies deaths since 1973. F ROE!"
🙏🏻👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This men who caused us woman to lose our rights is clearly letting us know woman are in danger. Thanks
Afghanistan our America real smart a holes
Abortion is murder. Glad U.S.A is waking up to sanity
US women : just Make LOVE Not Babies...killing fetus is a human rights violation & must be punish..
"If somebody that's doesn't want to be a mom , I'm fine with that , if their pregnant and don't want be a mom , I'm not going to judge you"

Constitutional right to kill their offspring. Poor pitiful bunch of feminazi’s might have to go back in the closet. I call that a breath of fresh air. Poor babies. Maybe they might decide to plan having a child rather then use abortion for birth control. Sick bunch of miss guided minds.
Sadly it was only 11 😔

Murdering your own child is NOT a constitutional right.
Here comes  the next migration to free states.
Why ban abortion? I dont get it
"A question for everyone who supports abortion - what is the fault of the child and the generations that are killed??  Is their fault their weakness and inability to defend themselves??  If you do not want the child, there are those who dream about this child that you are killing, make other families adopt him instead of killing him, or not carry him in the first place!!!"
There will be restoration of truths to America.  God  listens to His people. Unbelievers don't   understand. Everywhere there is life shows proof of God. Open your eyes!
"Will banning abortion, stop it? Or will women turn to unsavory and unsanitary methods?  Is there FREE sterilisation or birth control methods in America? How about trying to prevent or reduce  the need for killing first?"

i think i know why they did it. i had nothing to do with abortion. it has all to to with getting the house and senate back. since they cant win in a fair election they banned abortion so democrats in swingstates will move out of it to a democrat state. therefor that state will become red again. they get more votes and more power that way. its a long run process but i think thats there endplay. maybe look into that CNN. just an opinion of me.

Its not a constitutional right. Show us where it says that in the constitution
Abortions is evil only the devil's children get abortions
I just want to know who's going to take care of all these unwanted children it's going to happen and it's not going to be far away is the supreme Court going to step up or is this just going to be orphanages like they're used to be all over the state's
Next: prohibition of all contraceptives… Mark my words… there‘s only a very thin line left between the conservatives and the taliban…
It is not a constitutional right! All states should ban abortion!!
Finally no more kill babes
Abortion is just like inviting someone over to your house and then killing them.

This is an easily win a bow argument for Democrats you propose abortion and you play some limits on it that’s it give it a timeframe that’s all you gotta do it’s not hard it’s not complicated you come up with a time frame. Don’t make it indefinite but you can include the rate for a woman to have an abortion can you set an limit a date within the pregnancy. Once they do that you presented as the federal standard you wish to employ in every Democrat should get behind it even if you want more you say I can agree with this. After that you ask the Republicans for their standard because most Americans believe a woman should have the right to an abortion. If you can present some argument and then ask your competitor 2% there and it’s fractured at best you can win votes
JUST GO AND VOTE IN MASSIVE NUMBERS. #voteblue

"Here is something the Evangelicals can really sink their teeth in to. They believe that a human life begins at conception. If that is so and it is also so that every person has a soul then every conception has a soul. It is a scientific fact ( look it up ) that in the  normal course of human reproduction approximately 74% of conceptions  do not survive to become a full term baby. For Evangelicals then in heaven 74% of the souls there will have never had a life. They instead were conceived, died and then just moved into heaven. For the Evangelicals and now for the rest of us based on the SCOTUS decision for every million souls in heaven 750,000 will have never had a consciousness in life. To everyone but Evangelicals that concept is absurd."

Awesome!!!!  Let's get it to 50-50 states.  Murder should not be legalized in any nation!!!
"People who were given the bless of life by their mothers, now they are against giving life to others innocents babies, because for them it represents a big business.

"It should be more than just one woman who chooses whether to end a life or not. Abortion shouldn't be outright banned, but it should be a community decision, not one based on women's liberty. What about the rights of the father and grandparents? A woman's body is her own to decide upon, but a child's life isn't! Women are free to decide whether or not they get pregnant. That's already far more freedom than a father gets. There are plenty of preventative measures out there to make that choice easy enough.

I do believe in a woman's right to decide, but too many women use this right irresponsibly and selfishly."

"From another post > I'm not pro-murdering babies.
I'm pro-Becky who found out at her 20-week anatomy scan that the infant she had been so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organs.
I'm pro-Susan who was sexually assaulted on her way home from work, only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later.
I'm pro-Theresa who haemorrhaged due to a placental abruption, causing her parents, spouse, and children to have to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or her unborn child.
I'm pro-little Cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11-year-old body isn't mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal.
I'm pro-Melissa who's working two jobs just to make ends meet and has to choose between bringing another child into poverty or feeding the children she already has because her spouse walked out on her.
I'm pro-Brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially, emotionally, or physically able to raise a child.
I'm pro-Emily who went through IVF, ending up with SIX viable implanted eggs requiring selective reduction to ensure the safety of her and a SAFE number of foetuses.
I'm pro-Jessica who is FINALLY getting the strength to get away from her physically abusive spouse only to find out that she is carrying the monster's child.
I'm pro-Vanessa who went into her confirmation appointment after YEARS of trying to conceive only to hear silence where there should be a heartbeat.
I'm pro-Lindsay who lost her virginity in her sophomore year with a broken condom and now has to choose whether to be a teenage mom or just a teenager.
I'm pro-Courtney who just found out she's already 13 weeks along, but the egg never made it out of her fallopian tube so either she terminates the pregnancy or risks dying from internal bleeding.
You can argue and say that I'm pro-choice all you want, but the truth is:
I'm pro-life.
Their lives.
Women's lives.
You don't get to pick and choose which scenarios should be accepted. It's not about which stories you don't agree with. It's about fighting for the women in the stories that you do agree with and the CHOICE that was made.
Women's rights are meant to protect ALL women, regardless of their situation!

Walmart and many businesses do not give employees a 40 hour work week just to avoid paying for or offering insurance."
What rights have women lost? These ppl are clowns. Women still have rights. You just can't end the life of a baby. Do these clowns not own a Constitution? Where does it say you have the right to end the life of a baby? The Constitution says not to deprive a person of life.

This is not the Democratic government I grew in this country slowly this country is. Becoming a dictatorship. I so frightened if A redumplican takes over .Its so scary.
People who believe for birth rights you have that always the right to have an abortion has been taken away.that's Not right..
Well abortion is a murder and I'm not religious. Women should not be able to kill their children when they're least protected and face little consequences.
"So please explain....  if the voters go back to this and try and vote it back in. the SOCUS is lifetime and they can over turn it again even if 100% of the people vote it back in.... There is only one way this will change. If the bad apples on the supreme court somehow mysteriously die, then maybe this can be fixed.....Just say'in what everybody is thinking"
Jesus...I never think that US population goes into that bad situation..
Banning abortion will increase the chance of child abuse.
I hope they start killing lawmakers over this...they did it to abortion doctors and bombed clinics when it was legal...So what good for the goose...........

Stop fucking!
Just think about how young some of these justices are. They are definitely not going to retire until republicans are in a position to nominate and affirm another conservative. Unless one is assonated (god please don’t let that happen) then it could be decades before dens got control of court back. Scary to think about.
There sure is a lot of crying from so many people who have claimed to love our democracy until RVW is thrown back into democracy from federal authoritarian rule
50 years of babys not being killed :).
"The courts not conservative.Their blocking 100 years of medical care.Some are sick deformed , incest and rape victims.Its very personal.often tragic."
"So, let me understand, law enforcement who can barely keep up with the number of murders, rapes, home invasions, robberies and cybercrimes are now going to add abortion to their job description? Good luck with that."
These 11 that past this law. Well done. Because the Lord Jesus doesn't love killing at all. Well done. All the states should do this. Because people are wicked killing off so much babies. The Lord Jesus is going to get everyone that abort a baby..
We won 😃
"This new development should teach us many things. First, both men and women need to be responsible when they interact with women. Secondly, STOP voting for politicians that don’t have your interest."

Then they came for gay marriage and 'sodomy', but I said nothing because I wasn't gay.

But then they came for contraceptives, and now I can't have sex before I want children, which basically means no sex before marriage.

"It feels like Democrats owe their people an apology for being bad at their jobs -  they had a long time to codify Roe v Wade, defend a balanced court, get RBG to step donw, etc.  Instead they got played and trounced  “Help undo our faileres!” is not a compelling rallying cry.

Killing babies is wrong! Only the wicked and depraved support it.
I’m devastated! As a rape survivor of a violent rape at 16 I am ready to sue the SCOTUS/GQP for triggering my PTSD and find a way to fight this for my granddaughter. We as women have lost our freedom because of a SCOTUS that was soiled by Moscow Mitch and Don the Con! We are no longer a functioning Democracy!!! Tainted SCOTUS!
Every single civilized country has banned abortion after 15 weeks.
Don’t legislate morality…..it is ripe for hypocrisy.  Separation of church and state including extremism and state.    VOTE
"The deciding Justices have ignored fundamental civil rights guaranteed by our Constitution and years of judicial precedent to advance a politically partisan agenda. There is no denying the fact that this is a direct attack on all women, and Black women stand to be disproportionately impacted by the court's egregious assault on basic human rights. We must all stand up to have our voices heard in order to protect our nation from the further degradation of civil rights protections we have worked so hard to secure. We the People who cares about Abortion and Gay Rights need to register and mobilize voters in what will be the most critical midterm election America has ever faced. If you're not registered to vote or know someone who isn't, now is the moment. This is no time for anyone to sit on the sidelines."" Now is the time for all current and former Dems Politicians, Celebrity Allies, Business Owners and organizations to hold RALLIES and TOWNHALL MEETINGS every weekends in Poor White, Latino, Black and Asians Rural Counties to educate voters on how Dems Policies are improving their livelihood. This will help get Dems Voters Motivate to vote in 2022. So Dems can keep control of the US House and WIN a SUPER MAJORITY in the US Senate with 61 Dems Senators. This is the only way for Dems to pass meaningful Police and Criminal Justice Reforms, Voting Rights, Comprehensive Immigration, Economy, Abortion, Gay Rights and Gun Control."
I bet any money people will move out of these states
"LIES, LIES, LIES:  Dear Mr. Biden, on 6-22-22, I was watching news and there you were on TV, lying about how the Ukraine ""war"" was responsible for the high gasoline prices in the U. S.  Apparently, you actually, expect the public to believe that lie.  What you left out of your lying rhetoric was how you came to that conclusion.  Maybe you can explain just how in the hell, the Ukraine conflict could possibly have an effect on the price of gasoline in the United States  of America, especially since the U. S. is completely self-sufficient in oil production and independent of foreign oil.  Let's get this out in the open so that the American people can learn how just you make things up, as you go along, whatever suits you, like for instance, ""the Russians are invading"", the words that was responsible for getting things stirred up in Ukraine, and which has got us to where we are now in Ukraine.  Such as you stockpiling that drug crazy friend of yours with enough weapons to destroy Ukraine, which he is doing little by little and blaming it on Russia.  Today, it just so happens that I feel like strolling down memory lane.  Lets see now, in order to make Americans forget about all of your fuck-ups, you started with your lying rhetoric about how the ""RUSSIANS ARE INVADING"", (yet you did not start any sanctions against Russia) when all the Russians were doing was postering at the Ukraine border.  In fact, you did not start sanctions against Russia until you used the peaceful incursion of Russia into Ukraine as an excuse to start sanctions.  Then you kept up the rhetoric until NATO, EU, and your drug crazy friend, Zelensky got on board with your lying rhetoric about Russia invading.  Then your drug crazy friend decided to go a step further by telling the Ukraine population that the ""RUSSIANS ARE INVADING, AND COMING TO KILL THEM"", which started their scramble to flee that possibility.  Then your drug crazy friend decided to take things even a step further by starting to bomb Ukraine and blaming it on Russia.  Evidence of Zelensky doing the bombing was submitted to you, congress, senate, NATO, and EU. yet none of you acted on that evidence, and allowed Zelensky to continue with his rhetoric and bombing, because he is doing exactly what you want him to do, which is to smear Putin, because you hate and fear him so much. If it was not for your words, ""THE RUSSIANS ARE INVADING, of which NATO, EU, and Zelensky picked up on, there would not be any destruction in Ukraine or people fleeing their country.  So Mr. Biden, whether you like it or believe it or not, you are solely and directly responsible for the Ukraine conflict, which history will eventually show.  What a legacy you are going to leave behind.  First, Palestine, then Afghanistan, now the Texas border and Ukraine. After the Supreme Court decision today to kill Roe v Wade, you can also add abortion to your fucked-up legacy, because you could have prevented it by adding three more justices to the court.  It was a conscious effort on your part to not add the three justices to the court because that would mean that the court would then be ruling in favor of the democrats, and you being a republican in sheep's clothing posing as a democrat, could not allow that. Today being 6-25-22, one day after the devastating earthquake,there is help from the  U.N. AND INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL CHARITIES, AS WELL AS THE TALIBAN GOVT.  Where is the help from the U. S. to the people you deserted and left to the mercy of the Taliban. Does your hate for the Afghans still linger so much that you refuse them aid and instead help with a worthless war in Ukraine?  God, what a legacy.  Also, you, congress, and the senate were provided with evidence that the U. S. is entirely self-sufficient in oil production and is independent of any foreign oil.  In fact, the evidence shows that the U. S. exports 7 million more barrels a day than it produces.  How is that possible?  Is someone dipping into the reserves?  That being said, then how can what happens in Ukraine or anyplace else in the world possibly affect the price of gasoline in the U. S.?  To make matters even worse, you actually believe what the lying crooked oil companies are saying about being unable refine enough oil to keep-up with demand.  Do you really believe that, even if they could, that they would be producing enough oil to reduce the price of oil?  What, the hell are you thinking?  Make them prove it to you.  Do you actually expect them to tell you the truth about anything?  I can't believe that even you and the dummy congress can be that naive.  So, all of you people out there in Facebook land, if you don't like what is going on at the gas pump, then get on these peoples case, and demand action.  Also, Mr. Biden, it becomes more and more apparent that you ran for president on a false ticket, by claiming that you were a democrat, when in all actually, you are a republican in sheep's clothing.  All of your actions point to that being the case.  So far, everything that you have done has been contrary to the democratic party and has favored the GOP.  In fact, once you stop and think about it, the same thing can be said about Vice president Harris and the supposedly democratic congress and senate.  So far, none of you have acted democratically.  I believe that I can provide an answer for your actions.  If you performed as democrats, then it would mean that you would be risking your lives by crossing trump, and his crazy zealots and the insane and dangerous GOP and of course the president, because he has already shown where his allegiance lays.  Therefore, I guess you poor guys are in a predicament, aren't you?  Your damned if you act like a democrat, and history will frown on you if you don't.  Personally I would not want my children or grandchildren to remember me failing my country due to cowardice.  As far as you are concerned Harris, because of your hate for Biden, you have become the most inefficient vice president in history.  The same can be said about the U. S. congress.  Do we even have a democratic govt. any longer?        Just, voicing the truth. 6-25-22.  CC:  Biden, Harris, Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff. CNN."
"Bottom line; Roe/Wade was bad law. There is nothing in the Constitution that supports it. Overturning R/W was not about abortion. It was about the law. The Court did not ban abortion or make it illegal. In 1973 when the Court said that it was a Constitutional right. They were wrong. Nothing in the Constitution gives that right. No. What the Constitution does say is we ""Have the right to life liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"". Key word here is ""LIFE"""
Shame shame shame shame shame on all those who have taken away women's rights
The State compelling women to be baby bearing slaves is barred under the 13th amendment.   This decision also violates the establishment clause by making the Catholic faith of SCOTUS justices the law of the land.  Time to remove the power of constitutional review from SCOTUS.   Congress can do this simply through amendment of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and limiting SCOTUS jurisdiction to those legal issues as defined in in the Constitution.   There is no constitutional authority for SCOTUS to adjudge the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress.  This type of judicial review was an invention of John Marshall in Marbury v. Madison and it is without foundation in the Constitution.
"He's right the womb is the safest place for a child in Oklahoma. Once they're born his government puts their lives at risk. Oklahoma ranks 46th in insured children, 45th in education, 45th in child poverty and 44th in child well-being."
"5 religious extremists are Holding this country hostage. As a first generation American I thought we were safe from religion, especially in 2022, god isn’t even a thing, how are we changing real live law based on a made-up invisible man? Religious extremists making the rules is something I thought I’d only see places like Afghanistan do this"
"Roe v Wade and abortion rights are not the same thing.  
It just means that abortions are taken care of at a state level instead of a federal level.  
Keep in mind the the reason this is happening is because a woman abused a federal law to force a man to financially take care of her and her child while he wasn’t the biological father."
"""Freedom and Democracy for all!""... LOL.  The Taliban took back Afghanistan, now it looks like they've taken over the U.S. as well."
Anti-abortion but pro-mass-shootings 🤦‍♂️
"Leave those states, reducing their population reduced the sits in the congress and their power in the government, we need workers in our democratic states, better paid and with better laws, more human more safe."
Lie one CNN. Abortion was never ever a constitutional right. Show me where it says killing a child in the whom is a right and I will show you where it Says I can keep my AR 15 to protect my baby from any harm……
IL gonna make that $$$
"Last year, I posted: 
""Those who call themselves Pro-life believe a human life begins at conception.  And those who are Pro-choice believe a non-viable fetus is not yet a human life.  The only resolution would seem to be complete control over conception, so that only intentional pregnancies occur.   Can we just agree that, until control over conception is a medical certainty, this will remain an insoluble issue?  Until then, this will requires tolerance and respect from both sides.  We have a moral obligation to do all we can to prevent unwanted pregnancy.   Yet we must not chastise those who face such a personal choice.  I do not believe anyone has the right to force a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term.  Pro-life beliefs should be respected; but their beliefs cannot supersede the rights of the pregnant woman herself, prior to fetal viability, that is.  For now, the Roe decision on using a viability limit to govern abortion is the best compromise available to balance the rights of all concerned...for now....""  
And now, we are proudly marching into a past that was never as good as their selective memory recalls. 

God help us."
Is it a crime against human beings or a women right like how .... This prouves that the western ppl are running from the responsabilities even as parents
TRUMP DID ALL THIS .......
"Government intrusion into women's privacy and reproductive
healthcare (at the behest of the GOP) is just the beginning. Other

Good
Facing the global energy crisis! Oil dried up! The best way is to produce hydrogen energy and build hydrogen refueling stations!
Found the movement it seems in America by hundreds of thousands of women and by the Democratic party is the fight for men not to wear a condom and it's not teaching women how to use other contraceptives maybe because the Democratic party thinks women are too stupid morons and they will not comprehend the use of other contraceptives besides abortion on the other hand the Republican party is telling them to put on the condom and use contraceptives and not to use abortion as one
"Yes. Crushing a babies skull, ripping off it’s little legs and arms while it is still in the womb, and then throwing the bloody body parts in the dumpster, IS healthcare.   
Oh, and sometimes the baby survives, and you don’t want to know what kind of healthcare they give it then!!
lol"
I strongly advise any woman who does not want to have a baby should not get pregnant.
Abortion is NOT a constitutional right. Show me where in the constitution is says that?
You will now see an exodus out of those states.  This will also discourage people from moving into those states.
It’s mistake then it’s a mistake .. who we  are to tell women what to do with they own body .. that’s so crazy controlling …
They won't mention religion because that would hurt their business.
abortion only increase taxes .
tell the lefties to move to california... where taxes are always increasing.
Lol accountability.
It's a good thing liberal woman have penises

"Wow, great time for the ones who were screaming my body my choice about a fking shot"
"So if abortion is not a constitutional right can we make it one?  I think that would be something that can be successful.  The fact is many anti abortion people are only anti abortion because of their local culture but they quietly support it, they will vote for it in private."
When does my body my rights no longer exist???? The minute the baby comes out?? Seconds before the baby comes out??? Weeks?? Months??? Can you kill your child anytime because they came from your body at one point???? So when you get an ultrasound and see the babies fingers you still have no issue having an abortion???? I understand why abortions should be allowed for certain reasons but just confused how people are not realizing they are killing a baby...\
"Bottom line is: If a woman tells another individual she is pregnant, expecting a baby, the response should be, congratulations, you should have the baby, you'd be a mother!! Not: You should abort. 
Beyond that, basic, example without further explanation, it is important to understand the variables, if the individual suggests they are not going to deliver the baby or carry full term. It is not an easy solution, the same exact for every individual experience. 
Thereby, in some instances, people are going to do, at times what they themselves may be inclined to do. 
In addition, it is important to understand a miscarriage is NOT the same thing as an abortion. Women do lose babies by miscarriage, that decipherable by the course of the pregnancy. It seemed one discussion was trying to imply connection between losing a baby and aborting a baby. Two very different experiences, typically though BOTH are VERY emotionally upsetting and leave years of anguish, sorrow, regret, wonder, sadness, etc. Becoming a mother, giving up a child for adoption or any such other experience is usually of serious impact, as a human connection, if the individual has a heart, a soul, emotions. It is not a (light) decision. It is serious and personal. Moms who have had children, a child usually love their children, child and are happy of having had them. Thus if a person has news of pregnancy, try to encourage and be supportive. Yet, understand that the experience is complex, the physicians may or may not know more in regards to the womb and the delivery and that personal opinion is absolutely best in regards to personal decision and as a recommendation, guidance."

"There is so much time, that goes into talking about, discussing topics, nearly, EVERY topic, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. It seriously seems amazing that people do not become tired of talking about stuff, repeatedly, repeatedly."
VOTE. Vote in the name of every native American that aren’t allowed to vote. STILL in 2022. There are tribes that never got the right to vote. 2024 marks the 100 year anniversary of the Indian citizenship act. But some states still don’t count some tribes as part of that act. Tribes like the 16 Comanche tribes. Who never surrendered. Arizona flipped last election. Because the Navajo stepped up and used their right to vote. Some tribes don’t even realize they too can vote. Others refuse out of distrust for the left and right. Churches don’t pay taxes. But they still are allowed to vote.
Cnn telling lies again. Abortion was never a Constitutional Right.
All this because many Democrats decided to sit out the 2016 election because their guy didn’t get the nomination. Hopefully those people learned the error of their ways and moving forward I only hope those people also learned that elections have consequences. Boy did we pay a horrible price for it as a result of their stupidity.
There appears to be broad public support to ban abortions in multiple states
"🤣🤣🤣🤣 this empty-headed female really just said ""medication through the mail.""  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  abortion pills simply do not fit the definition of the word 'medication'"

"I think that if the baby is black,abortion should be legal!!!!"
I'm sure babies and mothers feel a lot safer now. All medical expenses related to pregnancy and childbirth will be covered by universal healthcare. And children's living expenses will be paid for by the big government that promised to protect every child. Thank you to the Supreme Court for helping the quality of life for children in the 4th trimester and beyond.
"This is disgusting, women should choose not the state, what happened to freedom"

"sooooo those who shout ADOPTION...are they going to adopt these unwanted, unloved children?? have they done so already and can't take anymore children in??? I asked my former classmate who uses her Christianity as a weapon..3 days later and my fbf want an answer"
Black markets arise in 11 States as well.
As an unwanted child whose mom only had me because of religious beliefs due to let’s just say “lackluster parenting” I’ve been passed through the system for a while. Why don’t the ones who push for abortion bans/restrictions help fix some of the underlying problems first so us mistakes don’t have to live in the current broken system that is cps after being born? My time in cps hasn’t been super fun but my experiences don’t speak for everyone and most workers mean well; I used to despise the idea of abortion too but with so many kids like me who go down the wrong path because they never had proper structure and stability in their lives needed to flourish abortion might just be for the best yk?
"The way these people are freaking out, I really have to ask the question: How many times a month are these women getting pregnant!? 🤣 This makes no sense!"
"It is called the will of the majority. That is what the PEOPLE in those states wants. I doubt that California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, NY, NJ, New England states will follow suit, so abortion is still available in the US and legal in those states. That is what the  PEOPLE want it. States rights!"
So sad!!! Now these republicans need to adopt all these unwanted children!!!
God is fighting for the unborn good luck murderers!
They can take a trip and get one else where.
Only 11? Keep it coming. It will be a glorious day when it’s illegal countrywide. We all know the lunatics in New York and California will never let their love for killing unborn children go away. 48/50 is good for me.
Mommy stop killing me give me a chance!
If those 66% of Americans who do not wish to see abortion bands vote for Democrats to win the senate they can secure abortion is legal.
"I don’t think there exists a more morally bankrupt political organization anywhere in the western world than the GOP.

never visiting or doing business with a red state
I don't understand how so many people who doesn't care how people walk around as if  nothing is wrong people are so worried about other people and no one can help them no one see nothing wrong with that picture right now let us save the lives of the children who are her ect. And try to save our lives and get them to Act and make life easier and more affordable and more liveable we need them to Lower the cost of living food gas rent everything else and keep something high but not that high and make things low that can be low Amen and let what can be free be free I know we have time but exp(if you standing outside and someone approached you to bless you are you going to say no thank you or come back later Amen so today is always a good day
God bless Donald J Trump
Great news!
America has not freedom.
W America
And in Breaking News… Republicans are to phase out the Elephant icon and replace it with a Foot and Crosshairs!
Don't date anyone that doesn't believe in women's rights. Don't live in states that believe women have the right to autonomy. And look how fast they can act. No ability when babies are murdered. That's murky and shouldn't be political but stripping right back to 1898 is all good. No more pretending this is a matter of political differences. Authoritarianism vs Democratic Republic  and if white folks are willing to murder each other what can the rest of us really expect 🤔 😒 🙄
There are Government programs to help the moms out there like free health care and Welfare Programs
"Get your tubes tied. It’s cheap, painless, reversible and there’s no need to murder a baby and go to hell."
"It's amazing how CNN can just lie to everyone and morons eat it up. Think for yourself, know what the truth really is  or shut the f#@k up."
Republicans just want to be able to rape women and not be responsible for the child they create
Hmmmm… I wonder what constitutional rights the democrats will take away now. Republicans opened Pandora’s box.
These red states are used to having inbred people nothing new...
"Whats next, same sex marriges, votes for women or the return of jim crow segregation. Crazy usa."
why are they not trying to prove that abortion is a constitutional right? 🤔
I blame democrats for this! I tried to tell anyone I came in contact with before the 2016 election that Roe v Wade and Obamacare was on the ballet because the positions that Mitch was holding up and justice Ginsburg heath but to many made excuses to why they couldn’t vote for Hillary! Now we all will have to suffer for their stupidity!
Once the government successfully  eliminates a right you would think they would be satisfied. But they are not. They keep going. Look for more limits on your rights with no end in sight.
"woman: he had sex so he has to take responsibility for the cild and pay 20yrs of support.
woman: just because i had sex doesn't mean i want a child. i have a right to kill it with abortion."
Its a distraction from whats really happening - people won't afford food and water that ARE surviving right now. Bidens up to the plate to answer to that one. The lefties will take more of your tax dollar soon too.
AR-15 need to be banned before we talk about abortion...
Abortion is murder.  Cheers!
White supremacists are infiltrating all levels of government from local school councils to state and federal congresses.  They plan to overturn future elections and create a dictatorship. Mary Miller of Illinois is one of them. Majorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert are too. Vote against them in November 2022 and 2024.
Yes to life!
Those numbers aren’t correct.
There 50 States. This is BS
God wins! Save the babies ❤️❤️
Unfortunately that 60+% in favor of Roe v Wade are concentrated in blue states.
I support abortion until a child is able to become self-aware. Until that point the child is no different than an animal. Disagree and you are a pro choice hypocritical monster
If Roe is on the ballot I guess I'll be voting red
"Garland just keeps gnashing his teeth!! 😅🤣
Thank you RBG and President Trump!!!!"
"""the constitutional right to abortion"" says the cnn snowflake.
There is no right to abortion in the constitution. Abortion and constitution are two words that should never be in the same sentence."
You don't have the right to murder your own baby.
If you can cross state lines to get an abortion then you should be able to cross state lines to buy a gun also. Just saying you can't have one and not the other And it's hilarious when  The shoe is on the other foot
Women can we agree that you stop sleeping with men that are uneducated and can't afford to raise the kids. this way you screw over all the losers that voted for this. cause you know they are all broke af with no talent and just want to make you a single mom. it's 2022 stop sleeping with broke people to show you are in control of your body then watch them change the law back asap.
"the supreme court has no constitutional power to overturn laws on the basis of their constitutionality (judicial review), so let the democratic states make laws outlawing the possession of firearms by private citizens who are not part of a ""well regulated militia"".

Evangelical America - using the Handmaids Tale as a blueprint since 2022
"""Abortion"" never was a ""constitutional right""."
"11 out of 50 - that leaves 39 States to have an abortion and in the future the issue will go to the ballot boxes - so the issue is not settled- so dumb!
Speculation and assumptions!"
Women who have misscariages early in their pregnancy or late will be suspect to criminal charges in some of these states and it will be hard to prove ones innocence. Anyone that doubts that this will happen only need to google. It has already happened before even when Roe vs Wade was the law of the land.
Throw in war and pestilence and it's basically the dark ages
"In Oklahoma if you are a victim of rape, incest, or your life is put in danger from the pregnancy you can still have an abortion. They forgot to report that."
good lmao

"1:37 someone needs to tell mrs pelosi that the ladies that are carrying the children didn’t just spontaneously get pregnant. I personally think it’s not real fair to the dads that DO want something to do with their children, that they have NO say in wether an abortion should or should not happen. If someone can explain why the dads should have no say in this, I would love to here."
All about a woman’s right to play God!
I wish men had a right to choose they don’t we sure don’t have any reproductive rights and all over USA men are being kept from their children they love that they never hurt or anything forced to pay child support amount regardless of income or bills and food other children overhead prices medical costs no exception if a man can not see his children release him. A man should have some rights really men are parents to we do have a parental instinct and love our children as much as a woman can they are part of us as well it takes two to make one ya know imagine being happy overjoyed about a incoming child but the other parent decides not to go thru with it and you want the baby but have no legal right to fight to save it and regardless of your pleas they abort your child anyway.
Hallelujah
"To all those saying ""My body, my choice"", I am curious what you all think about suicide. If a person wants to end their own life, it is their body and their choice. Many people look down on those that commit suicide and call it selfish. Why? So it's ok to take another person's life (abortion) but not one's own?"
"Absolutely fantastic, these supporters of infanticide, yes, the brutal murder of the foetus (Latin for baby) that's right BABY, do not realise the Most High Creator of life, is going to hold them accountable!

It's a great day in America
I know it’s a big inconvenience but it saves lives good way to look at it
"California Governor Newsom said it right. Don't ever tell me America is the leader of the Free world. Half of American states have now embraced fascist totalitarianism. You  people make me sick. Autocratic, fascist, enslavement.  What I see is that America has just gone to war with itself. This will kill so many. Now I'm glad the second ammendment is in place. Fundamentalism has crossed the red line. 6 months and you'll be killing each other. More than you already were anyway. Once the consequences are felt. Once enough girls and women have died. I don't think any of you is prepared for what is about to happen.  One tiny example. The law abiding father whose student daughter gets raped... previously he would have let the law work while he dealt with an abortion. Now that dad will kill that rapist and anyone else that gets in his way. Another..m the career woman that dies after arranging to get the baby kicked out of her in a back alley. Leaves a daughter who hates men. Grows up bitter and twisted. Have fun with your dystopian reality while it lasts. I would say 9 - 18 months and it all starts sliding towards... possibly the end of America as a union. North and South at the very least. ☠ 🇬🇧"

I’m confused. All this talk of “women’s rights” from the same insufferable CLOWNS who are incapable of defining the word “woman”. 🤔
Sooo....are they coming for gay people next? And then bringing back slavery?  Tell me again....what is the difference between the U.S and Afghanistan?
There is 50+ states. Go pick one that supports your beliefs. Problem solved 👍
Dayum.
Mississippi banned Abortion
"It this doesn't get the indifferent majority to the polls, we deserve the fate of Afghanistan."
Is Clarence also ready to roll back the laws legalizing his inter-racial marriage or better yet women suffrage. That would really get the feminist camping around his gated subdivision.
The craziest thing is that they really think women will suddenly stop getting abortions. Being deluded by self righteousness is the worst.
I am a Canadian and I am a father of two beautiful daughters I would support each of them if they need it my support for an abortion I don't think it's the laws choice or decision to tell what a male and a female can do with their bodies what the Supreme Court has done to the American women is wrong and in a disgraceful
Bravo 👏
disgusting
"The unintended pregnancy problem is easy to solve:
*_1_* Sexually active tweens and teens must use contraceptives, must avoid alcohol and drugs at parties, and must avoid being and walking alone at night. This age group especially must be on the alert to avoid all situations where rape and incest may occur.
*_2_* Number (1) also applies to sexually active women over 20 and married ones. You can enjoy many sex acts without penile penetration of the vagina. Use several birth control methods; condoms are about 92% effective.
*_3_* The government must make any effort possible to end poverty by (1) lowering unemployment, (2) giving universal basic income (UBI) to poor people, and (3) making sure all women have a high school diploma. 💕☮🌎🌌"
"Good, only 39 states to go"
use  Birth control  also  condoms  work be responsible with you're body
God Wins
America is moving closer to Syariah law. Alhumdooolilahhhhh!!!
Women rights blabla yes all gone. Accept it and move on. Go to blue states or abroad to procure your abortions.
This hurts me so much. But the fight is no over we will get our right back.
It’s the states right ..
I'm voting progressive here on out no more democrats and Republicans are unless to us  the ppl
Thank you SCOTUS! Two back to back smackdowns for the Liberals. I LOVE IT. Drinking a diet coke to celebrate like Trump is probably doing HAHAHAH
Yes it is a slap in the face Pelosi so what??
Like I been saying this country should not be ran by old rich white ppl making laws they not going to fully see
Great job SCOTUS 👏 👍 👌 🙌 😀 💪 👏
Time to rewatch the first five minutes of Idiocracy
I like how people cry so much about the kids in uvalde but not for the kids that couldn’t even make it out of their “loving” mother before being ripped apart.
"These ignorant people believe judges are supposed to dictate all the nuanced rules on abortion which involve, whether teens can get medical procedures without informing or gaining parental permission, who will pay or provide them if legal, how late a baby can be aborted, what methods of abortion are acceptable (plyers, coat hangers, poisons, etc), who can perform them, exceptions for victims of rape and incest, child abuse, IVF clinics, what punishments will be for violations, etc. It is not the job of judges to dictate all these rules. The legislative branch writes the details of the law, the executive branch signs it into law, and the judicial branch is there to interpret the law in how it applies to various situations. This is civics 101, which they obviously don't teach in schools or everyone would understand this ruling is correctly placing power where it belongs"
"Are yall really that lazy where you wont put on a 5 dollar condom, but will have a 300 hundred dollar abortion?"
The right to abortion is not constitutional right - the right to parent IS a constitutional right
Abortion is not for convenience or a contraceptive. Stop crying and be responsible.

The dem voters just need to accept that Roe is gone and probably not coming back.  I have no power to do anything.  Let's just move on and unify our people as a country.  There's no red America or blue America, there's only the United States of America.

"Is getting a vasectomy worth it?
Vasectomy is safer and cheaper than tubal ligation (blocking the fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy) in women. The one-time cost of a vasectomy may be cheaper over time than the cost of other birth control methods, such as condoms or medication. GUYS TAKE THE LEAD"
"Americans remember,
If you are loosing you’re right’s to free abortion. Remember.
This is the fault of the republicans.
Republicans are the enemy of the people. Republicans are to be ignored in the next election.
Republicans took away you’re right’s for safe and secure medical attention.
All American women whether republicans or Democrat, should remember in the coming elections that the republicans took that away from you. 
Americans just went fifty years in the past. All because a few people decided 
too take away what you’re mother and grand-mother add access easily and safely. Now what will you doo.
VOTE démocrate.
Fuck the Republican Party and send them a message.
Trump and his stooges Are nothing without you’re vote.

"The best social revolution for equal opportunities in abortion, and also but above all to avoid traumatic abortions because of poverty, is PUTINE who did it respecting all the advice of UN specialists .
And who is it ? Who provoked the war in Kazakhstan which inevitably followed in UKRAINE? By agitating the idea that this social revolution for equal opportunities for children would be a return to communism??? He is the preacher whose vassals claim to defend Europe against the Communist invasion. Meanwhile friendly mothers do not seem to have had the information of this social revolution advised by UN specialists.
It's not communism, it's a pension for children and FUTURE children until the end of university studies. It's some, confederate Europe who wants to keep an injustice of chances in front of access to studies by money, don't like that. The so-called protectors of life don't like it and pay to prevent it. They said they would rather defend poor women's right to abort than give an annuity to poor women who would prefer to keep the baby if she could. They even dreamed of succeeding in pushing Russia to fire Putin, but all these CONS who talk about democracy for them and non-democracy for PUTIN do not have the same rate of acceptance by their people as him.
Biden is 70% who do not like him, Macron is less than 25% who voted for him.
The pension for the fetuses until the end of their school studies, without the parents being able to touch it from a certain age, is what all should do to solve all the concerns of injustice against the children of the fetus to studies. Violence against children...etc....Perhaps it will be necessary to improve but it is already very advanced towards better justice."
if you just check the list of countrys that ban abortion you see the us is in great company. thats the countrys you want join. fuck this modern free countrys.
The womb is not the safest place for a child to be! That’s why they are NOT BORN until they leave it doofus!
"So, a woman has the rights of ""personhood"" when she's a fetus, but not after being born."
Women have been stripped of their baby killing rights which should have never been rights at all.
"just a doubt: is this abortion ban based on ""Christian believes""? 
Because if that's the case overturning Roe vs Wade is illegal, since a judicial decision should NEVER be influenced by ANY religion. 
Because then you're doing the same as the Sharia in the Islam religion and culture."
This troll that's posting nonsense after every comment has a strategy and a purpose. It's to keep Americans from communicating with one another on YouTube. They fear our coming together.
Imagine getting rid of a constitutional RIGHT because you FEEL something isnt right but let this be about gun control and everyone starts losing there fucking minds
Your *NOT* going to be murdering any babies in my state.
"In my opinion, the SCOTUS Roe decision is literally going to cause the breakdown of many American families in Red States, Blue States, Purple States, and for US families throughout the world. If girls and women are jailed... How will their families, husbands, boyfriends, LGBTQ+ partners, single significant others, cope with the dilemma when they might have other children together? If, unfortunately a woman has a miscarriage... Will the police go Gestapo into people's homes to question and possibly arrest women... literally throwing them in jail? What about women who get pregnant within their fallopian tubes or through abnormal processes? Will these abnormal pregnancies health conditions fall within the state medical guidelines of concerns for the life of the girl/woman?"
Move to a blue state that still allows them.  Get ready to pay more taxes too to pay for all the ones who get it for free.
"Why didn't Dems secure it at any point in the last 50 years? They have to stop trusting Republicans. These Republicans are not trustworthy. They aren't even Republicans anymore, they are something else, radical power hungry control freaks that don't care about people is what they are now. We must take the gloves off and stop being nice and never trust one of them again. Fix this mess NOW. We can and should fight dirty too. I know it's not the civilized people we want to be, but to save our country from these terrorist traitors, we simply MUST."

Something else to consider for women of childbearing years, what happens if you vacation in one of these states and have a miscarriage and they don't allow abortion to save your life? Check out the American in Malta that just experienced this scenario. Some of these states will hold you hostage to prove their point, and your life will be endangered.   I'm all for boycotting travel to any of these Christian Taliban states."

"Looks like the USA is starting to go fully mediaeval. Damned if I'd want to live in a country where the only people with any right to freedom were heavily armed white male bigots, with everyone else being treated as barely human."

"I'm thankful it was there in 1980 when I was raped and am thankful that now I'm too old to get pregnant, but I'm devastated for all the women who will die because taking their own lives will be the option they feel they must choose or back alley abortions that go wrong. People don't matter to Republicans. Control and power matter. Voting for any Republican no matter how different you think they are, is a vote for losing our freedoms and rights and damaging our country. 

Michigan has a temporary injunction stopping the ban so for now, it's still legal."
"Now it's time to fix the foster system, hmm?"
There's no constitutional right to kill babies.  Thats fake news.
Where was that care about body autonomy when it came to being forced to take an experimental jab ?Hypocritical fools.
"Fake News. Judges are not supposed to write the laws. That is for the legislature, a separate body of government. They lament the ""ruling makes no exceptions for victims of rape and incest"". This shows laws on abortion are by necessity very nuanced and complex, and involve not just these issues but whether teens can get medical procedures without informing or gaining parental permission, who will pay or provide them if legal, how late a baby can be aborted, what methods of abortion are acceptable (plyers, coat hangers, poisons, etc), who can perform them, what punishments will be for violations, etc. It is not the job of judges to dictate all these rules. The legislatures job is to write the details of the law, the executive signs it into law, and the judicial system is there to interpret the law in how it applies to various situations."

Not a constitutional right.
"Regardless of our opinions, abortion is now illegal.  People need to stop having irresponsible sex. There are more protective measures and access than ever before. Much more than when roe vs wade began. Let's start practicing safe sex or no sex. Feminists, pressure men to use male contraceptions."
"Women's rights used to be about equal pay and equal opportunity now it's about killing babies and letting males pretending to be women beat the crap out of woman.
 
It used to be about I am woman hear me roar now it's about I am woman let me hurt other women.

It's about destroying the hopes of millions of women so a few hundred men that couldn't compete with other men enjoy the status of being at the top of a women's sport.


Women would rather now see hundreds millions of other women's hopes and dreams be destroyed and let them be in misery instead of a of a few hundred males.
NOW THE OPPRESSORS OF WOMEN ARE WOMEN."
"My solution:

Women everywhere should stop having sex with men until Roe v Wade is codified"
how about women just stop opening their legs for every guy they meet eh??
"This SCOTUS is completely illegitimate as the cherry picking of privacy cases shows only too well. The idea that that we have to go back to the 1900s for Constitutional protection is in and of itself ridiculous. Their tortured logic is lazy, stupid and cruel. It's just an excuse to codify into law Fox News right wing  grievances. We are now acting more like Iran or Afghanistan in that a court of religious zealots are imposing their beliefs (of Christian America) without caring the least bit about human suffering or human dignity. America is supposed to have separation of church and state but nothing will stand in these horrible people's way. NO right is safe with this court. Even it this comes up again as Equal Protection, they will find a way to squirm out of it. Zero integrity."
fear and sorrow can be the only path for equal rights honestly .
"women should know that the abortion pill is still available by mail. if you get it early enough you can perform the abortion yourself. you do not need a doctor or a clinic, they are only there for the very rare cases when taking the pill causes side effects. 
every woman in these states should know this, that they can still get abortions thru the mail. 

and they cannot stop this. as long as democrats control part of congress or the presidency, they cannot stop this.

Time for everyone to be proactive… it’s obvious our country has left us to fend for ourselves… it’s time to research and seek all options available for ones individual needs.. there are alternatives to this nightmare… we have to address this reasonably.. protest is nice but once the rights are stripped protest is useless… so find out all of the options available and plan accordingly… it’s time we save ourselves and do whatever necessary to avoid being burden with unwanted…
"Only thing that's happened is they've made it harder and/or more dangerous to have an abortion. NOT IMPOSSIBLE. A woman desperate enough is going to do what ever she feels she needs to do. Desperation trumps laws, even commandments. We are humans and we've sinned from the start, hello. There might be more headlines now like, baby left in dumpster, 19 year old college student gang raped that got pregnant has commited suicide, preachers 13 year old daughter died trying to abort her baby or republican christian senator molesting his daughter paid  for her to have abortion. THERE'S NO STOPPING THE FILTH IN THIS WORLD. Why bring more innocent babies into it that aren't wanted by the woman carrying them, DUH!!!"
"“No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.” – Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Constitution, Draft 1, 1776"
"The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes…. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.”

"“On every occasion [of Constitutional interpretation] let us carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying [to force] what meaning may be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, [instead let us] conform to the probable one in which it was passed.”

"American Exceptionalism, right?"
This should have always been a state decision. Abortion is not a constitutional right regardless of your feelings on the matter. I also see so many pro abortionist protesting Christianity. There are plenty of secularist against the murder of unborn children. All the blue states will vote and continue to murder innocent life in the whomp. They will probably even double down and push for late term and even partial birth infanticide.
"“Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense? Where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction, and having them under the management of Congress?

"“[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.

"When the First Satanic Church of America makes the statement ""You can't outlaw abortion its part of our worship."" Then we understand exactly  why Abortion is so important. The ancients worship of Moloch sacrificing live babies into a burning fire."
"Regardless of where I stand on abortion, in my opinion there is no indication in our Constitution that it should be considered a fundamental constitutional right. This was, in my opinion, an extreme interpretation done by the Supreme Court at that time. By the way, I also think there is no indication in our Constitution (or second amendment) that anybody at 18 should be able to purchase an AR-15. One thing is the right to own arms, another thing is what type, since what age, and with what requisites. Both these are extreme interpretations that intend to make something constitutionally covered, so it can't be discussed. I think this is wrong. I think both things should be defined in Congress and have limits to when and how you can exercise those rights."
You can’t be in favor of people having the right to bear arms (weapons) to kill people and animals and be against women having the right to choose.
Biden needs to add 2 more judges and explain that this is the will of the people we can't go backwards.Two judge stolen my Trump taken back.
"PS. Where are the voices and demonstrations concerning threats to democracy itself? Where are the loud demonstrations to indict Trump for being a  clear and present danger to the very core of your democratic institutions? He attempted to overthrow a free election.

The Roberts Court is the most corrupt Supreme Court in history.  We all know it.
"You know what type of men and women who wants abortion to be reverse? It's all the ugly men and women who are not physically attracted who don't get laid regardless who only have a hurt and anger in their hearts,,, especially to a good-looking or normal people who do get laid👍😏💩🍄 and trust me it has nothing to do with religion"
"What is good about the Supreme Court's decision to knock down Roe v. Wade? Just looking at some of the women in this video tells you that there are only religious people who are happy with this ruling. David Brooks from the NYT says you cannot fact check a person with an emotional state. I would go one more to say that you cannot fact check a person of a religious faith. That's fine until the people of a religious faith who are in a minority end up deciding what the rest of the population should do who are in the majority. This must be maddening to see this happen before your eyes. Nevertheless; what you can do is not to get mad, but get even. What is the root of this problem? It's the Electoral College that allowed a candidate with----listen to this---3 million less votes than his oppositional candidate to win the election for the presidency. That's right, Donald J. Trump won the election that Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote by 3 million people. What happened next is one of darkest chapters in American history. Mitch McConnell quickly realized he had a proxy president who would willingly do his bidding if he got all the credit. McConnell deftly stacked the Supreme Court with religious fanatics that do not even come close to reflecting the views of a majority of Americans. This is a reality difficult to accept where nothing can change a Supreme Court ruling, but you can change your country's disasterous path of having an Electoral Candidates that puts questionable candidates into office that would not have won in a true democracy. George W. Bush got in the same way and America's image has been forever stained by a president whose vice-president called the shots and once again---gave George W. Bush all the credit. I'm an overseas viewer and this is my two cents to sort things out, but I think this is an excellent time to use the rising anger not to explode on the streets, but to take out the seed of the problem making your country a laughing stock across the world. Abolish the Electoral College before a person like Trump once more is in charge but who may just decide to use nuclear weapons."

Women of child bearing age have lost their right? Is CNN saying men cannot get pregnant?
"I would say any constitutional right could be taken if it was born after the 1950s. It wasn't a constitutional right, if it was then congress would have passed a law to make federal abortion illegal. Finally the states have the right to make abortion illegal."
So do u pro abortion people believe in aboration in a 3rd trimester?
"The Republican appointed Supreme Court Justices in their confirmation hearings acknowledged  Roe v Wade as set precedence. In overturning Roe v Wade they perjured themselves in confirmation hearings to be confirmed to be a Supreme Court Justice. If the House and Senate don't hold  these Republican appointed Justices accountable for perjury by not impeaching for perjury these corrupted Justices send a  message that perjury is okay. The Supreme Court Justices by overturning Roe v Wade have taken women backwards in their right to choose which brings them back to when there were many deaths from back room abortions.  Forcing women who have already been devastated mentally and physically who are a victim of rape,  incest or a dangerous pregnancy are once again a victim of their right to choose  being taken away. In most States before a child is given up for adoption both people give consent to give up the child. The Supreme Court Justices and the states that have banned abortions have given the rapist and  the perpetrator of incest parental rights to once again victimize the already devastated women."

If they are going to do this there must be massive investments on child care.
"Factoring in CNN's margin of error, 11 is actually 18-20. 22 states have it legal presently and 8-10 are undecided with more than half leaning to ban. In the end it will likely be an even 25 for legal/ban which showcases that America is divided right down the middle with no chance of that gap ever being bridged. I think it's time for a divorce."

Thoughts and prayers to all the pregnant men out there
"Banning abortions does *not* lower abortion rates. 

You know what does?

*Allowing Abortion Services!*

It is a very simple, demonstrable fact, that states (and indeed, whole countries elsewhere in the World) that have the most draconian anti-abortion laws have the higher levels, per capita, of abortions (illegal), STDs, teen pregnancies, and child mortality and birth defects. 

Abortions are part of reproductive health. And that goes hand-in-hand with:
Pre/post natal health care services
Child support
Comprehensive sex education
Access to contraception
Income support
Housing benefits
Affordable health care, or all out state funded universal health care
Payed maternity/paternity leave

*These* services lower abortions, whilst *allowing* abortions. 

And it goes without saying, the States  that are frothing at the mouth at banning abortions do *not* have these services, or are gutting them to point of being meaningless. 

If you're a foetus, your rights are sacred. Once you're born, you can F### off and die, for all they care!"
"I don't think everyone understands the seriousness of this Abortion situation

Google the question and see which states have 'banned' them and at what stage.
Even deSantis platform supports contraception and early stage abortion. He suggests 15 weeks as a limit to when abortion should be legalized. It looks like the question for States is ' at what developmental stage should abortion be illegal' or even just medically unethical?
It is an important question that includes but also extends beyond privacy rights and choice.
I am a woman, with a uterous, who has had pregnancy scares, has been pregnant and  had childern. I know the issues. I have as much right to influence abortion policy as the pro choice lobby.
Please de escalate the rhetoric and deliver a balanced calm news piece. The American people have been through trauma after trauma. Be part of the healing and unity project not part of the problem."
These creepy Leaders banning women's health rights are insane. What childcare & family supports are they proposing to help pregnant women after the child is born?
America is slowly becoming a shithole country.
Hell yeah let’s arrest women!! Human rights!!
"Republicans will take over the House and Senate, get rid of the filibuster like the democrats always should have, and pass whatever draconian laws at the federal level that ""their God's"" voices tell them to."
God bless those 11 states
Absolute worst decision in the history of the Supreme Court. I am disgusted that anybody could ever support this decision.
"We in Europe have experienced what happens if rights are being reversed. I just hope it will not end in getting slavery back in place. And be sure, we will not come to free you from fascism, you are on you own."
Decent Americans—we HAVE to defeat the TRAILER TRASH HILLBILLY’S that are trying to turn the Country into a THEOCRACY!!!
I thought religion and state was supposed to be separate. I think the women should sue the US at the world court for violation of human rights
EXPAND SUPREME COURT!!  RESIST AND REJECT THE FASCIST GOP PARTY!!
"Most of the 1 million abortions in America are from poor lazy and uneducated women, come on America educate your masses ,"
JOE BIDEN CHEAT SHEETS:   YOU Take YOUR seat💺 😉😀😄🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  This is what YOU get when YOU order a president by MAIL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 THE US IS A LAUGHING STOCK ALL OVER THE WORLD 😂🤣🤣
Roe allowed abortions right up until the time of delivery. Why don't you ask Americans how many of them support that CNN. I'll bet it ain't 66%.
"If we're now going with literal interpretation of constitution and rights which are not explicitly enumerated in constitution being deligated to states, lets remember that 2nd amendment protects the right to bare arms, but it does not protect the right to sell guns, hence states can flat out ban sales of guns. Same goes for shipping of the ammo or guns across territory of a particular state."
"""Oklahoma is now the safest place a child can be"".  what the hell kind of rhetorical bullshit is that?!"
Clarence Thomas is political and Supreme Court Judges are supposed to be objective.
"it’s not going to impact suburban women at all, they can afford to get an abortion no matter what. That Great White Replacement they fear is coming about by their own hands…"
Stop making women look uneducated.
A huge step in the right direction.
"“Oklahoma is the safest place for a child to be.”

‘Are you are increase funds for maternal and child care?’

“Are we what now?”"
Weren’t these women talking about a sex strike?Problem solved 🤣🤣🤣
"Well democrats are keeping the dream of eugenics alive. 
Margret Sanger and Hitler would be proud"
He says Oklahoma is the safest place for a child to be. Except when that armed gun man comes into their school and blows them to pieces. Thanks to republican gun laws.

Hmmm we're all biologists now 🤔
Making America great again! God bless America!
This is Wrong
Why was this not on the voter ballot.  This is unconstitutional. For the supreme court to make the decision against the will of the people.
How about Roe lied that she got raped in an interview and said she was an alcoholic and stole money from people.Her words!!!!
"40-million Afghans -- the people of the ""Graveyard of Empires"" -- have capitulated to a life under the tyranny of less than 100,000 Taliban. 140-Million Russians have capitulated to a life under the tyranny of Putin. So why will it be any different for 330-Million Americans vis-à-vis The REAL Republicans of MAGA."
"Amazing the Supreme Court does not consider the States are qualified to regulate gun control, but are very qualified to regulate women's reproductive rights.   In one week they have managed to produce contradictory opinions on States rights.   The gun control opinion comes as a rebuke to the bipartisan resolution passed by Congress a few days earlier.  It aims to appease the NRA for allowing and cooperating in the bipartisan legislation that no one would have dared oppose."
"And the voters, if they disagree can have it placed on the ballot.  CNN where the terminally ignorant go for misinformation."
"All states should make abortion illegal unless one of the following happens. 
RAPE: Given the morning after pill to abort or no longer then two weeks. After that then they should not be able to abort. 
Medical emergency:  Doctors don't have a choice but to abort but only with two or three doctors in agreement that it would be the best decision. 
Baby's health; Doctors say the baby will not have a quality of life for reasons such as brain damage, severely deformed etc....then and only then with  two to three opinions with same opinion. 
Other then that abortion should be illegal period and if a doctor is caught preforming they should be imprisoned for life without parole , life for a life, same goes with mother. Abortion is murder period , we are a nation that is supposed to be under God but we go against God on many things such as abortion, gay rights and many more things. America has become very dark and we need to get back in the light and stop going against God, if not America will fall as if people can notice it is starting to crumble and pretty soon America will not exist if we don't start getting it right, Democrats are destroying our country a little at a time as per their agenda and we need to take our country back out of the hands of this demonic power that has it's grasp on many people. God bless and love to all."
"Horrible  it doesn't make a baby safe.  It will be in Foster care .
Unloved and abused."
after birth abortion is the most appalling and evil thing i have EVER heard of
"When I thought America couldn't get any worse, right wing nuts with power prove me wrong again. We are falling deeper and deeper into authoritarianism by people who a majority of Americans disagree with! Something must change or America is DEAD!"
at the very very least what i require to feel bad about women because of this: all those women voting blue from now on. otherwise accept what you voted for
Oklahoma is the safest place for children to be...until the next school shooting facilitated by the lack of gun laws.
This should be a big boost for Canadian tourism.
Look at all these Serena Joys rejoicing at having brought about their own subjugation.
"so sad to see 33% of americans support this madness, republican party is a mind-washer to amazing levels, if something this obvious is an issue, how the F are we ever going to pull together on the real problems everyone keeps ignoring because they are too hard to solve. pure madness."
"With body autonomy now voided by these states, these 11 states can make vaccination mandatory."
Thank  GOD  Almighty  for OUR Amazing  Conservative  Supreme  Court  Justices 🙏🙏🙏🙏❤

11 states that should vote blue next time.
"In the same time the court rule in two cases 
First case you do not have control over my Gun
Second case I have control over your body (you do not have control over your body)

"Good!! Hopefully this will wake up the people in those states and get them to vote these ant-American, anti- freedom bastards out!"
"It's theocratic dogma from an illigitimate benched supreme court overturning precident set by at least two decisions by previous courts.

I blame Dems for letting this sit as precident for 70 years and not amending the constitutional privacy sections to include personal medical rights."
Women? Shouldn't you guys be saying birthing people?
"""Women of color disproportionately depend upon abortion services."" CNN is right about that. That's because Margret Sanger founded Planned Parenthood to control the population of minorities."
LMFAO..... YOUR ELECTIONS ARE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH REPUBLICANS ELECTED WHO MAY END UP TAKING OVER WHO GETS INTO POWER AND WHO DOESN'T.  I just shake my head at all of your in America and count my blessings every day that I live in Canada.  America is now in the same circle of 2 other countries which are considered dictatorships and do NOT ALLOW ABORTIONS IN THEIR COUNTRY.  AGAIN  LMFAO.
I haven’t seen Democrats this mad since Republicans freed their slaves! 😂😂😃
Abortion is not a constitutional right!Get your facts straight!
It is time for a female sex-boycott for bringing back abortion rights.
"Take the word “effectively” out of the title of this video and this story becomes dead space.
CNN consumers will likely and/or ‘effectively’ interpret and transmit this story as ‘11 states ban abortion’."
"Irresponsible voters distracted by the sirens'' song of the dog shit, of dog-whistle politics, are entirely responsible for this happening"
"There will be a run on knitting needles and forceps.....the old standbys, disgraceful ruling by the court"
What’s the matter you don’t want the public to know that doctors profit off of aborted fetal parts???
"Funny how the same Nazis who were crying over masks in PRIVATE shops want the gvt regulating bedrooms and wombs. That's not going to happen. We will not allow it, no matter what it takes. The 2nd amendment is to protect against gvt overreach."
The solution is simple..... expand the court
If GOP wife daughter mistress need Abortion they secretly leave the country an HAVE ABORTION. The Hypocrisy so deep get boots on. An by the Rich women will still getting Abortion.
RBG's Legacy.
Yeah what happens next is we fight abortion can save lifes of alot of woman that know can not give birth do to the risks of death and what about rape victims this is an insult to human rights
Oklahomo just became the most dangerous state for women.
The majority of Red Southern states are supporting this insane situation that allows old wyt men to just ravish young wyt girls and then raise their unwanted offspring!!!🤢🤮
"I remember when planned parenthood got exposed for selling aborted fetal parts.Plan B ladies don’t let them profit off of your aborted baby.That is what this is about.No profit in medications that dissolve a pregnancy.22,000 for an aborted fetal brain.Just saying.Stop making women look uneducated.Sincerely a biological woman.Peace."
Kansas should open abortion clinics on the borders adjacent to Oklahoma and Missouri and advertise them like a casino.
Free birth control.  Nation wide.  Prevent as many unplanned pregnancies as possible.  Why can't we do this?   Regardless of left or right can we agree that prevention would be less stress on the health care system and society as a whole.
#AMEN
Oklahoma is far from the safest place in the country for a baby. The infant mortality rate is one of the highest in the country at 5.7 deaths per 1000 births. In fact look up mortality rates and the Red states lead the way in death.
Kevin McCarthy would go for extermination camps if he thought it would win votes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
"These right-wing extreme evangelicals (even non Christian’s who condemn pro-choice) fail to realize that the only sin that can never be forgiven by God is the, “Unpardonable Sin” of grieving away the Holy Spirit entirely. (To reject/not listen to the Holy Spirit.) They are in far more jeopardy of loosing their salvation and burning in hell than a woman who has had to endure an abortion and seeks forgiveness.

Matthew 12:31-32
“Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven. Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come."
"Amazing victory for all Family People, Loyal People and horrible news for cheaters, people who like to sleep with everybody and victims of rap (which are a tiny minority btw let’s be honest)..protest all you want just respect the law and don’t break anything Okaaay?"

Well I think the hospitals could hand out plan B along with the rape kit wouldn’t you say?"
No j6 hearings or......?
Cant wait to hear how many Republicans get called out for their abortions. I imagine Trump and kids have racked up 6 or 7
"For Republicans,to be an American you must be born in the USA, be white, Christian and a MAN.
I would not be surprised in 10 years if women are not allowed to vote."
"To CNN
It was not a constitutional right....read the constitution and stop spreading misinformation"
"All that happens is the people needing it, go over the border into countries that give abortions  - those countries make millions of dollars. Ireland women used to come to England - they do not now, because Ireland Catholicism practice has fallen and sanity prevailed and Ireland realised it needed to get in the 21st Century. Looks like the US has gone back a century."
"The problem that arises from more millions of Americans as refugees from the failed GOP states -- like for California that handed Joe Biden 5-million of the popular vote, that he did not need to win California -- is that it entrenches the disruptive power of a death-grip on the country, that the Republicans -- The REAL Republicans of MAGA -- hold, by way of the Electoral College system."
Sorry to hear this from Canada here. Maybe it’s time to drag these Supreme Court justices out into the street for a trial by the people. You outnumber them don’t take their shit.
"These folks don't care about ""babies/kids"". So doesn't matter how these children come about or what the pregnancy can do to the mother or life it would have being born to someone who doesn't want it. Same folks complain about government assistance, low income, adopt agencies better get more locations & rooms. What about the rights of the mothers? This is very very bad"
"i love that they keep saying ""women"", but they don't even know what that word means"
"RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW, WATCHING THE WORLD WAKE UP FROM HISTORY ❤️🇺🇲🗽"
Stay focused on Donald Trump democrats. Don't take your eyes off of him. Tunnel vision pays off yet again.
"Why American women need the Supreme Court Justices? Recalled the Supreme Court Justices if they can't protect women rights to abortion. They are appointees and can also be removed. Politically motivated overturns Roe and Wade, in any part of the constitution are abortion illegal. They punish women for having sex. The Supreme Court Justices can't read the constitution and sent women to the cavern age, they need to be removed."
"The best way to fight this is for all of the Democrat Supremes to stand down, for to take away the SCOTUS as the stick for The REAL Republicans of MAGA to terrorize the country. Also, make sure that this November and 2024 is the stake through the heart for The REAL Republicans of MAGA."
"The Taliban moves forward.
USA moves backward."
They won't ban ar15s but ban women rights to choose. This country is so backwards.
"Hey in Colorado you can have an abortion at 10 months (just suppress birth for  a month)? Who cares if it is a human living baby. Who cares.  Come to Colorado and abort your baby.
Colorado is going overboard to get your abortion monies.  Heck maybe even free buses and free air fare (Oh, guess Dick's and Tesla are doing that already).  Ok just come to Colorado to abort your baby (10 month is fine ok --- you all come!!!)"
"Breaking news: Roe is dead, and the democrat's leadership has utterly failed them. Now back to Donald Trump, and the never-ending impeachment."
The Supreme Court justices should have term limits and not be in for life.
This is the greatest of Democracy....I love it😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
do any of these people understand US law maybe they should move to move to another state or another country
"Abortion, ah, the ultimate bright shiny object!  The Orange Fuehrer and his Turd Riech has just hammered down the last coffin nail for the Republican party.   Has anyone thought of why did the Supreme Court dropped this decision before the midterms?  To deflect from the January 6th committee dominating the news.  Clarence Thomas is neck deep in the conspiracy to overthrow democracy and is trying to keep himself and his wife out of jail.  Remember the line Trump used to pressure Georgia secretary of state Raffensberger?  ""You just find me 11,000 votes and the Republicans in congress and the court will do the rest!"".  The January 6th committee want to talk to Ginny Thomas about trying to overthrow democracy.   Boom!  Roe vs Wade is overturned!   So now January 6th is back burner and Abortion is the new fight, which just, finally, will give total congressional control to the Democrats.   The dog just caught the car.  And fascism was at the wheel."
they will be going after birth control next...
"Thank you democrats. Just please keep voting for Biden, and Pelosi. We couldn't have done it without you."
"now Kavanaugh can rape through the US without feeling bad about killing the unborn... Next goal: women-voting rights, i guess. Or, stop female education...
USA. you are insane..."
Abortion should not be a constitutional contraceptive for bad behavior bad decisions between men and women
This country is dying as fast as Lake Mead.😔

"“I don’t view Abortion as a Choice and a Right, I think it’s always a tragedy” - Senator Joe Biden, 2006."
It’s not a constitutional right.Get your facts straight!
"What time is it? Time for a constitutional amendment. Maybe to revive the ERA. Maybe to bring back Roe Vs Wade. Maybe to increase the number of SCotUS Justices. Maybe to revise the 2nd amendment.  Maybe something else, It's time to restore the rights that the GOP wants to take away. Make America a leader in human rights again."
"What do you get when you order a president through the mail? An unbroken string of victories like this one right here. Good job, democrats. 👍"
Pph actually lowered the black pop to 12 .4%.
If you are all about medical advances then there is no need for surgical abortion which doctors profit from aborted fetal parts in most cases.There is no financial gain from taking medication to dissolve a pregnancy.That is what this is about.
"Dear pro lifers... you are more than welcome, because I don't make choices for you, to have all the babies your little heart desires.  But don't shove your choice on me.  You do not have that right.  I don't like men with beards... so every man should shave to suit me.  It should be federal law.  Same for tattoos.  If I do not have a right to my body, no one else should have that right.   Also, pro lifers, please pop out more so we can ensure we add to the workforce and foster homes and adoption agencies.  We are doing such a good job of caring for them now.  
You need to do some research on oxygen.  Only 2 things live on this planet without oxygen.  You know, breath of life and all that.  A fetus is not a living breathing baby until such time.  period.  
I can assure you women have very serious talks with God when it comes to this type of decision.  YOU are not God... YOU are not there.... YOU do not know what path God has planned for that person.  YOU are. not. God.  
Your spoiled snot nosed little sheep that think you have the right to be gods..."
I hope those States are prepared to assist the Mother to rear  that child to responsible adulthood!
How can we punish the people that put Trump in office that led to this?
So those 11 States being USA will abort their children while they are at school age in mass shootings.
Democrats seem hell bent on pushing population off the proverbial “cliff” lol Agenda 21 and 30? Paying employees to fly and get an abortion doesn’t that cause a big Carbon footprint? Are they gonna take an electric car? Where does the source of electricity come from wind? Lol The hypocrisy on Democrats is un real open your eyes and ears people don’t be so simple minded. Scientists want the embryonic cells for future vaccines and plandemics.
If democrats want to keep on  winning victories like this then they should just keep on voting for the leadership they've been voting for. Thank you Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden. Good job. 👍
They keep saying my body my choice and they are 100% correct. They have the choice to keep their legs closed.
Like Germany Italy and other countries the states set a time limit like 40 weeks. NY aborts them at the birth day.
So those judges would celebrate the new life to be when a teenage  family member is raped….
"Terra nullius is a Latin expression meaning ""nobody's land"". It was a principle sometimes used in international law to justify claims that territory may be acquired by a state's occupation of it. The State is occupying Vaginas."
RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY is alive and well in these states!!!
"Here's my next observation. How is Texas or any other state going to prevent me from freely traveling to an abortion friendly state, how is that going to work. Maybe I misunderstood, if I go to another state then Texas can prosecute me? How is that going to work? I didn't commit a crime in Texas, I'm puzzled. If I murder someone in NY state, Texas can't prosecute me. I have to be extradited back to NY.  Another question. Mothers who abuse illegal narcotics during their pregnancies, are they going to be prosecuted for the damage to the baby? A heroin addict can't have an abortion so she births an addicted baby, if nothing else think of the costs associated with the long term care of this child....maybe money will make it mean something to you pro-lifers, the human suffering is making no dead way."
But who gets arrested?
Beware the Theocrats.
"I think its hilarious how we're acting like women are randomly waking up the next morning with unwanted pregnancies, as if they didn't make the decision to have sex in the first place."
Good no more killing babies
"YES THEY LIED UNDER OATH WHAT IS THERE PENALTY 🤔🧐just my opinion and thought. 
This is Bull 🐂 Sugar Honey Ice Tea and they know it  .. So when one there family members whomever it is need to due what they just outlawed &  passed let's make sure News 📰🗞️ Media is there to report it.  This is .just my opinion keep a 👁️👀 eye out.  Even the news media family members who agree with the decision. Just my opinion 🤔"
😂 remember the female doctors and nurses that were among the group of other doctors and nurses in different cities in America that were fighting against hospital mandates to juice people. Where were the pro abortion people for support. Where was my body my rights for support. See . This is definitely about money.  Definitely about white people depopping themselves. And a big thanks to Soros for the pro abortion people protesting now when they should had been in protest from the use of the juice to now . I guess Soros had to refill his cash flow for a while . See God is getting ready to bring women to their knees now. God is going to put limits to women freedoms no matter what. Welcome to Jacob's trouble Karen and liberal women .
"Those with money or influence, will not be affected."
"You should show a list on the screen. Show it every day.
Keep a death toll, as well."
"If we look at the striking down of Roe v. Wade in the context of Trump's coup attempt with the massive assistance of his Republican co-conspirators, with those same legislators further abrogating their sworn duties to uphold our Constitution and actually do their jobs rather than obstruct everything they can, then it becomes obvious that the Republican Party is thoroughly corrupt and seeks to destroy our democracy for only one thing and for only ITS benefit, not America's-- power.  Does anyone in his right mind want to give ANY power to this criminal cabal of traitors?  No, I don't think so, either."
Constitutional right to kill babies.
Let's hope this attack on womens rights  sends them straight to the ballot box!
Thank you Harry Reid and Ruth Bader Ginsberg. We couldn't have done it without your help.
"Reproductive freedom, same sex marriage, immigration, social programs, control of arms of war, poor people opportunities to have a house, good education, health services, a government that work for all and not for the riches. Those rights are on the election on NOVEMBER VOTE VOTE VOTE WE KNEW W WE ARE MAYORITY WE ARE MORE !!!!!!"
If they  try to band birth control  for  women  does  that  include  condoms  that  help prevent  STDS  ?
"I'm a semi retired activist of 25 years on all human rights anti war in the 90's was a very lonely movement. I always encouraged younger people to never take any of our freedoms for granted begging young people to be vigilant about abortion and usually it was an ""OK, boomer"" response but I warned about selfish unimaginative right wingers want to take away safe legal abortion and frankly if they could take right to vote as a women too. Take nothing for granted. I am however still totally amazed that I had more rights in 1991 age 21 than women do now. We need to fight hard voting rights is also on the chopping block. Women have always been undermined in patriarchy. At least todays women won't be screaming into the wind as I did in the 1990s nobody cared much then. There was no social media to organize with except newsletters. Remember the words of the great Fredrick Douglas who did activism with the suffragetes ""Power concedes nothing without struggle."" Well Woe to the vanquished because we will devastate the GOP in the house and senate. Look out for Harris county and gerrymandering."
The unborn only wish they were worth “three-fifths”.
Most of these states don’t even allow exceptions for rape or incest. Republicans don’t think there won’t be backlash.
"The Supreme Court giveth, and the Supreme Court taketh away."
Talk is cheap. Someone has to take their case to Supreme court again
"There some elements of the  dystopian science fiction of the Handmaidens Tale, are beginning to look like a documentary commentary in some red states. It will not be sufficient to ban abortion in these states, it will be necessary to restrict the movement of potentially pregnant women, to stop them leaving to have abortions in other states. They may face arrest on return, should they leave for such operations. Natural miscarriages will be subject to legal investigation. This is simply following the change in the law to its logical conclusion."
Abortion was never a constitutional right. It's not in the Constitution.
"Leave those states, reduce the population, that way you reduce the numbers of sits in the congres and the power of those who dont care about what the people needs and want"
"Who voted again? oh wait, it's the people... So who's fault is it that these laws are made? You guessed it! Might not be what you want, but you should consider that when you vote someone into power😂"
"It’s so funny that the Oklahoma governor said “Oklahoma is now the safest place for a child to be” when the state is ranked third to last for overall newborn healthcare, labor and delivery. Seriously the hypocrisy knows no bounds."
"A sentence from Rui Barbosa (a lawyer that was 3 times presidential candidate in Brazil in the beggining of the 1900's and consider one of the most brilliant minds that ever existed in Brazil) says: ""The worst dictatorship is the one coming from the judicial power, against which there is nobody to whom one can appeal"". This decision from the SCOTUS against the overwhelming majority of the american population is raw judicial dictatorship."
"Damn right, it will be bad for Republicans. I was going to vote Red before, because Republicans were promising to improve economy. Now I realized their word means nothing, when 3 of their conservative judges lied to be confirmed. I am voting Democrat now, hope many other women will too."
The red trailer trash states will be asking for larger handouts.
"There's zero parental leave, healthcare, social services, affordable housing, safe schools etc AND there's already a huge shortage of foster homes and too many of the existing foster homes aren't properly vetted.

What could possibly go wrong?"
Sex with women should be illegal unless for the puposes of childbirth. Problem solved.
Welcome to the republican caliphate
If a woman is already paying for the abortion then why is Planned Parenthood being funded by the government? If the government is funding the abortion why is Planned Parenthood charging the woman anything for the abortion?
but it takes two
FACT: Abortion cannot be banned unless an election is held statewide and voters make the decision. State legislators can only act on voting results.
Fk fanatical fascists!
Cool...the will of the people!
"The 3 trump puppets should be impeached for perjury, occuring during their confirmation hearings. Just more lying pub garbage."
psychopathic democrats want to kill babies in the name of womens health!!! That proves they are EVIL!!!!
"The ""pro life"" should start paying the child support, since they wanna be the baby daddy of all the children that get ""saved"" from abortion."
The trouble with any right a court gives you is a court can take that right back anytime it wants to.
Apparently it wasn’t constitutional.
Haha 😆 a Muslim woman at a abortion table telling women to vote
It's about time the constitution is followed and the people of the states are given back the power of the government!
When Americans start voting on abortion it's going to be illegal to get an abortion after the first trimester. That's going to cut into Planned Parenthood's profits significantly.
F—k i just moved to one of the states that banned abortions. I’m moving back
"It's really pretty simple to fix.  78% of the country disagree with banning abortion.   So get off your lazy azzes and vote in November.   If you vote blue, you can finally put this issue to bed once and for all.  If you vote red, or fail to vote then you are giving the right permission to take away more freedom from you. SIMPLE LOGIC !!"
"Well then it sounds like alot of people don't support abortion in this country...

Welcome do democracy 

Deal with it you crybaby liberals"
"𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗨𝗽 𝗘𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗳 𝗢𝘂𝗿 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗡𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲

The United Nations recently celebrated the International Mother Earth Day as a reminder to protect the environment. Heat waves, droughts, fires and heavy rains that cause severe flooding have become more frequent in many parts of the world due to climate change, which affects the entire worldwide population.

The Earth is facing a “triple planetary crisis,” warn UN officials. Climate disruption, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste are the main areas of concern regarding the current state of the environment. This year, the Earth Day’s theme is “Invest In Our Planet,” so what would humanity's best investment for the planet be?

We need to start by cleaning up the planet. There is no place on Earth where the air and water are clean, and that's a real problem. In theory, tackling this issue should be our priority when it comes to taking action to improve the dismal state of our planet. But let’s not fool ourselves. Such a plan alone will solve nothing.

It will only help the international organizations to justify their own existence. They tick off ""done"" to raise as much money as they want, and that's it. If we do not improve relations between us, we will not be able to achieve the great and ambitious improvement in nature that we want and need to attain globally. We will never achieve a good result through bureaucratic, mechanical measures.

There are a lot of people sitting in their comfortable offices profiting from the environmental crisis and demanding money and respect. They keep flying from one end of the world to the other on all kinds of missions to make a lot of noise with what they are ""doing"" and which everyone ""needs to hear"" as if that alone means something is happening, but in practice we see no real progress. The Earth must also be cleansed of them, of these people who engage in useless campaigns that only cause harm because they mislead the world, leading it away from the real solution.

The cleaning of the planet should start inside out. If we do not clean the planet from within, and continue with our reckless behavior and the selfish nature of our hearts as before, nothing will change for the better. The immense sums invested in environmental initiatives should be directed to spreading an educational process aimed at improving the way we relate to each other.

Humans are the most developed and influential factors of all of nature's levels: still, vegetative, animate and human. Since we occupy the highest level in nature, positively affecting the environment, the climate, and nature in general can be achieved by reaching positive relations among us. On the contrary, by letting our divisive drives tear apart human relations, we also destroy our surrounding environment, the very nature that our lives depend on.

The more we humans are able to correct ourselves by changing our divisive attitudes toward each other into positive attitudes of mutual support, encouragement, mutual responsibility, and reciprocal concern, the more we will receive positive feedback from nature. And the more we develop without making this necessary correction, the more negative feedback we will receive from nature, as we have experienced in the form of natural disasters, pandemics.

It is of utmost importance for us to organize our thoughts, desires and qualities so that we understand that saving the environment and a shift to a better future depend solely on changing our attitudes to each other: from antagonistic egoism to positive, compassionate and cooperative relationships."

VOTE THE REPUBLICANS OUT!
Funny how the focus is on 'red' states whereas Democrats haven't done anything to put a law on the books since Roe to protect Women either...
"The GOP took the choice away from Americans and gave it to the government. They are fascist, plain and simple."
Republicans will not stop until there is a complete country wide ban codified in Congress.  Do not give them the Congress or presidency.  I guarantee that is their next step. They will also go after gay rights as well.
States consider an embryo 'property' by the state.   So your 5 week old embryo is now owned by the state.   Honestly disturbing they completely ignored the 11th amendment.
The Repuglican party is boldly leading America into the 19th Century.
Democrats shouldn't be surprised that Joe Biden is mucking  everything up. That's what you get when you order a president through the mail.
How is it a constitutional right? It's not.
"What is going to happen to the innocents that are born to mothers who simply don't want a child? I don't want to get in to the right or wrong just the outcome. What will happen to these babies who grow up, if they survive, to be adults? Our foster care system is horrible, list to what the kids say that have been shuttled from foster to foster. How many will be adopted successfully, a family that will cherish & love beyond measure. What will happen to the babies that stay with the mothers who didn't & don't want them? Lots of physical & emotional abuse is my guess. Are the legislators, justices, pro-life folks going to step up and care for these children? Of course they aren't. They talk it but don't ask them to walk it, inconvenience themselves....This isn't just about abortion, what about the devastating effects this reckless decision will have on the innocents?"
It’s amazing the BS that these continue to spill. PRO-CHOICE ALL THE WAY!!!!!
The best possible scenario was to have abortion legal: Those who choose to have abortion have the right and others can choose not to have one. Now EVERYONE cannot choose. There is no choice here

"The good news is, they didn't take any rights away from men.

Vote those Republicans out
V.O.T out Republicans
The states are cultivating laws they have their hand on the plow. Trying to grow the law in every state. Where the federal government says Roe versus Wade we shouldn't make laws governing abortion. Maybe that's good for the goose is good for the gander State shouldn't be making laws about abortion. Leave it up to the doctors in the patient
Interesting that it's mainly the lighter-skinned that are protesting all over and up in arms. Where is the diversity on this topic?
Since Joe Biden has come to power democrats have suffered an unbroken string of losses. Everything he touches turns to disaster.
"I'm pro-choice, but since democrats are so anti-America and insane on every other issue facing our country,.....I can't vote blue."

"They’re pretending there is a problem with white reproduction rates. Spoiler alert, America has the largest white population in the world.

"The Republicans are anti-freedom, and they only preach about ""freedom"" when it comes to their own needs, even if it means ruining our country."
I'm glad abortion is now illegal. Women have lived their life on easy mode never having to deal with accountability every terrible decision they made the law was always on their side to help them but not anymore.  It started with the Depp and Heard case and now this and I'm ALL FOR IT
"Hey, how about that, democracy in action!"

Abortion is no different than walking into a school and shooting children. At least the kids have a chance to run away. 
If you had a abortion your a depraved murder."

The Supreme Court has taken women to the 1500/1800 periods. Please watch the movie Homesman directed by Tommy Lee Jones and Hilary Swank. The SCOTUS want women having babies NOT to compete with jobs that should only go to white men.
"If you want to restrict abortion then surely you support welfare for all those poor babies, right? No. Because it isn't about children. If they actually cared, the foster care system wouldn't be unable to house the kids in the system, we wouldn't have street kids with no place to lay their heads, and poor mothers wouldn't feel hunger and desperation. They don't care about children."
If men would just keep their pants on!!
Muslim in favor of abortion right😂😂😂😂 fasigh
Well Child surpport will go up I hope all these new dad's that live in Ban States are ready to pay and the big hike in goverment assistance to house and feed the Children. Great Job Supreme Court.
Is abortion mandatory for all women? I'm really confused because I know multiple women who will never think about abortion.
We really hate each other..that is the tragedy...I wish we could get a divorce...the ununited states caused by these republican conservatives nutz
"The tragically absurd thing is that these people say they HATE religious extremists from other countries. Yet here they are, the Christian Taliban....forcing Christian Sharia Law down our throats. All due to the Conservative Mullahs on the Supreme Court. Vote, women, vote. In Iran and Afghanistan in the 70s, women wore what they wanted, married who they wanted, became doctors and lawyers and, in the space of a single year, it was all ripped away by the Religious Right in THEIR countries. In the blink of an eye, they became property with no rights. If you thought ""that can't happen here""....it IS happening. Right Now. This is step one. Unless you fight back through engagement in the democratic process, through words, through solidarity with your sisters."
"Democrats will continue to pay the price for as long as they think that the filibuster is more important than the rights of women, just like Pelosi did when she pushed for an Anti-Choice candidate over a pro-choice, pro-worker candidate. As long as Dems gang up on progressives, the ""regressives"" in the GOP will keep getting away with murder. 

And quit blaming the corrupt justices for this; it is the Democrats who allowed this to happen by protecting the filibuster. So, yes, SUFFER!"
Boycott products sold by those States. Don't travel there. Starve the Ameri-Talibans

11 red states  given power  by gerrymandering . they also  dont want  anyone but  their  base they have voting .
I want to join the army like Emma. Defending her country and marching for equality with her two mums while being told they can't have an abortion after getting raped 🕺💨💩🇺🇸 Never been so proud to fight not only for oil buy also for women's rights 😂🤷 Shithole US! Imagine living abroad and just watch 2020 Season 3 of the USA. Keep going and more guns. I heard season 4 gonna be wild 😂
"I don’t see how a Federal law legalizing abortion is going to negate an existing state law criminalizing it. I hope that can happen, but, we’ll see. People have got to realize, voting is always more than simply voting for a candidate or a Party. It affects policy and lives."

could be just a stunt  too get eyes of the treason of jan 6th .the lack of morals allows the owners of the party of the rich  to do what ever their  far right  fascist  bosses  tell them too do. if you live under the fiction  that we are no more then slaves  as far as the far right rich see us. think again. for sure their  women  will have the  power to chose to have kids or not. if your not  rich .if uncle  crazy  gets hi on drugs and  rapes you at  12 years of age  your having  that cock eyed   kid .its no longer up to you. your mom or  any sane person. its up to  some old  man with preg  envy .its a private issue only the women  involved needs to face. not a  neo fascist   tyrant  g o p  fanatic   that  stole  office via gerrymandering. or  by the 1804  electoral college . elect  democrats and they can  amend the  constitution  too match the needs of the people. not  some  c e o of cult of personality   nut case  we never give the most votes too.  we would use the popular  vote and ban gerrymandering  if the dems  get the power to do  so.

The most dangerous place for a child to be is in the shower with Joe Biden.
God wins! Those against God will lose.
Some of them do not even have an exception for rape and incest.  That is sick.
More states will join them and then the real political fight will start to clean up the rest now that the courts have eliminated that roe wall of protection.
And if you think that abortion rights for women are the only law that the far-right extremists are banning then better wake up! They will attack everything that American democracy holds dear and come after every progressive accomplishment that there exists. It is time to finally treat this people as real domestic enemies to USA who have now infiltrated the government. I'm serious. And jail Trump! Don't wait until they will do more damage to America before the world won't recognize this country anymore. It's going sectarian backwards 200 years at least.
The Supreme Court was supposed to protect citizens instead of fighting against them.
It's unrealistic to think that the recent decision by the Supreme Court and states enacting laws will actually stop abortions.  What they will do is stop safe abortions.
"""Reproduction freedom is on the ballot in November.""  --Nancy Pelosi

Reproductive freedom has been on the chopping block for decades and the feckless Democrats have done NOTHING to prevent this day.  They care more about the filibuster than your rights."
Pro choice states should boycott antichoice states .all anti choice states are red states with no economy and rely on federal money just to operate at a deficit .
"Come and have a vacation in Canada , we are a free society"
No child is safe in this country with  all the guns and mass shootings.
"If people only knew the actual procedure and how abortions are performed, they might change their opinion"
Ban and confiscate all guns in America.
Last time abortion was illegal a man could say it wasn't his and skip town. Men have almost zero parental rights already in conservative states. A woman can put a baby up for adoption the father will pay child support no matter what. At any time over the last 50 years congress could have passed a law. So every 4 years abortion and the Mexican border gets brought up to distract you from the fact your children have no future.
"I’m pretty sure she has the right to choose if she wants to get pregnant in the first place. Accidental, incest and rape make up less than 1% of abortions"
Time for guns to be up to individual states.
Red states government are pushing restrictions against people just like in ww2.
Margret Sanger founded Planned Parenthood to control the populations of people of color.
this is effectively bs 😏
Rest of world should look at America. If you vote for looney this is what you get.
Pretty sickening that the first effort put forth from this Attorney General is to activate law enforcement. Nothing about getting healthcare coverage for pregnant women or maternity leave. Nothing about helping these women that will be affected not to mention the poor children that they are forcing to come in to this world. Obviously it’s never been about the sanctity of life. Punishment is what they have wanted. These people are dangerous to society and are trying to take us back to a time when women were the property of their fathers and husbands.
📺 this is only a break from January 6th regular programming 🧠
The US now effectively a kangaroo Supreme Court
There's a reason why abortion bans disproportionately affect women of color. 46% of abortions are performed on women of color. There's a reason for that too. Margret Sanger planned it that way.
"I can't wait to look at the shock on female right-wing supporters as it finally affects them personally instead of plain politics in taking sides, after being so brainwashed all these while. I bet they be like after the abortion ban, ""You say, what?!"""
"Pelosi is quite hilarious. Women are still able to make their own decision but BEFORE having a baby. If you dont want to give birth dont get pregnant. You still have a choice. You dont decide to create life to only then question ""do I want this or not"" you simply do it before."
This is ridiculous..I can't believe they overturned it. What kind of country is this because it's definitely not a free one. Good America you failed again

The republicans haven’t offered a better solution to any problem since 1861.
You might want to check your facts before you start spouting off about matters of any importance. Nowhere in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights is abortion the legal means to kill a baby legal means to kill a unborn baby spoken of or addressed even in the slightest. And since it's not in either of those documents it definitely is not a Constitutional right for women to be able to have an abortion. There is no wonder why so many Americans consider CNN fake news; this is a prime example.
When this republican party gets there agenda done We the people will have No rights....what will you cling on nut huggers who voted for them do then..😭😭😭
"All Republicans, don't forget TRUMP added the Judges that overturned Roe!  This is another Mess your guy is responsible for. Now deal with it. LOL! 68% of the country was against this ruling.  Once again, he could not care less about the majority."
24 weeks ? WTF
"Bad times in America. Progress of the last 50 years destroyed for women by Trump loyalists in the now corrupted Supreme Court who want to enforce their religious beliefs on all American women. There is only one who is so happy about all of this, and that's Marjorie Taylor Greene, that traitor. I put her on spot in the first video in my playlist, because I don't want her to get away with it."
"If you dont want to live in the handmaids tale, then dont give up your right to bear arms"
Thirteen not 11.  CNN can't even be honest with that.  If I watch CNN does that double their viewership?
If a state forces a minor to have a baby shouldnt they be responsible for all cost including food and clothing
Just move to California. Sure gas is $8 a gallon and 1/10th of the state is homeless because homes cost $800k. But you're free to abort those clumps of cells and smoke dope all day!!!!
"Women in these states need to start thinking of privacy, browser/apo data could get them a murder charge now.  If states can request data from Facebook, Google   Microsoft, etc.

Using Tor and Linux should become the norm"
"I supposed to good news is this tidbit of red meat for republicans is likely to get even some Republican voters to vote against them.  It is also likely to motivate so-called undecided voters to actually go out and vote which will most likely be blue.  Effectively, I predict that we are going to see a turnout for a state voting that we've never seen before in order to show where the people actually are on this issue.

Also I suspect conservative voices who were concerned about the domestic supply of children in the Foster care system are really just looking for a lot of kids that are going to screw up their lives and feed into the prison system in order to provide crap loads of virtually free labor for States and some corporations that depend on it.  The other big concern that I've seen for the future, is the prediction that the white race is going to become a minority given the birth rates of white families.  Wealthy people do not have as many children as not so wealthy people there's no need.  As such white families tend to be waiting later in life before actually having a baby if they have a baby at all.  And it doesn't compare to poor families of Hispanic descent which tend to have about five or six kids out of necessity considering that about half of them are not going to make it to adulthood if the police have anything to do with it.  To similar story with black families.  But now that we've taken abortion off the table, we are instead looking at flooding the United States with babies of all races.  Or more specifically we're going to be flooding red states with babies of all races, meaning these otherwise predominantly white States are now going to have lots and lots of babies of color and they're going to lose their majority.  This is kind of counterintuitive to the whole white nationalism thing.  Which to me kind of shows that these guys do not think ahead at all at least not very well. 

 It's kind of like the whole anti-science agenda you want a great United States and yet you do everything you can to put sticks and sabot into the gears of science and progress.  This in turn weakens the United States and to becoming inferior to other countries."
"Oh no you mean the voters get to decide?
That's a Democrats worst nightmare"
its not like  women  are stopped from having  kids. the reason for this is too cause  discourse   .100%  divide and conquer .its the g o p party of the rich way post nixon. it works until they  screw things up so bad it dose not work.  if your not rich and want too decide   that you  own your body  you best stop voting the  slave maker party of the far right neo fascist  g o p .simple.
It's debates like this that ruin the political discourse in America. Trotting out a statement that abortion rights may not be on the ballot in November because it's not the #1 concern is incredibly condescending to the voting public.  People are capable of considering more than one policy topic you know.
"""11 states effectively ban abortion?"" Ah, so these are the 11 welfare states who love paying their poor women and men food stamps and checks and then sending their kids off to get slaughtered in the army."
"The dumb Supreme Court just gave the Democratic Party super majority in November and I love it.

"I'm old enough to remember the time before Roe.

For a woman to vote republican is the same as the abused posting bail for her abuser.
This is going to be SO bad for Republicans.  Just the 65% voting blue will give the Senate the ability to codify into law a woman's right to choose nationwide.  VOTE in the mid-terms!!
Who the hell does the conservative Supreme Court judges think they are? The only reason that they did this is to keep capitalism the consumer and low wage tax payer strong for the future.. Telling you that you that authoritarian corpo-fascist ideology is in control cause the didn't want to financially help Americans that much they cut unemployment they cut and limited stimulus and try to blame the financial help that most of us hadn't seen in years no raise in the minimum wage assholes tried to cheat to keep a stupid fuck and a cheat in power cops shooting unarmed citizens and fuckers ducking and covering when one kid with one weapon is killing children and lying to the public about their response and heroism these people need to be taken out Trump his henchmen his stupid lying followers Congress needs to put term limits on Supreme Court judges any one who would flag a comment about Trump being taken out is part of them.remember his buddy is killing civilians in an illegal war.. Committing war crimes lies about election fraud created a coup that got people killed.. Fuck Trump and anyone follow him
Let the hillbilly inbreeding begin.
"As an African-American man, I honestly don't support abortion, with that said, I vehemently support and served for a decade defending one's personal and private right to choose.

I identified my race, because African-American women will suffer more than anyone due this this ruling.

I identified my sex, because I wanted to express that regardless if I was Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, African-American, I am a MAN, I should shut my damn mouth and stay in my lane when it comes to telling a women what to do and not to do with her body!"
"Perhaps its a good thing for red state economies.  

It will create lots of business for illegal abortionists, who will need: schedulers to set up the illegal appointments (probably working from out of state); assistants to dump the bleeding women in an alley, when the procedure has unforeseen complications; lawyers, to keep them out of jail...  A new cottage industry."
"To all women who value their privacy and decisions made between themselves and their doctors, and the men who agree with that, let's support states that support those rights. That includes tourist dollars, goods and services to shore up tax dollars to states that uphold women's rights. We are far from powerless and we know it."

It was never an abortion issue. It's about a womans right to self determination about her own body and her own life. Remove the first and how fast will the rest be removed. When I was younger my mother could not have her own credit card or even her own bank account. She had to Prove she couldn't get pregnant to get a mortgage loan for a house. Ect ect ect!

Why is this bad for republicans

Why should any state get to force thier beliefs on another group of people .abortion should be a woman’s choice between her own conscience and her doctor.that’s true freedom.that’s separation of church and state. Why should republicans get to take away anybody’s right to thier freedom of choice politics should not play a part in abortion at all.the republicans claim they care about life of a child until that life is hunted down at school by the second amendment...if one woman wants an abortion she should ba able to get one and if another woman does not believe in it she doesn’t;t have to. It;s that simple.people who are for abortion are not telling people who are against abortion to have one it;s the other way around people who are against abortion are the one;s trying to force thier beliefs on people who are pro abortion and that is not right.
The left can’t define what a woman is much less define a person or life . This is the result . You lefties voted for big government and you got it . You guys preach “democracy” now you have it . You now get to vote in your state on abortion. That’s the democratic process. Welcome to America learn to cope
TALIBAN supreme court taken over women right ✅️ 😒 😴 🙄
"For all the money red states are spending on denying abortion, how much are they spending to help with childcare, a living wage, education, health care, and safe affordable housing? I’m guessing the contrast is stark. It’s talk to line their golden pockets. It’s never been about abortion."

It shouldn't be the mainstream democratic party job to fight an extremist party.

Anyway, congratulations to all Oklahoma women - you are now listed at the bottom of the food chain - just below plankton.   You will have to look above your position to see microscopic human embryos."
This is brought to you by the same people that ended free lunch for children.
Banning things dont mean there a going away. So what are the GOP doing to prevent unwanted pregnancies: absolution not sexual health education i guess as they did under the Bush administration. You need to understand that many democratic countries are not taking The US seriously anymore.
"Lol, this story is so easily verified false.
The court ruled that Texas has the constitutional right to limit abortion after a heartbeat is detected. CNN is listing Texas as “banning all abortion”. NOT TRUE!
In Texas abortion before a heartbeat is still legal.
How many lies does it take to show how dishonest this network is.
The courts heard this case because the Left challenged the “heartbeat law”. Roe failed because the left’s desire to have zero limits applied to abortion."
Is divorce still legal in US??
"In 1861 republicans put an end to Democrats slavery and dehumanization of blacks.

Is the womb really the safest place to be Oklahoma??  What about drugs or alcohol?  There are some women that need help and can’t get it!  Why add a pregnancy to this serious issue??
Now we know why Trump surrendered to the Taliban:  He IS the Taliban...

You reply, ""But I'm not blind!"" Actually, yes you are. Spiritually. Only once your blindfold is removed and you give your life to Jesus Christ will you realize you've lived your life in utter darkness. Hopeless and destined for an eternity in hell. But it doesn't have to be that way because Jesus loves you and died in your place so that you can live forever with Him. Sin causes blindness that separates you from the saving light of Christ. When you repent of your sins and accept His sacrifice on the cross, He removes your blindfold. We are approaching some really dark times ahead according to Bible prophecy. Now is the time to wake up and see what's going on. You can have peace instead of fear and joy instead of depression. Please give Him your life before it's too late. I'll be praying for the removal of your blindfold. God Bless."
"Liberals will need to learn about contraception, abstinence, or anal sex!"
Those children end up dying in school gun shooting
Racist and misoginist those states.
They need to band abortion in all states. There is such a thing as birth control pills condoms you can have a shot so you don't get pregnant. It is against the law for mother to murder her child but because it is in her that's okay. At 5 months the child was pretty much formed. Just because a woman is in responsible and gets pregnant then she has the right to murder her child I don't think so. Need to change Nationwide and ban abortion
I am sure that these states are all proud of themselves.  Let's see how they react when their mistress or teenage daughter needs an abortion? See the law doesn't just apply to democrats.

So, therefore, we're at a place where, we must expand to balance the SC, abolish the filibuster AND, immediately thereafter, codify voting rights protections, then, with real votes COUNTED, win elections.
Democratic policy builds a middle class, our only hope to thrive as a nation.
The Dems have waffled in denial for too long. We may be out of time--immediately, abolish the filibuster and expand SCOTUS to balance, or we literally lose American's fundamental DEMOCRACY.
The ignorance, cynicism, & denial of too many MILLIONS of Americans is horrifying. 80 million eligible voters DID NOT VOTE. Yet, they fully expect their lives to improve---if they don't start voting, and Voting pro-democracy, Blue, the Constitution becomes a mere artifact."

No change in hormones. No physical change. No labour, birth, lactation etc etc.  He can continue education, career as if nothing happened!

"These ""pro life"" extreme right-wingers say they even oppose the elimination of a one month old embryo which has not taken a definite life form and cannot think or see or act in any manner. That embryo should not be eliminated even for the protection of the mother. That means they really don't care about the 'life' of the mother. Moreover, these same people most fervently support the use of guns even by children for so called self-protection. But the vast number of gun related deaths happen in the US are not incidences of self-protection but mass shootings, violent gun crimes and aggravated assaults. These 'pro life' people really don't care about those tens of thousands of 'lives' as well. These same right-wing people are big supporters of the US military and their numerous wars around the world. What about the millions of 'lives' killed in those wars? They really don't cared about those million lives as well. It seems, in real terms, they are very much ""anti-life""."
GOOD !!! some of these foolish women use abortion for another way of birth control !!!
"Don't be misinformed. This is not about dem or republican, not about black or white, equal rights, or even just about abortion. It is about an unseen battle going on between light and darkness.

Why would anyone want to be born to someone who doesnt want them ? So take of the future mothers then adopt them out to parents who are new born with drug or other problems to begin with. One drug lady can get 10 kids pimp them while getting welfare free housing free medical care . Or better yet ophans who cant get a family will get them when their crack head adopted padents go to jail. End up instuationed for life. Better lets lock the insame up like them were before.  Get a bunch of wire clothes hangers as plastic has replaced most and break while giving abortions. The law will change back when the goverment ( rich) realize how much money their loosing with clinics closed. Why do you think probation was revoked?  Your loosing money. Who gives a sht that peopleike to fk. Thats what makes the world go round !

"It is horrible, obviously, but it is also fascinating. These politicians must be sure that doing this will help them in the upcoming elections, even though polls indicated that the vast majority of voters is against abortion bans. So ... do these politicians know something that we don't know? To me, this seems like political suicide, and totally unnecessary: They could still do all those horrible things after the midterms. They waited since 19873, surely they could wait half a year more.

Jesus is not pleased that so many are fighting to kill unborn children. Remember Satan  killed babies to try to prevent the birth of Moses and Jesus. Being born poor is better than being killed.

LOL they act as if voting rights haven't been blocked at every level.
Interesting that Oklahoma Goes straight to law enforcement strategies instead of health and social support of those who would have had their abortions legally and safely otherwise. Nothing about recognising the injustice of natural abortion events being safeguarded from law enforcement agencies. Force is the operative word and clear intention. Life is precious and God is good - I don 't think so!
"USA has lost the moral ground of accusing other countries of human rights violations.  In many countries, abortion is protected by law, not court decision.  USA just join a few countries in the world that abortion is banned or restricted.  Countries from Japan to India to Canada, as well as most of Europe, women can safely access abortion either on request or based on broad social or economic grounds."
A state can't ban a pregnant woman from traveling out of state for an abortion
So that means you flakes have 39 states yall can move too so you can toss your baby's out. 🤔  get moving.
"If the SCOTUS decision was based on federal over-reach on an issue they said belonged to the states, how can they turn around and make a federal ban? They claimed this was not even about abortion. How can states take their laws and try and exert them in other states? This is stupid on steroids. Women should realize this is an attack on their autonomy and equality regardless if they themselves would access an abortion. These absolute bans can affect their daughters, grandchildren, sisters, and nieces. Imagine rape, incest, and the health of the mother all being ignored by MEN who are more concerned with how many white babies can they FORCE women to have."

The current Supreme Court is most definitely NOT ‘conservative’. They are radical, reactionary, fascists (at least the perjurious five who voted to cancel Roe v Wade); enemies of progress, humanity, humanism, science,  and democracy…and anti-conservatives. Conservative justices respect ‘Stare Decisis’. 
Our only hope is VOTE DEMOCRATIC!!!

I still can't get over these hypocritical Republicans confirming Amy Coney Barrett as a conservative justice for the Supreme Court bench after the passing of Justice Ginsburg in the middle of an election, and during the pandemic, not to mention they were OK with her lying under oath about Roe V. Wade. This country is heading into dark times, and the Republicans are to blame for this. When it comes to the Republicans, it's ""freedom for me, and none for thee."" On that note, they need to remove ""land of the free"" from the lyrics to ""Star Spangled Banner"", because this country is far from free, and it's all because of the Republicans."
What happens next ?  More dead women & girls . Foster care overwhelmed . And more babies in dumpsters.
Please VOTE BLUE TO SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY FROM THE DISGUSTING GQP AND ORANGE CLOWN CULT MEMBERS!!! 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Fuck the Democrats. Now you're trying to save face... Used this for years as a political tool. Good luck to that party ever doing something for the people. Can hardly help people who are already struggling now... Hahahaha
Essentially the people who support this are the same people who are likely to dissolve responsibility when children are being born into poverty.
Next up...election decertification
Republicans are off their rockers it's ridiculous and SCARY where they are trying to take this country ...
I agree with CNN we should be militant about cutting defenceless babies into small chunks & then selling their body parts to cosmetic firms!!!!!!! How will Nancy Pelosi get by without her night creams????
"Every woman better come out and vote, I just registered my granddaughter that turned 18"
Roe versus Wade was never a constitutional right. All Roe did was make it legal to have an abortion anywhere in the US. It was never a right and never can be a right.
I for one has no respect or confidence in this supreme Court and even our current democratic folks in Congress and the president
America pride themselves on freedom. How free are you if you cant choose to get an abortion.

"Anyone who votes Republican has no right to complain about this. Republicans, as a whole, have never hidden their agenda. Voters said, ""Oh, they say they want to overturn Roe, but it could never happen."" The GOP understands the political game better than Dems."

"To USA Women ... migrate to Australia. We love you. You have freedoms here that give you control of your own bodies. Also, a great Country to raise your kids ... there are NO School mass killings of your child (30 so far in USA, and we're only 1/2 way through the year ... 40,000 Gun related deaths in USA, EVERY YEAR, virtually ZERO in Australia), we have affordable Health Care for you, and no-one loses their House over Medical bills in Australia.

They don't even listen to doctors and scientists about when life begins. After birth they vote against every proposal to help mothers and children live. That's NOT pro-life!!!"
"I am not American but saw on piece about this on the international news. They were reporting that the US is no longer a free country because they have lost basic human rights to healthcare and privacy. This is terribly sad as the US used to be a respected nation. I support my American friends who are fighting for their freedom- you have international support- don’t give up.
Edit: The news was also reporting Ireland was in a similar situation years ago. They got the United Nations involved under international torture laws (forced birth being a form of torture). Perhaps it is an avenue for your country to explore as well."
ALL REPUBLICAN STATES. ITS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF WHAT THIS SUPREME COURT WILL TAKE AWAY FROM WOMEN .
Look at it this way. I’m a few years actual murder will probably be legal. Then we can wrap up a lot of issues a lot faster.
If women stopped having unprotected sex disease will go down too.
Mostly RED STATES ....GO FIGURE STUPID REPUBLICANS.
"We need to stop letting people get away with the idiotic ""life begins at conception"" myth. It is not a medical or scientific construct. Calling a fertilized egg an ""unborn child"" is stupid. I guess it makes conservatives feel morally superior. Now, that moron thomas wants to go after same-sex marriage. I thought it was a great example of societal progress, that, after Obergefell, people accepted it and moved on. It became a non-issue. Create more hate, clarence!"
Gawd dam conservatives are deplorables.

And it was the right decision to let the states decide they can still go to Democrat States it's just like everything in California causes cancer well all the other states disagree with you
"So stop and think about this.. If a woman cannot prove rape and she gets pregnant, she has to then go to court with her rapist and have a custody agreement. How is that ok? We have that going RIGHT NOW because the rapist is well connected in their town he got FULL CUSTODY of his rape victims child and she had to pay child support to her rapist! Are you guys out of your damn mind? So sitting in a room with men now women aren't equal with rights... Wtf is wrong with you Talibangelists?? Are men going to start being made to pay child support at conception too???"

Get over it. So you cant kill babies anymore. Find a new hobby like getting a job and moving outta mom and dad's house.
"If these people are so pro-life then, why are they not adopting children out of orphanages? I know why it's because they don't want the children either. And that's why abortions should be legal."
"It is disgraceful what USA have done ... taking the freedom from Women. This is a Human Rights abuse and should be looked into by the UN. Also, all Developed Countries should boycott going to USA until this abomination is removed. Half the USA citizens are Women ... hence USA has removed freedoms from over 180 Million citizens. Unheard of in a developed Country.

"Also, I'm pretty sure some women choose to seek abortions just to stay alive themselves, it's not to allegedly ""murder babies"" like Republicans claim. If the mother dies, the baby dies anyway, but Republicans didn't think about that either. Idiots."
"Always remember this and what republidiots  did.
And we need to show up in Nov
And get rid the idiots so they can't continue to take our rights away"
The party of small government and more freedoms has scared the living shit out of their base about liberals taking away their freedoms using big government for decades. This ruling is the antithesis of what the Republican party are supposed to stand for. This party of radical hypocrites believes their right supercedes the right to choose for the other 70%.
Well maybe if Democrats would have treated the judges a little nicer instead of putting them through a circus this wouldn't have happened did you think they forgot karma's a b**** and as far as abortions go with the rising inflation and recession they couldn't afford an abortion or the gas to get there
"Why don't they mention the fact that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer campaigned for an anti- choice Democrat, Henry Quaillar ( sp?)??!!!"

It's time to review and revamp all these small amendments and create a proper and definitive declaration of Human Rights in your country just like the majority of the Nations around the world have done decades ago.

Baby killing is insane. Millions of defenceless innocent babies deleted. Just sick. Try birth control going forward.
I'm disgusted by our Supreme court. We need forward thinking people in leadership roles in our Country not these cavemen.
This will result in young girls and women being butchered up and dying. A lot of misery for incest victims and rape victims. Shameful for a country like USA. America have their own religious fanatic Taliban…WOUW

"""A person is a person no matter how small."" - Dr Seuss"
The supreme court is using its faith to force women into slavery
The problem with people who believe in abortion is that they have a real big issue with when  an unborn child call can be called a human being.When does an unborn child go from being a foetus to a human being ?.Where is the cut off point? If a baby is half way in its mothers birth canal and half way out is it human? If a baby is no different 5 mins or five hours or five days before its born but for the fact that it is now outside the womb and its umbilical cord is cut is it now only considered human? When does it go from foetus to human being? People who belive in abortion really need to answer that Question.Im sure people who believe in abortion like being alive at this moment in time but yet say its ok to abort an unborn child if it needs be.An unwanted pregency is a hard thing for any womann no doubt but its not the end of the world and there are services that can help women in this difficult time im there lives and yes abortions happen more in less well of parts of society then in richer parts.The testimony of a former abortion doctor Dr Anthony Levatino to congress a few years ago is worth watching if your so sure abortion is a womans right to choose.
More to come.  Yay!

A show trial is a public trial in which the judicial authorities have already determined the guilt or innocence of the defendant. The actual trial has as its only goal the presentation of both the accusation and the verdict to the public so they will serve as both an impressive example and a warning to other would-be dissidents or transgressors.[2]

Soon contraceptives and minority rights will be gone, voting will be extremely hard if you are not a white evangelical fascist. Guys, do you really think voting doesn’t matter and both parties are the same, from my perspective I can actually see a slight difference! the big divider is Juridical laws or Religious laws. Right now Christian shariah laws are winning, abandoning the abortion law was a religious ruling."

There is nothing progressive about being pig-headed and refusing to admit a mistake. And I think if you look at the present state of the world it's pretty plain that humanity has been making some big mistakes. We're on the wrong road. And if that is so we must go back. Going back is the quickest way on.” - C. S. Lewis
"Why isn't cnn covering the riots? Or will they pass them over as ""mostly peaceful protest"" lol"
Children in these states are NOT safer. They are now endangered more because predators know they can rape a child and force her to birth his child. Unwanted children will be neglected and abused. This made children and women more at risk and gave power to the predators and men.
"Governments should start payment child support for every new pregnancy..   if is a life at 1 week, then pay the mother for that child."
it’s so sad to see us going back in history it’s mind blowing to see our rights being stripped away like it’s nothing
If you don't like the abortion laws in your state.    Move.... very simple.    Leftist socialist are too stupid to realize that.
👎🏻
"Evil Evengenital Kkkristian Republickkklans wrath against women was inevitable. Their fight against abortion was made through trillions of dollars of tax breaks for the Christian churches. They get $1 trillion worth of tax breaks every 12 years. That adds up. What the fuck do you think they’ve done with it? They’ve stacked the goddamn Supreme Court. It’s time to end tax exempt status for churches, Since they used it politically. Fuck the Christian churches with political power."
Ask yourself 'Why now?'. Why has SCOTUS chosen this timing to start revoking rights? Thomas has made it known that same sex marriage/adoptions and birth control/contraception is next. The SCOTUS which is there to interpret the law has been politicized and weaponized against the majority of Americans. This cannot stand!
If a clump of cells is now considered a person can  we now get life insurance for that person.
To the Midwestern states.Staying your ass at home= Trump+ conservative judges= Ban on abortion. Your fault Demofucked.
"11 states becomes the Republic Of Gilead , bet the ladies there ain't  too crazy about that 😂"
Remember democrats are in favor of murdering newborn babies that are alive and outside the womb. Just ask Gavin Newsome
Watch out for the death rate of women going up because of this. Some women who are stuck in situations are going to try to get out of it themselves instead of being able to go to professionals. This is so archaic.
"It was a democratic decision, you have to accept it"
It should be up to the states. That why you get to elect you local officials. The fed is too broad for such an issue
The male pill would make all of this laughable.
If your wife cheats and get pregnant you in trouble lol
Daily reminder that  rape babies and incest babies make up only 5% of abortions in America.
Just go on and bring back plantation slavery I mean why not sheesh
I haven't seen democrats so pissed off since we took away their slaves.
Why aren’t they interviewing men? Men can have periods and get pregnant according to the psycho lefties

Big shout out to all the abortion protestors that got arrested.  Let's go Karen
"How's Build Back Better going?
What was built back better???
Is ANYTHING better now than when Trump was in office?"
Court took this decision based on religion instead of being neutral
Sad republicans telling people what to do with their healthcare? Wow! Republicans want more laws and a bigger government?!?
No one lost any rights. How is CNN still in business?
This will only help the black community this black woman is paid to misinform her own community🤦🏾‍♂️
🍺🍺🍺🍺 for every Liberal going 🦍 😡
"Bye Roe vs Wade 👋
Cnn does more race baiting than Joy Reid"
"Colorado has abortion through the 9th month.
Enjoy!"
All three of trumps appointments for the court lied under oath and said they felt Roe v Wade was settled case law. And yet here we are. All three lied under oath to get the appointment.
"Good 👍. At least one good thing happened during the Biden Administration  term of office. 
And killing babies is NOT A RIGHT."
"Let’s see the financial plan for taking care of all these forced births?  This will increase poverty, depression, deaths, prison for children now known as foster care, disease.  This was never about women having body autonomy, it’s about power, hate and control of the majority of Americans."
And they will lose voter and tax revenue as people move away from their tyranny. Republicans effectively ended their careers this week.
"Our Founders warned us that our great freedoms were only fit for a moral and ethical society and one only needs to look at the headlines to see the Founders were correct. Thanks in part to Roe, we are no longer a moral and ethical society. It is high time we started on the road back to personal responsibility. SCOTUS nudged us a little in that direction."
No abortions = more welfare mothers and more foster children = higher taxes.
so DAD now you have an 18+ year sentence as well . Child support at a minimum
Taking away rights most likely never good. They can do this because it affects the poor.
"Truly, If any American actually understood the definition of Conservatism. They would find out it is the fundamental antithesis to what it means to be American.  Truly our nation is regressing under these Conservative "" Justices """
Child support really needs to start at the first missed period.
"Hay men pray for the health and safety of your woman because yours depends on it, oh and we are working on taking some rights from you."
I'm sure you guys are real proud huh.
ameristan........like Afganistan but with bacon
"I find ironic what the GOP christian conservatives did to undocumented children at the border and yet in the same breath say that the life of an undocumented unborn child is more important than abortion rights of a us citizen. Truth is, this is about religious fascism. We the people shouldn’t have to be forced to conform to christian idealism."
