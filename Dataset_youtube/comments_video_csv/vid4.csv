"Actually, if you don‚Äôt let the p‚Ç¨n!s in your vajay, that would be easier. Don‚Äôt create what you can‚Äôt feed. Wait until you are married."
"The trip gives you enough time to reflect, it would be cool to hear testimonies of people who changed their mind after realizing the actual effort to get one and ended up keeping the baby‚Ä¶"
Yon must be so proud of yourself killing your unborn baby and then posting this story as if you‚Äôre the victim. Bull S.
"What this beautiful young Queen signed up for and did may have been for herself but it was to another human being.  It's definitely more easier to end a life than to birth and raise a beautiful little one....She has chosen to terminate-to end the development and life of her recent little one and it's not right period though any and the lovely lady feels it's the best/right decision, it's very wrong.  Ending the life of your children based on your feelings or situation is never right!  Thanks for sharing  your story Queen Monica if you are seeing this comment (of course I love your name and I certainly speak life and love to you as you move forward on your journey; may you and everyone reading this comment receive much mercy hope and healing for your soul and be made whole). There is MORE to YOU than you know and you are not meant to be what you did or what was done to you.  May you find and become all that you were created to be"
Nothing ‚Äústunning and brave‚Äù about terminating a developing human life.
"I really don't see the problem. 
No one outlawed dumpsters."
What a beautiful human being! I‚Äôm so sad about what‚Äôs going on. She is so brave for sharing her story.
Thanks for sharing your story! You are an incredibly brave person ‚ù§Ô∏è
Stop using abortion as a contraceptive
"üáßüá∑Deus p√°tria fam√≠lia liberdade
Bolsonaro o melhor presidente do Brasil e do mundo inteiro!"
"Next time, don't cheat on your husband with something younger"
"Millions of typically Republican women and men will be secretly voting for the Democratic candidate in the midterms to ensure that women's reproductive rights are not taken away nationally but rather have those rights enacted into law by a Democratic House, Senate and Presidency."
"Sterilisation is also an option as even though I support abortion, the procedure of abortion is actually dangerous the older you get."
"Always have to use black Americans for this foolishness.
Why not other cultures? Disgusting"
I‚Äôm glad she survived the two hour drive.
How did she get pregnant?
"What this lady did for herself is very brave and courageous. And, there is nothing wrong with what she did either for it was the right decision for her life."

Women are going to continue to get abortions. This change will not stop that. Abortions go way back.  There will be illegal abortions somewhere too. That‚Äôs just my opinion.
Use contraceptives. It isn't rocket science.
Reminds me of that time Jeffery Dahmer had to go all the way to Chicago to dispose of body parts
It's call keep your legs close
*Here's a thought ---- close your legs !!! Or only do it in the rear !!!*
"Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if she couldn‚Äôt get it, and then has to explain to that child ‚Äúmommy almost flushed you down the toilet when you were 3 months old!‚Äù"
After I got mine I got my tubes tied. Ladies that is an option.
"If you support contraception, you support hook up culture. There is no getting around that. Contraception severely compromises people‚Äôs natural inhibitions around the act."
"This isn't the ""own"" y'all thought this story would be.

That said, who paid for the abortion?"
Then why aren't you practicing abstinence if you can't afford another child?
