Isn‚Äôt that what‚Äôs great about abortions all these women can freely leave Tx at any time but they choose to stay‚Ä¶hmm
I would also recommend they seek permanent residence in other states as well
Texas is hell on earth.
"The solution is simple, live in a state that fits your values. If you are a liberal why would you want to live with a bunch of right wing wackos. Even the poor can relocate. You can be poor anywhere. Just move. If you say its to hard to do then you are not negatively affected enough to leave."
Protesters should educate themselves on how to prevent a pregnancy instead of killing defenseless unborn human beings. Life begins in the womb and those lives matter and must be protected.
"Treating women like Cattle.








USA be like."
"No BlTCH. U had the option of condoms, spermicide,  pregnancy blockers! So dont sit there and cry that u had no other choice! U spread ur legs knowing the consequences that a baby could be a result! Selfish BlTCH!"
Here we go back to the 50's count on the conservatives to flush women rights down the drain again.  Vote for rights in MIDTERMS THIS NOV üëâüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"I thank my biological mother everyday that she gave me up for adoption instead of having an abortion. 
I was adopted at 3 weeks old to wonderful parents that loved me like their own biological children."
It Might Be Ur Body & Choice. But Ant Ur Life Being Ended. Is it ?. U R Nothing But Selfish. & Thinking of Ur Self. & Not the Little üë∂ In Side of U.
this because this lady is was on fornication .but baby is a gift for good end the abortion
"Planned parenthood only push abortion- they don‚Äôt educate on other options because they make so much money and performing abortions. Think about it why would you not just go to your OB/GYN to get your Abortion? Why don‚Äôt you just go to your doctor if abortion is so wonderful and let them perform it? No, You go to some dirty clinic because it‚Äôs not held up to sanitary standards at all. I know first hand that  they train everyone that works at their facility not to ever use the word ‚Äúbaby‚Äù, show the ultrasound, not to ever tell the person that they have to count the hands arms and feet of they are aborted baby before they let them leave!! Because these poor females would be devastated! They don‚Äôt tell anything of the truth. They are all about money. I admit pro life has dropped the ball and educating. Read The book transfigured‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs simply amazing and it‚Äôs about a girl that had several abortions and that did work at planned parenthood!!"
"It wasn‚Äôt your only option. You didn‚Äôt look elsewhere, ONLY Planned Parenthood‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt offer any other option but abortion they push it because they make so much money they are sick and they train everyone that works at their facility not to ever use the word baby not to ever tell the person that they have to count the hands arms and feet of deer boarded before they let the lady leave because they want to make sure no limbs are left in her body. They don‚Äôt tell anything of the truth. Read The book transfigured‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs simply amazing and it‚Äôs about a girl that had several abortions and that did work at planned parenthood!!"

"Strange how the most pro gun states (40,000 deaths annually) are so anti abortion!"
"What is a woman?
The latest Supreme Court Justice doesn‚Äôt know.
Nobody on the left can define a woman.
Which is probably why the left is lying about the pending Supreme Court decision.

Yes, the Left has a completely b@t sh!t crazy."
"Lord Rest in Peace these 65,000,000 lives that never had a chance to live. RIP little ones. "

The government has no right to force women to have a baby. #fuckyougregabbott
I don‚Äôt feel sorry for the girl. All I heard was what about me. Didn‚Äôt even think about the child at all. I gave birth homeless I had nowhere to go. I could‚Äôve gotten an abortion but I decided not to. I still went to school when I was pregnant. and I didn‚Äôt have family to support me at all. I did what I had to do when I had the baby. I could‚Äôve gave her up for open adoption. But I chose to keep my baby. All I heard from this little girl was I don‚Äôt want to take responsibility for my actions.
Is it now a requirement of a demoRAT that you abort you first born? Or is it the second? Just askin.
"It‚Äôs ok to have an abortion if you want to, no one should force you to have a baby you don‚Äôt want to .."
"""abortion expenses  total amount of credits allowed on your federal return that includes coverage of or reimbursement for abortion or abortion expenses
credit or partial credit for abortion or abortion expenses""  LETS GO üòÖ"
I don‚Äôt understand these people that want someone to keep their baby even though their not the ones that are gonna raise the baby how about we find better solutions like find ways to help pregnant women instead of judging
If your mad then go out and protest or boycott planned parenthood? Their corporate lawyer is the one arguing in defense of upholding the case made to the Supreme Court
"I am not going to get into ethics surrounding abortion, and here is why: it doesn't matter. It is no coincidence that the places with the least abortion access have the highest abortion rates, and tend to be more sexist areas with higher maternal mortality and lower standards of living. Abortion is proven to improve the lives and educational levels of women, proven to improve the lives of existing children. Most of all, it is proven that abortions will still happen no matter how many laws you put in place to prevent them. The difference is, people will die with unsafe abortion. Unsafe abortion is one of the three major killers of childbearing women worldwide."
Good for her in getting an abortion!!!! Yay!!!

"Poor lil puddum, engaging in adult activities, yet being so out of tune with her own body that it took her to 10 1/2 weeks gestation to figure out she was pregnant (FAR longer than someone who actually knows her body and is paying attention should take)... and then she's so heartbroken and cries that she lacks the ""right"" to execute her child in the state of Texas and had to wait and cross state lines to hire a mass murderer to assist her in her evil desires."

29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.                                                                                                                                             -                                                                                                                                           2 Peter 2:12-22
12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
13 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
14 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:
15 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.
17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.
18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.
19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.
20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.
21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
-                                                                                                                  Be not deceived your not born again if you walk in willful sin.
By this we know that we know him -                                                                                  1 John 3:6-10
6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.
7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.

2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.

And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:
12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
13 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth ."
A woman's life is worth more than the possibility of a new life.
LOL!!!!!!!!!!! I just saw a different lady do the same thing. XD I alwaysed said banning abortions are pointless. I am glad these pro sadists that call themselves pro life are failing and women are still finding a way to have their abortion! Thank you to all the women who aborted and saved a child from this trash world!
Abortion is Murder
"Pregnancy is dangerous. Even fertility clinics have to go through multiple embryos before success. I have friends in Texas who wanted to start families but are now too scared to try. This punishes everyone across the board. If you don't understand that, just wait til it's your turn to deal with a pregnancy, expected or not."
"lol imagine being one of those absolute TOOLS who got tricked by the government and big pharma that a child is nothing but a ""clump of cells"" and is not valuable as a human life so it can be exterminated.. you realize these same people who taught you to be so stupid are the ones who PROFIT OFF OF ABORTION?  stem cells among all kinds of other things are harvested from babies who are aborted by stupid ass teens who just want to have fun without any repercussions.. imagine that. Idiots don't understand the monetary value in things like stem cells and how much of a market there is for it among the super wealthy and elite.  But keep offering up your children as sacrifice to them and one day you'll meet the creator you think is just a ""sky wizard"" and you'll get to see first hand what Hell actually looks and feels like.  Enjoy."

"Oh poor little b****. You're not in  place to have a baby. So you're going to murder it. That's exactly what you're doing. 
You're committing murder because it would be inconvenient for you to have the child disgusting. But your typical of the people having abortions that's why it needs to be made illegal with criminal prosecution. Treat it just like other murderers."

"All these ppl having sex but not using NO protection. Its too many devices and methods put here. The pill, the patch, the insert under the skin, condoms, vaginal rings, sponge, film, gel. Like if u are getting pregnant in 2021 its because u either want to or you are being reckless 98% of the time. its very rare to get pregnant while on birth control. Do what u gotta do but most of the time abortion is preventable if u use the proper contraceptive messures."
"I am against abortion because today, more than any other time in history, we have ways to prevent pregnancy.  Why doesn't the Government pay 100% for pregnancy prevention (from the pill to sterilization, if a man never wants to father children,  or a woman never sees herself as being a mom) instead of creating laws that only worsen the situation?  And, the mantra, my body, my choice, is not valid.  It is something you tell yourself when you want to get past something that has put a wrench in your life.  Once you get pregnant there is another body that does not have a say in what you are about to do."

Women are truly living in the dark ages. Where we have to jump through loops to have autonomy of our own bodies. Everyone wants to put their rosary beads and bibles in our uteruses"
Don't worry Liberals - you can still kill your unborn baby girl or boy in 49 states + DC. There's still hope!
"Taliban Texas. Appalling treatment of women as classless citizens.

Murderer
Abortion is murder
The fetus is NOT your body and is NOT your choice
Clearly you lack control...couldn‚Äôt stay out of the bed with your boyfriend
See? Birth control increases unwanted pregnancies. Don‚Äôt have sex. That‚Äôs the best way
Private Adoption is not good.  It is legal human trafficking you exchange a large sum of money for a child in return. That is human trafficking with a new name. The private adoption industry will make about 19.1 BILLION dollars this year.  In foster care parent should always go in with intentions to reunite the child with the bio parents unless it is absolutely not possible.
"Some of these comments are vile. Until you all are pro-welfare expansion, low to no cost healthcare, pro mask and vaccine, pro foster care reform, pro comprehensive sex education and free birth control w/o parental consent, and anti death penalty you all are not pro-life you are pro forced birth because you all have made it clear you don‚Äôt care about that being once it is on earth. Just be fucking honest with yourself. 

Also if an embryo at 6 with cardiac electric activity (it is not a fully formed heart or true heart beat; it is also not considered a fetus even at 6 weeks) is considered a child women should start receiving child support at 6 weeks of pregnancy right and be able to take out a life insurance policy right too?

The vast majority of pro life arguments are based off the Bible. Guess what we don‚Äôt live in a theocracy. We live in the US where per our first amendment rights in the constitution (which for as much as you all claim to love and love your freedoms you sure do pick and choose) we have religious freedoms and separation of church and state. Laws shouldn‚Äôt be based on religion ever even a little bit because by doing so you violate my first amendment rights to religious freedom."
Medical textbooks and scientific reference works consistently agree that human life begins at conception.
"Jesus said,¬†‚ÄúFather,¬†forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.‚Äù Luke 23:34"
"You'd want to option b****. First of all is adoption.
The absolute last thing you should have done with kill your unborn child it was disgusting."
"When I held my newborn grandson in my arms, it was just the most beautiful feeling, he was so tiny and helpless - to think some women don't think twice about doing this is so heart wrenching."
If you know its not 100 percent why‚Äôd you let him let loose? How about keep your legs closed
Mississippi might be the next state to ban abortion.
Why not be responsible  person and not get pregnant.  Abortion is not a good choice for birth control.
"I'm glad these women have to drive HOURS away and have plenty of time to understand that they are about to MURDER a BABY!!!

If you're not responsible enough to raise a child, you're not responsible enough to have sex!!!"
Wait a minute‚Ä¶She felt her only option was gone. What about the option of adoption?
"""Pro-lifers"" have never been against abortion because they care about saving the lives of unborn babies. It has always been about wanting to take away the rights of women. Plus, the Bible is PRO-ABORTION. See Numbers 5:20-22."
Adoption! Their is always a family that can‚Äôt have a child that will give so much love to those babies
God can and does bring good out of evil of all kinds. Murdering the baby short-circuits this good process and deprives many people of blessing.
Don‚Äôt speak about human beings conceived in rape as though they have no purpose and ought to have been murdered in the womb.

so with that being said PPD is no joke and she could end up killing her baby from that alone or her own mental state  and not have any love towards the child .

Exactly why would you want to execute the unborn child living inside you. Yes it's living. It's an act of murder. Pull your head out of your rectal cavity and deal with the situation. Sure if the inconvenience to give birth. But there's always adoption and then you will not be a murderer.

None of my business.
I don't here one thing about father's rights.
"This is clearly unconstitutional, and a direct violation of the 4th Amendment which guarantees that everyone ""be secure in their _persons,_ papers, houses, and effects."" A fetus before 18 weeks (when it is developed enough to feel pain) has no legitimate moral claim to be considered as an entity in its own right worthy of legal protection. The rights guaranteed to all Americans of ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" simply do not apply to it _at least_ in the first 17 weeks of gestation. The autonomical interests of a fully-grown adult woman who IS capable of experiencing pain and suffering and seeing herself as entity existing over time (the notion of ""personhood"") supersedes the non-existent desires of a first-trimester fetus to stay alive or to not suffer. It couldn't be more obvious what the correct moral stance is here, unless your faculties of judgement are blinded by the shackles of Iron Age superstition. Put two-and-two together, folks. This law is an indefensible abomination in any modern, civilized society."
ABORTION IS MURDER! These women should be shackled and chain and arrested!
"All human life is sacred. This genocide of the innocent will one day be seen as the collapse of our morals on a huge scale. So many innocent children have been killed that future Nobel peace prize winners, pultzer, politicians, people that would one day make life better for all who inhabit Earth, for what? Because you decided that a child's life was worth sacrificing so you could continue living a irresponsible and unsatisfying life that is all about YOU. Human life is the most amazing thing to have ever graced this world and yet we still treat those of us who are the absolute most vulnerable as nothing more than a annoying side effect from a drunken one night stand. If you are having consensual unprotected sex then you have no right to take the life of the child that you had so carelessly pushed into this world."

If you are pro abortion you should be well aware of how it actually works. They rip the child apart by each arms and legs and then they literally scramble the poor child's brain and head before removing the child. All life is scared. Either be responsible when having sex or be responsible and at the minimum allow the child to be born and have a fighting chance at life. Who are we to snuff a childs life out before it gets a chance to see the world that has so cruelly destroyed it.
It may be her body but it‚Äôs the baby‚Äôs life adoption is her only choice to not be a ‚Äúdisappointment‚Äù to God only he can take a life
God bless Governor Of Texas!!
"If you have unprotected sex you had better be as responsible as you say you are and find out if you are or aren't pregnant before 6 weeks. And don't say oh I didn't know I was pregnant until I was half way through my pregnancy, NO if you have had sex unprotected then you are well aware you may be pregnant and to deal with it accordingly. Personally I think all abortion should be illegal except for medical and special occasions."
"Why do Republican states keep passing these laws? Because white people keep electing them. 

Don't like it? Leave Texas, because these racist, draconian laws are being rubber stamped by six Republicans on the U.S. Supreme Court."
"just wait till the kids are 18 then use a gun like everyone else.. and take responsibility like everyone else that does it just because the government can kill anyone they want with impunity doesn't mean they can give you the same right.. it's wrong for them and its wrong for you..to          you have the right to an attorney...    .. Jesus is mine..  he already paid my price for sin so i don't have to on judgment day.. ..   but for some reason, this evil generation wants to kill their children by the millions.. .. it used to be illegal when the world wasn't as evil."
U miss one day that baby never sees the light of day
Your literally ripping the baby out of u limb by limb that‚Äôs so messed up. They literally slice the baby up as it‚Äôs alive and has a heart beat dang. It takes a man to have the kid too
"Despite the economic crisis, this is Still a good time to invest in Crypto"
All the more reason for heart beat bills in all 50 states.
Who cares
U can‚Äôt set it up for adoption. If u don‚Äôt want kids don‚Äôt start screwing then üòÇüòÇ it‚Äôs not 100 percent protection
Why are these women having sex during a pandemic in the first place?
It is not your body. It is the baby's body

My Body My Choice ‚ù§
"Stop killing babies! Don‚Äôt have unprotected sex.
Give it up for adoption 
Selfish bratü§Æ"
Brave girl
"1:40 THAT CARE FREE IS WHAT GOT YOU PREGNANT. CONDOMS IS THE BEST EASY AFTER ABSTINENCE.

SHE WILL PROBABLY WILL REGRET IT DOWN THE LINE. WHY NOT SIMPLY GIVE THE BABY UP FOR ADOPTION ?"
"If you said it wasn‚Äôt meant to plan, so it means it happen for a reason üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Watching the MSM whine when they don‚Äôt get their way is HILARIOUSüíØü§£üñïüèΩ
"Good! If they don‚Äôt like the laws in Texas, they‚Äôre free to leaveüíØüëãüèΩ"
"Use the Safe Haven Law and drop unwanted babies in firefighters stations. Since The government is denying you the choice to abort, makes it the government's problem to deal with those unwanted kids."
Your bodies end where the baby's body begins.
Selfish
üëçüëèüëå
God knows
If billions of dollars are being made off of the genetic material that the women are giving up why arnt women mad they dont see that money
Her health is in danger
BS all for narrative. Clear actor
"I know its ur body your choice. Use 2nd protection, or calm ur hormones down. Seg not necessary to live so yea."
I dont get it why not have the baby because you dont know if your going to live to see tomorrow to decide to even want a baby
Should have kept your legs closed.
My body my choice ‚ù§Ô∏è
Abortion is not health care. Neither is contraception. However You‚Äôre there because you had sex knowing the risk. Grow the Hell up. Stoping a heart beat is murder.
Yep. It's all about States Rights. Go ahead.  Murder a baby in another state.
I think only time abortion should be allow before baby forms..medical condition.... rapist raping a woman and got pregnant.   Baby are innocent... maybe still give birth and give up for adoption.  Many families want a baby but can't
Who cares make your partner use a rubber or get on birth control lady
"She felt like a disappointment to her parents, but not any more."
Let‚Äôs go Brandon!
Shout out to George Floyd on eighteen months of sobriety. It took some tough love but he did it. Say his name liberalsüñï
