"So there is a reason to kill a child ? A friend of mine was pregnant with a child that had Trisomy 18‚Ä¶ these children typically pass away within hours after birth.  My friend was told she HAD to have an abortion, but she went full term and got to hold her child for several hours before God took his life.  The parents wouldn‚Äôt have had it any other way‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs impossible to know a parent will feel when a child is in these critical situations, but WE shouldn‚Äôt be the ones to terminate Any life from Womb to Tomb.  There are also countless times an unborn child is Misdiagnosed and is killed out of fear of a defect, only to find the child was perfectly healthy. Put it Gods hands‚Ä¶ PAX"
"abortion is 94-97% of the cases BECAUSE THE MOTHER DOESNT WANT A BABY.... look at the stats... for the outlier cases saving a mother's life, the baby is dead , the doctor will make the health care decision....HOWEVER, 'NOT READY FOR BABY,' 'RAPED' 'TOO YOUNG' TOO IMMATURE' 'TOO CARELESS' 'TOO PROMISCUOUS'  are not acceptable reasons, and result in murder of the baby....as the baby could be given up for adoption.  FULLSTOP"
"ATTENTION LIBERALS!!!    If you're upset about Roe vs Wade being overturned, you should be upset at the Democrat Party for doing NOTHING!!!!

In 1976, Jimmy Carter was elected President. He had a Democrat majority in the House and Senate his entire 4 years - why didn't they codify Roe into law??
In 1992, Bill Clinton was elected President. When he took office, he had a Democrat majority in the House and Senate - why didn't they codify Roe into law??
In 2008, Barrack Obama was elected President. Not only did he have a Democrat majority in the House and senate when he took office, one of his campaign promises WAS to codify Row into law - why didn't they codify Row into law, after making it a campaign promises??
In 2020, Joe Biden was elected President. Not only did he have a Democrat majority in the House and Senate when he took office, they had a 2-month notice that Roe was going to be overturned - why didn't they codify Roe into law, knowing the ruling was going to be overturned??
If you're upset, the only people you can be upset with is the Democrat Party for doing absolutely NOTHING when they had the chances!!"
"To say that some women use abortion as ""birth control"" was utterly shocking and offensive.... and just goes to show the incredible judgements people make about abortion, without actually knowing real womens stories behind it..... because i know many women who have been forced to make that choice, and i can not think of a single ONE where abortion was being used as a form of birth control... i can not think of a single woman who was so irresponsible, and selfish that they did not care about getting pregnant, because abortion was an option..... thats so ridiculous, it would be laughable if it wasnt so offensive and evil to say....and i firmly believe that the energy you put out into the world, comes back to you..... and sadly, i think thats what happened here.... i feel horrible for her, and im shocked and disgusted that she was forced to endure that.... but sadly, i dont think the experience has changed her ignorant thinking on abortion... because apparently she is the judge of when it is acceptable.... yikes.... karma!"
"Stupid people doing stupid things . ""Every vote matters."" Even stupid ones. Too bad democracy in this country seems to work only if it results in a stupid outcome"
"No she wasn't forced to carry ,..all she had to do was go to a state that allows abortion,.... No body would have known anything about this .... except for wanting attention"
"Do Republicans understand they are voting themselves out of exsistance?  First they come for the ""gays"" next... they come for you. This is T$&rrorism..."
They got what they voted for.
"Funny how pro abortionist will cite this as a reason for legalizing abortion, but they still want to be able to kill a perfectly healthy child for any reason."
"Biden may be Doomed, in 2024, by the Electoral College. Can he Really win Arizona and Georgia again?? And, ALL of those GOP candidates are BAD. The College is Inherently Unfair to the DNC, Despite Trump's Ironic Claim that he was ""Robbed."" 

He Lost because he Screwed Up the COVID response. He WON, in 2016, Despite losing the Popular vote-by Two Million Votes-to Ms. Clinton. And, THAT Election may have been stolen by collusion with the Russians. 

My Solution?? Democrats in Deep South states, where their votes count for Little, should move to Texas. And, some of us Northerners can retire there, and marry African Americans from AL/MS/LA and Oklahoma. I would get a Prenup. (The Vast Majority of AA are Democrats these days. If you know someone of a different ethnicity is a Democrat-marry them Instead.)

Florida Democrats should,  by the same token, get hitched to Atlanta Dems. Florida has been a Crucial Swing State. It's Too ""Red"" nowadays. GOP Governors there have refused to let Felony Ex-Convicts vote. Even Today, they are making them pay Restitution to victims, after they get out: Elitist Double-Jeopardy. I sent money to ActBlue to help pay those fees. 

And, it's Not simply because of the above Law, either. Texas is the QUEEN of the Electoral Chessboard. If we Steal it...we will have the Whitehouse and The House, Basically-Forever. 
It may Eventually turn Blue because of Latinos obtaining Citizenship in that State, but that would take Too Long. The Senate is Already ""Blue"" but just Barely so."
"You KNOW...the Only Blessing here (albeit in DEEP Disguise) is that this shows how Dangerous the GOP IS...and what happens when Dubya, Trump, and the rest, put a bunch of Ayatollahs on our Courts.

We on the Left bear some of the Guilt, Too, by refusing to Back the Late Hubert Humphrey (because his Boss, LBJ, got us into Vietnam) or voting ""Green Party"" or sitting out the 2000, and/or 2016 Elections, because we couldn't stomach Moderate Democrats. 


I concur that Ninth Month Abortions are, by their very nature-Controversial.

This ""When the Sperm meets the Egg"" Crap, However, needs to GO.

Among First World Democracies, we are Almost Alone in this type of Lunacy."
absolutely disgusting these hypocritical right wing lawmakers push nonviable fetuses to be born. why do people vote for these awful people?
If you don‚Äôt want an abortion don‚Äôt have SEX‚Ä¶
God forbid you have the baby and love the baby until the baby passes.  There are places that will help a family through something like this.
"This is an exception, nonetheless it‚Äôs a human baby in utero, something pro infanticide advocates never admit to, they blatantly ignore biology, pick and chose what‚Äôs beneficial to the horrific agenda. Also careless adults use abortion as literally birth control which is wrong and irresponsible it‚Äôs the era of taking full accountability for one‚Äôs actions."
Keep your legs shut and you dont have to kill baby
"I looked for a really lovely interview I‚Äôve seen from them and like four other couples who wanted a baby, but had issues and texas refuse them abortions and the mothers we‚Äôre going to die and the babies were going to die and they still wouldn‚Äôt do anything and I can‚Äôt find those interviews anymore they‚Äôve been scrubbed from the Internet. They were well done and the couples got to tell their side of the story. It was well done like very classy and everything but now its scrubbed off the Internet and this is all I can find is pissing me the f off."
"When the power you held over men is then given to the state and leaves you powerless. Karma, dealing with what men have dealt with for years. Abortion rights should have never been passed on lies, which it was. Abortion should have never been used as a contraceptive for lazy people which it was."
"My sister-in-law carried her baby that died one week prior to the due date, my brother-in-law bought her a little baby dress, it was sad but dignified, she was named Cristy, she was a baby, she was buried, she wasn't thrown away or ripped apart, she was a human just like the rest of us.üíî"
"So the baby is only estimated to make it a year‚Ä¶ by that logic, you should be able to muder any human as long as theyre less than a year old and just call it abortion. Diminished quality of life doesn‚Äôt justify killing someone."
QUESTION: I know this may sound insensitive... but why aren't they going to other states where its still legal? I know that in Kentucky you can still get a pregnancy terminated if its an ectopic scenario (even after the overturning of RvW).
"As a woman, I refuse to deliver 9-20 babies in my lifetime.  I have other plans, 1 or 2 ‚ù§children and a career in engineering.  I‚Äôd NEVER live in a state in which politicians decide my life and death for me."
She deems it necessary in her case. How blind can she be
WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR IN 2016?  ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES.
The baby should get that year to live rather than straight to heaven right away tho ‚ù§
"It sucks, but at least this child got to pass away in the arms of her family instead of being ripped a part in the womb. She will be given a proper burial and be mourned and her family, mother especially will eventually heal from this tragedy if they have faith in God's plan. It doesn't make sense to us now, but one day it will. This little girl is an angel baby now. ‚úùüôè"
"Top tier Karens who ""religiously"" take away people's basic human rights in the voting booth. It's only ""unfair"" because it happened to them. *massive eye roll*"

"So, the citizens of Texas can legally go out of state to have an abortion?"
This will never stop being funny that a Trump voter is whining about not being able to get an abortion.
"New Mexico does not have a cut off of a certain amount of weeks. Maybe that particular clinic has a rule, but there are other clinics in the state. And I love how she thinks she has the right to decide for other mothers if an abortion is needed or not. No one is using abortion for birth control, Kylie. I can tell they voted for these laws, so let them suffer whatever consequence comes to them and stay TF out of New Mexico, we have enough people to serve and don‚Äôt need any anti-abortion hypocrites coming here when they suddenly realize that abortion is healthcare. They deserve whatever comes to them."
"These anti-abortion laws are the sort of sh!t that I would expect from groups like the Taliban, or ISIS. It's the Christian version of Sharia Law. Astounding that these laws are being made by people who grew up in a (supposedly) modern, advanced society. The GOP and religious right are living in the freaking Dark Ages and think they have the right to drag everyone else backwards too."

"GOP politicians if you want to be doctors , be doctors.  If you want to be teachers, be teachers.  But goodness sake you don't have the knowledge of a doctor so you are hurting innocent people.  YOu are scaring doctor so they cannot give the best care to pregnant woemn.  I would imagine that we have the fewest medical students going into OB this year. YOu intimidate teachrs, so now we do not have enough teachers.  The funny things is you are not doing the things the tax payers want you to do as politiicans like regulations for industry,rrailroads. and enforcement of regulations  You are all talk, cruel hateful talk, and no real positive action except for futher cheating to gerrymander and take away voting right s and that does not count.  I am doing a search of all the stories of families have suffered already. I have sent a letter to my Governor about this issue.  I guess I need to investigate further who has authority of making these laws that don't have the proper prodicol for women in an emergency situation. They wanted to do something , they could have that from the OB doctors in a week. So what kind of sick stunt.  I wonder, is there any GOP party member who actually cares about the well being of his or her consituents.  I think not.  The democrats have been very helpful.  I just don't get it.  But I guess it has to do with the Trump cult.   I don't get that at all, but clearly Trump does not care about women and theri heath."
Not the whole true story. But what does anyone expect from lying left wing marxist devolving abc in the forced socialist dystopia coming full scale in the 21st century.
There is no restrictions on abortion in NM.  Why is she saying we have a cutoff of 23 weeks??
"1) Abortion bans do nothing. Women will always have the option of abortion, whether it‚Äôs banned or not. 
2) Abortion bans actually increase the number of abortions, ironically. So I guess you people really aren‚Äôt about saving fetal lives so much as virtue signaling.
3) Fetuses now have a right that no other human being has, and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another person‚Äôs body to stay alive. No other human has ever been granted that right. Even if you stab someone and they‚Äôre bleeding out, and you have matching blood types, the government cannot force you to give them your blood to keep them alive. Or if you use a mask, gloves, etc. but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organs start shutting down, the government cannot forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organs. You used protection, so the chances of giving this person the disease that you‚Äôre a carrier for were very low, but it still happened, and now they‚Äôre dying because of you. Guess what‚Äîthe government does not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive. That‚Äôs exactly what an abortion ban attempts to do, however. So I‚Äôm not sure why fetuses should have that right when no one else does."
"This story is concerning regarding Kylie‚Äôs health, and the precedent that Texas law sets here regarding the rights to a fetus. In babies with alobar holoprosencephaly many are stillborn and if they do survive the birthing process only 50% of patients survive by 4-5 months of age and 20% of these cases survive by 12 months of age. 1 They also have major physical deformities including a single eye (cyclopia), epilepsy and seizures, intellectual disability and problems regulating their own body temperature, heart rate, and breathing which requires them to spend their entire life in a hospital. 3 This is a severe economic burden to the family and to the state and could be a major emotional burden to the family involved. This is also without taking into consideration the dangers that come with childbirth especially when compared to the abortion that Kylie was seeking. The pregnancy-associated mortality rate among women who delivered live neonates was 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births. The mortality rate related to induced abortion was 0.6 deaths per 100,000 abortions. 2 With that in mind I believe the laws in Texas endangered Kylie‚Äôs life and encroached on her medical autonomy and her ability to make a medical decision that was in her best interest and safety. It could be said that Kylie could just go out of state to get an abortion, but this places undo financial hardship on a family when there are capable medical facilities much closer. I understand that people might not agree that the risks to Kylie here outweighed the fetuses right to life, however I think one needs to consider the quality of life here. I think the laws in Texas as they stand could cause undo morbidity and mortality to mothers in Kylie‚Äôs situation and encroach on ethical principles that are generally agreed upon in the medical community."
"Welcome to the consequences of your beliefs! Interesting how these people think that abortion is primarily a form of ""birth control""! Same people that ban the teaching of sex-ed at schools and discourage teenagers from having access to contraception that might prevent them from having to be in this situation! They are now also looking at banning birth control pills. We screamed at the top of our lungs for decades why reversing Roe vs. Wade was a bad idea .. now, welcome to your consequences .. when you think something like this cannot happen to you or your daughters in the future!"
"As you can now see .. the issue of abortions has never been about ""saving the baby"" .. it's been about some weird ultra Christianity radical agenda that republicans have been pushing on all of us for decades! Now that the supreme court cracked the door open (again republican doing) you get to see states not thinking about the laws they are passing .. they are passing extremely oppressive laws that never take into account that abortions' are a medical procedure which is sometimes very necessary to save the mother or deal with complications that would let a child suffer unnecessarily with crippling defects that are sometimes horrific! The crazy thing to me are ALL the republican women who still vote to keep these men who are taking away their rights in office. Do they NEVER think such an issue can happen to them or their daughters? A side effect of all this are the closing of delivery hospitals due to lack of qualified doctors because they are leaving for states that haven't gone crazy .. because why risk your medical license in a crazy state that wants to make you a criminal for performing a procedure .. a procedure that is medically necessary a lot of the time! What people forget is that Row vs. Wade .. was not opened ended .. it had limitations as to when abortions was allowed and when it wasn't. Good luck red states! Hope you thought carefully about your choices .. prepare yourselves for 2 things 1. Increase in the deaths of pregnant women due to complications 2. Dramatic decrease in people getting pregnant .. because why risk it in a state you can't be guaranteed medical services if you needed them!"
"""Pro-life"" means ""return women and girls to where they were before 1900: *Property of men.""*

That's the (current) endgame for these single-issue activists. It's not a return to the ""traditional family"", it's not a return to some moral standard that only exists in propaganda, this is turning back the clock on women so their only station in life is pumping out [white Christian] babies."
"People only care when it happens to them. Did they think about the women who were raped and forced to keep the baby? But since now it's happening to them they say it's not fair for women. Every decision made has an impact and, sadly, that's what it took for them to realize that."
"The typical people with the land, tractors, the food making capability and means of production of industrial works, do not believe in abortion. If the non-productive people like to kill themselves and their young, I guess what are we to say to that? Less welfareüëç?"
"I say let them abort, it's usually the ones we don't mind anyway"
"Terminations/abortions/procedures, should be available to women. It‚Äôs 2023, not 1923, c‚Äômon. Wealthy women have access if they choose but try to convince us that women should not have access to medical care!"
"Anti-abortion people think women wake up everyday hoping well get pregnant just so we can rush to have an abortion. It is a painful procedure that no woman wants to experience let alone do it over and over as a form of birth control. Sometimes, it is necessary for many reasons and non-medical professionals, like politicians shouldn't have a say in it. They are not qualified to say if it should happen"
A life is a life.
Prayers for this family.
Ban abortion. Imprison anybody that wants it legal. Demons will respond negatively when you speak up for innocent babies.
They'd rather a woman die from a dead fetus rotting away inside her because they're not prolife theyre pro forced birthüíñ
Good
"Wait a minute, who has to pay the bill which can be tens of thousands of dollars once the baby is due? This is so unfair! I'm asking as a concerned neighbor from Canada"
There are always consequences to choices that involve forcing personal beliefs on others..... Enjoy üòè
"""Unless it affects the mother"", right... as if the mothers mental health means nothing. Try carrying a dead baby to term and not lose your sanity. Jesus fucking christ."
"It‚Äôs wrong that women, parents, and children suffer because of a ban. Once a child is born, no one will be there for it. There‚Äôs not enough resources and money to make sure every child is taken care of properly. Then you get cases of child neglect, abuse, or death because other people choose that it was wrong and a waste of life. Those same people aren‚Äôt there to raise the children born with health issues/problems, aren‚Äôt there to protect a child from an abusive parent/guardian/foster parent/adoptive parent. They aren‚Äôt there when a child has to live like this poor baby or be there when a baby is carried full term only to die/suffer seconds/minutes/hours later due to a foreseeable illness that could‚Äôve been prevented if given an abortion later on. Unless it happens to you, you don‚Äôt think about other people‚Äôs lives till then. It‚Äôs does effect everyone in the end, more negative than positive."
No Joe or Jane average should have ANY SAY in another persons medical choices! PERIOD! Funny how ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù think they get to control everything including other peoples choices!
Who cares that‚Äôs what they voted for
"Nobody should be forced to endure this horror. Sick mentally. Sick emotionally. Sick before God in heaven. Sick before U.S. Constitutional Law. Cruel and inhumane. Grotesque. It is sick that a minority in the U.S. is being allowed to force their sick, unbiblical religious beliefs onto the majority of U.S. citizens. It's unconstitutional.

Prepare to witness this and other horrors over and over and over again. Just like we did in the 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's, and 60's......... women will die unnecessarily because of these situations, and their babies will die along with them."
I tell everyone whose pro life in their politics THIS is why I'm pro choice politically...banning abortions leads to health complications and poorer health services for women through studying countries with complete abortion bans we can see it leads to NOTHING good for women
This is so sad and not right. I can‚Äôt believe this is happening in America.
But..but..freedumb!!!! What a joke...
Good it should never be ok to slaughter unborn babies for your own selfish benefit.
No one is forcing her. Go to a midwife and get misoprostol put it in your vag and it will release the baby.
The only moral abortion is MY abortion. This is what you voted for.
Birth control is to prevent pregnancy. If you're pregnant is not birth control. Abortion is not birth control.
"It is so hard to see these people struggle with the loss of their baby, and now on top of that, this woman must wait to become sick before she can get help. The abortion laws are getting out of hand. The government is sentencing women to the brink of death before allowing medical professionals to intervene and putting healthcare providers between a rock and a hard place. However, what is the government doing to provide women of childbearing age with the resources to prevent getting pregnant in the first place? The answer is nothing. Obtaining birth control can cost hundreds of dollars a year, something some people can‚Äôt afford. Sexual education classes are being criticized and removed from schools, not allowing the public to gain information and make informed decisions. Now in South Carolina, a bill is being considered that a woman can be eligible for the death penalty if she receives an abortion. I struggle to see how this is beneficial for anybody. These laws infringe on patient autonomy, making it difficult for medical providers to care for these women because they will also be punished. This is one time that laws and medicine should not be mixed because it has poor patient outcomes. Who is responsible for the patients? Medical providers are not the government. More dangerous things are happening in the country like gun control and school shootings that are on the rise that needs to be addressed first, not a woman‚Äôs health that should be between her and her doctor only."
"It‚Äôs important to remember that abortion is healthcare and there are many reasons why somebody may need or want to have an abortion. Regardless of the reason pregnancy, even the most uncomplicated ones can cause adverse health effects, and no one should be forced to make a healthcare decision they don‚Äôt want to. I also want to address that the vast majority of people receiving abortions are not using it as birth control. The Bronx abortion clinic reported that about fifty percent of the women who receive abortion used some time of birth control. In addition, more than fifty percent of the women receiving abortions had never had one before. While I want to emphasize that not all abortions are because of unplanned pregnancies, this should not limit abortions to only those cases. Some people who have unplanned pregnancies may want to continue with it, but if they do not it is unethical to make someone continue a pregnancy. This will violate many people's autonomy if they have no choice in what changes occur to their body."
"Republicans always ALWAYS vote _against_ themselves, then blame the Left for everything bad in their life."
What about if the pregnancy is ectopic. That‚Äôs a situation where the baby absolutely cannot survive and the mother could bleed to death.
This is what voting for Greg Abbot gets us ü§ß
"The fact that she said ""I don't believe in it as a form a birth control"" just goes to show the LIES conservatives are told"
"Texas mother banned from saying, ""Welp, kid's gonna die anyway, so we might as well torture and butcher 'im to death for grins and giggles."" FTFY.

There is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHATSOEVER to torture children to death. If your three-year-old were dying of cancer, would you proceed to dismember and disembowel them? Or would you put them on pain meds and hold their hand until the end like a NORMAL human being who is actually capable of love? Why should it be any different for any child younger than that?"
That's really sadüò¢
Lol you got what you asked for. üòä
She says that she doesn‚Äôt see it as a way of birth control but if she does it while pregnant she‚Äôs literally controlling a birth By stopjng it from happening
Karma is a bitch.
Abortion is murder
It‚Äôs a baby no matter what. Carry that baby and nurture it best you can as long as you are healthy and God will take care of the rest. Just because it doesn‚Äôt have a brain doesn‚Äôt mean you can decide to abort it.
I believe it was said before that it's easy to have beliefs but it's difficult when those beliefs conflict with your or your family rights/freedoms.
Welcome to the consequences of voting for an abortion ban.. you are at the receiving end of what you voted for.. stop complaining.  This woman lacks compassion for other women who needs or wants an abortion is the root of her problem
This is the america y‚Äôall want so what‚Äôs the problem
HUH MAYBE WE SHOULD BE PROCHOICE?!??!?!
This sickens me soo much dont people get it these laws hurt womenüò¢
"Be careful what you wish for/ vote for....
Hypocrites! Its good for me but not for thee.
Welcome to your own nightmare."
"THANK U ABC FOR BRINGING TO US EXTREME CASES, AND PLAY WITH EMOTIONS, HOW ABOUT YOU BRING THE MANY WOMEN  WHO HAVE ABORTION AFTER A ONE NIGHT STAND AND COULDN'T BE BOTHERED."

Glory to God for life ‚ù§
Thank God I'm Australian we're so sorry üò¢
People need to see that sometimes abortions are necessary.
When she calls it a procedure what she means is an abortion is healthcare.
No men or women in cults should be allowed to determine the health for all other women.
Its disgusting the greed and selfishness of other people I don't even have to watch it to know this is evil. anyone against abortions are EVIL. and here is why. Medically they are needed for things like this not every pregnancy is healthy and can survive. say a mother has 5 kids already and now a 6th on the way and the baby passes she gets septic she dies that's 5 other children without a mother because her choice was taken from her. no its not the case for every pregnancy but that's where its up to the individual you are a pos if your getting abortions because your irresponsible not because a rape an accident from failed prcations I'm taking about your 2-4 in because you cant be responsible which at that point you shouldn't be having sex. but that's not always the case there are cases where a child being born can subject them to more suffering then living. there's documented cases look them up I'm not here to make you grow as a person and change your mind I'm here to explain that your very close minded and ignorant to have to go through these things in order to understand they are real after some easy googling can educate and save lives and or prevent them for the better.  Its evil to subject people to this.
"I'm so sick and tired of people saying ""Abortion isn't birth control."" No one anywhere is having unprotected sex under the thought of ""Oh. I'll just pop into the abortion clinic next Monday.""

Also, I'm low-key loving that people like her are part of the ""Take responsibility for your actions"" crowd. Guess what, sweetie? You're learning about the consequences of your actions... you voted for these laws. You got 'em."
She voted pro-life and that‚Äôs what she got. She only had compassion for herself and not other women that desperately needed abortions across the country. No sympathy for her.
"""never in a million years would we expect"" Yeah exactly. YOU didn't think this could happen to you, the rest of us KNOW it can happen to anyone."
"I know people who have suffered due to her voting, I hope she knows the consequences of her actions to the fullest."
Hurts my heart that voters can‚Äôt imagine instances like these where abortion is necessary until it affects them personally. How ignorant. I do feel very sad for their family though.
"That is so tragic, I‚Äôm so sorry for your heart break."
This is absolute insanity.
This is what I try to get people to understand about abortion but people wanna stand on their views because they know better but they won‚Äôt get it til they go through it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"These people are literally sad because they cannot kill their child. If you stop to think about it, that's what this actually is. It's a tragedy that the baby has abnormalities, but ultimately, they want to destroy the baby because they are scared of having to deal with a child with abnormalities, who the doctor said won't live long. Their solution: kill it! What has society become?"
Living in Texas is living in a fascist state.  Our Republican government is ruining what once was a great state.
üò¢
Everything happens for a reason. I hear so many stories of things like this happening to upper middle class White Texas families. They change their tune on abortion pretty quick. I have little sympathy for them because they made their own bed. My husband and I talked extensively about issues that could arise with pregnancy and birth before we even tried to get pregnant.
Please contact me! I will gladly adopt your child!! I live in Illinois. My oldest son was diagnosed with alobar holoprosephencephaly when I was 3 months pregnant. The doctors insisted I abort and they continuously said to be prepared for when he took his first breath of real air he would die. Let me tell you he is now 12yrs old!!!!! Every obstacle and deadline they gave him he surpassed with flying colors each and every time!! If you don't want your baby because of the chance and challenges that will come with every child give him to someone who will love them unconditionally!!! As a mom of 3. 2 of which are special needs in two very different ways just give them a chance at life because you never know what they can accomplish with love and support around them!
"And these dumb politicians think they know it all... unbelievable, plus people uninformed."
Terminating an abortion because the Baby will potentially be disabled ‚ÅâÔ∏è
So much for freedom in your country! Disgusting and barbaric
TOTALLY MISLEADING TITLE! watch the whole video!!!! THE PREGNANCY IS STILL VIABLE AND THE BABY IS NOT DEAD IN THE WOMB.
"they look like they can afford a plane ticket to another state or drive so get over it, take precautions not to get knocked up in Texas next time, don't like it you are ""Free"" to move out."
"That poor unborn fetus has my sympathy, They should never be put through any of this. Those parents however? I have no more pity for people who can't see something as a problem until it stops at their front door. Maybe they should have thought about this before they went in to vote away their rights as parents."
I'm so sorry..prayers be with you ...
"It's easy to say I'm anti abortion in all instances and tell everyone else that they are evil until you hear these stories. Very few topics are black or white, good or evil , and people need to know that there is nuance to things. Let's expand access to birth control and  stop women using abortion as such."
"I understand political pro life agenda, what is behind it and why they push it, but every day person, especially women, who vote for this seem truly stunted in their critical thinking. Any women voting for this, not getting that they can end up in situations they don't want, that can kill them, that can harm their children (not just the one your pregnant with if you already have children they will be scarred too), men who vote for this not realizing that women in their families, their wives can end up here. How rotten you must be to want your partner and your child to suffer when you can avoid it? Deluded, evil people."
This is bs. As in not true. People really need to do research. There is a very clear difference between a non-viable fetus and a healthy fetus that is likely to come to term. It is possible she may have to carry to term for health reasons as the Pregnancy may be to far along and this is the safest option. So thank abc for being full of it

I thought almost all states don't allow abortions that far along. It's hard to pretend it's just a bunch of cells. My babies started kicking not too far beyond that
I pray for them and their baby and that they give him the most love they possibly can during the life span he has

"There it is in a nutshell, how quickly the conservative Republicans want to back track once they feel the heat of their own decisions.  Brain dead monkeys üêí."
If the child does die young...at least you did right by him by loving him and fighting for him.
Doctor says abort 1 of 3 because pregnancy is dangerous...mom said no.  Mom has 3 healthy happy babies.
"Last man in Iron lung. Doctor said he was dead to TB.  Another doctor takes him puts a tube in and places him in the iron lung.  He lived.  He became a lawyer and wrote a book.  He is alive today. You love your child, but to an extent.  Thats not unconditional. You never give up.  Especially with your child."
Thats your son and you don't want to give him a chance.  Thats sad you wouldn't fight because doctors have been wrong a lot.
People have no idea how many times a doctor has said there is no hope and the person thrived.  You abort that child you give them zero chance.
Thats crazy!
"I know the catholic position is ""human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception"" and in summary, from the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person. Catholics and protestants often cite passages from Exodus 20 for why they believe human life begins earlier than birth. Even if you accept their argument, it's pretty stupid to force women to carry non-viable pregnancies. These by definitions cannot form human life. I just don't see the point. Often times I can see some self consitancy with people I disagree with. For example, many war mongers just want more land and a larger taxbase, this might not be great for everyone involved, but I understand their position. The law is just stupid even if you believe a fetus is a person. The best non viable preganncies can do outside the womb is maybe have some cells live on as a collection of cell culture to be used for research purposes... although the scientific value of these might be dubious since a tissue culture of kidney fibroblast, hepatocyte, or myocyte from a non-viable pregnancy might be different than a sample from a baby."
"This video title is fallacious. The pregnancy was viable, by definition."
"Honestly, I don't really feel bad for her. 
I DO feel bad for women that didn't want or choose to have their rights stripped from them. 
This woman is part of the problem, and only figured it out when her pregnancy wasn't viable.  
I told my husband that the only way these Republicans were going to figure it out, was when it happens to them. Guess what."

"For people who are against abortion, that Is your right you can be against it. That does not mean you can force others to have the same stance. That is their right. You can believe it is imoral and murder, but you have no right to another person's body. For those that are against it for religious beliefs thats fine, but not everyone has the same religious beliefs. I could be wrong here as I have not been church since I have been old enough to make my own choices that I do not follow those beliefs, but it is gods job to deal with those that sin, not yours. So you csn belief these people are doing wrong and sinning, but its still not your place to do anything about it. Instead trust in your God, and let them handle it."
"I believe a woman should be able to do what she wants to do with her body. I just had to do an abortion and it's something i have always said i would never do especially since i always thought i couldn't have children. Circumstances change. I have 3 children my youngest just turned 5 months, me and my family live in a 2 bedroom apartment and only my husband is working now. We possibly can't keep the baby as much as it tears my husband and i's heart it's something we know is the best for our family. And we will try again once we are where we need to be. I feel for any woman now a days who can't get what they need to get done in order to live healthy happy lives."
"And when women start dying from sepsis, because they have a dead fetus rotting inside of them, and they can't have it removed because the law views it as abortion, y'all conservatives are gonna beg for abortion to be legalized again."
That's cruel
Girl bye. Karma got you. For your hypocrisy. For those who don't know the full story. This woman suffers from PCOS. It comes with complications of conceiving alone in the 1st place. And other factors. Regardless your political affiliation & religion. Abortion is NECESSARY. It is a life saving medical procedure. Now imagine for a moment. All surgeries are ban. Sounds ridiculous right? Because it is. I swear people are beyond stupid today.
You reap what you sow.
Do we euthanize terminal cancer patients simply because their condition is incompatible with life? It is barbaric to kill a child because of a birth defect. His life belongs to God. There should be hospice care and palliative care teams helping parents in these situations prepare for the loss. They will grieve for their child regardless. Let it be in the midst of life-affirming moments instead of death inducing procedures.
"Everyone wants to focus on rape and incest ! It happened to me I had to terminate a pregnancy that wasnt going to make it to the end, and everyone ignored me"
"Sorry but I agree with her. I‚Äôve known so many women that use abortion as birth control. Situations like this the abortion is warranted, as well as situations where the moms life is at risk. Period. Some of y‚Äôall are murderers"
"Good for her, she went through with exactly what she believed in üôÑ hope people like her go through with it a thousand times.  They are the ones that put other women through all the pain and suffering"
The title of this video is inaccurate and deceptive. The pregnancy is not non-viable. ‚ÄúCarrying non-viable pregnancy to term‚Äù is an oxymoron. The doctor said that the infants usually do not live to the age of 1. She didn‚Äôt say they usually die in utero. This is a baby with a disability that sadly has a short life expectancy. Calling the pregnancy non-viable is untrue. This baby deserves a shot at life like every other baby.
Sooooo did she get rid of it? What‚Äôs the outcome??? We‚Äôre left with a cliffhanger‚Ä¶.
I think everyone needs to cut her some slack!
Can you believe they have a daughter and voted for this insanity?!! Now they are scared for her??? Noe they hate the law they helped pass?!? Someone please explain this level of cognitive dissonance. My brain just doesn‚Äôt grasp this kind of hypocrisy and ignorance.
See up until 2:52 I felt bad for you. Now I feel like you got what you deserved. Abortions aren‚Äôt ‚Äúonly for birth control‚Äù and even if they were it‚Äôs not up to you to decide what happens to other women‚Äôs bodies!! Enjoy this taste of your own medicine!
"Develop all this technology, to save yourself and then just go back,, I mean we‚Äôre not evolving we‚Äôre regressing."
So SHE wants to abort a nearly FULL TERM baby because he will be handicap and die young but she doesn't think other women with different circumstances shouldn't be allowed...
"I want to feel bad for her but I don't. SHE voted for this with no regard for any other women. She didn't care until it started affecting her. Abortion bans are awful for EVERYONE, not just some women."
If you vote for other women to not be able to have an abortion for whatever reason they want to how can you be mad when you are denied the right to.
You can always go to another state if you feel the need to terminate.
Stop saying procedure. It's an abortion!!
"She still ""deems"" what is considered ok to get an abortion? That's the problem, people ""deeming"" what other people should do. Husband seemed more empathetic with women than her. She should make changes in her beliefs."
"I do not feel bad for her at all. She voted for this, now feel the consequences."
So heartbreaking for this family!! I‚Äôm tragedies like this we should have the right to choose üò¢ God Bless
Interesting how people think that aborting a healthy and viable baby is comparable to aborting a non-viable pregnancy and therefore this woman is a hypocrite. What? It‚Äôs totally not the same thing.
Propaganda post!!
karma. love it
"Ancephaly is always used by abortion advocates.  It is extremely rare.  If mom is perfecty healthy, she should carry baby to birth.  Baby is alive in there. Let baby live life God has willed.  It‚Äôs tragic for parents but we all know pregnancy is a risk."
They said with the baby condition it has less then a year to live. Hopefully thats true because the child was not meant to be born. The pro sadist movement only wanted the child born so he can suffer. I hope something goes wrong and the child is not born. Honestly if a woman is not going to have an abortion I hope they miscarry.
"Good, karma it‚Äôs what she deserves who cares"
"Some parents go that extra mile and step up to try to give their baby the best life it can have while it can have it, and others choose to throw it away bc they aren't perfect. How tragic. And don't even flippin say I have no idea what they're going through bc I do, but I chose to give my baby life, despite her severe birth defects."
She‚Äôs anti abortion. Just getting a taste of her own medicine.
This is a. Hold regardless‚Ä¶. It was conceived out of love‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd want to be able to at least hold my child‚Ä¶ This is truly heartbreaking‚Ä¶
they still voted for trump and abbott
"""there are certain instances where I deem that it is necessary""....but you're pro life, and all life is sacred, right? Oh but you see it as ""necessary"" because it will affect you. Got it. So all life is sacred until it negatively affects you guys. Cool. Hypocrites. 

This is what they voted for, and now they're looking for sympathy. GTFO

literally no one uses it as birth control!! YOU ARE PRO CHOICE SWEETIE. if people using it as birth control is your worry then vote for free 99% effective birth control instead of free condoms at a health department that are hardly used properly. y‚Äôall voting for the wrong thing. abortion is a medical procedure that has been stripped away from doctors and interpreted into political opinions.
PERSONAL CHOICE.  It can't be OK for you but not for others.
"This is so difficult to go through and sad that your baby has not developed normally. You need to be aware that this beautiful baby is still a baby and not to be discarded  ,terminated or aborted. This baby is precious and all life should be loved and nurtured. The baby might not have a long life, but you need to give the baby as much love as possible in this short period, loving, holding your baby,kissing and talking with it. Whether one has a baby with a heart defects, abnormal  body, missing limbs or any other disability, the baby deserves to be loved and nurtured and a chance of life."
"Be careful what you vote for people.  You have to read it all- the politicians are sneaky and well, are not always honest and forthright.  So heartbreaking"

It may be a moot point as more and more OBGyns ditch the profession or move out of states like Texas. Sadly women and children in rural areas will bear the brunt of that.
"I told my other half he needs to go get his colonoscopy 3 states away. His response, ‚ÄúWhat for?! I live here I should be able to get the care I need. It‚Äôs between me and my doctor.‚Äù Same thing with abortion people, stop sticking your nose into people‚Äôs medical procedure. I‚Äôm pro minding your own business. Thanks!"
That is barbaric and inhumane. That woman must have been so depressed.
"Non Medical people making Medical decisions, just like many Health Insurance Companies, Judge's and politicians. Who's going to help folks pay for the health care in cases like these? How much money is in the State or Federal budget for pre, post natal care?"

Who‚Äôs to say that this child won‚Äôt come out normal and live a normal life!
"So this girl (Ashley ) and I had been friends since freshman year. During summer we began spending more time together. We hooked up just one time. That's all it takes. I have to note that at that time I was in and out of jail, on probation, fighting cases, and before I turned 18 I'd go away for 2 years in prison. I was reckless and knew I wouldn't make a good bf. We both had grown some feelings for each other ; hers more than mine. But once she found out she was pregnant and told me , I honestly began really thinking about changing my life. My feelings grew for her and I was willing to grow up and be a dad and bf.. She allowed other people to get in her head and behind my back she went and got an abortion. I found out from someone else a couple weeks after. I was crushed. Even though I lived a rough life and could be violent towards men at that time, I was always real gentle with kids and wanted one. That baby literally could've saved my life. Because I would end up doing a total of 6 1/2 years locked up, not caring about anything or anyone. Later on at 28 I would get engaged to a single mom. We didn't work out but I still talk to the kids. I'm 35 and still no kids, single, etc. haven't been in trouble since 2014 and live a normal life sorta. Haven't dated since though, most people have kids at my age and getting close to kids and breaking up is probably the worst thing I've been through and that's saying a lot.. Idk.. I hate abortion because you deprive the world and others of a life that could possibly change things for the better. Sorry for the long story, I've never talked about this before. Thank you for asking this, felt kinda therapeutic to think and write about it.

Side note: the abortion had a negative effect on Ashley. She started partying, doing drugs, and became promiscuous. We ran into each other when I was fresh out at 22. She was a stripper then and her life was chaos. She later got pregnant and had her son which totally calmed her down and now she seems to be a good mom. I think he's 7-8.  Just wanted to point out that abortion hurt both of us."
Good time to hold you ladies to higher standard. Condoms and birth control exist for a reason. Lets not act like you ladies arent abusing abortion for a birth control. Maybe we need to start making better decisions and choices.
So the states are already overwhelmed with too many children they can't care for and that's all that this is going to do is add to that problem so the people who so badly want this to be legal will be the ones who end up so badly having to figure out what to do about the mess that they made and the children will suffer for it
"They try to control women and their body but men who love family suffer too. It seems just jerks are happy in this scenario for forcing others to live with their stupidness and biases. We came back to hundred years ago, technology doesn‚Äôt bring us forwards, our mentality and respect to other human rights bring us forward. Saudi Arabia has technology but they live in the past. Our society started to backward."
Texas got what it wants. Full control over women. Taliban Texas
I am sorry did you say non viable? Uh wow sorry dear we lost as well..
I'm so sorry women have to deal with this.. No government or Judge should have the right to play doctor unless they have a degree as a Doctor
These people definitely sound like Republicans. You get what you vote for.
"I understand the want to terminate in this case . In Texas when something like this happens, you go out of state. I‚Äôm a Christian and I vote for republican all the way. Abortion is a fine line however. I think it‚Äôs more of a moral issue. I think we should have the choice. I believe we should have the personal choice that we then have to live with for the rest of our lives and in my Christian beliefs, we then will be judged by our maker for that choice. It should still be a choice. It‚Äôs freedom and the Lord gave us freedom. Every choice however has a consequence. The problem is the women that use abortion as birth control happens far too often, this is murder."

"Thank God i was born and raised in North Carolina. And there is no rule against getting a abortion. Thank you North Carolina.. tbh more woman should move here to have there babies. If something goes wrong like this tragedy, nobody can stop you from terminating the pregnancy."
"To me it's an example of one extreme to another. Abortion whenever, use it as birth control, it's a right to sorry carry that dead baby to term, oh you'll die if you remain pregnant?  Too bad.  I've yet see anyone argue abortion is wrong unless the mother could due ( ectopic pregnancies for example) she's raped ( surely there's a way to know if she's lying) and this. Though I know after a certain point, they'd induce labor. This though....oh sorry watch the baby die after birth. 
Though the whole ""have compassion"" argument people are using is just a band-aid to me.  Ok have compassion for the life growing inside you rather than think kill it. Cue the responsibility argument. Another band-aid.  Nothing will change because of this 'one extreme to another ' mindset."
"Conservatives: ""If you got pregnant, now you will bear the consequences for your actions! You should have closed your legs!""

"So the problem here is that two parents view the difficulty of an otherwise normal pregnancy as a burden because the baby might live long enough to be an inconvenience? Am I missing something or is that the big story here? The big story is that people who identify as pro life became pro choice because of personal inconvenience. There‚Äôs no concern for their child. This illustrates why abortion needs to be criminalized in Texas for everyone who participates in an abortion‚Äînot just the abortionist.  Human life has been reduced to viability based on convenience. We are in a bad way. We need to become abolitionist, not pro life. It‚Äôs a term that has lost its meaning."

New York state will 100% do the procedure for you and there are places that will help pay for your travel if you can't. New York state allows abortion up to the day of birth even if your past your due date and they find that something is wrong with your baby and your baby is unable to survive and has a terminal condition even if you're in labor they will perform the procedure for you.

This is political propaganda. So her child is ill. That‚Äôs not a justification for slaughtering thousands of children out of total convenience and selfishness.

Honestly. I don‚Äôt wish these things on anyone. I‚Äôm staunchly pro choice. I don‚Äôt care why you choose an abortion.

But I‚Äôm heartbroken for them anyway. I‚Äôm a mom I have two boys. I love them so much. Could I imagine ever choosing an abortion? No. Do I see every day how it may be the only right option to alleviate suffering for mom and or baby? Yes. I do. Rather we think it‚Äôs wrong or right I believe that‚Äôs between the individual and God and it‚Äôs above my pay grade. Abortion is healthcare and women deserve access to it.

lol üòÇits what yall voted üó≥Ô∏è for
Carry it to term then let the baby die naturally..no meds nothing
"She got what she voted for! If $15000 for the Colorado abortion was too much, wait until they get the bill for the inevitable c-section and NICU.

No sympathy whatsoever for this hateful 'the only moral abortion is mine' modern-day version of Eris"
Thank you Joe Biden for taking our rights awayüò¢
Abortions are health care for women
I went thru the same thing sorry to say. My situation was in 1981.üò¢
That is soo sad üò¢
They need to go back and change these laws. It‚Äôs our bodies and no one should have the right to tell us what we can and can‚Äôt do with them.  I feel so bad for her and can you imagine the mental health issues she will have after this and lasting so long.  Like how stupid is this law.  It makes me so angry!!!
And she still can‚Äôt empathize lol. Oh Christians. üòÖ
Deserved.
Abortion is our right has females
Forcing a woman to carry and birth a baby that won‚Äôt have a good quality of life or that will suffer is just wrong. I don‚Äôt believe in carrying a fetus full term then termination before it takes its first breath but I do believe that if a woman decides early on that she doesn‚Äôt want the pregnancy it‚Äôs her body her choice.
"Obviously she's not a believer because doctors can be hella wrong. My cousin was supposed to be a down syndrome and she came out normal. God created that baby for a reason, this couple is a coward and weak. Even if the child is born with the brain abnormality so what? You still love the child and be there for the baby.... again God created this beautiful life for a reason....the enemy knows this child is powerful that's why he is trying to take him out..... Parents get your butt into church and start learning about the Lord and his miracles... Because obviously you have no clue how to live in this world!!! This is as deep as I can hash it to y'all. I pray for your soul and I pray for that sweet precious baby inside you to turn out healthy like my cousin whom the doctors were wrong about!!!"
Probably wouldn't have happened if the baby killers weren't out celebrating murdering babies and putting on parades and stuff.
This is more harmful than an abortion would be.
"Abortion is no different than murder. You want to legalize abortion? You might just as well legalize murder. ‚ÄúYou are an American, you have the unenviable right to avoid all responsibility for your actions, even if you have to kill your own child in the womb before it is legally born,‚Äù is essentially legalized abortion. (Incidentally, my Mom wanted to have an abortion when she was carrying my sister in her womb, but changed her mind after she got to the clinic. She left the waiting room before it was her turn. I cannot conceive of how different my life would be like if I had never known my sister. And neither can my Mom. My sister also suffers from severe mental health issues. She‚Äôs lived for decades needing even the most basic care, because she is incapable of taking care of herself. But she is the sweetest human being we‚Äôve ever known. She has saved our lives with her cheerfulness more than once. Imagine how many good lives will never be lived because they were deliberately severed in the womb before birth.) I cannot feel any differently about this matter."
"My question is why all these gynaecologists were silent when the laws were passed, why some politician brainwashed by religion should be allowed to make such a choice. 
Are we going back to a Stone Age? Because this is definitely not a democracy, when instead of medical professional we listen to religious demagogues."
Your perfectly free to travel out of Texas for an abortion. No one is forcing you to carry a baby nor to live in Texas.
"I would carry that precious baby. I lost my daughter at almost 4 months pregnant,  and got pregnant again and we lost that baby. In you worry about carrying that baby. I lost my daughter, and the day she left this earth was May 21st. Wish I had more time carrying , because I still cry everyday,  and for our baby we just lost Jan 15th. I do anything to have them both back. üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢"
It‚Äôs absolutely cruel. These laws are crazy to have no type of exceptions. Can‚Äôt believe women voted for that.
This is such a tragedy for this family. To go through a full term pregnancy just for more sadness in the end. God protect this Queen and her family. üò¢
As a Texan myself I feel sorry for all the women living in this state.
My heart cannot handle another pregnancy
Lol so you‚Äôre telling me women have to put their life and their kids life at risk over some dude being able to bust a ü•ú. BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH . ‚Ä¶.and women still give it up??? All you have is to blame yourself ..no wonder they say women are stpd
They voted pro life and NOW they are still against a woman's right to choose but complaining that they have no choice here. Go figure.
"The decisions regarding  a woman's womb need to be done by the woman and her medical caregivers.  Only males who support this stance have a part in the discussions.  If you do not have a viable womb, butt out.  If you are not a certified medical caregiver for the female, butt out unless invited. Keep your praying, prying, protective, and creepy hands off of a woman's body."
Sounds horrible but you reap what you sow.
ü§£ü§°
That's what you voted for.. Now you want to leave the state to get an abortion. What about the women who can't afford to do that...
pro life üíØ
I don‚Äôt wanna see any shocked faces
New Mexico is a safe state still
"There is nothing crazy about carrying a terminally ill, living child to term. Hopefully it will form bonds, honor the baby's life, and provide closure. There is no way around the sadness. Losing a baby is awful."
Omg how sad üò¢but be hard and omg this hearts my soul ü•∫
"If the baby is dead or killing you, then that is one story. If it is a child that you don't want to care for, selfish and a list if you decide to kill it"
Lets just get the laws out of women‚Äôs uteruses already. Side note: it is interesting that we dont need to know if a trans person has had surgery down there in order to respect there identity but yet we so openly have on trial women‚Äôs uteruses. Honestly it should just be between a woman and her gynecologist. üò¢
Sad
Move to California you can kill a baby at any age
Welp
Stop voting for Republicans and you won‚Äôt have this problem.
This woman never expected to be at the receiving end of her own judgments
"What I don't get is why is the husband afraid for his wife? What would be different physically about giving birth to a baby who doesn't live long, vs one who does?"
"I'm very sorry for the loss you both must be feeling. I hope that somehow, despite the politics, you can make your sweet baby boy feel all of your love for as long as he is growing and living. I wish the outcome would have been different, but if he is born and does live with you for whatever time is his, I hope he feels the love of his Mom & Dad and you feel his love too."
üò¢ üòÆüò¢ No words‚Ä¶ sending healing & loving vibes your way.
"She wants an abortion but doesn‚Äôt think other women should be able to choose one. 

Husband: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fair for her.‚Äù Sir, it is not fair for any woman."
To me even though this woman realized her mistake she is still disturbing to me. NO ONE should be able to decide what happens in and to someone else‚Äôs body
Personally I'd carry an give my son the best year he had on this earth with tons of love. He wouldn't have to be perfect to the rest of the world
"Heartbreaking all the way around. No one deserves this situation, Especially not that baby."
"Well, thank the pro life maga conservative for over turning roe v wade and passing these bans as if this won't affect real people."
you get what you vote for unfortunately
I agree with her. Abortion is not birth control
Hod makes no mistakes
"In my country abortions are legal so I have no issue there BUT if states are going to make it illegal, if the baby is not going to survive and will have no quality of life if it does then teminations should be allowed for MEDICAL REASONS.....E.g. brain dead child."
"Yea it's not a big enough issue to turn the abortion ban around. Sounds like a 1 in 10,000,000 problem. Keep trying ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
I think abortion should be available for those women who get raped but those that have a relationship and want abortion is wrong because in the first place there is protection and like this family just because the doc says something is wrong with the kids whether the kid has mental or physical problems does not mean get rid of the child it's called being a parent and dealing with the kid
Christian didn‚Äôt think about this when they decided to push their dumb (fake) beliefs. This is why idiots should not run or country/nation. #selfish #greedy. they should‚Äôve known inbreeds would have issues like this. #CantControlEverything
Why do Americans STILL allow Old White Men to make decision and control an American Woman‚Äôs life.  You can‚Äôt cherry pick either your for it or against it.
Voting has consequences. Maybe people will start to understand that they are subject to those consequences as well. Quit voting for candidates who feel it‚Äôs their right to dictate their illogical beliefs on everyone.
"Fucking Texas.  This woman just needed to shut up after 2:52.  Good riddance, sorry you have to go through this but maybe stop being so rigid in your approach on dictating how other women access healthcare. üò° so you‚Äôre pro choice but only when it affects you? Ugh"
This is so heartbreaking. Literally feels like we are in some horrendous show where people have no rights over their own bodies.
You got what you voted for. Enjoy üëçüèª
Not even conservative christians want to be forced to carry non-viable babies to term. Yet these laws are made by people who think their conservative christian base want this.
"Many conservatives are fond of calling a clump of cells in a woman's uterus, a ""child,"" and of calling abortion, ""murder."" I say democrats don't know how to rabble-rouse like republicans do.

How about demanding social security numbers for the clumps of cells, and that the IRS Code be amended to allow zygotes, embryos, and fetuses to be claimed as Dependants on Form 1040. And make that applicable to ALL pregnant taxpayers. 

There are ways to fight republican zealotry, but democrats are too conventional in their approach."
How funny it only matters when its happening to you. The consequences of your vote.
"Sue your state. Vote Blue! No laws should touch your body or force you to harm your health. Husbands, dads, bf you should stand up for your wives,  daughters,  friends."
I say woman need to stop having sex if they want to avoid this situation or a normal pregnancy. Boycott sex woman. There are toys if you want the big O.
Welcome to the real world.  You don't think other people should be titled to terminate an inadvertent pregnancy but it should be okay in your circumstances.  This is what happens when the State starts sticking its nose into decisions that really should be between a woman and her doctor.
They want to play God
My son might be born disabled so let's murder him.
Praying for baby boy.
Girl come to California. We gotchu.
"If the baby puts the mom's life in serious danger, then it must be killed to avoid the loss of 2 lives. Otherwise the mom must carry on with the pregnancy. You make your bed you sleep in it."
"so even if it already has died and has no brain and is essentially brain dead, she wouldn't even be able to get a D&C? my MIL got a d&C right after she gave birth to my husband to get her tubes tied, this is ridiculous. so she would basically have to have a still birth??"
Now this is a medical reason for an abortion. Using it as birth control is what is disgusting.
If men had to deal with carrying babies this would even be an issue.
Lol get fucked loser. She literally voted for this. She must have thought it through and put herself in other mothers shoes no? Or was she a nasty fucking devil who could see passed her own agenda?
Life sure can humble you.
"and this is why people who aren't affected by the situation shouldn't have the power to vote on it, give the votes to those mothers who are actually facing these issues and we will be in a better world because of it"
I don't understand why she couldn't get an abortion. Does Texas not have medical exemptions? Could she not have gone to a different states?
I get sick of the women in this world that get pregnant and then with to go to a Dr and kill it but will go to hell but I no one thing I don't talk date have sex or marry a what that kills a baby don't care about what people say that u me I want
üôÑ
"I‚Äôm so grateful to live In Colorado. Even as a Christian, we need to save viable lives. Not force others to suffer."
You're either for abortion or you are not in ALL cases. Sick of people only caring when it involves THEM!
It may sound sick but maybe the Texas mom should have her delivery on the floor of the Texas state house while they're in session so they can see the horror they've created
"If the baby is already not going to live, why rush to kill it before it's born? The little boy will die naturally after birth."
Question: Does this harm the mom to give birth to the baby who‚Äôs not developed like other babies? Does this type of birth put her life at risk?
"People absolutely SHOULDN'T have to do this, not in this day and age, and truly they don't. Unless of course they happen to live in a random geographical locale where some politician has decided that they are going to be in charge of these decisions for us, regardless of their lack of education on any of the real issues related to these ludicrous laws. This should never happen, not ever. This is just one more great example of why. They want you believe they are passing these laws because in the majority of cases, ""abortion"" is just used as a horrific form of birth control. So you know, hurry up and take that away, but the truth is, in reality those instances represent a very low number of cases. And EVEN THEN, they still have that right to make that decision for themselves. Unfortunately, the reality is that a large percentage of ""abortion"" procedures, (a term which encompass a wide array of treatments), are performed to end a pregnancy that was VERY much wanted. That's what everyone listening to their rhetoric and constantly repeated sound bites supporting these laws doesn't even try to understand, until it affects them, or their loved ones, which at some point will happen to everyone... We are smarter than this people, come on."
In a rare situation like this the baby will be born terminally ill and will likely be on life support until it passes. I don't see why so many people belive thats any different than a person of any age being on life support or in hospice care until they pass. Its always terrible for a person to suffer and die and its awful for the family members to go through it but we don't just kill everyone who's terminal. Thats so sad. Why kill the baby?
"Anyone notice neither of the couple used the word abortion and kept using the word ‚Äúit‚Äù or ‚Äúprocedure‚Äù? Accept reality and the fact that you are pro life, but want an abortion. Who wants to make their own decision for their own body now? The hypocrisy in this video is remarkable‚Ä¶"
This is so heartbreaking.  Sad for everyone involved-this family is traumatized enough finding out their baby will not survive and then to be told the law is forcing everyone to suffer more is horrific.  I‚Äôm sorry for this family.
"Say yes to live is always the right thing to do.
God will blessed you and your family.
Instead of saying procedure, say abortion and see how you feel.
We women are to give life and take care of the human being when is in the most fragile stage in life.
We women should be against abortion, God created us to give life, not to terminated.
Be open to life and receive blessing for every little Angel."
"I work EMS in Texas and actually ran a call for a 35 year old woman who has this same disease after she pulled her trach tube out. She was in a total vegetative state - absolutely no means of communication or signs of cognitive function. She couldn‚Äôt even localize to objects with her eyes. Her entire 35 year existence has been laying in bed, breathing through a tube and being fed through a G tube with a suprapubic catheter to catch her urine. She has to be turned every few hours in bed (for her entire life) to prevent pressure ulcers. She‚Äôs never been able to talk, walk, speak, sit up, or even eat on her own. I remember thinking to myself how miserable it must be to live like that. And I wondered if her parents knew before she was born of her condition and why they wouldn‚Äôt choose to terminate if so. Seems like it would have been the far more merciful thing to do. Now thanks to the SCOTUS parents don‚Äôt even get to make that quality of life decision for their kids. What a nightmare we‚Äôre living in."
This  kind of news is crushing enough.  To force this woman or any woman to maintain this kind of pregnancy for another 4 months is beyond criminal.
She should have gotten denied. She can vote to get rid of peoples rights but when it comes to her it‚Äôs ok
WWWW
#Prolife
This so what y‚Äôall voted for. Why are y‚Äôall upset?
"The only way to solve this problem is to vote Democrat. There is only one political party that will ensure that women have the choice and the options available to them to safety handle any pregnancy complication that may arise, and it's certainly NOT the Republican party."
This is a lack of good judgment and descernment by medical staff.
WELL... you asked for it. üòê
The system is so fucked up!!!! So they will not allow her to abort but are willing to let her give birth to a child that will die no later than 1 yr after birth? Make it make sense AMERICA!
"A lot of valid criticisms in the comments, but I really feel for this couple and it is a good thing for everyone that they are coming out with their story."
"The doctors said the baby was nonviable. Doctors have been proven wrong before. I wouldn't have an abortion. There's always the chance that nothing will be wrong.  Nobody's perfect. I would love the baby no matter what. Only God should take a life away. Heartbreaking, but no doctor would have the right to tell me to have an abortion. God bless this baby to be perfect enough for these parents."
Oh well. You reap what you sow ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This is outrageous. Filled with rage that women have lost the right over their own bodies and now will be left traumatized over situations just like this one. Lawmakers should be ashamed of themselves.
This is sensationalism... read the laws for yourselves. I've read them.
I‚Äôm snitching and collecting the moola if she aborts in BIG TEXAS ! Chaooo! You get what you vote for ‚Ä¶pow! üí∞üá∫üá∏üòé
"There needs to be exceptions for stuff like this. I think it should be allowed anyway, but if not, at least allow exceptions for emergencies like this."
"Sad, proof that no life exist without a birth in brain....no bible quote says anything abortion specially in political laws."
Don't orient the conversation to support murder. Women culture insistent of murder to children within the womb has DIRECTLY INCREASED MURDER OF CHILDREN OUTSIDE THE WOMB. EVIL IS NOT AN OPINION. KARMA IS UNRELENTING
"If it ain't broke don't fix it; let the lawsuits begin so victims can get a million+ from tax payers money; if only came from politicians, sad."
"Wait until all the compassionate OB/GYN's leave the state so they make medically necessary decisions with their patients and not with politicians who have zero business doing so. This woman and her husband had the means to go to another state, although by that time it was too late. But how many women and girls have to suffer with no hope before bodily autonomy, right to privacy and separation of church and state are given back to them?"
"If you turn it over to the Lord, he will take care of everything"

"So, your beliefs/votes actively caused this. So, very sad."
"She thinks she has the right to tell other people what they can do, but she gets to chose.  What a dope."
Her comments indicate she‚Äôs one of those conservatives that didn‚Äôt think this could happen. ü§î üßê
"A fetus without a brain is no longer a baby, much less a pregnancy. It isn‚Äôt even compatible with life. No brain = no heartbeat once the mother‚Äôs circulatory system stops working to keep the fetus from rotting. This is ridiculous and if people knew how toxic a necrotic, dying fetus inside a mother was, they would terminate this lethal mass of flesh inside this woman immediately."
"They are the adults, they are not the victims. This child is the victim and the one who will suffer. Their son will die either way. This is not love or concern or well-meaning or good. This is purely selfish."
"LMFAO natures way of saying FU to the toxic human species.. the human animal will suffer the consequences of ignorance!!!!! LOL i came into early menopause at 37 because of how toxic a civilization we live in, and was never selfish enough to subject any of my would be offspring to the rest of you savages, so as far as i'm concerned im no longer at risk of being a forced broodmare for the state lol!"
The right to terminate a pregnancy should remain a right.
This is why Politicians should not make any laws that have to do with health/medical.
No efffsss giving since more than likely it sure looks they voted for that.
"This simultaneously breaks my heart but also enrages me. 

Like HOW could she be going through this, but also still be so against abortion?!
She doesn‚Äôt support it as ‚Äúbirth control,‚Äù yet she can‚Äôt see the problems that arise when doctors aren‚Äôt allowed to be doctors?! 
As she is learning, she can‚Äôt have it both ways! The state needs to leave medical procedures to practitioners and patients. 

It‚Äôs a case by case basis. Things are not black and white, and politicians should not be able to police a woman‚Äôs body with these laws. Something is very wrong here! 

People seem to forget we don‚Äôt live in a damn theocracy!"
She is the type of person who deserves this
Ok but 20 weeks it‚Äôs too far along. Plane and simple. You do realize that the procedure for abortion at 20 weeks is essentially partly giving birth right? And ‚Äúnon viable‚Äù pregnancy? No. Non viable means baby wouldn‚Äôt even make it through delivery
"1 in 10k is NOT an ""anomaly"" you demented lunatic....thats a LOT of deformity lady what drugs is she on tryping to pass that off as a small occurrence..... and thats without stating the fact this country has the highest of wealthy nations of women dying from childbirth as if there is infinite space and resources on this planet of 8 BILLION dysfunctional savage...with what information is available one would be so inclined to say that you people deserve to suffer the consequences of self-serving ignorance...when the chances are higher for having deformed offspring than the chances for winning the lottery, then I would say that is NOT an anomaly and from a doctor no less LOL no wonder the ""quality"" of people there are in society when so-called educated people say 1 in 10k of deformed offspring is ""an anomaly""...this lady is either downplaying the severity or highly questionable when it comes to math either way this speaks VOLUMES..."
But I was told this didn't happen! Did the pro-birth camp? /s
Oh well. That's the preferred law in texas. This is exactly what they wanted.
"Nah, but you guys don‚Äôt want abortions right? You should‚Äôve stayed in Texas with all the other trump supporters. Hypocrites."
"‚ÄúNot deemed for birth control‚Äù, but now that she needs she is okay with it?"
He‚Äôs still a person üò¢ I would gladly love him as long as he lives. Poor little guy.
What pro-death to human beings ABC won't show you are the 1000's of women who choose adoption or at first wanted an abortion but carried the baby to term and now say it was the best decision they've ever made.
"I'm being punished now with their undesirable whining, not going to let my cat's belly go?  It's skin."
"Whos using abortion as birth control? Its costs hundreds of dollars, so its not the poor."
"They're always whining about me needing healthcare and help, but they've gotten rid of abortion in many places.  Even though I'm an adult, me bringing a kid into the world is child abuse, especially in the US.  Most people have no idea how hard it is to do simple things because of all the roadblocks. We have to do more than normal people, too, and we can only live if we do quantum physics. I'm not kidding. The places I live in become bunkers and a war zone.  The US can't be civil about anything. I have to be hunted and in Hell, for I'm evil. I asked to be sterilized.  They would not do it.  I've only had one true boyfriend for like 6 months.  Due to how I was treated, I don't like dealing with the crowd of cliches.  They want me to join the masses.  I can't.  They did it to me. They'll never say sorry.  Cry me a river."
That‚Äôs sounds like your problem sweetheart. You know you voted so enjoy your non-viable baby.üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Who gets to select the reasons it is necessary? That‚Äôs why it should always be up to the woman and not to other peoples religious beliefs and  politicians.
I pray in Jesus name that God makes a miracle out of that baby boy and that he's born healthy with a fully funtional brain and that this family has beautiful  testimony out of this.  Read the book God Wants You Well and watch the youtube testimonies of the many negative ultrasounds that turned into miracles. In Him
"You don't need to go to Mexico where it could be unsafe or end up with a serious infection ... If you need medical abortion and your life is in danger go to Canada They will help you and it's safe you will be taken care of !! 

This also affects IVF , ( EGG DONATION ,SPERM DONORS , SURROGATE MOTHERS ) making people who battle infertility impossible to ever have any children because no one will be donating with ban laws as ridiculous as this in the USA !! Did anyone even think of that when making this ridiculous Law !!"
"A life is a life and just because they don‚Äôt want to go through the pain of losing him they are willing to put him through pain and kill him? I mean really!? Everyone wants to tip toe around the word abortion and how it is actually done. The fact that you are choosing to kill your child because you don‚Äôt want to live with the consequences of your act of having sex (regardless of that child‚Äôs health issues) is heart breaking and evil.  That child deserves to be loved and wanted regardless of how ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù he is. And lastly, you are either pro-life or pro-choice, there is no gray or in between area. Murder is murder. We have killed more unborn babies in this country than hitler did during world war 2 and that is is sad. I pray we stop acting like we are god and start acting more human with empathy and compassion. We are all give trials and tribulations and our true colors shine by how we choose to act and handle them."
I hope this women sues the state of Texas  for pain and suffering
I‚Äôm sure California would do ti asap and for free.
If they had made me carry to term I would still have a dead fetus inside of me right now lmao. This is insane
"Apart from a 230+ year old document - that was used to justify slavery and deny the women the right to vote - does anyone have anything else beyond pure pragmatism to justify killing a developing human in the womb but not outside the womb?






By the way, a non viable developing human isn‚Äôt alive. Hence, this story has zero to do with being pro LIFE!"
He had a brain. A brain not dividing is way different than not having a brain. Still terribly sad. üòî
People don't care until its happening to them. Body autonomy should be a human right.
Horrible...my condolences
"Sounds more than ""nonviable"" if it can survive for even up to a year after being born."
"Pro choice here. I am not shocked this is happening, I am shocked she still believes she has any right to deem when abortion is or isn‚Äôt necessary. Both of you are dumb and could not make the final stretch. If an abortion in colorado costs 10-15k its HIGHLY probable that abortion cannot feasibly be used as frequent as birth control. however even if abortion was: why would we force them to carry a child they don‚Äôt want"
My heart was restarted twice with adenosine and me and my baby were on bed rest for three months while our heart rates dropped and I had to lay there helplessly as she was on my sciatic nerve and killed the nerves to my knee. I started the pregnancy doing 5K‚Äòs and ended up not being able to walk in a wheelchair.  I literally used my body my choice to try to get the doctors to take her out early when she was viable enough to save her life over mine while they were restarting my heart with adenosine for the second time and it wasn‚Äôt working and she was losing oxygenation to the brain.   Because they didn‚Äôt take her out she is nonverbal and will never speak or have a normal life.   They did not respect my wishes as her mother to save her before me even though I have a life-threatening illness and she had a full healthy life ahead of her if they had listen to me.   Its not our bodies or our choices.  They‚Äôve chosen for us.
Stop voting republican
I had a missed miscarriage at 3 months‚Ä¶ I still had to carry my baby 2 weeks after finding out my baby had passed away inside me. Those 2 weeks were horrible I can‚Äôt imagine having to carry the baby until full term.
Prayers to the family.
Its still murder no matter what its situation is

"We are not a ""Free"" country anymore.  If I was still in my twenties I would be looking for an exit any way I could find.   Good luck ladies.  WE are no longer safe."
"Pro life people act like medical issues with pregnancy are something rare when they are in fact so common. Then they are surprised when it happens to them or someone they know. 

When something is going wrong with your pregnancy the last thing you want to do is fight with the law.

Few women actually choose to get an abortion and most of those women who do are either teenagers, or below the poverty level. The fast majority.

It's easy to say not to get an abortion when you may end up homeless if you don't."
"Society needs to stop pushing their beliefs on everyone else, mind your own business and keep my body out of your business and leave my body in my business where it belongs!"
This is a medical issue and should have been delt with medically. The Dr who did not deal with it was negligent.
"God works in really mysterious ways,really really mysterious ways!"
I'm glad I got my abortion back in 2017 before this banüòÇ nothing was wrong with the fetus I just didn't want it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
What‚Äôs more tragic is that it‚Äôs clear they were pro life voters. You don‚Äôt care until something like this is FORCED upon you.
"Why don't you, ABC, look into the MEDICAL reasons for her carrying to term rather than slicing her children up and sucking them out of her body, or tearing them out a leg at a time.  Birth is a natural process, whether or not the babies are alive.  ABORTION is NOT natural, unless it is spontaneous through miscarriage.  This could have ended up with a dead MOTHER as well as still born babies."
She shouldn't have had sex ABSTINENCE IS THE ONLY WAY NOT TO GET PREGNANT Another THEN HE WOMAN WHO ACTUALLY CANT GET PREGNANT WHICH THAT IS REALLY SAD  WOMAN HOW CAN GET PREGNANT ARE Taking advantage of that she could be stupid and go have a backdoor ABORTION
"My heart goes out to this woman.  ""The pain she has to endure is enormous"".  Can you just imagine the pain a baby, yes a baby, endures during abortion.  Easier not to think about that isn't it?"
So sorry. ü´Ç
"I‚Äôm sure even with the brain being the way it is, this baby would still feel the pain during an abortion at its fetal stage- thank God Texas is saving these poor babies from painful murder."
"Pure evil, someone who wants to kill their innocent precious baby that they created, that God wanted them to have for a reason"
"Oh, oh, it was because God and republicans loved it so much it had to go to Heaven before it was born."
"Republicans: we want less government intrusion in our lives!!!
Also Republicans:  make the government ban abortion!!!"
Boohoo pro life conservative Texas woman can't (in her own opinion) kill her unborn baby. Big whoop. She even judged other women in this interview. This is sweet karma.
Despicable that a women's healthcare decisions are being made by the government.  Patriarchy in all it's glory üò°  A major set back to women.  üò§üò°  A return to days when women has no rights.
Everyone needs to stop controlling women's bodies.
American freedom?!  A husband and wife cannot choose abortion to protect the wife‚Äôs health. But they can own as many guns as they want!
"I‚Äôm sorry they are going through that.  I think it‚Äôs sad that no one feels like this baby‚Äôs life is worth it. Is it traumatic and horrifying to find out your child‚Äôs life expectancy is a year after birth? OF COURSE. But many babies sadly die from SIDS or get diagnosed with fatal  medical conditions after birth and they don‚Äôt live very long. Should we terminate all pregnancy‚Äôs if we know the child won‚Äôt ever become an adult? No. If it‚Äôs not unsafe to the mother to carry, I don‚Äôt understand why she feels the need to terminate the baby‚Äôs life? That baby is beautiful, and precious, and matters, even if we know his life will be short. I‚Äôm praying he is healed in Jesus‚Äô name and that the next scan they will see his brain is forming the way is should be."
"The family shouldn't have ever been in a situation where they weren't in control of her reproductive rights. If you don't want an abortion, then don't have one. But it isn't the place of the government to regulate any woman's uterus. Ever!"
The child deserves to be delivered naturally and feel loved until he passes..that's the right thing to do. She's not in distress but the baby would be.
Women reproductive rights are going to the dark ages and still they vote for the stupidest people that make these laws.
This makes me mad üò° how dare the government make this family suffer with knowing they have a child that will not live they want her to carry full term
What about the mental cruelty she has to endure. Oh my God!  Horrific.
"The majority voted in the politicians that bought these types of non exempt laws to the table. And instead of the public thoroughly examining the bills before siding yes or no blindly, this is what we get. So we all live with the outcomes until further notice.  In the states, where it is illegal, let's not expect any changes too soon."
"Every life is valuable. EVERY LIFE. God gives and takes away life. Wanting to abort even a ""non-viable"" baby means missing out on joy, lessons, growth, and grace that God can provide in such a tragic situation. That baby has an ETERNAL soul and is precious."
So beyond stupid ignorance of Texas
PROPAGANDA.
"If anyone deserves this, it's literally her. She knew nothing about medicine and decided abortion was bad and now she knows 1 thing about medicine and thinks she should be exempt from the rules she voted for. Come on."
"Well, I hope more conservative folks will listen to this lovely couple from Texas. This poor family. The poor baby. Reverse the overturn of Roe vs. Wade. Thank God I live in California. Although I myself would not get an abortion unless I was in a situation where my life or the baby's are in jeopardy, a situation like these people are going through, but I still believe that abortions MUST be legal especially today. You can't POSSIBLY think that no sex Ed in schools PLUS no abortions is REALLY a good idea..."
"I feel for them. She has to carry the child full term, only to see her beloved child with disabilities and deformities. And then to see the child die. That‚Äôs a lot. And if she gets postpartum depression that‚Äôs even worse. :("
Abortion is murder.
"Sad 
I had to get an abortion years ago because I was having difficulties. 
I had to make a decision loose the child, myself or us both in danger of dying. I choose abortion I already had 2 toddlers & a new husband. It would not of been fair for them loosing a mother at such a young age nor my husband loosing his wife."
"This whole situation is scary, and women being rape are getting pregnant early smh ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è what happens now ?!?!???"
Religious turds making laws about crap they know nothing about. Typical right wing stupidity.
are there really dumb people who believe that someone use abortions for birth control ??
"""...that people have to do this...""  -- do what?  I don't mean to be insensitive, but that child will have a full brain in heaven and is a complete person here on earth, whether in his mother's womb or outside of it."
"Such a sad story. Imagine this being your wife, your sister, your daughter, how would you feel about it? Would it change your mind? I am pro-choice, our government has no business in our private affairs. I mean, if a woman is out there using abortion as birth control, perhaps there should be repercussions, but most women have an abortion because they feel they have to, not because they want to, it‚Äôs done out of necessity. This is just crazy. How big is our government going to get? How many aspects of our lives do they get to control?"
I love how all the men who've never been women have the most to say. The fetus doesn't have a brain. HOW ELSE CAN A HUMAN LIVE WITHOUT A BRAIN? NO BRAIN=IMMINENT DEATH... üôÑ
Thank a republican
I'm sorry for your situation.
Women have had to do this even Before Roe VS Wade was over turned.  Please research people becMSM is just playing on your fears n outrage.
So doctor has said your health is not in jeopardy and the baby is alive. God gave you this baby to love for however long he lives. Making this stance for abortion when you don't believe in it is a shame. Now pro-aborts will use your baby and your story to kill many babies needlessly. Please pray about why you are doing this and whose future besides your own you are affecting.
"Man, that ban.... what a setback."
NO SYMPATHY GOD doesn't like ugly
Don't feel sorry for you you voted to overturn Roe v Wade so live with your choice
"Every human has value, even the ones people will deem 'non-viable'. It's not up to us to play God and destroy that life."
Could idk go 1 state over‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. It goes state to state.
"You know, I had sympathy for them until their comment about disagreeing with abortion ‚Äòas a form of birth control‚Äô. Gives big ‚Äòmy abortion is the only moral abortion‚Äô energy. Pointless gatekeeping and splitting hairs about which types of abortions are justifiable is why America is in the mess that it‚Äôs in. They were quite happy to feel smug in the fact that they would never have to deal with an unintended pregnancy but now the draconian anti abortion laws  attitudes like theirs have supported have meant that they are now in an awful situation."
"I think I know what‚Äôs going on. I don‚Äôt know how to put this in exact words but nobody in their right mind is going to do this to another human being UNLESS they are using these poor mothers to show you the downside so well that we agree to reinstate the abortion laws. I have a feeling this is not an accident that they put that innocent poor woman though that without it standing for something. The government is actually really smart and sick for this if what I‚Äôm thinking is true. I‚Äôm starting to think Texas is showing you the actual permanent cruelty making women go through birth regardless of the mother‚Äôs well being. I am personally against getting rid of the abortion  and stories like this really just confirms why this is a bad idea to make abortion illegal to begin with. If the government is going to be this heartless (which is on purpose for a purpose I can assure you) than we really don‚Äôt need to get rid of abortion. This is to much and it sickening. You have to lock me up in prison cause I wouldn‚Äôt have made her go through that. That would have been a big fat yes approval to abort the baby and save the mother. These reasons right here is why people need to leave abortion alone and stop trying to control everything and everyone. This is ridiculous and not okay. Abortion is very personal and very hard and frankly it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business. I would never get an abortion unless I‚Äôm in a situation like this beautiful mother but I don‚Äôt find it appropriate for anyone to judge a person getting an abortion. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business. We all are never going to see eye to eye on this but one things for sure, putting mothers through this is uncalled for regardless of the point they are trying to make. Y‚Äôall really dropping the ball on this. I‚Äôd rather save the mother from heartbreak and devastation she would have to go through after all this. My answer will always be the same. Keep abortion legal!!!! Can somebody please make it illegal to hound the abortion clinics is what really needs to happen. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business, I get it save the children but we can‚Äôt even take care of all the American foster children already and y‚Äôall want more??? I can smell the stupidity from here!!!"
Welcome to Texas ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
Oh so because it may only live for a year it's worth killing sooner.... Hm
"The forced birth zealots will love this, they have no regard for the women‚Äôs feelings or health, she is nothing to them but a birthing vessel and she loses her bodily autonomy by law and she will be owned by the state until she gives birth."
Thank the old white men in your state ladies!!!!
Are his other organs viable and working? Your baby could save so many other babies lives!
People like them are the reason that those laws exist. They won't even say the word abortion and that woman thinks that there are people who use abortion instead of birth control. No one does that. They are clearly misogynistic Republicans who didn't care until it affected them.
"""It's necessary if it's for my benefit, but it shouldn't be allowed for others"". The hypocrisy is real."
"2:52 As soon as she said that it made me realize she is apart of the reason her (and other women in her state) are struggling to access this type of medical care. She wanted to ban all abortions, she only had a problem with her stance when she realized it would affect her life. It‚Äôs not up to anybody else to make these decisions about a person‚Äôs body, only the person who is pregnant. Hope this experience expands her perspective.

Edit: grammar"
Im glad you are sharing your story and helping to shine light on how these barbaric laws will effect people in reality!!! How your Vote matters! Who you chooseto lead definitely matters!
Could she not drive to another state?
"I couldn't watch this bc I immediately started to tear up.
10 years ago my boyfriend and I decided we wanted to have a baby. We'll I schedueled an apointtment they did a test said it was positive and sent me to a different hospital I thought it was normal bc this hospital was basically for sick and emergencies.. Well the second apointment they told me there were two heart beats and I would have to go to a high risk hospital after my next visit with them.. (my next visit was a glucose test) and after that we were sent to a hospital about 1hr away from where we lived. This is where we found out just how high risk our twin pregnancy was. They told us from the jump that this would go week by week.. we had weekly visists. and each visit they'd say next week we might have both, we might have one, or we'll loose both but lets hope for the best. I lost one at 22 weeks. My body went into labor and I had the second twin living (he lived for about 1 hr) and the other was still born. Their names are Elijah & Gabriel. I had no option to have the still born twin I had to carry him as long as my body would let me and that was less than 24hrs. Had I made it 24 weeks I would have been admitted into the hospital for the ramainder of my pregnancy.

I can research twin pregnancy all day long.. and figure out a game plan. but you never know what will happen. Nothing can stop what is to come. If your doing everything right to care for your unborn child.. not drinking, not doing drugs, taking your vitamins, eating!!
They said one of my twins wasn't getting what he needed.. the living twin weighed more than he did. I took my vitamins and ate as my dr directed. and still one passed away. No one could have controlled how much went to which twin.

So, I think its ignorant for people in the comments to say nobody cares about what shes going through... or she should have thought about this before.
To the people who dont want to abort their child they dont think about the abortion laws bc its not something they want to do. However if you are in a situation like this there should be an option to do so. If the baby has passed on and your body isn't going into labor.. maybe the doctor can induce you. Idk if that is apart of the law that the dr cant induce a pregnancy.. but if the baby.... 

Ok, I stopped typing and watched the video.
This is very sad.
How does a baby or person live with no brain..
Maybe this ultrasounds is wrong.. (it has happened)
I've been there where I was only able to hold my baby for an hour until he took his last breath. He wasn't developed enough and the hospital didnt have any supplies. & this was supposed to be the high risk pregnancy hospital. This was the place they sent people for high risk pregnancies.. if st. jude and leboner can save a baby at 20 weeks then why couldnt this high risk pregnancy hosptial try to save mine at 22 weeks.
I didn't fight because I felt in my heart it was time to let him go. He went to heaven with his twin brother. I knew it was time in that moment to say goodbye. I love both of them <3
two months later I found out I was having another baby and her name is Lailah! She's 8 now <3
I can only imagine trying to care for a baby that is possibly be none responsive..
knowing at any moment he or she could be gone.

idk what I would do in that situation having been through something not so the same before.. but right now I would say I'd carry the baby and enjoy what time I did have with him or her. Hold them snuggle them bc either way that is your baby. It sounds so awful to say ""I dont want my baby bc he doesn't have a brain"".. saying it that way does sound bad.. but listen to them they wanted a baby they dont want to abort their child. but now they are preprocessing the loss of their unborn child. Their child wont live past a year (based off of statistics) and the baby will essentially be lifeless. It's sad either way you go about it. but the baby is developing.. he's growing he just doesn't have a brian.. so I understand that he is living and you cant terminate a living baby. So, I'd say carry the baby to term and enjoy the time you do have with him. Hold your baby and love him bc any second he could pass away."
"She knows that I have a hard time controlling it. It‚Äôs just she wasn‚Äôt expecting it to stop no.  But she just wanted me to learn. That behaviour is not OK you know

Like sometimes people with mental disorders, have behaviours and violent behaviours that they can‚Äôt control sometimes.  But even if you know that you still should put a consequence on that behavior.

Even though he might, or she might not be able to control it. She or he can at least learn that OK yes this behaviour isn‚Äôt ok and I need help you know

Yes, I still had violent outburst. But that‚Äôs not the point the point is that I knew it was wrong. I eventually learned that.  Yes I can‚Äôt control it but instead of hitting I could do you know get a counsellor or do you something you know so that I don‚Äôt act that way in the future


That‚Äôs why she created a consequence because she was hoping that I would acknowledge that and try to get somebody to help me deal with it you know.  And it worked. I haven‚Äôt been violent for quite a few years you know. Because I‚Äôm not in a situation, where I feel like I have to pound the life out of somebody. You know I‚Äôm not in that situation so as long as I don‚Äôt get put in that situation.

You should never see me get physically, and/or emotionally violent again. Because that‚Äôs a problem. If I do end up living in a place where somebody‚Äôs screaming or yelling, you know when they get mad or upset. And it‚Äôs also why they‚Äôre getting upset too that‚Äôs what ticks me off.

Right like I had a roommate that used to get mad and he‚Äôd yell and swear at the support staff for trying to help him do his laundry.

He would get very rude and belligerent if somebody tried to help him with some thing. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even think he was angry. Sometimes I think he just like to behave like that I know sometimes I think he liked the idea of looking tougher, you know

Instead of just saying no, I don‚Äôt need any help with that. Thank you very much though you were very very very kind to try to help me.

You know that would‚Äôve been the proper way you know. And most people do get ticked off and yeah they do they can get physically violent.  But most people choose not to do that, right

But with me, it isn‚Äôt a choice you may ask OK if you can‚Äôt control getting violent then why haven‚Äôt you done that for a few years now.

Well, let me explain that. It‚Äôs because I know I can‚Äôt help it and because I‚Äôm so scared that I will end up in serious trouble you know. That I just try to avoid those situations you know.

Because I know I can‚Äôt I might be not able to control my actions in the moment. So I always like somebody to go with me so that if that happens, I can just tell them.

OK let‚Äôs get the heck out of here. You know that if I were to be on my own, you know. It would be much harder because. Yes I could leave and I have before too as well.

But it wasn‚Äôt as quick thinking. I was actually thinking should I get involved or should I just walk away.  Because I really wanted to do you know if somebody was being mean to somebody I really want to step in there and save them.

But you know my counsellor that I have now says that you know if they were to be like that it‚Äôs better off that wait until they leave and

Then go up and see if the person is OK and offer them support. Because if I went to that person, and I started it all yelling and screaming in his face or her face.

Then I would be just as bad as he is, or she is you know. And I don‚Äôt want to look that way I don‚Äôt want to look like an idiot. I don‚Äôt want that person that is being treated badly to look at me and

I think I am being a bully and not the other person you know because that‚Äôs exactly what they would think you know.  They would think I‚Äôm pulling the bully, and then all the attention will be on me and

I would be in big trouble I would be being a bully, not the other person. So it‚Äôs just good to wait until they‚Äôre done and left and then you go up to the person.

And ask them if they‚Äôre OK and offer support. And say to the person that you didn‚Äôt deserve what happened you know that was completely rude you know

And then that way they‚Äôre still feeling that support from me without being a bully, you know."
I wonder if the anti-abortionist do listen to medical professionals about health.
üåπüôèüèº
Elections have consequences.  It all sounded good until it affected her and her life and only then does she feel it should be available under certain circumstances.
"By her own ‚Äúabortions aren‚Äôt birth control‚Äù logic she shouldn‚Äôt be given an abortion. That baby is still ALIVE and the doctors didn‚Äôt deem it medically necessary. Her own lack of compassion for others is officially her problem, and that sucks. I hope others learn from this and start voting in the best interest of the public, not just what they think benefits them at the time or in the interest of controlling other people."
"I‚Äôve done this. I NEVER thought boy I want an abortion. I knew what was going on, I knew the outcome, I also knew god would support me through this. 
I‚Äôm sorry she/they all struggled with this. I know the pain of loss. Either way, grief is involved."
"Oh god, alobar holoprosencephaly is extreme. In some cases, the babies have one eye in the middle of their faces and no nose."
"I thought Joe Biden was going to make abortion possible. But again you people must‚Äôve voted for that lady who wanted she was so against people you know doing bad things that she obviously didn‚Äôt want abortion.

I forget what her name was. I don‚Äôt want to know because people like that makes me sick you know

I mean, there‚Äôs people that don‚Äôt want to have kids and don‚Äôt wanna give birth because they just can‚Äôt handle probably what they hear on a daily basis. Like they don‚Äôt want their child to end up a school shooter or you know a person who kills more than more people add an event on. 

Like sometimes in Barrie, they would have fairs, and that they usually have a fair that goes on in the summer at the waterfront.  And people just like to ruin that for kids and their families and friends to

Like lots of teenagers, go there with their friends, and have fun and have a ball. No just a bunch of innocent people just going to have fun that‚Äôs all.  But people like to use that opportunity, you know to kill them at that fair you know.

Thank God that hasn‚Äôt happened yet thank the Lord.  But you‚Äôre starting to hear more and more and more that now you know would like the July 4 shooting. That one was bad. I think a little boy like five or six years old maybe even younger. Had lost his parents you know

I think his dad I think the boy and his mom and dad are watching the parade and just like everybody else you know they were killed. Lotta people were killed that day you know

So yeah, it‚Äôs very very very scary you know. So I‚Äôm disgusted that doctors can‚Äôt do anything to stop a baby from growing in your belly.  Because I know in Canada, abortion is legal.

And I don‚Äôt know why in the states people don‚Äôt have the option of abortion.  Because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll change the fact that lots and lots and lots of people will still have kids you know I think there‚Äôs so so so many people that would at least adopt. Do you know kids from other countries.  So it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me that abortion is banned because you know.

There‚Äôs lotta kids for adoption do you know nobody Hass to give birth you know.  I mean when you adopt a child, you‚Äôre basically signing lots and lots and lots of paperwork and signing documents, saying that that child is now yours you know.

It‚Äôs exact same thing if you were to give birth because.  You have to sign papers in that too. You know there‚Äôs a lot that goes into pregnancy probably just the same amount as you were to adopt.

Do you know what you need to have a room. Toys depending on how young the child is. You have to buy clothing you know so it‚Äôs still as much work as it is to you know get pregnant you know

And plus I think you‚Äôre allowed to have some say that‚Äôs the only difference is that you‚Äôre allowed you know you‚Äôre allowed to have the same as to what personality of the child you‚Äôre looking for and you know how friendly you want them to be.

Like if you‚Äôre a mother and a father, who likes to go out and enjoy boat rides and traveling. You would want to adopt a child that would enjoy that too. You know

Yeah, giving birth you don‚Äôt always have that choice you know. You got like a 50-50 chance that you know you‚Äôre taking your chances and

When you give birth, sometimes children grow up and they aren‚Äôt very nice and did you get into lots of trouble sometimes they don‚Äôt care about how their parents feel. Like half of the school shooters or mass murders probably have a very loving family and that will never never never except violence in their house, I know my parents don‚Äôt you know they never agreed with violence of any kind 

I mean, if I had to leave from school because of my violent behavior.  Then she will have consequences for me and she sure did you know she didn‚Äôt put up with any of that

Even though she knows, I can‚Äôt help it, right"
"Well, DUH."
This womans experience was cruel and inhumane.
"The government trying to tell women what to do with their bodies is so wrong and so screwed up. To make a woman carry a baby to term that has something wrong with him and they know he's going to die, can cause death to the mother as well. And if that's the case, the husband should be able to sue the government for basically killing his wife. If it wasn't the government that got a woman pregnant, then they shouldn't have any say about what the woman does with her own body"
They should consider suing the state for mental health issues and for medical costs.
Inhumane
Forced birth is murder
"If only y'all can treat gun laws like abortion laws. Guns take more lives than abortion do... Another distraction from focusing on REAL ISSUES! Instead of banning abortion entirely EXACTLY HOW YOUR WONT BAN GUNS INTIRELY! You use the excuse (It's for our safety.) Well abortions can come at a woman's safety. (Men: So, you're prioritizing yourself over another human being) MEN DO IT EVERY SINGLE DAY IN POWER YOU EGOTISTICAL MUTS! Get over yourselves men are continuously trying to tell woman what to do with their bodies. You're not the ones pushing out the babies, you're not the one carrying for 9 months, you're not the one on the delivery bed. Shut up honestly if you can't carry than you aren't part of this conversation at this point. Regardless ban it if you want, you're just causing people to move out of your shitty state which is something my family had to do because she wasn't able to have an emergency abortion due to the fetus (egg) was stuck in the fallopian tube, due that that the baby would either not grow properly if it does pass through at a later point, my sister was at high risk of death during birth or the baby could possibly miscarriage as it's not possible for an egg to grow in the fallopian tube so to leave that fetus inside of her till term... disgusting. GUNS KILL WAY MORE PEOPLE THAN ABORTIONS DO... WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY MORE! Remove guns than you can continue the abortion debate but till than ladies. MOVE! GET OUT OF THERE. GO SOMEONE WERE PEOPLE CARE ABOUT YOU AND PRIORITIZE YOUR SAFETY! WHY RISK YOUR LIFE A CONFIRMED ONE OVER A POTENTIAL LIFE! Be smart! don't let them brain wash you with this nonsense. FETUS ARE NOT ALIVE! A fetus doesn't even have lungs fully working until approx 26-28 weeks. So even if there was an emergency anything prior to that the baby wouldn't even survive without life saving devices. Why would you even want your child to live life like that... It's sad really. BE SMART LADIES REMEMBER WE ARE THE BRAINS USE IT. DON'T LET THESE MUTS BRAINWASH YOU! WE KNOW OUR BODIES BETTER THAN THEY EVER WILL!"
America: ‚ÄúHome of the free‚Äùüòíüòí smh
"Abortion is most used in the States as birth control, sickening. Many Prayers for this family. Never forget God is Great all the time! Have faith you will make it thru this."
"The southern border is bringing turmoil to our country. These main stream media news is on china side. They don't give a fat rat assss. China doll news anchors, report cow farted before border crisis. It does not fit the anti American narrative. Msm, is on our adversary side."
It‚Äôs so sad that the government thinks they can get involved in our health and well being.
The entire anti-abortion issue is driven by religion. And religion is make believe. End of discussion - engage with reality it will happen and legal = safe.
"She chose to have a pregnancy. Of course not all pregnancies are the same. If the child is dead, it is a miscarriage. If the child is alive then it‚Äôs a forced miscarriage, also known as an abortion. In other countries they have wiped out the disable kids. Since the doctors see the fetus ‚Äú not developing properly‚Äù and advice to have an abortion or it would look bad. This is only the second case, that has happened and just needs a bit more research. It does not happen that often, therefore making it not necessarily to reverse the anti-abortion laws."
If this woman were to die from complications of the forced pregnancy....her family should be able to sue each and every political figure thus OWNING the state of TX in the end.
"Medical advances are allowing babies to be created...but there are cases where one or both parents have biological issues that would never bring forth a child. 

Medically assisted fetus' that turn out to be (in this case broken) should not be held under this ridiculous new law!!!!"
I‚Äôve lost hope for America. Good luck everyone.
To anyone outraged by this and other recent supreme court rulings == if you were too busy or disinterested to vote in 2016  -- THIS IS ON YOU.
No brain baby that‚Äôs exactly what Republicans want. Someone just as stupid as the rest of them
"Thank the holier than thou brainless GOP.
May they suffer far worse instances of pain & suffering than these countless parents are forced to endure."
"Most people who are anti abortion think it's used as ""birth control"" when it's not used that way. No one uses it that way. People get abortions because they need to. Like ""Its not fair"" when they were the ones to vote for anti abortion."
"üò¢,poor family"
I can‚Äôt believe that people STILL believe in the myth that abortion is used as birth control. NO IT‚ÄôS NOT. Think about it logically. Is it logical to spend hundreds of dollars to get an abortion when you can spend a few bucks on birth control? That‚Äôs essentially what you‚Äôre saying. Jesus Christü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Texas has decided to take control of women‚Äôs lives. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with this.
So wrong on so many levels..wtf.
I hope and pray that baby is  born perfectly normal and they have a healthy baby ! God is always good no matter what ! Amen !
"Women are now second class citizens in states where abortiion is not allowed.  W/O legal, safe abortion, women will die.  We must be allowed to make our own decisions.  I come from the era before Roe and had to get a safe if illegal abortion.  I was lucky, but my granddaughter who is 19 may not be.  If this woman can get to California or Washington, she will be ok.  I encourage you to
do everything you can to get to a state that is legal."
"How is this not considered mental, emotional and physical abuse of a Mother and mental and emotional abuse of the Father?"
Did they vote Republican to support these anti-abortion laws before finding out her baby was not gonna make it? üßê
"So did she end up having her son or is she still carrying him in her womb? We need the whole story ABC,not just some of it. Besides,this baby could prove dr.'s wrong and live past 1 year and so on. It just means he may not be able to walk or talk and feed himself. It's not a big deal if he has to sit in a wheelchair and be fed with a feeding tube device. Hundreds of children are born every day with medical issues like cerebral palsy that make them invalids for life and their parents didn't abort them in vitro just because they didn't know and thought their lives no matter how long and short were worthless and a waste because they can't be normal."
I am conservative but I am pro choice. I believe it's wrong to force people to go through something like this. It's not loving. Someone make a go fund me for her to get her the $15k to get it done in Colorado ‚ù§Ô∏è
"""Cool story, bro"" üòê"
I wonder how they voted
"No matter what the reason for an abortion is, it's healthcare that should be universally available to everyone who  has a uterus. All reasons are VALID! Reproductive Healthcare CHOICES should not be regulated by politicians! You're morals and values (most likely based on religious upbringing) have no bearing on another person's healthcare."
"The best thing to do is have the baby, fruit of the love between you and your husband. They wanted a baby and now his imperfections give them cause to doubt their first idea. Their marriage will thrive if they can accept this imperfect child and love him even for the short time he lives. Watch videos on youtube about how to get through this and enjoy the blessing of the child."
If she‚Äôs not an advocate for birth control and is pro-life why is she bitching.  She wasn‚Äôt ‚Äú forced‚Äù she chose to vote for laws that made this her reality.
This poor lady. How is it right to keep someone suffering like this? These new laws have just caused craziness
"No sympathy for this family. They voted for these laws with no compassion, and in the video still made it clear that the only moral abortion is theirs."
"Exactly. I may never choose to terminate personally, but I will never vote against a womens right to choose."
"Why are people in the comments getting so crazed with her statement of ‚Äúpersonally not for it for the way of birth control‚Äù? That‚Äôs a very fair statement, because there are people who don‚Äôt use any kind of birth control and they‚Äôll get an abortion every time, I don‚Äôt believe that abortion should be for that, you should prevent yourself from getting pregnant not get yourself pregnant and get rid of it.

This situation this woman is in isn‚Äôt wanting an abortion because she never wanted to be pregnant, the baby isn‚Äôt going to live, and it‚Äôs got no brain, that‚Äôs a legitimate reason for NEEDING to end a pregnancy.

People are basically saying you can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it too, but that‚Äôs not what she wants, stop looking at ‚Äúaccidental pregnancy‚Äôs‚Äù and a harmful condition as the same thing."
"there‚Äôs a scene in it‚Äôs always sunny in philadelphia where one of the main characters, Mac, dog gets pregnant and the only way the dog would survive is with abortion, for some preface, Mac is hyper religious and pro life, his response to the vet when he said that the puppies would need to be terminated was to go through with the abortion to save the dogs life. A second main character was at the vet with Mac when he made that comment and Charlie said, i thought you were against abortion? Mac replies, Oh, yeah, but this situation effects me. 
In short, people always want to have an opinion until they‚Äôre effected by it."
"Back to the medieval ages, I guess"
So sad the country is crazy cruel and controlling
Abortion is healthcare
"Family planning laws need to ensure that they take into account medical needs for mom and baby. This isn't a black and white issue. Non viable pregnancies should be an exception to restrictive laws. It's already heartbreaking enough knowing a baby won't live to birth or shortly after, to risk the moms life is too much üò¢"
"This is exactly what happens when women try to dictate the terms in which we can abort. Abortion is abortion. You don't get cookies for using it for medical reasons vs. for a lack of readings or financial wherewirhal. 

I'm not happy that she's going through it but the fact that she draws a line of distinction between motivations is hypocrisy. Let that fetus run its' lifeterm, since abortion is wrong. She chose to get pregnant so that's her burden to bare. Smh


*I hope no one was too dense to catch the sarcasm*"
Can't do anything unless her health is in jeopardy?? Imagine the STRESS and anguish she experienced and what health consequences that has...
"This is cruel to both the mother and the child inside her, this should definitely qualify for a legal abortion. 
 TBH the only time I think abortion should be illegal is for those women who just keep on having them, they should be forced to have long effected birth control. And then I of course don‚Äôt believe abortions should occur after 23 weeks, unless! the baby is gravely ill or severely disabled where they would always be dependent of others, medicines etc. Or if the mother is gravely ill where continuing with the pregnancy would kill her.

There are different circumstances that need to be reviews. Abortion should never be a flat out ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù"
This makes me so angry.  Vote blue.  Vote blue.  Vote blue.  This is absolutely inhumane.  OUTRAGEOUS.
Vote blue.
Everyone always has an excuse for killing their baby. Maybe you should just keep your legs closed.
"So sad. Just because these people want to force their religion on you, people have to go through this"
You are not carrying a non-viable pregnancy. You are carrying a child who will most likely not survive. Sounds like you're pro-choice and using your very small case (less than 3 percent)  to justify the majority of cases of abortion.
Nobody is for abortion for birth control stop believing the propaganda
I always say you can't play a victim when you vote for this. Suck it up and deal with it because that's what you thought when voting.
This is still a very rare case in abortions. While most cases are just people who don‚Äôt take responsibility. In cases like these I believe there should be exceptions
This is basically a late miscarriage!!! What the hell is wrong with ppl !
"I feel sorry for them but I have to say I have seen 100s of miracles of babies fully recovered when born. What if that happens for their baby? There is a purpose and a plan for everything. 

When my mom was pregnant with my sister on the ultrasound they saw everything that could possibly be wrong and that she would die too. She came out miraculously healed of every single medical issue they saw. 

I know there is a chance that might not happen for them but there is another chance it can. 

I believe in prayer and miracles. ‚ù§"
"Well if I hadn't been to a women's conference having the wife of the leader of the UpcI and what I heard awful things said that if Governor Abbott doesn't see things our way we remind him while one of us pushes his wheelchair towards the stairwell, so they're you have why there's trouble in Texas. The name is Bernard's"
"the way she said she never would have thought she would have to go through this, as if any woman ever thinks that. like no one wakes up thinking about getting an abortion, its not an exciting thing or some form of birth control. like i hate women like the one here, and personally have no sympathy for whats shes going through"
Well that sucks.  Thanks to everyone too stupid to vote correctly
üò¢ so tragic...can we spot letting Men decide what we do with our Bodies. Please go vote

"3:00-3:14
It's no fun when the rabbit has the gun. Y'all are okay when other women are affected by draconian laws but when it's your turn wanna act confused."
They look like republcans. I think it'd be funny if she died from it.
"It's so crazy, I am pro-abortion for many reasons, this being one of them. Like how does abortion affect these antis? Does it affect you physically? Are you physically hurt by it?? Does if affect you mentally or emotionally?? It's like when those people say if you don't like it, stop watching. If you don't like abortion stop searching it up, watching videos about it, don't hang out or talk to people who have had or are going to have an abortion, if it's on something, and you don't want to see it, turn it off, look away. All babies know is the womb! They don't know anything outside of the womb, they haven't experienced the outside world, parents don't know what they actually look like since it's a black, white, and gray ultrasound, the baby most likely has no idea what their parents look like, so I see nothing wrong.  

I just saw a video about a woman who had killed her 21 day old something baby, on my YouTube recommendations there was a girl who killed her baby and buried it after prom, these crimes were before this Roe v. Wade, but imagine how it will increase after this Roe v. Wade. All because of these people that chose to vote for anti-abortion, not even looking deeper and realizing why it is needed, just wait in 5-10 years, the affects will be known, and yes now it's showing both sides will have to face the affects of this ruling. 

Yes people killing there children was bad before, and it'll still be bad now, most likely with an increase, babies will still be dying you haven't changed much. This time it'll be babies, that are outside they aren't in the womb anymore, it's the real world."
"Leopards ate her face. You voted for this, I hope you're happy."
"Used to be if you were pregnant you were pregnant. No ultrasounds, no abortions. Get what life gives. Only the convenience of said 'preventatives' leaves people in their feelings of being wronged, unjustified. Rights and autonomy, liberals and choices all modern terms to turn something natural into a convention and then steered back to natural through the grief and unrighteousness of it all ü§¶üèΩ

Disclaimer my condolences to this family and others who have gone through traumatic pregnancy experiences."
"Men can still purchase Viagra, condoms and vasectomies."
"Cruel, vicious, barbaric and NOT Christian."
We is a miracle maybe your baby will survive and be ok
I wonder how many people who are against abortion have ever chose euthanasia for a pet animal?
Having an Abortion is MURDER! No matter what noone had the right to disregard a baby an unborn. They have a right to live and yes even if they have health issues they are Human beings not to be disgarded like a piece of garbage.  If you don't want kids then prevent it from happening.
There should be exceptions in the law for cases like this.
"54% of women having abortions used contraception during the month they became pregnant. Women having 2 or more abortion are more than 2x as likely to be 30 or older and, even after controlling for age, almost 2x as likely to already have had a child.... like this woman here.  These women also are more likely to be using ""highly effective"" hormonal birth control (the pill, injections, implants, the ring). The data that the right-wingers use is from abortions peak in the 80s. Since then there has been a steady decline in them. Make fully informed decisions, don't just rely on what a talking head is saying. Turn the tv off for a night and research both sides. That's what patriotism is about, that's how to be a good citizen."
This is a lie.
"Yeah everyone says this is why the couple should only make the decision,umm they knew the risks of having a child there is no guarantee your child will be healthy and normal. It's a life not a car or object when are people going to realise this that you can't just despose/get rid of because you didn't like the order"
If you think this is wrong you should not have kids.
That's cruel to make her carry to term.
She or any woman is welcome to come to Oregon.
I have an idea. Maybe we should just pay women the respect of believing they know what is best for themselves and their families.
Come to Canada
"Honestly it is sad that they had to get to this point in life and have to carry a baby full term under those conditions. However i cannot feel bad because i can only assume they voted yes to pass the anti abortion law and the whole time the information, knowledge, the empathy to see and learn as to why its so important to keep abortions legal, all at the disposal of our mobil phone! In our world in this day and age there are serial rapist, predators, foster homes, and adoption agencies which are full to the brim with kids that are not wanted any more, or parents can‚Äôt afford medical care or food! We see advertisements on the news to adopt children and yet we pass a law to stop more children who are coming into this world only to be given up, removed, raped, or in this instance live to take a breath and then die. Nobody turns their attention to those kids and want to do something about no! Instead we as human beings want to put our noses in somebody else‚Äôs business and think we have a right to pick for them."
My friend has a 6 year old boy with this!!! He wasn't supposed to live past 1yr!!! But GOD!!! AND WHAT HE CAN DO!!!!!‚ô°
"this comment section does not pass the vibe check
have some empathy instead of gloating over this family's suffering"
"So did she have that baby already or not?  I'm confused. 

Also I'd love to adopt if they don't want the baby. Or did the baby not survive?

 I'm just happy mom is alive and healthy, sometimes the moms die too. Just tragic how these things can end up happening to you and you end up losing the woman you love. 

Whoever voted for this should be ashamed and do what they can to reverse this ruling. They should have been able to abort."
"2:52-3:07

"Not only no, but Hell no.  That isn't fair to the mother, dad or baby"
"Women are under attack. I can't believe we've allowed this to happen. You cannot force a woman to carry a fetus she doesn't want to carry - for whatever reason. The woman's say is final and the only one that matters. You cannot legislate sex. You cannot force the bringing of children into the world - we aren't taking proper care of the ones we already have. The notion presented that there are ""lots of adoptive families just waiting"" is a complete lie - and I know that for a fact. There aren't enough adoptive families for the poor babies who will be brought into this world with no one who will take them. Why can't people see that the purpose is to cripple women and  obtain surplus bodies to throw into war, into prisons (that are now profit-driven), to create an even bigger underclass that the upperclass will use for their own purposes. This insane law is already causing and will cause horrible things to happen. This insane law will feed poverty, feed the sex slave industry, create more agony, hunger and death, dysfunction, mental illness - and further destabilize our country - and the world. There are too many people on the planet now - we are outstripping the ability to feed everyone as it is. No woman undergoes an abortion willy-dilly. Abortion is a sad but absolutely necessary part of conscious, civilized existence. If this law is going to continue, just go ahead and put women into chains and be honest about seeing them as property and chattel and nothing more than production cows. Abortion has been legal for 50 years. It became legal for a very good reason that history taught us. Young women who aren't fighting this attack on their very beings, their very lives, are too young to understand why legal, safe abortions became law in the first place. Those who do not understand or heed history are doomed to repeat it. WAKE UP AND VOTE TO STOP THIS INSANITY."
i‚Äôm sorry for her but all she went through and still sounds like she would vote pro-life again. it‚Äôs interesting to hear stories from the woman who want/voted for this.

"So, you agreed with women losing agency over their own bodies UNTIL YOUR rights were taken away, huh? #FOH"
People Shouldn't Have Sex If they don't want kids and if they get forced to then use a weapon to stop whoever the guy is
"Hmm, maybe stop fucking with womens bodies. It's not your choice or opinion"
It's so fcked up what the government controls in our lives.
"Come on Doctors of America stand and  fight for something, did you sell your souls to religion and the corporations. I know many women doctors  and nurses are trying to stand up ,are they the only ones with the guts. Of course I know  all this doesn‚Äôt affect you men like it does we women. Your oath is, first do no harm, If you don‚Äôt stand up for that, you are not worthy to be called doctors."
Right-wingers believe selfishness if a virtue. They pass these horrific laws supported by awful people who simply don't care about the impact because they don't think it will impact them. These people are despicable
"clickbait, it's not a non-viable pregnancy.  Sometimes the doctors are wrong, like when they said the baby had Down syndrome they are wrong and the baby comes out normal so you just killed someone for no reason.  Killing someone with disabilities isn't fair to them and they are saying the baby might not live beyond 1 year but they don't know."
No man has the right to tell any woman what they can or cannot do with their bodies.  These men are disgusting.
People want to remove birth control and place hardship on women for getting pregnant but ignore the guys who are so eager not to wear a condom because  ‚Äúhis private is too big‚Äù or ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt feel right‚Äù. Or whatever bs these guys come up with.
"Abortion is healthcare. Calling it ""birth control"" indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of why people choose/ should be able to choose to get it."
"Well it's a conudrum. But I personally will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. I'm so sorry.this is beyond stupid. And who is going to care for him for a year if he actually lives? 
I'm a Christian. But I also still have common sense. And I'm a nurse. And I had an abortion lon ago because I am RH negative and I didn't know it and got pregnant and didn't know it. And I was testing negative. But I was pregnant with an Rh positive fetus and i ws having a severe allergic reaction to the fetus. Crazy as that sounds. Any how i had an awful experience. But I am alive."
i dont know a single woman using abortion as birth control. wtaf.
be careful when you vote against your own best interest.
"So sad. Condolences to them, it‚Äôs so heartbreaking to have a sick little one in utero. Especially with this outcome."
Texas should be all  liable for funeral costs for this baby.
"She wants to blame someone and I can‚Äôt blame her. However, even when D&C‚Äôs were not frowned upon Doctors still had the mother deliver the stillborn infant. Through the last 3 decades when Abortion was funded through Planned Parenthood and clinics in every city Abortion has become birth control."

"Elections have consequences folks,you wanted it,you got it."
"The echos of this trauma will forever affect the surviving daughter too. Please don‚Äôt forget her needs. She sees her mom‚Äôs belly grow, she hears people publicly ask ‚Äúwhen are you due‚Ä¶is it a boy or girl‚Ä¶?

Thanks for the explanation.
"So called Christians and  other religious types are the most ignorant people when it comes to the human body, the only reason they know where their heart is, is because it beats and they have no clue as to how it works, just that it beats. They are dangerous and are killing  women with their selfish ignorance. Try talking to one about health and the body. You will be talking to dumb and dumber. Women of America we must fight this evil for our freedom just like the brave ladies  of Iran who are being slaughtered by a  government who is trying to keep  them as sex slaves."
This ban is simply about control and harm to women's bodies and minds.

"I live in Texas and chose to terminate my first pregnancy last year for medical reasons, it was the hardest and most heart breaking experience I‚Äôve ever gone through, and Texas abortion laws add insult to injury. I‚Äôve always been pro choice but I never thought I‚Äôd personally be in a situation where I would have to choose, you truly don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like until you‚Äôre there"
Lord Jesus üò¢
This is what they voted for. Dont cry now.
Atp I feel like this is a lesson in life for them . Hopefully they will gain some sort of empathy for all women including the one their daughter will be .
"Where do they draw the line with this though? If your unborn child was diagnosed to have down syndrome, it‚Äôs just ok to kill it because you don‚Äôt want it to have a disability?  It‚Äôs a slippery slope"
The Democrats love killing babies
"Well...if you didn't have the ultra sound, you would have never known....and trust me She will survive ( iwe have and we have 2) and you will survive if you choose too.  Haveing a child with special needs isn't the end all to your life.  Unless that is what you choose.  Yep, we got what y'all wanted in Texas.  Now roll with your vote."
This is a valid reason to abort a baby. He's gonna be born without brain and that will affect the life of the family. It's better they abort him than they bring him to the world to suffer. Abortion was banned because of woke women who started aborting babies for no reason.
"Voting matters, tired of saying it over and over yet majority voted for this. A man who forces to carry even in cases or rape AND incest. Bunch of weirdos over here for sure."
PRO CHOICE. Miserable disgusting men making poor decisions based on hate.

The politicians don't believe this is right, they just want some red meat to feed their mad dog base. I watched one of my dearest friends gamble with her life and get eclampsia if we didn't live right near a hospital she would be dead. Privacy means privacy. Women have always died in childbirth but we live in a modern world why torture women? I've never met a person who used abortion as birth control. They use it because of all the circumstances life brings including the economy stupid."
Criminal. They want to wait for herself to suffer medical problems?? üò¢ I cannot. Thanks for bravely telling this personal journey. It really shows the heartbreak quiet desperation. This is shocking medical professionals should sack up. End this tragedy with some medical dignity for them this should be lawsuit precedence they should get something monetary at least in this ordeal. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
I am pro choice. What happens if a person comes up and ask to touch your belly? Do you tell them the baby has died and because of the abortion ban. Judging and you have someone telling you what to do. People should get facts straight people do not have abortions for birth control.
"If you‚Äôre a female still capable of getting pregnant living in Texas, you need to be planning an exit plan.  Otherwise this could very easily be your future, or worse."

Can someone tell me why she can't travel to a state where abortion is legal?
When are we going to ban viagra? Needs to happen asap
It is still a baby.  I could never purposefully take my baby‚Äôs life.
Anyone else notice the baby boomers lawmakers want America back to the way it was when they were kids?
These lawmakers are a bunch of hypocrites.
I don't agree with abortion at all. But I do believe that there should be special terms apply to certain cases. This is sad!
"That's horrific, it's abuse and torture to the Woman.üò†üò°ü§¨ She could have died!"
If I had to choose a word to describe this- ungrateful.

Unacceptable. Our women deserve better
"This crap is so ridiculous. I cannot believe that our government is interfering with our most personal life choices. It is nothing short of barbaric and frightening as hell. 
And don‚Äôt give me your psycho babble bullshit about the Bible or what YOU believe is morally wrong. All that shows is how truly ignorant you are and have no concept of what people deal with in our PERSONAL LIVES."
"This is a horrible thing to go through. However, I hope her hypocrisy is not lost on viewers. She refuses to use the word abortion, calling it a ""procedure"" and goes on to say she doesn't believe it's a suitable method for birth control. Now that she requires an abortion for her own medical emergency she finds validity in its use. She and her husband may also have voted for the very people that contributed to an abortion ban in her home state. I don't feel sympathy or empathy towards her. They are also showing their privilege in being able to travel to different states to seek out expensive abortions. Unfortunately those states also have their own conservative led abortion bans in place. Will we see these two at a pro-choice rally now that they are forced to carry a non-viable fetus to term? Probably not."
"she literally said it shouldn‚Äôt be used as a form of birth control because realistically no it shouldn‚Äôt. she did however say that in medical instances she supports it. she isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfacing the consequences of her own actions‚Äù and you can‚Äôt assume how this woman voted. if you asked me if i 100% support abortion, i‚Äôd say not entirely. BUT i damn sure did not vote for the politicians who took away a woman‚Äôs right to choose. Regardless of my opinions on elective abortion, it‚Äôs still every woman‚Äôs right to make the choice for her body. Stop attacking this woman who‚Äôs going through something traumatic that most of y‚Äôall have never experienced. It‚Äôs sick"
Oh well.
It‚Äôs unfortunate that women used abortion as birth control for children in utero and even partial birth that had no defect forcing states to take such drastic measures to protect children.
"Pro choice is the right of choice freedom of choice, not pro murder, not pro death. It's pro choice. This is a literal restriction onto women only. That alone is an issue!"
Lady you got what you voted for! And personally I hope your baby survives and becomes the biggest burden to you and your husband!!
You can sign paper and have someone taking off life support
"Heartbreaking for anyone wanting a child to suffer a loss of one. With the current law they could have turned a devastating situation into joy for many others. You're in Dallas there is husband and wife that have had two pregnancies with a similar genetic defect. Before the abortion band went in to affect, they still chose to take the baby to term. Because they donated all the viable organs to other babies who needed them. Their first child saved 12 infants lives and improved the quality of life for 30 more. And when they got pregnant again the same thing and they did the same thing. Every year for mother's Day they get so many flowers and cards from not just the people whose kids are alive today because of them, but from all over the city all over the state. I don't know what they did with their child but if they were to have done that? They would have  zero cost in hospital bills."
Sue the state for emotional damage!
So the solution is kill the baby so it doesn‚Äôt die???
There is no danger to her life but she's complaining that she will have a baby that will die young and she wishes she could just kill it right now.
Leave it to government to control women‚Äôs bodies and choices üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº they must be proud of themselves.
"This isn't dangerous for the mother.
 So, unless it is a perfect child you don't want to birth it?
Let's stop being selfish and start caring for children of all abilities.
If it had down syndrome would she be asking the same ?"
Why would you want to murder your baby at 23 weeks anyways and just carry your baby to term and let him or her go the way they are supposed to??
"Vote blue...esp this family living in that wheelchairmonster greg abbott. Someone needs to put him on a hill and gravity do its thing.

This poor lady. Texas will always be a red state tho. Too many rural bible thumping cowboys who hate immigrants.  No matter how many people die from a failing utility grid...they will still vote slugs like cruz and abbot in. Until we all vote out every single republican that bans books,  bans abortions, make up ridiculous laws to hurt gays and drag queens, and shipping immigrants all over. There are things that can be done on these issues but both side's keep them as hot button issues bc they need votes every cycle.  They dont want us working on term limits and forcing them to stop taking lobbyist pay offs. Its all a distraction. Get mad and vote blue, the lesser of two evils.  At least democrats want weed legalized. Look at what it did for Colorado, California, Nevada.

Wow. Way to make her trauma worse. Didn't think losing a baby could get worse but the legal system really just said hold my beer

I am sorry that they are going through this, but not taking time to think about who and what you are voting for and how it could possibly affect your future is insane. I will keep them in my prayer and hopefully the next time this law comes or up the people in place to make the laws are wanting reelection, they think twice about it."

"I think if her health is in danger I can understand it but if not , this STILL IS a life!"
"it breaks my heart to hear parents talking about the children they conceived in such sterile terms. and the word youre looking for is abortion. dont hide from the gruesome reality of what it actually is and what happens to a developing baby. the child is still worthy to be loved no matter how short the life may be. is it difficult? yes. but the value and principle of life is valuable is absolute, not just when it gets hard."
I had s similar situation. I was 20 weeks along. I had perinatal counciling and requested a c-section and thankfully my insurance approved it and I was given a hysterotomy.. My baby was born and she died outside of my womb but she passed humanly and I didn't have to go through the emotional grief of continuing in a pregnancy to full term.
"I feel for them because I have a friend who has gone through 3 miscarriages despite her and her husband really wanting to have children. However, the lack of awareness is stunning. She‚Äôs making judgment calls on people who receive healthcare when she thinks it‚Äôs used as birth control yet she‚Äôs upset that providers are making the same judgment call on her. Not having the choice to receive necessary healthcare is literally what they voted for - it‚Äôs only a problem now that they are personally affected."
She's not forced. She can drive to another state.
"Terribly sad for the family.  Terribly sad about the circumstances. 
 
But this is what happens when you vote for Republicans.  Ted Cruz, Greg Abbott and the rest of the Republicans are responsible for this dilemma.  They decided that women are second class citizens and voted to strip them of the right to make medical decisions about their own body.  They disregard your health, what kinds of impact this will have on your family, and the financial costs that this will entail as well.
Will Ted Cruz be on the hook for the delivery and any complications?  Will Greg Abbott be on the hook for the child's funeral?
Forced-birthing is reproductive slavery made legal.

I'm worried about another thing, since this family went public, will they come home to find a warrant for their arrest for seeking an abortion too?"
"She definitely alluded to being 'pro-life' later on in the video. I have empathy for her awful situation but does she and her ilk honestly believe pro-choice women want to intentionally kill babies? The reality is not all fetuses will become healthy babies and abortion is the only option to save the mother. I hate these selfish assholes who have no compassion until it happens to them.

Yet they'll still vote Republicans because they believe the lie that they're better economically, small government and to 'own the Libs' (democrats are awful as well so any attempts at a what aboutism is moot)"
"1 in a million moms, and million babies saved from death and being cut in pieces in their mother‚Äôs wombs."
Texas the most back assward people in the nation
"Republicans talk nonstop about spending to much money, less government, stay out of people‚Äôs lives and here are the fruits of their labor. 
A family that will suffer with a non viable pregnancy, forced to carry to term.  If this child lives 1 year, the parents will have to apply for Medicaid to keep him alive OR allow nature to take its course thus prolonging this family‚Äôs suffering.  It just doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Stay out of these people‚Äôs lives at their most emotional, important, difficult time in their lives."
"Disgusting pro lifers look what women have to go through bc oh save the babies...yeah how about go adopt children in foster care  and save them!
So sorry for you!!!prayers.."
Love the baby anyway. We adopted a baby with this condition and he only lived for a couple months but in Those months he was loved and cherished and taken cared of. ‚ù§ RIP baby Matt Pat
"If Texas wants to make the decisions for people they should pay the costs of pregnancy and raising the children. Including for mother's that must stay home to take care of those children, medical, food , rent, childcare. If they are the ones who think they need to make the decision for others. And if the mother's life is lost they should pay maybe 5million to the survivor?"
This has gotten so out of control. Supreme court has made this chaos happen.
Texas law does not force women to carry a nonviable fetus. Physician ignorance or fostering an agenda?  Stop the lies and fear mongering.
"Now this baby is gonna die if t does grow and leave the womb or it‚Äôll never become anything and I‚Äôm all for women‚Äôs rights and we should be able to control our own body. But at the same time woman let‚Äôs get smarter. Stop having sex without condoms and thinking birth control is gonna help you. Stop having sex without condoms cause the guy doesn‚Äôt want to wear it or you don‚Äôt want to wear it and look for holes and get the right size if it‚Äôs too big for him the cum will slip down and into you. We shouldn‚Äôt need abortions you should be careful when having sex unprotected and protected! Even if you two have known eachother two years now, no keep that condom on. You didn‚Äôt want any kids but you‚Äôre letting him cum in you come on now! GET SMARTER WOMAN!"
"""'I never thought leopards would eat MY face,' sobs woman who voted for the Leopards Eating People's Faces Party."""
This is so very unfair. Maybe we need to look at men's responsibilities and men birth control. And what about that little blue pill? Can you imagine the outrage if that was taken away? It is despicable that women are treated so inferior. Things would be ALOT different if this were happening to men. They would be screaming like little girls!
This is so STUPID.
Abortions are free in california.
This is not pro life.
Hop on a plane. Goto a safe abortion state. Done.
This is why nobody likes Texas
This is what happens when you vote against women and need the service you voted against. Karma.
May they enjoy their child as long as they can.
"But essentially what they‚Äôre fighting for is birth control‚Ä¶ your either stupid or haven‚Äôt been in the business of politics long enough to realize it. Sad that this wonderful fam went through that, sad that abc took it upon themselves to find this one in a million couple to make an example from  when every 45 minutes a baby dies from abortion without any underlying conditions ‚Ä¶. Good job nation wide media"
She should‚Äôve been more careful that‚Äôs on her..or no sex if you don‚Äôt want kids..
Sad you continue to vote for those that place these laws.
"If the human body will expell the fetus safely in it's own...then there is no need to interfere. If abortions are not necessary to preserve life, then they should not be utilized. Condolences to this family. However, these scenarios will not be used to justify abortionsüòí"
"Yes, instead of injecting euthanasia drugs into the baby's heart (which has been banned for being too inhumane for dogs and cats in most states) and then tear the baby limb from limb, Texas said to allow the baby to pass naturally on hospice with love and care. Pro aborts are truly the sickest people on the planet."
I like how she still can‚Äôt empathize with other women‚Äôs situations when she says she‚Äôs not for it being used a form of birth control. Abortion for me but not for thee.
"This is why sometimes abortion is needed unfortunately. Nature is not perfect, alot can go wrong and sometimes it is sever. Like for example, any years ago a good friend was expecting her first, she wanted the child and was overjoyed. Kept healthy, did everything right for her pregnancy. But, in the second trimester, an ultrasound showed that some of the baby's internal organs where developing outside the body. Heart, lungs, and some of the GI track. The baby was alive but there was very little chance of the child survival when born. She had to make the heartbreaking decision of getting an abortion in the best decision for her baby. There was no ryme nor reason for the cause of the sever deformity from what her doctor told her, simple explanation was these things happen. Things can go wrong unfortunately. Nature is not perfect and can be cruel as we all know. It was no one's fault nor no one to blame. It just these things happen and it is what it is. Yea medical technology had came a long way especially with reproductive medicine but, there is a limit."
So the baby is suffering just because she can't do anything about it. The law is letting this innocent suffer until it's born üò©
Go to Jesus and ask him to heal your child as God to make the child whole and healthy. Stop thinking to terminate only God knows the future. Pray üôèüïäüçºto save the child. God can change anything even this.
"I cannot believe America's lows don't comply with basic human rights established a century ago. This is insane!!! 
The more restricting the lows and the society norms towards women, the fewer babies are born. How long is it going to take to learn this lesson?"
"The Republican Party sure is committing A LOT evil in the name of Jesus. Religious extremists always do. Not only do you have worry about things like this now, but if your baby survives you have to worry about what if they turn out to be Gay or Trans, republicans are writing laws that could have them taken away by the state, placed in to foster care and you charged with child abuse. Republicans are writing laws about how they can and can‚Äôt dress. If a man dresses to feminine in Tennessee it‚Äôs a crime now. Vote Blue and Save Freedom and Democracy."
"Thumbs down for 15 second ads!  Why?  You could do 1, 5 second ad!"
Abortion is genocide.
This is such a lie. Complete and total propaganda. Just like Roe v Wade was. But what else can you expect from ABC.
"Abortion is the voluntary termination of a healthy viable fetus, & should absolutely be illegal. She didn't need an abortion, she needed medical intervention to terminate a nonviable pregnancy. 

It's pretty simple."
"Death unfortunately occurs either way. It is devastating for the family, specifically the mother, to have to go through this. I'm so sorry. I hope this baby lives a beautiful life however long he is alive and brings joy that surpasses this great pain. Nobody should have to lose their child whether it be in utero or after birth. It's not fair."
THIS IS SO DISGUSTING AND SAD
"""Blessed be the fruit"" - republicans"
Leave it to God maybe the baby will be OK
And some wonder why many people don't take churches seriously anymore.
"2:54 ""I'm personally not for [abortion] being used as a birth control but there are certain instances where I deem it as necessary""  SO YOU ARE PRO CHOICE.  No one is pro-abortion we are pro letting people make their own MEDICAL decisions. Also - where YOU deem as necessary? Will every woman need to run their abortion by you to determine if their reasoning matches YOUR moral compass?

""Never would I imagine we'd be going through this"" - Conservatives love making rules for other people and have no concept of empathy until the rules apply to them and suddenly they demand an exception"
The fact that you people don't get this this is nature we should not be interfering with nature anyway look at our world because we've interfere with nature I feel really bad for those couple I do but let's get real about this this s*** happens people get pregnant in their babies come out f*****-up it's nature god just nature's basic nature fit kalmanovich ever Phoenix chicken come out weird he's not up to us to decide which one of these creatures come out of whatever Grayson is worthy of life or not or chance are you serious
"The only comment I‚Äôll make is that I hope her OB counsels on folic acid and its role in prevention of neural tube defects. Not saying she was ever deficient, or that lack of folate was the cause. I‚Äôm just saying she needs to be on it, now, during childbearing years, and continue it, religiously, during any future pregnancy. She also, ideally, should let her body recover from this trauma before trying again. This is not only physically taxing, for her, but the emotional trauma affects both of them. 
My cousin‚Äôs baby girl lived for about 2 hours with what used to be called ‚Äúwater head‚Äù.  Not a nice way to say it, but that‚Äôs how many understand what it is. She had no skull, only a fluid capsule with her brain inside.
The doctors immediately put her on a strict daily dose of 800mcg of Folic Acid, and she went on to have a strong, healthy little boy, who is now a US Marine!"
She's no victim. Don't want kids close your legs. Be a responsible adult. Not a baby killer. S/O Texas.
"U people r sick, stop killing children"
What about is abortion wasn't an option because back-in-the-day didn't have that option today major planet your baby was supposed to be born no matter what maybe that isn't your choice maybe that's God's choice and you're wrong in this you really are you're trying to tell me you're f****** addicted to something because you couldn't kill your baby are you serious right now stop it sometimes babies are born again we don't get to just kill whatever it is if we don't feel comfortable with you understand that get real

"The year is 2023 and a young country like South Africa üáøüá¶ which was democratic only in 1994 has more laws that protect women (abortion) and the LGBTQI+, compared to a country like America which has been democratic for more than 100 years, that is scary.

I just stumbled upon this post and I am feeling really sad for Kylie, I believe that a country is not democratic if it is abusing women, especially in this way. The fact that young countries are progressing in making sure that they properly protect all its citizens and America is heading backwards is sad."
"america must wake up see the problems, in my opinions there will be depressions from the mothers and possible suicide rates going up which i fear, bring abortion back!"
Abortion should be illegal to use as a birth control method not when it‚Äôs medically necessary or from rape

"Isn't there a point where it's nonger considered an abortion? Like if there is a known health risk to mother, baby or both... when is it considered MEDICAL? For the sake of YOUR LIFE?!"
Watch... it will come to a point that women won't be allowed to have ultrasounds so that non of these health concerns are found until to late... so sad to see...

So she was pro life until she needed an abortion....üôÑ
"In the beginning abortion was intended for such circumstances.  Then they wanted more, to the point that the child is fully developed, and started using it like birth control. The beast took over and started harvesting and making big money,  while society is left with broken women whose only rights was murder of off spring."

My former girlfriend and her daughter are anti-abortion and yet they firmly believe it's necessary on occasions like this. They're against abortion yet they are far more rational than the religiously conservative lawmakers who are dragging this country into another dark age.

Anyone that votes republican is one of two types of people that might hop back and forth personalities. 1: Votes to make money 2: have no idea what they want or talk about. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs sad that they still will bite the same way the next election cycle.
"But she is alive to tell about this so it did not threaten her life to have a baby in this condition which normally would produce a stillborn. What is the difference between an abortion and a stillborn? She just wanted control over the extraction?  It actually may have been better for her health to see all the hormones through such as progesterone, estrogen, and prolactin to encourage easier recovery from the loss. . . The body needs those hormones to balance and promote healing after a pregnancy.  This isn't burger king where you can order what you want without considering the repercussions, are they saying that they know more than medical professionals or that abortion should be like a product and they can have it whenever they want for a reason they are more worried about than professional medical providers? People need to learn their anxiety does not equal medical knowledge and just because they are consumers of medical care does not make the whole industry of medicine like a store where idiots can dictate their medical care without exhibiting medical need.  They definitely should move out of Texas though, there are plenty of states that align with their expectations."
You blame the women who kill babies for fun .
What a sham American ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù is when women have to endure these kinds of laws. There are no words.

Absolutely horrible this lady had to endure this!!! Makes me SO MAD üò°
Well this is what you guys voted for to have republican leaders that have a God complex and believe that they are right and nothing else matters
They need to bring back roe vs wade.

"oh america, what a disgusting fuckhole"
No one uses abortion as birth control. I'm pretty annoyed that a woman who has had to suffer only NOW understands that abortion is healthcare and doesn't belong in the hands of legislators.
"Well I guess it‚Äôs what Jesus would want, and no one is more in tune with what Jesus would do than the entire GOPüòèüòè"
This is why if you're against abortion 'you' should not have an abortion. Everyone else should be allowed to for whatever reason.
This is why we are a secular nation by design. Religious rule is evil.
"It is not only inhumane it is also absolute madness.  I would love to have been born in a State like Texas for so many reasons.  
But these abortion bans are going to cause so many problems for women!"
Wheres the gofundme for this lady!? This is a nightmare!!!!!!
"I'm sorry this is happening to her but did her vote put her in this spot? 
People need to stop saying or implying that women have used abortion as their birth control method.
STOP REPEATING THAT LIE."
"If she's against abortion, did she celebrate the overturning of Roe Vs. Wade? If she did, suck it up buttercup, this is what you asked for."
"This is a tough situation. Brave of them to share this. I feel for this couple, especially the woman. At the same, ‚Äúnonviable‚Äù seems inaccurate because the baby can carry to term and be born, it‚Äôs that the baby has a terminal diagnosis."
what the world
What would you do IF we didn't have ultrasound technology?  Be thankful for your son and the short time you will get to spend with him. He is part of your life journey.
The doctor said most of these children dont live passed a year. Why wouldn't anyone want to be able to spend as much or little time as they possibly could with their child letting it know how much they were loved instead of just killing them because they couldn't handle having such a small amount of time with? Abortion is cruel and selfish and most of all... murder. And i dont care who gets mad or what they say. I have a right to my beliefs just like everyone else does.
So sad! The pain this couple has to endure. Abortion is a human right.
This is what happens when one doesn‚Äôt think in principles.  Banning or creating absurd restrictions on abortion creates situations like this.  No one ever thinks it can happen to them.  What if she develops sepsis?  This is why I changed my mind about moving to Texas.
My condolences to the family. But lets remember we have  great Doctors out there who can help.
"This is why abortions should really only be used in cases of rape, incest; and emergency health complications with the mother and baby."
So they voted pro-life because they wanted control over OTHER women‚Äôs‚Äô bodies and never expected it to actually have an affect on them. Sounds like karma to me.
"Realistically if someone did actually try using it for birth control EVERY time they got pregnant, it'd probably be very stressful for the body. I don't get how some people legit believe women using it as just straight up birth control."
give women power over their body the science is there the preventability is there let them make a choice

Although I do not consider this procedure to be a replacement for birth control, it should be available in medical situations such as this or other serious issues. Not to mention rape, incest, minors, or medical conditions for the woman that may not fall under the purview of this law. It's insane that this family will be forced to go through this entire pregnancy, only for the baby to not make it long. The additional pain this family is experiencing has only begun, and it's heartbreaking."
"BTW, so few women use abortion as birth control. It's ridiculous to punish EVERYONE when CLEARLY there are good reasons for taking that step in the vast majority of cases."
It‚Äôs always different when it happens TO YOU
The insanity going on in the US is off the chain!!! So a woman could die from disease due to a decaying fetus but that's ok??????

"These Republicans are not thinking of the grief of the parents, or the death or dismemberment of the mother, and how that affects her living children or partner or extended family and friends... it really looks as if they want to just punish women for having female reproductive systems.

This is bullshit. They try to find  a person to fit their agenda and then they try to do a media Blitze. This is not what Texas needs to be broadcasting. What they need to be broadcasting is the border issues and the 100 thousand plus people dead last year because of it. Where are they on the 100 thousand lives they caused to be poisoned.

She's terrified because he baby is going to be born without a proper brain? No I'm seriously asking because I was looking for the health reason that puts her life in danger. All I'm hearing is they don't want to have a handicap child; right or am I missing something?
Hate to say it but they probably voted right..
When will these women learn to keep their legs closed she better not get an abortionüò°
And what is scary.. These politicians take care of themselves in these situations. It's never been about babies. It's a political flex.
USA- this is NOT the freedom you boast about.
I bet if it were a lawmaker‚Äôs wife it would be diffeeent.
There are not words in my vocabulary to describe the vile emotions I have for these evil monstrous anti-abortionists.
Let God handle it
"Well , this is really sad and they are doing everything I would have done.  However , it was clear that voted republican and she said never in a million years did she think this would happen to her and she is against using abortion as a birth control.   You voted for this ; we tried to warn you.  This is what happens when you vote against your own interests. Anyway , we are all in the same boat now.  Saddle up cupcake because this is a going to be a bumpy  ride."
No one cares when it was the black woman in NO recently but maybe this white woman will bring more awareness üòî
Going to New Mexico for an abortion is crazy scary. I get it I'm glad she said about not using it for birth control.
This is what happens when a conservative Supreme Court changes laws that are not broken. This woman passed judgment in this interview that she only agreed in this procedure  for her circumstances. That is why she is in this predicament because her lawmakers banned all procedures for all circumstances.
"She is so stupid for going on cameraüôÑüòí,  It's so pathetic our people are so desperate for attention and social media fame. She could have easily just went to another state and got it done, but now the whole world know she's pregnant. Stupid"
We all know the state will not be providing $$ for 24 hr care to take care of the child either.
Bullshit bunch of democrats bs
Just because a doctor says one thing doesn't mean that it will end up that way. My son has a heart condition he should have died from. Yet here he is. Should I have killed my baby just because of his heart condition.
If you want to put out your agenda about abortion maybe the law is not it!  It's so sad yall gonna see a lot of dead baby's in the trash dumpsters because of this law
Merica is such a sick country
I would be so pissed if I had to have a kid I didn‚Äôt want. Especially if it had developmental issues
I can tell by how she described a couple of things that they are pro life. This is exactly what they voted for. They are only pro choice when it needs to benefit them.
"She said ‚Äúthere are certain instances where I deem (abortions) are necessary‚Äù Thats the thing, it‚Äôs not up for YOU to deem. Every single women should make that decision for themselves. It should not be based on what someone else think they should do with their bodies. This is why that ban is so dangerous. Ppl who probably would consider themselves ‚Äúpro life‚Äù are now realizing that this ban could and will negatively affect them and the woman they love."
Give your baby up for adoption. Someone will love him until he passes away.
"Because ""Pro-Life"" craziness has overcome any logic or science. ü•º"
The law is only for the corrupt and to help only the Irish and government!  F the people!
"poor guy, he's taking it a lot harder than his wife. it's different when you're the one going through it than when your loved one is and you're powerless to help them"
I 100% guarantee she helped vote the idiots into office that did this to her. Let's keep it real its white folks that keep voting in evil so don't cry now.
üò¢This is heartbreaking
Texas is so toxic.  I'm surprised that state doesn't implode!
"My niece  had her baby  full term, this beautiful  baby  was born  still born who had the same problem. 
     She was happy she carried  her baby ,knowing  what is happening. 
The child will die, why won't people  let them  do it naturally,  not yanking them piece by piece out of womb.
    What more is more  loving?"
"Conservative Texans: Abortion is murder it should be completely illegal 

Also conservative Texans: oh look another school shooting in our stats let‚Äôs see how good this one was, OH AWESOME 21 people died and 19 of them were kids let‚Äôs go bruh I love this entertainment."
thanks a lot Trump üò†
Give him a fighting chance‚Ä¶so he lives only a year‚Ä¶you let him live!!! You gave him life for a little while! So torture him in the womb?!! Because he‚Äôs gonna be inconvenient to you for maybe a year? I just don‚Äôt understand üò¢
"Isn‚Äôt the point of choice is to use your own discretion on if it‚Äôs ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù to you and the life you want to live? ü´†ü´† 
OBVIOUSLY there are women who will abuse this system and use it as a form of birth control. But you better believe I would prefer that over a woman who is either too lazy, not financially capable or not educated enough to use birth control, to one day have the child due to an abortion ban who will abuse the child she did not want in the first place. We have so many children who are born into families that do not want them, who are being tortured and killed as is. Why make that a potentially bigger number because abortion doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù in your own life. Narcissism at its finest. Not everyone has the life you do. Why choice is important!"
This is definitely a human and civil rights violation!
#1 GO TO ANOTHER STATE #2 DONE AND DONE
The Catholic Church pushed this agenda.
You can go to another state that allows abortion.  There are options.
Stupid republicans doings !
This is why we need to think critically before we take drastic steps without thoughts about the consequences‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
This is so cruel. I'm sorry they had to go through this
Gods will be done . üôèüèª
"nevermind the 2 trail derailments, the nuclear leak and us being on the brink of a world war 3"
Sounds like their position and votes have come back to bite them.   Bet they thought lack of female bodily autonomy would never be an issue for  THEM.
"This is no longer a free country for women!! These laws aren't about the right to life they are all about controlling women and trying to put us "" back in our place"" like in the Andy Griffith days. It is disgusting how far we have fallen in this nation and how Republicans are constantly stripping away our freedoms to force everyone to fit in their cookie cutter box!!!!"
"That is so horrible
Caster oil and certain roots are going to be making a huge come back"
Have faith in Gods will. üôè
"If your wife sleeps with another man will you keep the God giving Child? If your husband impregnated your best friend should he keep the God giving Child? Abortion is murder remember that. You people are Fornicators yet tell LGBT people to live celibate lives because the Lord dislikes it, yet you same people sleep around with your friends from college and high school. Gay people cannot kiss and hold hands because it is immoral yet the pastors daughters have abortions in secret to preserve that good reputation. You people vote to ban gay marriage yet you sleep around committing adultery. People are anti gay yet find ways to justify abortion. ""I don't want my boy to see 2 grown men kissing"", yet she has had 2 abortions lol."
"My heart aches for this family. I was reading about this condition just the other day: a mom expecting IVF twins. She didn't have a selective termination because of the risk to the healthy baby and because she was led to believe the affected child would die... He lived 8 months, never left hospital, and experienced a tremendous amount of pain. Abortion is healthcare."
"So is she going to have to carry full term, and give vaginal birth / or c section to a already dead baby? Thats disgusting."
"This is the problem with conservative people. They get fed through Fox fake news that people use abortions as birth control. Too bad that for small-minded people, it takes an issue like abortions to hit you directly to inform yourself and look outside the box. Tge world is not just black or white."
When passing laws I feel they should add in special circumstances like these
Republicans are traitors
"This is a horrible situation. Texas is wrong for banning abortion. And it's also wrong to abort after the 20th week. First trimester abortion is necessary for population control of unwanted babies. These abortions have been banned because the system supports human trafficking, child pornography, etc. The system needs unwanted children to exist so that they can be abused in this way. Abortion should not be an option because a privileged couple's wanted pregnancy didn't result in a healthy child. It's extremely sad but this couple wants this child, probably planned the pregnancy. This child won't survive beyond his first year and that's heartbreaking. But this child will never be subjected to child porn or trafficking. Abortion should not be an option because it's inconvenient for the couple to care for their unhealthy child."
ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE!
Just travel out of the state. Sucks it‚Äôs our reality but my wife and I just had a similar situation. We live in Texas and got the help we needed in New Mexico.
What does the Bible say about abortion!
Thats wrong
Anti abortion laws are inhumane.  It‚Äôs heartbreaking to (still) be fighting for basic human rights for women‚Äôs healthcare - but we will keep fighting to make things right. üí™ I‚Äôm so sorry for all the women affected by the current backwardness of the legal system. I hope they all get compensation for their inhumane treatments.
"My cousin in Europe was told that her baby boy with the same condition when he was born would live for 20 mins. 
They tried to convince her to abort, she did not want to.  So she carried through with the pregnancy till full term, 
delivered him and he passed away at exactly the time they told her he would.  She goes to visit him daily for years, 
it was her son and she did not choose to abort.  I feel for you that the laws have changed but i understand that 
he still is a human being with a brain and i pray that God gives you the strength to endure this.  I wish you nothing 
but the best outcome possible."
Pro Choice is not pro abortion.  It is pro - patients make their own medical decisions.  It is your choice not the government's choice.  Vote BLUE for YOU.
"It‚Äôs your body, but your governments choice‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ sad world we live in‚Ä¶.."
"Texas. ""Ain't no fun when the rabbit got the  gun"" is the saying about reversal of circumstances. I do pray she survives this ordeal and teaches her daughter about why women should *ALWAYS* vote to have reproductive control of their own bodies."
"""I can't believe the leopards ate *my* face!"" cries woman who voted for the Leopards Eating Faces party"
"Now this is cruel! I normally do not stand by abortion but in instances like this, I would. How cruel. I feel for these parents."
I hope she donates the organs so another baby can live...üôèü•∞üôè
I‚Äôm pretty sure they are republicans so this is what they deserve
The pro-life party doesn't give a flying flip if women die. So much for pro-life. They're all a bunch of lying hypocrites.
"Then don't use it as birth control and mind your business. Remember, NO WOMAN EVER WANTS TO GET AN ABORTION. They are not fun or easy. Everyone that gets one HAS to for whatever reason that is not our business. I cannot freaking believe we are having this stupid debate AGAIN. Federalist Society SCOTUS decision will cause women to die. It will not be different than 1971. They only prevent SAFE abortions with these laws and this will not be the first woman forced to carry a dead fetus around for months and worse for these draconian religious zealots. 
Religious people need to REMOVE themselves from other people's bedrooms and reproductive organs. JFC.... like really, what is WRONG with y'all? Don't give me some saving lives line of crap. Women are alive and you don't care about them. Universal healthcare saves lives, why not back that?"
"Not all pregnancies are viable,  which is why abortion is healthcare.  Caring a miscarriage can lead to sepsis. This pregnancy was wanted. Republican elected officials have gone way to far. It's not a clear cut case of yes or no. It's a maybe."
"And if you voted republican at all, that‚Äôs what you voted for.  I know better.  My body is mine, not yours and I have the right to choose what‚Äôs best for me.  Not you.  So, if you voted for republican, that‚Äôs what you voted for.  Sad, isn‚Äôt it."
"Wow, the people wishing ill on this woman are just as cruel as the people who voted for abortion to be illegal. If she did vote for that, then hopefully she‚Äôll change after her experience. Sometimes, that‚Äôs what It takes for some people. THAT‚Äôs what you wish on others‚Äînot harm."
Wow-just Wow üò¢
Texas and Florida: Draconian Laws against Women
"If you feel bad, remember these people probably voted for Trump, and probably vote Republican"
She could easily drive to another state and get it done.  So she doesn't really care.
This is what happens when you have extremists.. One side wants abortion as birth  control and the other side won't allow it when necessary.
Self righteous Republicans to blame for all these problems
"No pity whatsoever!!!!! You were ignorant and naive enough to vote and support abortion bans THINKING that it was mostly people using it as birth control ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Statistically abortions are more common with miscarriages than used as birth control. Now that you see how detrimental the ban truly is, you want sympathy. Fck no!!! This is what happens when people let their emotions dictate their beliefs and choices. Pro choice isnt pro abortion. Pro choice means i dont know what is going on in your life, but you have the right to choose whats best for you. Yall made your bed, now lay in it. Conservatives need to learn to worry more about themselves and less about everyone else. I said it before and ill it again.... the abortion ban is only the start of unnecessary control and the start of us reverting back a couple hundred years. Look at Florida, perfect example. And Texas seems to keep following in their footsteps. Have fun with that."
"Then you have these people that want to tell you how to live your life and when the tables get turned and they have to follow their own rules they call it unfair, unjust and they don‚Äôt want to follow their own laws."
Most not all. Only God knows. Doctors only predict.
"I believe that in some cases, such as theirs is a compassionate option. For both mother and baby."
Texas is so gross. The other Ohio.
It's sick to make a woman try and live a part of her life knowing there is a dead child inside her and having to still give birth
Guess what y‚Äôall.  She is not in control.  God is.    If I can carry a sick child so can she !!!!!   Mine died in utero also !!!!! I ddnt kill my child because they we‚Äôre sick !!!!!   Still pro life !!!!! When Evil is called good in this world. That‚Äôs when you know the world is mad!!!!
This is what happens when you vote for guns over people. Abbott rules Texas.
What a nightmare for this woman.
No one uses it as birth control. This is god showing you that
Sounds like this is the outcome she voted for. Welcome to the consequences of your own actions.
"They passed this law because of God. 
Also God: Now watch me make a baby without a brain."
Is this what the Texas govt wants?
"‚ÄúNot fair for her or other women‚Äù üòë. You don‚Äôt say. Now here it is they‚Äôre trying to travel from state to state for help for their situation. Why not get the help in the state in which you live? Oh that‚Äôs right, how you vote took that choice away."
Who did they vote for???
Pops has some pretty bad rosacea
"This is why we need separation of church and state, even in a cowardly state like Texas."
Where's the land of freedom and choices pushed by the repubs?
"God gives us free will in every area of our life and lets us make choices, but somehow these unborn fetuses are more precious than anything else He‚Äôs ever created and better not be touched, and the women He chose as the vessels for them do not have a say in anything regarding their pregnancy and they are the worst sinners on earth (but not as bad as those gay people) if they dare make a choice that harms that fetus, even if it mean protecting her life. By the way, if you wanna own a gun and kill somebody, that‚Äôs alright. 

Conservative Christian thinking be crazy."
I felt sorry for her but this should be a lesson to all of you Trump supporters who try to take away women's rights when it happens to you now you understand your thought process was wrong
"Since Texas took control of the outcome of the pregnancy (forced her to carry it to term until delivery), then the state must shoulder the financial burden of all medical procedures related to pregnancy."
"Republicans, listen tf up!!"
This woman and her husband should be the ONLY people who makes the decision what to do in this situation.  What is wrong with people!
VOTE VOTE VOTE
Not an advocate for birth control she says.... this show people only care about certain things only when something happens to them or effect them. I had a lot of sympathy at the start but lost a little after she said that. Now she knows the pain other women are going through
"Don't have sex. 
Thats how easy it is."
"I'm not advocating abortion but all in all, this should be a women's personal choice."
This is what they voted for. This is what they get.
The party of family values folks!
"I feel for them, but as you've heard from her at "" 2:52 "" she is clearly regurgitating one of those pro-life reasons for being anti arbotion. That abortion is being used by people as a form of birth control willy-nilly. She clearly is anti abortion before all this happened to her. She for sure is one of the people who celerated the overturning of Roe. Now she sees the effect of the abortion ban first hand. All fun and games until it personally affects you. I hope she gets her abortion. I hope she fights for that right now moving forward."
Just awful‚Ä¶ prayers for this family!
"unfortunately, the people who are affected by this is quite small so the politicians wouldn't careless. This happen because people believe in the bible."
"Firstly, I am sorry that you are having to go through this. But as a liberal Texan, this is what happens when you vote with no compassion. You made your views known in the video, and now that this is happening to YOU, you're shocked. I swear, the pro-life people are the absolute LEAST compassionate people I know. No grasp on reality or personal decision making within the boundaries or established society."
So she force to carry a baby that‚Äôs doomed to die ‚Ä¶.. well she wanted this
Not the babies fault. Doctors always say there‚Äôs 1% of living. But that 1% can be a miracle baby.
"THAT IS FK DISGUSTING,  WE WILL NOT LET THEM RUIN WOMEN LIFE LIKE THAT , THESE ARE MONSTER , a fk trauma"
So grateful for these brave parents speaking out. My story 24 years ago. It takes past 20 weeks to figure everything out ! üò≠ I had to travel to another state. Please America come to your senses üôèüèº
"That is what religion does to society. The american talibans will force others to hurt in the name of ""christianity""."
How traumatic added to a already stressful and traumatising time
They got what they voted for.
They should sue the State of Texas for mental stress & damages due to her having to give birth to an unviable pregnancy. It's not ok. She should have full medical care & that does include aborting a fetus. Especially that the fetus is unviable. It's  ultimately her decision to make not the State of Texas & not anyone else's decision. No their body or life not their choice.
Awful.
Creepy conservatives asserting themselves in your life never ends well
Texas is sick
People so worried about abortions ....I wouldn't even have a kid in this society in the first place...they have nothing to aspire to anymore ....what to pay more have less credentials are meaningless work experience is irrelevant it's just social economic hierarchy based on things that have zero tangible value truly embarrassing world we have created
