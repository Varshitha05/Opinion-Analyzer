"‚ÄúPro-Life‚Äù 
Funny that states with the harshest abortion policies also have bar-none the WORST social support networks set up."
So disgusting the anti intellectual puritan streak in the states
The majority of Texan voted for him. Now they are stuck with him. Vote him out ladies.
People of Texas can only blame themselves for choosing the wrong candidate. Hopefully when it's time for election they will not forget all these things and pick the right & qualified candidate.
"she can leave Texas to get an abortion and spare us the histrionics. 
If she were really in desperate circumstances she would have not wasted any time on lawyers and court proceedings. 
She's doing this for the drama. 

It's not unusual for people truly in need of life-saving medical care to cross state lines to get it. Sometimes the facility best  equipped to meet your needs is in another state"
"I have not seen anyone who has a true understanding of what the Texas Abortion Kate Cox case is really about.  

What we need to understand is, this is NOT about protecting unborn life aside from religion.  It has EVERYTHING to do with religion. The belief in God's Will is very strong in the new Republican party.  The belief that we must accept God's Will is absolute for them.  We are not supposed question God's decisions and we won't always understand his ""plan.""  

If you grew up in a Baptist household like I did, you understand this, but this dogma is never spoken aloud in the political realm. You can accept medical help to save the baby's life or the mother's life, but line is - you have to understand, what is God's Will, because only God can decide who lives and who dies.  There is no reasonable way for these extremist Republicans to answer this question in a legal or science-based sense. Therefore, Republicans will continue struggle with this issue and look like sadists to the rest of us.  We need to bring this to the forefront as their weakness.  

My grandfather was a famous Southern Baptist preacher from Texas, so understanding this deeply held belief is important.  It is the evangelist's mantra that we cannot understand God's plan, so we have to accept whatever happens as part of HIS plan and still accept what he does as somehow a good thing.  

We need to make them admit that this is a religious issue not based on science.  They are making the argument based on emotion and pseudoscience, but it is not really the basis for their desire to control a woman‚Äôs body.  It is all about God‚Äôs Will and HIS Plan and that is impossible to define because we can never hope to understand God‚Äôs Plan.

I wish someone would talk about this.  Thanks."
"For God's sake. Wake up, America!"
"so true. second class citizenship like in the middle east where women can‚Äôt decide their own fate, can‚Äôt even drive."
And that goes for their own women...
"Pro-Life.
Pro-Gun.
Pro-Capital Punishment.
Pro-Lethal Border Barriers.
Pro-War.
Anti-vaccine.
Anti-Healthcare.
Anti-Welfare.
Anti-Environmental Regulation.

Did I mention Pro-Life?"
"Just as the bible commands.
Christianity is a wretched thing."
"2nd class citizens imply they still treat women as human beings on some level. But this isn't the case, Republicans only treat women as their livestock and slaves."
to bad we can't kick Texas out of the Union...
"The problem with abortions in Texas is the fact you can sue the doctor over it. If I were to perform an abortion and considered it medically necessary for the mother to live, and she comes out fine, anyone could still legally sue me. In a court, I could still lose my medical license because she did fine, and the jury didn't think her life was at risk at the time of the abortion. Therefore, no doctor is willing to perform an abortion for *any* reason."
Texas certainly has doubled down to make war on women.  Women still die of pregnancy complications or childbirth.
"This is second class citizenship for women.

GOP response - and?"
"Next state referendum in Texas: Changing the name of the state to ""Gilead"""
"Separation of church and state is still a thing, except when you're female, happen to be pregnant but in need of an abortion, and living in the state of Texas. Paxton is not a medical doctor, so why does he feel the need to enforce these disgusting laws besides showing religious muscle?! This is a blaintant violarion of human rights."
2:57-3:07!!! Nuff said not to mention there‚Äôs not 1 law that has courts deciding what a man can do to his body
I am glad I live in California. She and her family need to leave Texas.  I hope all works out for her. Prayer be with her and her family.
"Get your hajabs and berkas out ladies.  If they get their way, you will be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen of the master of the house."
"‚ù§In the seventies the saying was "" you have come a long way baby"". Now the saying is"" we own your body and we will track you down if you try to leave the state or buy birth control. That is a giant step back. But I am a guy so if they are not united to vote out those want them to be a second class citizen. Then I say too bad. Maybe they will want them to cover up like Muslim women in the next election. Women, grow a pair if you want to be like us. Texas is still red with Abbott,  Paxton and trump with a lead in 2024."
Reminder: the Equal Rights Amendment has never been ratified.
I wonder how long until the ‚ÄòTEXAS  Misogynists‚Äô decide to PUNISH women who seek medical care outside the state?   OR who suffer a Spontaneous Abortion ( miscarriage) ‚Ä¶.will women in this case have to PROOVE that they did nothing to contribute to that spontaneous abortion. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
Women in America are Absolutely 2nd class Citizens in the eyes of Republicans. Are you still calling yourselves the land of the free?
lol Texas. Who do these white texas men think they are? Joe Rogan
VOTE!
"Too many men just don‚Äôt get the facts about pregnancy and all the related issues. Their black or white thinking is a killer, or at the least-cruelty to the max. Shame on them."
Its about control and forcing their religious beliefs onto everyone.  These are the worst types of people.
The US republicans with their extreme religious beliefs dragging down the country to the level of barbarism. A banana republic.
"This is what happens, when politicians think that they understand the Divine will better than the G-d himself. Texas currently has stricter anti-abortion legislation than Saudi Arabia."
This is what makes America great again. Bunch of B. S. Get these men out of power
"She had some cramping and some leakage; that indicates the body is about to naturally flush out an unviable baby. which happens in animals, too; if a baby animal is unviable, it will either b stillborn, or the uterus will detect the abnormality and will just expel it."
From the advice of ‚ÄúDr Paxton‚Äù the guy that looks like he burned out last century.
who cares red team is winning soon u all will be slaves including me so cry some more it is the stupid dnc got to get messaging and the stupid dems senators and house folks
That guy's proven to be a corrupt attorney and where is Lee Harvey Oswald when you need him
Welcome to the New United Dictatorship of America!
What about vasectomies are they going to ban those too? After all there's lots of half a baby in there.
It should be a no-brainer that these women NEED to get this care. Mind-blowing how a bunch of old crusty men can decide what a woman can and cannot do with their own body!?
Third class actually. 1. White men. 2. Fetuses. 3. Females
"Anything that don't affect their lives personally, they don't care about! Racism, don't care it don't affect them, school shootings, don't care, it don't affect them, (R) don't care, it don't affect them! This issue don't care, it don't affect them! I'm wondering if the Wife or daughter got (R) by a Black or Brown Man, what would they do then!"
Time to vote the trash out ladies!!! Our bodies do NOT belong to the government and these men who want to push us back in the house!!!
"""Pro life"" Repulicans are some of the biggest hypocrites on Earth my god."
This whole thing is Agenda 21. Go read it. It explains everything. The author is glen beck.
Isn‚Äôt this practicing medicine without a license?  Why are legislators able to make health care decisions?
Has ken Paxton's female family members have to deal with these problems?
"She should be allowed to have  her abortion. It amazes me that we are going through this fight again. Women have to vote out these men and women who want to control other peoples lives. This is trump‚Äôs reality and his cronies in congress. The Supreme Court. People will say trump is for abortion, he lies through his teeth. He will say anything to get what he wants. VOTE BLUE so we can move forward not backwards!"
Why would any woman want to live in Texas?  I‚Äôm genuinely asking.
"The only way you can change this is to vote, or actively run for office yourself."
"They are not the party of pro-life. They are the party of pro-birth, pro-death, and anti-women."
"You women need to rise up and put your political power to work .How dare some old dude mandate your body,that should be between doctor and patient , not up for debate rise up vote blue,, and to Ken if your are so concerned about unwanted pregnancy ,how bout we denut ,irresponsible men,HOW BOW DA ,Ken?"
I'm a republican I hope she sees the heck out of Texas and and all the Republicans all the Republican I'm voting down the line Democrat I will never vote Republican
"Medical professionals should refuse services to all Republicans, no exceptions."
"This is crazy.  If we didn't  have the SCOTUS  overturn ROE, all this madness and suffering would never happen.  Then we have one lunatic,  politician compound  this misery. Why does the public allow this to happen. Paxton should be arrested  and put in jail.  And the taxpyers are paying for this circus."
Oh yeah there Attorney General is corrupt   HE should be in prison.
"WE the MAJORITY are going to show the Repulsive gop they have once again underestimated FEMALE and YOUNGER VOTERS. WE will be VOTING OUT all gop ""leaders"". WE will Prevail once againüíô"
That  woman needs to move to a state where she can get an abortion everyone should be leaving Texas that's  because Texas is the worst state in this union I believe we should let them become their own country take away all their federal funding and let the Mexicans and the cartels take back Texas   Had enough of Texas. Take all their federal funding away and I bet Texas will change their minds.
Just use birth control and quit killing babies.
"I wonder how many times Paxton may have overheard his parents wishing they had aborted him when he was a little boy, that may be why he turned out so full of anger toward women!!"
"I keep saying, PEOPLE BETTER STOP WORRYING ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE,!! VOTE EVERY ""BAD"" REPUBLICAN THAT SUPPORT TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE. VOTE BIDEN BACK IN OFFICE AND ALL THE RADICAL REPUBLICANS OUT. To be clear , I don't believe all the Republicans are bad."
Bless this woman for being so strong against these tyrant leaders!
Typical republicans passing a law with no room to move‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a blank document‚Ä¶.I wish republicans were not illiterate
"Only in the MAGA America. Vote the Republicans out. What a miscarriage of justice. About controlling women, not about the fetus."
Paxton should be jailed for preasureing women to die.
"_ women are indeed 2nd class citizens in republican eyes - very much 2nd class citizens, TO US CITIZENS specially US women: ENJOY BEING 2ND CLASS CITIZENS and the threesomes that you are religiously allowed to participate in BUT DON'T YOU DARE GET PREGNANT DOING THOSE THREESOME(S) .. ...."
misogyny is the gift of the devil
Abortion should be based on the right to self defense. Carrying a child to full term is the most dangerous endeavor most women will ever take on. Up to the point the abortion becomes more dangerous than completing the process to a live birth it should be the mother's decision. Why is this any different than a stand your ground law that allows up to lethal force to defend ones self and family?
I'm just glad at this point Texas can't be allowed to bring back segregation OR Slavery. Trying to violate women's rights to get medical care for lifesaving for political political just crazy.
He has to go vote this attorney general out along with this texas supreme court
"It's not safe to be pregnant in Texas, plain and simple.  Ladies, it's time to get out of Texas."
Texas to protect TheSanctity of Life even if it Kills every women in the state.‚ÄºÔ∏è. AG Paxton..
God bless you all
What life do these people think they are saving. This baby will only live hours if that
The second come of Jesus will be a caucasian baby and that the reason the far right want to stop all abortion of caucasian baby.
"Texas is full of idiots that claim they want to hang all them bad boys from a tall oak tree, but so far all I've seen them do is elect them to government office, It sure seems like Texans don't want women to be equal citizens but just want them to be breeding slaves. I'm thinking maybe they should wake up before they get woke up."
"Wake up, americans ,this could be your daughters,granddaughters.  It's horrifying to think because of a bunch of crazies. This could be anyone now... I fear for  all who could lose loved ones."
Ken Paxton should be in prison for fraud and tax evasion with his criminal buddy trump and Gregg Abbott.
Women of Texas VOTE THOSE B***TAR** out !! You are not second class citizens nor are your daughters your sisters your mothers your nieces !!! Please get out to vote at the next elections in your state?
Ken Paxton should not be in office. He threw out 2 million plus ballots to help the GOP hold on to office.  Beto won.
Welcome to the Texas Theocracy where you cant get stoned but can be stoned to death. Sounds like the Faux Xristian version of Iran here in the Southern US.
Republicans hate women and want to turn us into Chattel!
US Americans! Aren‚Äôt there more important issues in the world? Stop controlling women!! Just let them live and move on
"I wonder if those people know how evil it is to drive a wedge between men and women. In fact, men have loved and cared for women throughout human history."
PAXTON THINKS HE HAS THE RIGHT TO SIT IN MOSES' SEAT AND IMPOSE THE LAW !
"Republicans are making women a second class citizen . This is bigger than Abortion  , control over own bodies. Disgusting üá∫üá∏üëç"
All I can say is you elected Trump and put the Republicans in power who are deciding if you should receive Healthcare at all . I would vote Democrat from now on to ensure you have a right to receive Healthcare. By the way wasn't that piece of feiyu Trump bragging about overturning Roe versus Wade? You elected him so you have no one to blame but yourself.
Its a power trip. Thats the Republican party.
Texas was the last state to accept WOMEN as full citizens and not chatel of a man .
"Amazing, the country is watching Texas turn into the country's version the Taliban's Afghanistan every day.  How long before Abbott and his gang of Christian zealots require women to full comply with his version of Biblical, or should I say Sharia, law?"
That man right there is a indicted criminal.  And he's making decisions on a woman's body.  Yikes!!
This sickening decision puts the state of Texas on par with the Afghan Taliban regime. A Middle-ages dictatorship.
He belongs in JAIL!
"""women's voice are their votes"" - well the GOP knows that, so the next thing they'll do is start taking away women's votes."
This should put fear in every single person in America
"It's more than 2nd class citizenship. It's repression and domination.
Why aren't we looking at the $$$ spent on Viagara by the military every year?"
"If republicans get  the presidency, this will be federal law. That's our future ;/"
Texas is a shitshow
Let Paxton be the c*nt that he is. The GOP will lose BIGLY in 2024 after this
This is sick. Women can‚Äôt even make decisions to save their own lives. To save their fertility. All because a dead or dying fetus has more rights than women. All because these sick men want to punish women. Disgusting.
"I don't know why Mika thinks this is ""unbelievable"" since this is what the TX lawmakers wanted from the beginning. DUHHHH"
"Republicans are not pro-life, they are pro-control over people they don‚Äôt believe are full participants of this American democracy."
@1:30 I know that attorney get threats Attorney for Reproductive Rights? Oh God üòÆ
Ken Paxton look like an ex -serial killer just look at the face üòÇ .. got that Michael Myers look going on
These Texans are cat üí© crazy
"After I heard, years ago, Trump¬¥s audio about how he can grab young woman by the pu$$y whenever he wants, I was very sure that there is no women in the world who would vote that man. 
How wrong I was.
After Roe and all the political ploys to reduce women's rights, I still wonder how in the world there are women so stupid that they can vote for any republican EVER! But yes, they still support the GOP. Despite the fact that it puts all menstruating girls and women in danger.
Grazy!"
It‚Äôs a good thing that she went out of state and got the health care she needed
We are voting. They aren't listening no matter how many times we use it. Time to take this in another direction.
Politicians and lawyers are trying to scare women and doctors. Perhaps we should start scaring lawyers and politicians now.
"In this situation, if the baby survives the birth, the baby will suffer for the extremely minimal time the baby would be alive and would then die a painful death.  How can these law makers say they care about babies and demand the suffering of the mother AND THE CHILD?  This is not Godly.  This is mandated cruelty. In other words... evil."
So because shes a texan she doesn't want to flee to get the necessary healthcare so you want to take necessary risk god forbid if something hapens to you because of a radical and ignorant person have u thouht about your husband and chidren do you want to be martyr well good luck because they don't care
How could u want to be a texan if u want to fight vote these people out
Paxton is a vile corrupt snake and his wife backing him must hate women
If this doesn't help flip Texas I don't know what else will just sad
"So a man who can never know the pain of carrying and delivering a child under normal circumstances thinks he's the best person to make this kind of decision? Ken Paxton can threaten legal action against this family, her doctors or anyone who is qualified to make the best decision under this awful heart breaking situation? Will Ken Paxton be charged with legal action if any of the horrible outcomes happen to this mom and her family? What about this families pain and suffering?"
"If it's ""2nd class citizenship for women"" how come so many women are anti-abortion? Seems to me it's mainly women who protest against abortion - indeed it's well known that  it's those evil men who are always wanting their wives/girlfriends/mistresses to HAVE abortions. But I guess it's just another sign of the pure evil that men are that they simultaneously want women to have abortions but also want to prevent them from having them.

Exactly how dumb can feminists be?

And btw ladies, having to obey a law you don't like doesn't make you ""2nd class citizens"". Stop talking tripe."
Christianity has never treated women equally.
Maybe That Judge Doesn't Know the difference between Hypocrisy & Hypocratic Oath ~ Do No Harm
I WONDER WHERE PAXTON GOT HIS MEDICAL DEGREE?
"Remember the results of the one child law in China? No girls were born. Shortage of women. Chinese men are literally kidnapping foreign brides! 
Women's health care controlled by the government, or men?

Get ready for limited benefits, population decline, increase in human trafficking,  and women moving out of TEXAS!"
Republicans finally got their death panels.
"All women in Texas and across America need to vote Democrat. Otherwise you‚Äôre going to have an old Republican politician in your bedroom telling you what you can and cannot do with your own body!  It‚Äôs always the republicans who are taking your rights away, not the democrats!  Vote blue, and show these big government zealots who is really in charge!üëø"

"Welcom to Gilead ladies!
No self-respecting woman should vote republican!"
"Enough of these people. They are using adolf hitler handbook to a tee. Hitler told German women it was their duty as women to have babies and expand the German population. Hitler then had these houses set up in all the cities where young German women did nothing but fornicate all day. German soldiers were told it was their job to go to these houses to increase the population of the Aryan people. How ironic that he wanted this ""master race"" and he didn't fit into it. These women would get pregnant, go to hospital to deliver baby and back to work. She had no further contact with the child. There were hundreds of babies like this. Baby factories. The babies were raised by older women who were not allowed to give affection or love or human contact. These little babies actually held on to each other for comfort in cramped cribs, cold rooms and groomed to be Aryan! Human baby robots. Disgraceful and inhumane!"
Ever since they took RoeVWade away i knew this and many more cases would happen.we as women need to fight and fight HARD for our daughters...granddaughters...for women period! We need to bring back RoeVWade now! I live in the idiotic red state of Ohio...i worry about my daughter's...i cannot believe this is happening in 2023! We are going backwards...every women in this country needs to stand up and fight for our rights!
The blood is on the hands of Texas voters
"Mika, thank you for your impassioned presentations and reporting! Also, your dress is lovely!"
MEN HAVE NO BUSINESS TELLING A WOMAN HOW TO TAKE CARE OR OWN HER BODY!!‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
"Republicans would have no problem if the husband or a family member brought a lawsuit against the doctor and /or the hospital if the mother died of complications due to this inhumane law. The party of ""the right to life"". Yeah, right"
"What is it that a doctor's oath to ""do no harm"" not trump all of this political BS? Pun intended.üò¢"
Wheres all the women in Texas?!! They are okay with these maga cult people?!!! Omg!!
Texas is disgusting with Banana Republicans in charge. Vote BLUE!!!
"Magas don't care about women, it's about dominance and control."
Time to get out of TexASS.
AG is practicing medicine without a license. Isn't that a crime? State if not Federal?
It is way past second class treatment it's moved into turning women into Chattel
Don't we have more important legal issues to attend to other than killing woman by denying medical needs
Unbelievable!!!!  What century are we in???! Seriously!!
"REmember the Alamo? it was about Texas and  it's ""glorious' ""heroic' founders wanting to keep  owning  SLAVES. NOW 180 years later they're willing to settle for ""just the women""  as the underclass."
"You all remember when Obama was trying to pass ACA? The republicans had ads that said ACA would lead to ""death"" panels. Well guess who has death panels?? Fox Entertainment and all those other conservative, so called news outlets, are feeding their viewers a bunch of propaganda or not reporting on issues that directly affect their constituents. I did just read that this family ended up leaving the state to get an abortion. How much you want to make a bet, she and her husband are going to get arrested when they get back to Texas? This country is turning into a dictatorship, and I know we hear, vote, vote, vote but even when we do vote, republicans lie and cheat. Look what happened in Ohio voted to make abortion legal and the republicans are refusing to accept the vote of the people. Voting isn't working when republicans go rogue."
Taliban Texas.
2nd class? No! They have been prohibited from their right to  citizenship. The 16th Amendment needs to be brought in to protect women
"The party of freedom and DONT TREAD ON ME - THE GUBMINT should stay out of parenting - WANTS TO FORCE PEOPLE TO HAVE KIDS. they dont CO PARENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT they scream.... Its all hypocrisy and lies. JUDGES IN WOMENS UTERUS' = FREEDOM IN TEXAS

Women should stop getting pregnant period. Or get out of Texas
Its all about controlling women by spiteful men.  Vote Blue
"When you fail to vote, or vote further away from your road then accept what can be called God's punishment for not doing your duty. This abortion issue could've been avoided, but here we are."
Flush twice. It's a long way to Texas.
I don't care what the Bible or the Quran have to say about healthcare. A bunch of ancient sandpeople in the Middle East who only lived until the age of 35. I don't give a crap what they have to say about 21st century healthcare.
This is why its unequal and a harship. This is the main reason an unbiased SC would rule for abortion
"If you can't vote these monsters out of office in Texas, then vote with your feet. Move! And don't stop until you reach a state that protects freedoms, instead of taking them away. That goes for voting rights, as well."

"Clearly, controlling women is what is important in Texas because if Texas really cared about getting babies born, then the future children of this woman would be important and they are not. TEXAS IS BAKCWARD! WHY WOULD ANY WOMAN WANT TO LIVE THERE! Texas women need to hit the streets in protest and stay there until the legislature changes this backward thinking."

And when the people of Ohio voted to put abortion rights in their constitution the government shot back by saying 'nope' and attempting to (not sure if they were successful) take power away from the judges and put it only in the hands of the politicians. The GOP isn't going to let something as silly as people exercising their rights and voting stop them!
VOTE IGNORANT Republicans out and don't replace them with another IGNORANT Republican. VOTE BLUE IN 2024.
"Are Texian people that cruelty and too dump to question their bs evangelists and their redneck politicians?
Hope their wives, daughters, sisters, nieces, mistresses and church-ladies would not have to go out of states, or secretly doing abortions in the basements of some pastors' houses, or just rise up and fight for your rights to be safe and healthy, instead of  just spreading their legs for those thugs to make you pregnant!!"
Texas.  Where the guns have more legal protection then the women
This kind of deciduous from republican officials will incite a civil unrest between political parties.
Family values guy with a mistress for years.  Hypocrisy yet again.  I wonder if Ken arranged an abortion for his mistress or any other woman from his past.

I'm soooo tired of the fascist GOP. I'm extremely sick and tired of them. Yet some (including women) entertain the idea of Trumpism 2.0?! Foh!
AAAaahhhhh!!  Is this the USA in December 2023?!?  It's good to be Danish.
I could of sworn republicans hate big gov'ment telling them what they can & cannot do. But I guess that was just another BS talking point.

"Thanks a lot Texas!  You could have pushed this criminal pos out of office last month but because you don't have spines or balls enough to go against a bigger criminal pos (tfg), this is what you get!
I sure hope Texans and the entire country is paying attention.  You think this is bad?  Put tfg and his sycophants back in office next year and watch as this becomes only the first in a long list of rights that get taken away from us.  
And I mean ALL of us - not just 'the libs!'
Do you think Paxton cares if this couple voted for tfg or not?  
Of course he doesn't care.  You just emboldened another criminal monster in this country to become even more of a monster.    Congratulations!"
"oh this is easy! women your uterus belongs to old white men in the goverment! ask permission, because they love it! SMH"
Klansman Ken has got to go!
Older whyt uneducatedabout medicine whyt men shouldnt be making medical decisions about a womens choices .
But dumb women keep voting for reps so its their own fault
"The Texas Supreme Court should wait to make their ruling until after Cox does whatever she's going to do. This sends Texas lower courts that have Democrat judges a message, do not give permission to women seeking to pre-empt TX law and it gives Democrat women the message to not seek to pre-empt the TX laws. Cox should go outside the state to California if she wants to murder her unborn baby. The TX Supreme Court can afterward make their ruling in favor of the TX law and the message will be reinforced."
"Texas, vote these people out! It‚Äôs really simple!"
"why are lawyers and judges making medical decisions?   Remember during the healthcare debates when Republicans were talking about ""death panels""?  well, here we are.  I guess the next step is for the doctors and all the support staff to also get the judge's permission?  Then the post-op staff and her husband and children should also get permission to help with recovery lest they be prosecuted for ""helping.""   

It's a Republic - if you can keep it 
as Benjamin Franklin said"
"""Edwards syndrome has no treatment and is usually fatal before birth or within the first year of life."" So they want the potential baby to develop and suffer before it inevitably dies. Imagine the mental gymnastics it would take to justify that."
Ken Paxton was just reelected how many times do these Republican women need to say Paxton is speaking for us. Paxton is doing exactly what they want they will never push back against him.
Prepare for more authoritarian rule if the dumpsters get back in. This is but the beginning of what they'll do to our collective freedoms.
"Exceptional evil with nothing but religious overture for cover. Hey Ken Paxton?! How much do you hate women? I guess we know now. Ken Paxton, the world is in shock and disbelief at your cruelty."
"Whoever is putting these politicians in office is putting women's lives at risk and if this lady dies, you have blood on your hands. It's her body, it's her choice."
Glad she is suing. Also hope she comes to an adjoining state and get the abortion legally to save her own life
They don't CARE. CRUELTY IS THE POINT. VOTE BLUE FOR WOMEN.
The members of the Court should be indicted for practicing medicine without a license.
Yet texas will continue to elect republicans.
"We, the people, need to vote OUT every, single republican‚Ä¶.especially in Texas."
"That‚Äôs awesome that the decision should be in each state. However, when republican legislatures refuse to bring it to a vote, and worse when it does get brought to a vote and they refuse to honor the People‚Äôs decision, that‚Äôs when a national law is needed. Time for the men to get behind the women of this country and actually help."
This is medieval sh*t. I wouldn't treat a dog like this let alone a woman. GOP are sick and draconian.
"Don't believe maga Republicans when they say that there will be exceptions to anti abortion laws.  
This is just the beginning of their attack on human rights."
Pro Abortionists are the worst kind of racists.  They hate ALL races of unborn children.
She begged the ruling men and promises to follow the government mandate better next time. This is our new republican party.

"For a country, who keeps claiming to be ""the best country in the world"", u guys sure keep trying to prove otherwise. And to this Scandinavian, ur thoroughly succeeding.
U guys truly are extraordinary, when it comes to continually electing politicians, who will rob u blind, take away ur rights and generally leave u in miserable lives, that we Europeans would find totally unacceptable, and then u whine in astonishment about how ""government isnt working"". Gee, maybe u should look in the mirror to see why. Coz when electing these ppl isnt the bug, but the feature through decades, then u cant keep blaming the politicians, its on u guys for continuing to elect them."
"I need an explanation of a legal term regarding this situation. I heard elsewhere that Ken Paxton has said that this woman does not have ‚Äústanding‚Äù to bring this case. I recently looked up the legal term ‚Äústanding, and it essentially means that this woman doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave a dog in this fight‚Äù which means that she can‚Äôt bring her suit because she‚Äôs not personally involved in it. I also read that during the last women‚Äôs group (Equal Means Equal - wonderful group, BTW!) to take the ratification of The Equal Rights Amendment and fight to the Supreme Court to have it entered into the U.S. Constitution, because they had collected the necessary number of signed petitions. In the U.S. Supreme Court, one of the judges (I think it was John 8:38 Roberts) also said the woman‚Äôs group didn‚Äôt have standing. Can someone from the legal community, preferably a woman (Joyce Vance? Or the other woman here?) PLEASE explain to me how a pregnant woman carrying a fetus that WILL die either before or after birth, or a woman‚Äôs group which was founded for the express purpose of getting the Equal Rights Amendment put into the U.S. Constitution does NOT have standing in the law? I don‚Äôt understand how either woman or group would NOT have standing in a legal case that pertains fully and completely to them, and they are implicitly and absolutely personally involved in these cases! Can anyone please explain that to me. Thank you if someone does, because it makes absolutely no sense to me."
George Carlin was right these people are Anti Woman not pro life.
Republicans attempt at trying to stay relevant because their cult leader lost in 2020. This is the only way they keep themselves in the spotlight. A woman will die because of these laws.
This is just barbaric. The corrupt Texas AG is just a Devil in the flesh. But the people who are voting for Republican are guilty as well. Shame on all people who voting Republican.
"Paxton, a criminal who was exonerated by his criminal cronies decides over life and death.
The US, particularly Texas, have reached an all time low. Christian white supremacists are
a scourge on society, they are really cruel and inhuman. only interested in forcing their cultism
and beliefs of something that is unproven and absurd, on others. Technically and scientifically
the world has advanced, morally these people are stuck in a time zone where practically 
everyone was ignorant and uneducated and believed anything that clever conmen said to them.
Billions are grifted by clever conmen in the US, in the name of religion."
Sue Paxton for medical malpractice... without a medical license.
Opine Paxton is poster child for americanized christian version of Taliban.
They don't care in Texas.
"I hope Paxton just thru away his governor chances. This was a wanted child that became unviable & a danger to the mother. How dare you step in! These parents have cried unknown tears about this. But you felt  you should get in the way. Shame on you, Paxton."
Republican Government in the lives of families and women making life altering decisions for them.
Evangelical/Taliban maga Cult...
A law maker/inforcer without a medical degree uses his biblical opinion to enforce his belief on all others outside of his beliefs.
How stupid can you be  to be a woman  that lives in Texas and vote for Republicans?
Every woman needs to remember this event come 2024. This IS the Republican agenda‚Ä¶..nationally.
This is a clear and painful example of the misogynistic agenda of the MAGA-GOP.
"Wow, the government has complete control of women's bodies."
That should be a womens right. That's just crazy.
"OBVIOUSLY, THE STATE OF TEXAS DOES NOT VALUE THE LIVES OF WOMEN! 

WHY ARE MEN MAKING LIFE DECISIONS FOR WOMEN?"
These Texas pro life are sick people they have no mercy for saving this lady live
Vote vote vote vote
This is sickening.  The criminal Paxton keeps committing crimes. When will it stop???  The bully that runs Texas.
"Get rid of all these Religious Morons.
SAVE AMERICAN WOMENS RIGHTS.
VOTE BLUE"
"Please *don't call these people Christians,* they are the Gentiles and these are their Last Days. As with the right of an abortion, there is nothing in the Bible denying it. Actually a wise man once wrote...
*And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive. But better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil (that man has) done under the sun.*
The sad thing is, the great false religion, the murderers of our Lord and million of true followers, hijacked our faith and created their ""religion of man."" They never gave a crap about abortion, until 1869 when it was prohibited by the so called ""catholic canon law."" But again, what more do you expect from the Gentiles..."
"Having ken Paxton's making a decision of medical need,..sighhhh a corrupted political official telling a woman doctor and  medical support staff he knows more about human body cause hes a gop shady as heck political members  and now since hes has his law degree he knows reproductive and oby care..this is where a medical persons hippocratic oath should over ride a lawyer's false  wanna be medical ideology..."
"The very same party that is against women getting abortion, I believe are also wanting to make a move to ban contraception.  They cacre so much that a woman must carry every baby to be to term and deliver said baby.  Yet where are they on affordable childcare,  etc.  Once the child is born they don't care, it is no longer the governments  / the states responsibility"
Lower than property
This is INSANITY.
SOO..what she has to be on her death bed to have the abortion? Like ...really!? The AG is not medically qualified. If anything happens to this women her discrepancy is on their hands.
"File through the AG's background,, see what boils"
Paxton should be in jail. What a hypocrite.
"If I was rich, I'd fly her to a state where she can get one without a problem, first class, and pay all her bills. Texas may as well admit that it wants no exceptions."
Apparently Ken Paxton and the TX Supreme court have decided she can‚Äôt receive the abortion that Ms. Cox and her doctors have determined is medically needed. üò†üò¢
"This is what it looks like, when fascists rule and the people obey."
This is what voting republican
No American citizens of the female gender should be voting republican
"What would happen if this woman were to die?  Who would be to blame?  Shouldn't a woman who has two young children have the ability and the right to healthcare in 2023?  It would seem that children already born, and facing their mother dying because she can't get the healthcare she needs, is ok with Texas lawmakers.  It is nonviable fetuses they want to keep alive for a few hours, days, weeks, regardless how that affects the woman.  Who cares right?  Women in Texas have fewer rights that a pregnant animal who needs medical help!  All you need to do there is make an appointment and the surgery will be performed, without lawyers, without judges, without delays and without government interference and their lack of any medical knowledge what-so-ever.  Surgeries are even available if it's an emergency - to save both mother and offspring - if possible.  Imagine that!."
"If something serious happens to this woman, there will be women marching in the streets until next November, no matter what the GOP tries to do!  My wife and daughters will stop the streets of our Nation from moving anything and will make the Just Stop Oil protests look like a tea party!"
Show up to vote people stop complaining. Democracy and freedom can only survive if we vote out the MAGA extremist ! We can not let Trump into office he will go after our freedom to vote next.
This ruling was placed on hold by the all-male Texas Supreme Court. SICKENING
Maternal doctors should leave Texas‚Ä¶let‚Äôs see how republican women deal with it. I want them to spend hundreds of dollars traveling to another state for anything dealing with pregnancy
That's exactly how conservatives intend for it to be.
"If she dies, murder charges should be filed against the legislatures (republicans) who made this a law in Texas."
She can go to another State which allows late term abortion right? Texas doesn‚Äôt wish to get involved.
VOTE VOTE VOTE
Why was this law put in place without a vote from the people. State Government should not have any decision in women‚Äôs health.
Iran of America
Not surprised this is happening in Texas.  It‚Äôs one of those women hating states.
"Imagine that, the criminal Texas AG himself has criminalized abortion."
Leave the State of Texas and obtain the care you want.
Also this woman had to also now have her story on blast bc she has to go to court and over explain  her complications not only in becoming a mother clearly wants a baby and this is just unreal that even the medical professionals are standing by her ‚Ä¶. Her poor mental health?!!!!!
"Let's make a deal.  Trade Texas for Ukraine.
Meanwhile, lets get Ms.Cox removed, quickly, to a more enlightened state.
A question for Paxton:
You claim to be ""pro life.""  Are you concerned at all about the QUALITY of life, or just the QUANTITY?"
Paxton.   You DISGUST me.
No...  She must abide by the rules and regulations put into law by the leaders she and others have chosen to be in power.
Is this in Iran??
"Don't care about cruel laws. I care about her life. So much for ""pro-life""."
"If this woman loses her ability to bear more children, due to the state‚Äôs insane, invasive laws, it should OWE HER IVF, a surrogate to carry the child, and all associated medical expenses, for as many cycles and children as she wants. I SWEAR, it  owes her more than that!"
The American Nightmare. But Republicans will sell it as a dream.
"Right, but then the Texas SC stepped in and reversed the judges‚Äô order! This woman should go out of state. I know she wants to make an example, but she also needs to consider her health. She should come to Massachusetts. We would be glad to give her what she needs! I say if the courts delay her abortion until it is too late for a legal abortion, an exception MUST be made to permit a late-term abortion. This is what the right-to-crappers get when they meddle with a woman‚Äôs abortion rights."
Republicans are destroying this country
"Indeed,what gives a white guy with no medical training at all the right to judge what a sick woman needs to do to stay alive. They cannot claim religion on their side because I am fairy sure Jesus and His Mother Mary would think and act differently."
This is beyond reprehensible.
CHRISTOFASCISM !!
Those poor man in Texas soon have no gf or wifes anymore. i can't imagen that woman want to stay in Texas.
This is exactly why healthcare has no business being dictated by government. They are not medically trained professionals and need to stay in their lane‚Ä¶
Texans hate women.
"Texas needs to get abortion on the ballot.  It should have somehow been a requirement that it be put to the PEOPLE of the states once Roe was overturned.  States should not have been able to pass laws like Texas did - so it was primed and ready to the asshats in the SC take out Row.  I know people will not like that comment.  Ohio, Kansas and others have shown - even with a Rep legislature when put to the people they choose to protect individual rights to choose what you need for your own health.  I argued with friends and family that this would happen. They believed there would be exceptions.  ""Lose of major bodily function"" should include the ability to have children in the future.  Paxtons actions and threats show that's not true.  Rep cowards in the state senate need to be voted out."
Thats what i want to know when did  paxton get a doctor license????
Texas is just conservative North Korea. That whole state is a cancer.
"Grind my gears.


 Why do they keep voting republican?  This is what you get"
"This Is About Politics & Religion And Forcing Your Beliefs On Others. When The State Of Texas Gets Sued Into Oblivion For Billions When Someone's Wife Or Mother                                                       Dies Or When A Woman Can't No Longer Have A Child Becuse Of Their Stupidity ""The Christians"" Will Change Their Tune When It Hits Em In The Pocketbook."
Vote blue and every election in every state and let's end this fascism and Bible thumping because Republicans are using religion instead of the Constitution
"She can leave the state and get the abortion elsewhere  , almost like she is purposely trying to stay to sue , it‚Äôs your fault now for not leaving , she can even go to Mexico to do it for low cost !"
Absolutely insane for this POS Paxton should dictate the future for any women‚Äôs life! Paxton should be held accountable for anything that goes wrong!
I Hope she SUE PAXTON
You could bet if it was the AGs wife or daughter under the same circumstances he'd get the abortion done under the table.
Texas has always been an a** backwards state! Ain't nothin' changed!
If the mom dies then they need to charge Ken Paxton with first degree murder & give him 20 years in prison.
Why haven't the people of Texas haven't demanded a vote on this matter? Things like this should be brought before the people whose lives these laws effect.
This isn‚Äôt prolife it‚Äôs something else I would call it pro- birth as some have stated.
And just WHAT is the opinion of the health insurance? They need to step up for the health of women!!
I dream of the day when we have personhood rights for women in Texas.
"Abortion stances should be one of many single litmus tests for politicians and political movements for whether or not they're good for democracy as a whole. A politician says out loud he opposes abortion? Then he also opposes democracy as a whole. Also, science says abortion is NOT murder, so save your replies, forcedbirther-trolls."
Her body ken Paxton's choice.
This is an outrage!
These creeps should open an orphanage.
"Your rights end where a Conservative‚Äôs beliefs begin.
Exceptions that one can never qualify for are not exceptions."
They voted for this garbage.
"I am pro-life, but in this case Paxton and Texas are wrong."
Ohio voted to protect yet the state is still pushing back against what the people voted for !! So even when the people have spoken the government still doing what they want
"Texas needs to turn their state Blue so sane, lifesaving decisions can be made for its citizens. Especially for women."
What‚Äôs not believable about this. We‚Äôve been headed here like a freight train.
"First a disclaimer: I'm pro-choice, and see nothing wrong with (the former) Roe decision. But based on a comment on another article, I did find that emergency abortions are being performed in Texas. The link appears valid (Texas HHS). Yet there are the women who sued earlier this year, plus this case. What gives? Why were the other women in this document able to get abortions?

Texas allowed this to happen with your vote.
"Canadian here, I thought the Republicans said they wanted the government out of peoples lives? Guess they lied again,typical conservatives"

"MEN need to get TF up and fight for their wives, sisters, daughters. 
Allowing this to continue means the US Gov't decides when women will die. 
MEN if you value the women in your life, get in there."
"Thank God for Gov. Abbott, Attorney General Paxton, Republicans of Texas, and the State Supreme Court. Letting everyone know. It's a 100 percent pro - life state. No exceptions. As it should be."
This is Disgusting! Are we really still in America?
Paxton should have been aborted‚Ä¶..
If she's forced to have this baby and dies then Paxton she be held for murder
"Interesting how complaints are coming out of rightwing red states. Looking at the makeup of the population being 50% women, I can gather most women in Texas want to have their personal reproductive decisions made by the government. Otherwise, they would have bothered to vote. 

I would say, in Texas, democracy is working the way they want it to."

Women need FEDERAL legislation to protect their health and reproductive rights from meddling by state politicians.
"Just think dads, farther grandparents,  if she dies your now the care givers tonthat family. That or the state orphanages. Some one will need to be the care giver to those children left behimd."
"This just proved that Americans are the least free people in the world amongst the 23 industrialized nations. No other society in this category forces it's citizens to give birth and die. It reminds me of how slave owners would dehumanize slaves as property by taking away their body autonomy. Todays message is clear, the state owns you and your body and you are property of the state."
Republicans are misogynistic and evil.
All this from a man who is currently under criminal indictment and hides from it while he is in elected office.  That is the new norm by the Republicans.
"Women should leave all these states en masse, make the men go to a place where the rules are different and they can't use religion and crooked politics to control women."
The voice of women? Ken Paxton can't hear them because he's only listening to the voice inside his head... He thinks it's God. I think he's just psychotic.
Texas does hate women's rights
"My wife and I had to make the difficult and gut wrenching decision to end a wanted pregnancy that had the life threatening complication of Trisomy 18. We have two beautiful children now because we were able to make important decisions with our health professionals. The Texas Supreme Court and the people of Texas that support such abominable policies are deplorable, horrible, subhuman people that are not even close to being Christian."

"Turn America Blue in 24, go out and Vote. Remove these Maga Republicans asap.
 Women have rights!"
"Denying women's right to choose makes sense only if women are not autonomous humans who belong to themselves. How else to explain how when we don‚Äôt deny right to choice even to save undeniably living, breathing, sentient humans, including children and infants, we act like it's OK to do so to save not yet sentient zygotes and embryos?
Everyone has the right to say no to use of their body, even to save another‚Äôs life. There are people  who die because of this all the time. We don't typically consider this murder, we consider this exercise of our human right of bodily autonomy, our ownership of ourselves. 
It's the same for a woman and the embryo inside her. It's her right to exercise her right to bodily autonomy to say no to use of her body by another. It doesn't matter if the other is a embryo, a relative, spouse, the president, or a Nobel Prize winning physicist. Nobody has the right to use her body without her consent. Yet only in the case of the embryo does anyone think of it as murder."

Go to another state and stop making a big deal!
Her body! Her choice!
The Texas supreme Court blocked the lower Court's judgment as being illegal. Trisomy 18 does not lead to the death of the mother. You can't make up the rules as you go along. As an American citizen she has the right to travel to a state that does have legal abortion without breaking laws. Name me one instance where trisomy 18 led to the death of the mother. You can't. If you don't like Texas's abortion law vote to change the law. It's unbelievable that women cannot know what is legal and what is not legal.

"As a Pro life supporter, I pray for Katie, Justin, and their 20 week old unborn baby. I found it ""barbaric"" that we, as a society do not do our best to protect both, mother and child.

Paxton the INDICTED CRIMINAL?
Incubators of the State....
This case is a threat to their control over Texan women. It's as simple as that.
I believe this regime will be prosecuting women for having miscarriages next. There are already cases of women in the ER who could not get medical attention or removal of the remains of a miscarriage because hospitals and doctors are afraid to perform the procedure for being sued by the state.
To everyone who was on the fence about republicans not being a totalitarian regime. They won‚Äôt even follow the rule of law. They are openly trying to supersede a court ruling by threatening a 2nd party.
You never want a man speaking üó£Ô∏è like this as an AG. I feel ashamed for inhabitants in the state no voices but love talking about Democrat voters
Republican fascism
BEWARE BECAUSE NOW THEY ARE OPENINGLY LYING TO YOU SAYING THEY WANT TO HAVE EXCEMPTIONS BUT I PROMISE YOU IF THEY GET A HOLD OF POWER IN YOUR NEXT ELECTION THEY WILL DOUBLE DOWN AND TAKE AWAY EVEN MORE OF YOUR RIGHTS .LAND OF THE FREE LOL GIVE ME A BREAK
WOW YOUR COUNTRY IS A SICK PLACE ANY WOMAN WHO WOULD VOTE REPUBLICAN NEEDS THEIR HEADS EXAMINED WHEN IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY REGARD YOU AS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS WOW THAT IS SO SAD .
"The State, a Judge, an AG, the State Supreme Court, & lawyers. All these people are deciding what one woman should do with her body. America"
"As an attorney, Ken Paxton should know that a court decision is the authority. If he doesn't like it, he can appeal to a higher court, but he is in contempt of court if he is threatening anyone for following the direction of the court."
"I love Texas,but our govt. is so currupt."
"It is old men trying  to control  women, they are still living in the  stone  age."
I betcha she voted for Paxton
is this freaking Gilead? just crazy.
Yet they will continue to vote Republican
I'm not sure voting is a viable solution to deal with lazy-eyed soulless creatures like paxton.
"Texas is the state with the least citizen‚Äôs freedoms‚Ä¶look it up.  All of which are directed towards women and minorities! White old men ruling si the reason the world is in the shape it is in.
WE THE COMPLACENT PEOPLE!"
with three daughters i could never vote for a republican vote blue people
Republicans can be so vile.
Shame on Texas Republicans for letting Ken Paxton off to continue to this kind of damage in people‚Äôs lives. He should have been convicted and removed from office. Shame on Texas. Good for the judge.
Texas women always second class citizens.
I can‚Äôt get past his droopy face and blading GIANT head.
I am ashamed of this criminal AG ! Which century are we in ?
Greg and Kenny are expecting !
How many of the people who are shocked and upset by Kennys   actions what were you expecting and when you vote again for the orange republican God will you cry when he takes away your cake?
The pro-life christian Republican Party sadly just come across in instances like this as BARBARIC. Vote BLUE. this is on Obama could have codified Roe said he would and DID NOT. this is why the public DO NOT have faith in what ANY politician promises.Start governing for the people not the dark money peddling influences.
"no abortion no sir eeeee  lifes too important cant you see?
everyone knows what ken paxtons bottom line is $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
Hey dont ever become ken paxtons mistress and get preganant
"Respectfully, Joyce and Mika, you are wrong. Voting isn‚Äôt enough anymore, not with gerrymandering in TX. Come on, MSNBC, grow a backbone already. And you sponsors of MSNBC, we‚Äôre all sick of your gaslighting. I won‚Äôt buy anything from you anymore."
"Lets see paxtons wife or daughter not get an abortion if their lives are at risk, or show me ken paxtons medical degree"
"The only thing I have to say here is that Ken Paxton should have been impeached and indicted on multiple crimes he committed, as the Texas AG and before. He's a monster and he hates women."
The whole legal framing on abortion sounds criminal. I just hope that women and all sensible men can get out and vote OUT the people behind these cruel abortion laws
Free Texas give it to Mexico !!!
We So NeeD Women
Texas üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüí©
Unbelievable.  These Republicans want total control over women.  Women are to stand two steps behind their men and keep their mouths shut.  This is the United States??  These misogynistic men want to reverse all the social and equality progress made over the last century and return us to a time long gone.  Next they'll try and remove women's right to vote as they are trying to do with minority citizens.  We must vote these people out of office and thoroughly repudiate their fascist ideology.  Wake up America this next election is one of survival for our democracy
"No state,including Texas, has any business deciding such a health care decision for any citizen. Each human can make his or her own decisions regarding their own health. Paxton can decide for himself whether he ought to get an abortion, or not, but he can go stuff his opinions about others‚Äô health care."
"Everything is bigger in Texas, including the duschbag Handmaid commanders posing as republican AGs"
"Just remember this: Donald Trump is not only bragging about getting Roe v Wade reversed‚Ä¶he also wants to PUNISH women with jail time if they have an abortion! If he gets elected in 2024, women and life as we have known it in the US are doomed."
"It's sad that this woman has to fight to save her life, the right to have other children and that she can't make the right decision for the best care that she requires! Since she won her case and the AG is going to go after the doctors that gives her the abortion, the hospital and her husband for participating in her abortion! I pray that she takes the AG to court for attempted murder of her life, for the theft of her right to have other children, and the doctors and her husband also has the right to take him to court also for attempted murder by denying the right to have the abortion that could prevent death! The AG is also saying that the judicial system means nothing and that he knows more than any doctor, lawyer and judge! This AG is one sick man! No wonder God doesn't bless this country!"
"When you vote republican,  you get death panels, politicians in your bedroom, and doctors office. They told you they would do it."
Women as second class citizens IS the 'Great' in MAGA that Pubs want America to go back to.
"Until biden packs the sup court, women will be slaves of the state."
Think carefully about the issues you are voting for or against. B
The republicans have ruined our state.
"If, God forbid the mother were to die, will Paxton be charged with culpable homicide, or is that too much to ask?"
JESUS CHRIST! Please come
That is Insane. Who are these Men who believe they have the Right to tell a Woman What She Can Do With Her Body.
"Texas AG Tom Paxton needs a post-birth abortion, always has. The people's voice is, as the right-wing gun nutters keep telling everyone, the 2nd Amendment. Time for Texas Women to speak up loud & clear."
Ken Paxton is cruel and ignorant.   How dare he meddle in this difficult situation.  He should be sued personally.
Cruel and ineffective sums up MAGA Republicans policy positions.
"This is why I will *never* forgive Amy Covid Barrett for her MAGAcrimes against the American people.  Not content to slay a million living beings with her first ruling as a supreme court justice, she viciously tore down Roe, and now seeks another million deaths by miscarriage, and selfishly thinks it will win her a golden throne and glory in the afterlife.  Without her foul religious predation, American women would not have to beg the government for their very lives today."
this whole clip is some woke trash. 3 women complaining about men and talking about their bodies . you going to talk about that foreign guy you banged while drinking that old lady coffee next
"I thought it was ""Government OF the people, BY the people, FOR the people.  I guess Texas is too big for that principle."
"It's not about abortion and saving children. It's about controling women and girls. If they cared about children they would have past better laws for gun control, foster care and adoption."
TexASS Republicans have more respect for their cattle than women.
Vote all Democrats in 2024!
Anyone can be a woman today remember?  What's this talk about rights. What are those? Apples? Engines? What?
"This is a total embarrassment on the world stage.üá®üá¶. I see a fast exit, of Drs, out of US"
Texas is not part of the democratic world.
Wasn't Ken Paxton almost impeached in a vote and in a trial not too long ago?!?!?! üôÑüôÑ
Our country sute has fallen a long way....a criminal AG threatening others with charges for receiving healthcare.
"Well, we also have Malpractice Insurance carriers making medical decisions for doctors.   No, the insurance carriers do NOT have medical degrees, so glad you asked.  

This is the same thing.   It is dangerous, it is unfair, it should be positively ILLEGAL for anyone other than a patient's CHOSEN doctor to choose what is best for his/her patients.   The bloody end, man!  

I'm Pro Choice, but really thankful it did not have to be MY choice.  Desperate women will resort to desperate actions:   This is why I am pro-choice.   Of course, it breaks my heart for the pigs that use it as birth control...but it's not MY decision.   

I am so sad for this woman.   Truly."
Ken Paxton is a criminal and the fact that the American law allows him to still be. A governor makes me sick
Republic of Gilead IS ALIVE AND WELL IN TEXAS.
Sue paxton and file charges for attempted manslaughter
"Republicans must pay for this in 2024. Especially in texas, florida and all punk states trying to control women"
"WOMEN OF THE U.S. WE THE MEN OF GOD OWN YOUR BODY, WE OWN YOUR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, WE OWN YOUR HEALTH CARE. YOU ARE NOTHING BUT PROPERTY,  LESS THAN A 2ND CLASS CITIZEN, YOU WILL DO AS WE SAY, AS OUR BIBLE TELLS US . (IF YOU DISAGREE THEN VOTE. VOTE. VOTE. VOTE.)"
Isn't this 2023?  or 1723?
Blessed be the fruit...
Vote for all Democrats in 2024!
Second-class citizenship for women is allowing men to replace them in society... literally.
"What in the heck is wrong with the doctors of Texas that they don't fight this cruel, hideous law."
"They don't care about babies.  This baby has zero chance of living.  But 100% chance of conti6to devastate this mother and possibly leave her unable to have children.  Having lost a pregnancy at 22 weeks, the grief and devastation that comes with knowing that you will never get to bring your baby home is beyond what most people can grasp.  Her milk will come in. And there will be no baby to feed.  To put her through this, is absolutely disgusting.  Cruelty seems to be the point and I am thankful that I don't live in Texas."
"Imagine what happens to the citizens of this country who CAN NOT AFFORD A LAWYER OR LAWSUIT.
What are THEY supposed to do? Ken Paxton has IGNORED THE JUDGE AND THREATENED TO PROSECUTE HER DOCTOR AND HUSBAND! This is ""American""?!?!? We should ALL be FURIOUS!"
"Yes, THIS is health care - why call it abortion? Turning off life support for a terminally ill patient is not called homicide."
"The medical community should have created different codes long ago for situations like unwanted losses of wanted pregnancies. This is no different than removing someone with no chance of recovery off life support. If it had terminology recognizing it's not the same situation as what EVERYONE means when referring to ""abortion,"" we wouldn't be here."
Paxton is like the villain in a bad movie! Red states are going backwards.
"How does it affect women's status? Men can be pregnant people, too, ya' know."
Another reason to never live in Texas
"If you believe the Bible you don't believe that women are equal to men.
It's not binary like conservatives pretend. 
God made man.
Man was lonely. 
God cloned Adam and made him a  trans gender partner. 

Conservatives are hypocrites.."
Laws written BY men FOR men. Period. We couldn't get the ERA passed! The GOP will NEVER allow women to survive their hatred.
"STOP VOTING FOR REPUBLICANS.......STOP VOTING FOR REPUBLICANS.......THEY(REPUBLICANS) DO NOT CARE...,,........!!!!!!!!!"
Magaga is going to regret this.
This cruelty and negligence to this lady is ridiculous.  The USA has gone backwards to the rest of the progressive world.
I can‚Äôt believe that the man and woman; Kenny Pax suppose his daughter wife every woman in Texas. His selfishness and fear of women !! Maybe he should have a baby.
"The irony is the GOP wants to cut funding to all children's programs that help children in need, but they want to insinuate themselves in between a doctor and a woman.   These men who are making these laws are hypocrites."
Maybe Paxton should be sued or arrested for practicing medicine without a license.
"The judge already ruled.  But Paxton prefers to impose his cruel, personal ideology on a suffering woman just to show her who's boss.  I cannot use the words here that I would prefer to say."
"Texas when told they've got it wrong say, ""Hold my beer."""
"These people need to be stopped. May I suggest that emergency personnel when arriving at an accident find GOPers on scene and injured. The paramedics and physicians claim this is an act of god, hand them a bible, and tell them they haven't prayed hard enough and walk away."
"Religion is the motivating force behind all republican laws, being cold hearted hateful and prejudice against everybody that doesn't go to their Church.GOD must be proud to have such heartless spinless worms standing UP FOR HIMüò¢"
Let's be real she most likely voted republican until it didn't work to her advantage. Now we are supposed to feel bad for her years of poor choices? Stop voting for them then cry when they bite you. The republican party has been the party of hate for decades and the European women have been voting for them or decades. Now they losing their rights the republican party is the party of hate? Really?
What can women do to retake their bodily autonomy? That answer is very simple: Vote for Democrats across the board and get those evangelical tyrant Republican idiots out of our government.
Their holy book tells them women are property.
She doesn't realize that she is not considered an equal with men.  She is property and is now being reminded of that status.  We have fought for equal treatment for decades and finally won in 1973.  Here we are back at square one.
"I find it very important to point out how much of the issue around abortions is coming from MEN.  I am so tired of men trying to control everything and anything on this planet, especially a woman's body and health issues.  WOMEN ARE NOT YOUR INCUBATORS.  And, if you really want to end unwanted abortions then it HAS to come from the root cause of a pregnancy, which is the SPERM.  The sperm is what causes the pregnancy not the woman eggs.  NO SPERM NO UNWANTED ABORTIONS."
Why do we continue to excuse murder ?
"A bet you a quarter ,that in the past maybe one of trumps girlfriend had an abortion,im not saying it's true,,,no proof but why was he pro choice back in the day ,then in 2015,he change to pro life,because evangelist where supporting him,,,and how many Republicans have the same history when younger their girlfriends had abortions!,,,,iporcrytes"
why is Ken Paxton not in prison yet all government Aid to Texas should be banned.
Vote them out
"This is so distressing, she is cradling her bump so the baby is more than just a clump of cells, and for this poor woman to let go and say goodbye to her baby who she knows will never survive must be so sad.  And for some republican fool to pontificate and threaten her health care providers who are trying to help her survive it‚Äôs just unfathomable.  Republicans who support torturing women are doomed."

"Please can we call it healthcare because that is what it is-an abortion is only part of the healthcare she needs
a key part of her healthcare she cannot get"
Ken Paxton belongs in prison
Im pretty sure denying someone medical care to the point where they‚Äôre almost on the brink of death is a sin. Texans need to read their bibles more closely‚Ä¶
He should be in prison for corruption but his time is coming
why does your country even have judges if noone listens to them
"Republicans are using abortion as just another tool against women to maintain control and authority .  Force birth, oppose programs for childcare and economic costs of raising children forces women from achieving higher education and employment advancement."
"I am pretty sure that if Ken Paxton was suffering from a medical emergency he would get the best treatment from Texas doctors.

So if Ken believes that this poor women should not get the medical treatment in an emergency situation then neither should Ken nor any of his family even in an emergency situation."
"Voters in Texas wanted it that way, they voted their people in."
"Imagine the arrogance and cruelty it takes to force a woman to endure such continuous pain and suffering and mental anguish to prove your Christian values and some nonsense religious point.  If she is unable to have children again because of this, she should sue Paxton personally and the state of Texas for damages."
Shouldn't politicans write laws that help healthcare workers keep and support their sworn hippocratic oaths and not break them do to avoid legal prosecution?
"As a Texan, I'm appalled at our Republican House & the AG Paxton.  Paxton is a major criminal being allowed to stay in office by the other Republicans who are know accomplices in his crimes.  The Texas Republican money is vile & corrupt.  How Texas has allowed this to happen is beyond comprehension."
"Abortion-on-demand turns men into second class citizens and brainwashes women into believing that they're ""gods"" that have control over life and death.  Even the Pro-Life Movement doesn't have control over life and death.  We're the messengers for the One who does."
It sure is and the rest of us peones are next in the Traitorous Republicans cross hairs ü§îüá∫üá∏
Ken Paxton is the the most despicable sleazy POS...he needs to be removed from the AG office immediately.
It's too bad MSNBC decided to report the story this way because it's actually an example of our laws and courts working correctly. New laws are sometimes purposely vague in order to allow for the citizens to debate the issue and work out the details in court. It's impossible to consider every possible outcome or consequence of something like a partial abortion ban so iit sometimes makes sense to provide a general framework gets clarified over time. The woman in question took her issue to court because it was possibly borderline and prevailed because of an effective attorney. We should be happy with this not angry.
"Ken Paxton and Gov Abbott shoukd be removed,  investigates, and barred from gilding ANY OFFICE"
"Kkk wants to control everything, but other pink girlmen"
For someone who's looking from outside the United States this is one of the most depressing things I ever heard it's just depressing and sad to see how bad

The left dramatist this case is pathetic and discusting.  Mika is one special woman huh folks.  She knows nothing about this but is telling people that maybe she can't have a child in the future. I don't think she has the qualifications to do that.
"Let's see if the most ignorant stupid people in the USA could figure this out and explain it to the rest of the country, we were number one worldwide in education now we are number 24 worldwide in  education, because we let the criminal Democratic party and the stupid people that vote for them take over the university and the college,  will some intellectually stupid Democratic person explain that to any of us,  because I like to know why they were so stupid to vote for the criminal Democratic party,  they are destroying the USA and everybody already knows there's  the ignorant people that vote for the criminal Democratic party they're too stupid to understand any off thisüòÇ"
I'm glad this guy had the time to give that lady permission to get health care.
Don't worry - d*mb*ss magamoronic WOMEN are still gonna vote for the redumblican party soooooooooo...yep
The trans community has made women second class citizens
"Dang, how far along is she. Why cant she do like thousands of others and schedule a delivery. The baby CAN survive? I'm so confused by liberal thinking?"
"One day Paxton may need urgent medical care, may the ambulance lose its way."

2nd Class Citizen is better than making available Zero Class Non-Being status for Babies. Plus making those 2nd Class Citizens Murderers. Your Fancy Excuses aren't Cutting it !!
Women just need to move out of Texas. Leave these control freak men behind to be the incels they deserve to be.
It's amazing that Paxton isn't in jail.  Republicans have a moral value at all to vote for criminals for office.
"Smh. It strikes me the whole abortion issue is about fear and control. Those most fearful (of what, for God's sake? Women?) are the ones most hung up on controlling. They couldn't control their way out of a paper bag."
the last stats and study i saw were that over 75% of abortions were out of convenience. with money and 'not the right time' being the top two reasons.    less than 5% are out of actual medical necessity
"If you want to know how things like this can happen in the state of Texas it is because Texas is the buckle in the ""Bible Belt"".   These are God fearing Fascists in this state......not all of them, but too many of them."
"Lol... ""Second Class...."" As if a mythical ""1st class"" is getting abortions? Wow... Leftists are this nonsensical it's comical. I'm not even pro-life and I can't stand the way you idiots talk about this."
"I live in Texas and yes, our state government is run by a bunch of hacks, but that does not let the voters off the hook on this issue.  No, I have never voted for a single one of the abysmal candidates that were elected to lead this state, but as a voter, I share the collective guilt of the voters of Texas who have installed these misfits into places of power.  I apologize profusely for the misery that woman and her family have had to face because of our elected crud.  And Ken Paxton is the worst of the lot."
Nice to see the boneheads haven‚Äôt learned a thing and keep doubling down on stupid. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Ken paxton you nut case!

These decisions ARE NOT YOUR BUSINESS !!!!"
With Ken Paxton would qualify the abortion is when this woman has a tombstone and dies from the complications of the pregnancy.
"Bring it on Texas.
Keep pushing America's buttons.
FAFO."
"This doesn't seem very pro life too me condemning, them to potentially die from medical issues.  Very Texas, pro life only after people die then do bare minimum to fix issue to look like they're doing something.  Texas energy grid comes to mind. People who didn't realize, how conservative Americans are must not deal with many restrictive laws. Colombia a very catholic country legalized abortion as did overly, conservative S.Korea the USA isn't that pro life more like pro cruelty. I wouldn't be surprised, if the USA starts acting like Uganda or Russia and starts going after LGBT next."
It's shame that they used religion as a tool to control women's bodies.
George Carlin had the GOP dead to rights.  They are NOT Pro-Life.  Conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers.
Hold on define citizens ship is that at the open borders
Men should have NO say in any women's health issues.
Doesn‚Äôt Texas execute criminals?   Why isn‚Äôt that life sacred?   Christians playing God.
There's not a single woman in Texas that feels like a second class citizen.
"When the comments about abortions after birth wouldn't this be the same thing. To force a woman to carry a baby knowing ultimately the baby will suffer a painful death after birth.
   ‚ùì"
"Why do we have to deal with the state when we go see our doctors, this is no one's business but our own. If you don't like abortion, don't have one, if you don't like to think about it, don't, you will never know these women's stories, and it's messed up that we have to be public with our health issues. We are all held hostage by a few men don't like or appreciate women."
Where‚Äôs the surprise..you voted for this
This is just so sick!
"It is the arrogance of xtianity coupled with misogyny and narcissism.
Paxton is deplorable."
"Each state should have a referendum on abortion, let the people speak."
You guys have any breaking news on Hunter Biden!!üòÇ
"I can predict with very high certainty; if this becomes the standard.  Texas hospitals WILL close down maternity wards and many OBGYNs will leave the state.  Just like Idaho.  

As a single, straight male, I am VERY bothered by this, just like Mika"
Republicans must be voted out of all levels of government for this madness to stop.
I'd be curious to know where she stood about Pro-Life and where she's standing now with regards to reproductive rights and healthcare.
"So, let me get this straight...  A woman needs the ability to murder her unborn BABY to be a ""first class"" citizen?  Just trying to wrap my brain around what you are stating...  I understand the dilemma, I really do, but please do NOT make this about ""class"" rights.  It's NOT about that, period.  There SHOULD BE LIMITS and women MUST STEP UP and take PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN CHOICES.  Personal responsibility does NOT mean killing, it means PREVENTING.  Stupid argument.  FOUL."
"Paxton says she's an activist.  Yeah, I bet that's why she got pregnant."
"Are we going to imprison everyone who assists 66th + term abortions, cause I think Mexico is ready to pay for that wall."
Yeah right this is coming from the party who‚Äôs trying to remove women from sports by supporting men playing in women‚Äôs sports. So unfortunate.
What part of infanticide do you not understand?
So sad for her. She obviously wanted the baby. There is no reason to threaten her life by forcing her to continue to carry a baby that appears to be aborting already and that can not survive even if carried to term.
"This ruling would have never happened if the woman suing the state if they were black or brown. 

White Woman tear are a powerful thing..."
wow
The reality is that human societies have to be class differentiated [patriarchy and matriarchy] because the function of the human mind is to discriminate. No discrimination is no mind or mindless state of consciousness.
No woman should have to beg ANYONE for her healthcare.  This is good*mn ridiculous.

They don't care about babies.  Anti-abortion laws are not about babies they're about punishing women.
"Oh well, at least the economy is great .. according to democrat gov't workers in the DC beltway."
"USA  has always been a caste -class society , depending on your race , religion , wealth and position of power in government !

"Religion is behind all this crap, vote these nuts out!"
"Where are all the republican pro life preachers now?  I haven't heard any of their takes on this?  They are cowards. Come on out and discuss an actual circumstance that happens instead of lying about ""post birth abortions."""
"This is what forced birthers want for young girls and women in all 50 states. Forced birthers have repeatedly proven that they view young girls and women as sub human property- thats the point of laws like the ones in Texas, Florida, Idaho etc. Vote blue to stop them"
Paxton is a disgrace without empathy for anyone.  Why is he still in power?  Welcome to Texas.  If Women aren't allowed necessary procedures then make those in government who deny them accountable for the support of mother and child.  Texas politics sucks!  Vote Blue!
"Maybe Paxton needs to do a little learning about these rare genetic problems.  Trisomy banies seldom survive and their lives are full of discomfort.  Think of having a baby with microcephley, spinal bifida, clef palape and lip,  do a littlt research Ken. Be responsible, learn how your actions may affect and effect others."
Now I know where i can sell my steel coathanger collection. Thanks MSNBC!
"women in red states are not second class, they are nothing but breeding boxes when they are young and even less when older."
Sounds like a good test for a self-defense for the woman.
"While I agree she should be allowed to get an abortion in this instance and what I'm going to say is not the answer, but wouldn't it be easier to go to Colorado or New Mexico where there are no restrictions and then sue Texas later?"
"Ah, so your lifes on the line and you need the government and courts approval to get the necessary health care you need in order to survive?
