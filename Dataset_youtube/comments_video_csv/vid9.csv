Never vote GOP again. That's how we fix healthcare.
"a better world, with less murder"
"EASY SOLUTION. If men really wanted to save babies lives, they would mandate vasectomies instead of playing politics with women's bodies.    VASECTOMY is safer, cleaner, more successful, a one timer, not risky nor fatal, and a whole lot cheaper,       Hey guys, how about it?    SOLUTION TO ABORTION IS PREVENTION."
Extreme?  No. Sorry.  A wrong has been righted.  Roe vs Wade was based off lies.  Using Larry Laders ideologies.
They be illegalizing abortion but still let people sell gun legally
They took are JOBS!
"Many churches are evil.  Don't give your child up for adoption.  They want to ban abortion only for their own greed and evil intentions; to sell children to pedophiles, sexual perverts and into slavery."
"1) Abortion bans do nothing. Women will always have the option of abortion, whether it‚Äôs banned or not. 
2) Abortion bans actually increase the number of abortions, ironically. So I guess you people really aren‚Äôt about saving fetal lives so much as virtue signaling.
3) Fetuses now have a right that no other human being has, and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another person‚Äôs body to stay alive. No other human has ever been granted that right. Even if you stab someone and they‚Äôre bleeding out, and you have matching blood types, the government cannot force you to give them your blood to keep them alive. Or if you use a mask, gloves, etc. but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organs start shutting down, the government cannot forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organs. You used protection, so the chances of giving this person the disease that you‚Äôre a carrier for were very low, but it still happened, and now they‚Äôre dying because of you. Guess what‚Äîthe government does not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive. That‚Äôs exactly what an abortion ban attempts to do, however. So I‚Äôm not sure why fetuses should have that right when no one else does."
"By the order of God, a soul is sent to a particular womb, but by this contraceptive he is denied that womb and has to be placed in another. That is disobedience to the su-preme."
I'm pro-choice. Is abortion killing a baby? Yep...but I'm good with it anyway. We have enough people.
People on b9th sides quite  your stupid stuff.there are more life threatening  things going on in the world. There using you all to run on elections and money same thing ever year.
Not Government role to control stay out will never please all.  Waste of time and energy.  Individual  decision. People mind your own business
Look at all those people it‚Äôs ridiculous the world is populated with people what the hake do I look like adding on to that I‚Äôm good ‚úåüèΩ
Isn't it something how they talk about the one woman in a million that couldn't get an abortion and something went wrong but they don't talk about the other billion of babies that are born safe and naturally. Ban all abortion pills. It goes hand-in-hand with overturning it
Every abortion is the murder of a baby.  I don't understand how blind people are.
"The ""right to lifers"" tend not to mention the things I've delt with; I am mow 62, never had kids (because I did not want them to grow up in this world). I get consistent üí© from people in the Reich-wing because I didn't have any. Seems it is not all just the gripe that abortion is murder. Clearly they have other motives. The Reich-wingers will never touch my children!!"
Every woman encouraged by Dems to just get an abortion All wind up in therapy.   Dems should get abortions
I wanna get rid of my kids too man y'all please help me.üòìü•≤üò¢üò•üòìüòûüòñ
"It makes me so angry.  These people demanding abortions until as long as they want.  Who do they think has do these things.   Nurses and doctors who don't have a choice or lose their job.   We get to do the nasty murderous things these people demand.  Nurses and doctors committing suicide on a daily rate because they are being forced to be murderers.  Assisted suicide, late term abortions.  They monsters demanding it don't have to get their hands dirty or sin against God's wishes.   They don't have to live with seeing babies taken out piece by piece.   You are monsters to make medical people who swore to say lives take it so you don't have to be bothered.  That is why I left my profession and why thousands are leaving daily.  You selfish little snowflakes."
Till she's on deaths door really..
"Does abortion cause breast cancer?  In medical circles, estrogen is a known carcinogen (cancer causing). When a woman is pregnant, her estrogen rate spikes significantly, and her breasts begin to change in size and function (differentiate) for breast feeding. Specifically, her ovaries produce 2000 percent more estrogen and progesterone at this time. With the levels of estrogen now elevated, if she interrupts the cell differentiation process before full term pregnancy, this elevated estrogen introduces routes for the onset of breast cancer. This is the triggering process where abortion increases the risk of breast cancer. This is why in a late term abortion or miscarriage, with this abundance of estrogen, the risk of breast cancer increases by 638 percent over those with no such history. This is also why teenagers who have an abortion are especially at risk for breast cancer, because of the changes estrogen is already causing in their breasts, plus the additional estrogen from the pregnancy. 

There are a lot more data on this but the bottom line is, (1) abortion significantly increases the risk of breast cancer for all women, (2) the younger the woman and the later the abortion, the greater the breast cancer risk, and (3) the breast cancer rate for women almost doubled since Roe v. Wade. It is medically established that abortion increases the rate of breast cancer. But women typically are not told about this until the breast cancer starts and by then, prevention is no longer a choice.  If you wish to learn more, check out ""My Right to Choose,"" on Amazon. This information will help you make informed choices about what you do, and what you encourage your family and friends to do. It literally could be the difference between life or death."
Jesus is coming folks. Repent and be saved.
"The living but unborn are persons in the sight of God from the time of conception. Since abortion takes a human life, it is not a moral option except to prevent the death of another person, the mother.‚Äù The sin of willfully aborting a child, except in those very rare situations where it may be necessary to save the life of the mother, is a sinful act, totally contrary to the will of God."
I wouldn't personally want to abuse my child but I wouldn't stop other parents from doing so.
Free tickets to heaven! Free limbs to be able to afford to get through life!
Stop the drama and use protection! If you can‚Äôt afford to raise a child then use a double condom. Actions=Consequences! Pro life! üëç
Happened with Biden administration. Y'all voted for him and wanted him. Don't cry now. Just like how he left extremely expensive military equipment in Afghanistan purchased by my tax money.
Killing is killing use a condom.
Yeah. It means no babies will be murdered. That‚Äôs pretty much it. üëåüèºüëç
The defining moment of being a modern woman the right to abort your child. What a sick position it's the epitome of stupid. I'm pro-life even if it means The Unborn Child might possibly turn out as ugly as your disposition. Shame on you for bringing your hurt to the party and advocating for termination of The Unborn. Go forgive your mother
You can get all these people out on the street to fight for the right to abort but you can't get anyone to protest the current political regime in America even when you can't afford gasoline and your family is going hungry. How about a great reset to the American people's priorities? Good luck repopulating the future too.
"Women should have the right not to become pregnant.  Haven't they always?  It is her body after all, her choice.  Pregnancy is not a communicable disease, it is (usually) a choice for exposure they make for themselves.  Irresponsibly removing consequences of detrimental decisions encourages more of the same.  ""More of the same"" meets the definition of perversion.   Some people want Big Government to mess in personal lives where individually you own consequences.  That you can depend on Big Government for your well being is a fallacy Democrats are selling and failing with.  Think about it. People reach new understanding every day."
I know a woman who is EXTREMELY  conservative and all about the abortion ban. What she won't tell you is that she's had 3 abortions herself when she was younger. If she would of had any of those children her life would have been completely different
"Reverse psychology that's why they did this, it's to easy the government is smart.  They don't want anymore babies born,  there are to many people on this planet. You'll walked right into there hands!"
We need to fight for abortions so blacks and Mexicans are not born anymore. Legalize abortions n place them in all black communities plz!!
How about women start using protection and taking responsibility for their actions? AKA don‚Äôt be a murderous POS!
"I'm a 100% Republican, and I just don't get my sides point of view on abortion, or understand why they're all so against it. Personally, I think there should actually be a 100% legal forced abortion, after a family has just 1 child, if that many even. None of this adoption garbage either because that just adds to the problem. Not just because I hate, and despise, children but also, and mostly, because this World and especially this Country (US) are all completely overcrowded. We do not need more people in it, plain and simple. Enough is enough."
Abortion is not medicine it is murder
"The movie 2001 a space Odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion. A space Odyssey is a fetus in the womb. The Clint Eastwood dirty Harry movies was angry calm. It seems nasty but it's a good police officer. Angry calm is how a women chooses abortion.

Everything in motion makes one error. Your supposed to park the error where it doesn't matter or you play wack a mole with errors. It's intelligently designed that if you try killing God you will always make one error. A movie is in motion so you have to park the errors where it doesn't matter. 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind. That why Hal computer eye is colored red so it still has artistic integrity. 2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made. It only has one error to park. You can't do better than that."
abortion is not the issue most people want some regualtion schumers bill advocated for 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 months and aftr birth thats murder
Simple solution.... stop spreading you legs
More future wage slaves this is why they decided to banned abortion.
they bought the supreme and now this anti abortion law in 2022 ? this law is bigoted intolerant and make a lot of problems for people . i dont know how this people were elected but sure usa voters have to ponder about it
"Exodus 21:22-25

Authorized (King James) Version

22¬†If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart¬†from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman‚Äôs husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges¬†determine.¬†23¬†And if¬†any¬†mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,¬†24¬†eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,¬†25¬†burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe."
"Men have no right to be the ones to decide women‚Äôs issues, especially about reproductive rights. If the shoe were on the other foot men would literally lose their minds if women were in charge of deciding men‚Äôs issues, such as who gets vasectomies, who is allowed Viagra, etc!"
"Here's what I don't understand:  
1) Bearing a child carries an inherent risk of death or grievous bodily harm.  
2) One may not be forced to use their body at the service of another; that would be slavery.  
3) One may not be forced to endure medical risk, physical pain, and mental anguish; that would be torture.  

So HOW, exactly, is abortion anything other than self defense?"
"I don‚Äôt understand how people who are/were against government mandated Covid vaccinations, but are in support of abortion bans. It‚Äôs enraging that some only support bodily autonomy when it‚Äôs in regards to themselves, but don‚Äôt care that women‚Äôs rights are being violated."
More lies and propaganda. ABORTION HAS NOT BEEN BANNED. Check with State voters!! MSNBC can't  be trusted. Beware of these propaganda news networks. Americans deserve truthful reporting!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
"U.S. democracy is a broken system and it does not represent the majority of Americans. The majority of Americans approve of legal abortion, they approve of stricter gun control laws, support raising the minimum wage, recognize our Southern Border is in crisis with illegal immigration and etc., yet our representatives continually fail us, playing political games back and forth, prioritizing their own needs and the needs of corporations and special interest groups over the average American voter."
"GOPs can't respect a women's right to decide what to do with their bodies in order to ""protect."" When it comes to gun and violent though, they don't seem to care about those lives........"
We are all here because our parents choose life for us and yet in 2022 we are still killing babies in the womb. So wrong.
Hopefully what the Supreme Court did will be the undoing and the permanent removal and destruction of the Republican Party and hopefully we can have term limits
You can only ban legal abortions.
"Just wait, it‚Äôll be 2055 and the country will be so overpopulated that you have to live in stacks like ready player one. Imagine banning the one form of population control we had a right to."
Almost 50% of the adult voting age population are women. If they don‚Äôt stand up and vote these Republicans out they will have only themselves to blame when their rights are taken away from them. What will it be next? The right to vote taken away? The right to travel to another state is already in jeopardy. Will they make it so you have to have a man sign for you if you want to travel or open a bank account or get a loan from the bank to own your own property? This is only the tip of the iceberg and women need to sit up and take notice or they will lose all the gains that our grandmothers and mothers fought so hard to secure for women of today. Wake up to what‚Äôs really happening here!!
"Its less about abortion and more about that some ppl believe they know better how to live your life. But don't tell them how to live theirs, that's THEIR freedom. It's your freedom that offends them."
Abortion bans dont stop abortions. Only Clinics. Most women are just causing their own miscarriage. I am glad women have abortions. Pro Life only want us born so we can suffer. Every abortion saves a child from this world.

Still hasn‚Äôt changed my mind.  These children matter more than you think
Dude it‚Äôs up to the states
Protection of the helpless babies is never mentioned.
"Why do peopke think they have any right to tell a woman what to do with with her body? No one should be able to. My body my choice.
If someone doesn't believe in abortion fine, don't get one. But why bc they don't believe in it, they get to tell others what to think, how to feel, what to do with their bodies? I bet most of these people yelled ""my freedom..."" during covid. Thing is they weren't forced to do anything. There were limits and boundaries but not forced. Women are being forced to do something major with their bodies."
"As a mature woman who lived in the times before Roe, I remember. The tears of a teen who missed her period. The ostracism of a pregnant young girl from school, church and/or family. The swallowing of pills & potions attempting to self-abort. Or the horror of nurses & doctors when left with the ravages of the damage a coat hanger can do when a woman is desperate. Those were horrendous times for women. Please don‚Äôt make me live them again."
"Never forget that all it takes is a political,
economic or religious crisis for women's

Over a million dead labor units in the US alone.  Big money wants Forced Birth Cattle.  Religious nuts want to control crotches.  What a team.
"Republicans don't give a crap about the unborn, they just want to keep birth rate up, so we don't runout of taxpayer's and cheap labor in 16 years."
Abortion kills alot of babys
Can Texas please just secede from the US.  It‚Äôs a POS state.
That's just a small percentage of the general population.. not as many idiots out there as I thought üòÇ
I would like to know if there are any incidents that doctors were charged when treating a miscarriage. If not this is fear mongering. Every party does this. If it has happened then that would be ridiculous and we should address it
The staff at MSNBC is reason enough for abortion........
"Come on, ""Supreme"" Court, follow through on this fair decision based on the same reasoning! Update the Federal voting law!
Roe v. Wade was overturned based on 14th Amendment and the situation in 1868. Look at who were allowed to vote or hold office in 1868 based on the law and the 14th Amendment.


Arkansas Constitution‚Äî1868 
Sec. 3. The following classes shall not be permitted to register, or vote, or hold office, viz:
1st. Those who during rebellion took the oath of allegiance, or gave bonds for loyalty and good behavior to the United States Government, and afterward gave aid, comfort or countenance to those engaged in armed hostility to the Government of the United States, either by becoming a soldier in the rebel army or by entering the lines of said army, or adhering in any way to the cause of rebellion, or by accompanying any armed force belonging to the rebel army, or by furnishing supplies of any kind to the same.
2d.  . . .
3d.   . . .
4th.  . . .
5th.  . . .
6th. Those who are idiots or insane

The first group takes care of the former President, many Congress members, and the Insurrectionists. The sixth group encompasses those people who still think Trump won in 2020!"
This will make people less reckless about getting pregnant.
It is inhumane to murder your own child.

"Organized crime is what you are really seeing, women's biggest partner in crime walked away from them, look at all the custody and child support laws when they really started and you'll see it all about the 70's when they legalized murder of the unborn, just because they call something different than what it really is doesn't change what it really is. Custody=Kidnapping, Child Support=Enslavement, Abortion=Murder, they just changed how you think about it by calling it something different."
Reclassify embryo as a tumor üòâ
No matter how you feel about abortion. MSNBC is an ignorant outlet that is driven by hate.  Every valid point they may have is lost in a river of stupidity and ignorance.  MSNBC SUCKS
It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt understand being pro-life. I do understand. I get it. But it simply doesn‚Äôt outweigh the reasons to be pro-choice. There are too many exceptions and too many tragic situations where an abortion is - as unfortunate as it is - the best option. And it‚Äôs really nobody‚Äôs business to impose laws upon a woman in one of those situations.

"It is time for Americans to man up. If Republicans win this then we must face some facts. Republicans have not hidden the fact they are going after birth control next so together with banning abortions this amounts to FORCED BIRTHS. If they win and you care about children you might want to consider getting your TUBES tied or a vasectomy. If this sounds a little drastic, IT IS. However, if Republicans win would you really want to bring a helpless baby into this country under their RULE??????"

"Abortion is not for religious fanatics and politicians to decide. It is right of the woman to decide, with help of doctors and specialists. There is so many things wrong with you America."

See how utterly dysfunctional the adoption Gordian Knot is.

"the overturning of roe vs wade was a political choice by republican lawmakers to help their party get religious zealots on board to vote for their party during the mid term elections.  think about it.  the timing isn't just random.  whether these justices are religious zealots thou isn't an argument i am going to get into now.   what is a religious zealot?  well in my opinion its a person who has a faith and that faith dictates their lives... and they attempt to force others to comply with their beliefs by any means necessary... whether it be changing the laws, mobs, all the way upto death squads and such.  they do not believe others who do not follow their ideas or their faith have the right to exist.  and by their actions others of faiths with anything in common with them, will be forced to help them or face their wrath.  and that is how you get anyone who is religious to get in line and support the zealots...  fear and the desire just to survive take prestant, to fit in, even if these ideas are not your own.   so ya in my opinion... roe vs wade being overturned is a means to buy religious folks compliance to the zealots, and to force the population to follow the ideas of the zealots.   either the population acts or it lays back and accepts these religious zealots rule.  which has only just begun.... next it will be public schools, science, medicine, the list is endless... but attacks have already started on every front.... people fight back and hopefully it will be enough to retain our democracy and not fall back to being pre constitution days."
"Everything happens for a reason. I believe this is happening because it's damaging republicons reputation to the point where even die-hard supporters are saying they're voting blue this year, effectively removing the GQP's power over us one election at a time"
"I hope that every woman that has been denied medical assistance and has suffered for it , sues every pro abortion government."
"Everyone needs to plan ahead and make sure these cheaters have not purged you from the Voter registration list.  We all need to plan ahead and know where, when and how we are voting this November.  They have passed a ton of Voter suppression laws all over the country.  We gotta do our homework well in advance.  There are fewer drop boxes for ballots to be dropped off at. You may no longer be eligible to vote by mail so check now.  They have closed and or consolidated many precincts to make the wait time to vote in person prohibitive in minority areas.  The maga klan (red hats) will be out trying to intimate voters.  Some of them have run off the usual poll workers so that they can intimidate, misinform or discourage voters that might not vote for mara-lardo.  We should all expect obstacles and be ready to overcome them quickly.  Know who's running and what policies they stand for and against. Vote against the fasci-publicans or we will loose even more of our rights and freedoms.  These crazies will make Handmaid's Tale An American Documentary if we give them a fraction of a chance."
Living in NC near the border. Still wanting SC money for it. We go for fireworks they come for abortions. Crazy.
I cry for all the women who will die because their right to safe care has been taken away. Too many women will die when we could have helped save them. I live in Texas and I‚Äôm terrified of having a complicated pregnancy now.
Overturning Roe was a beautiful thing!
If a man is against abortion they need to be sterilized meaning a operation
I‚Äôm a democrat but am against pro choice
Biden was against abortion in 2006 I only support that version
Land of the free...
I'm so happy I live in Kansas. I think this is the most my state has ever been in the news!
"ABORTIONS ARE NOT TAKEN AWAY, THE QUESTION OF ABORTIONS WAS PUT BACK TO THE STATES WHERE IS SHOULD HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
ABORTION IS NOT BIRTH CONTROL"
"Abortion needs to be legal again, it's a woman's body and her choice. Unless she has an abortion to spite someone like her husband or wife. While we are on the topic, circumcision should be made illegal, his body his choice."
Blessed be...
It's about the total ban of abortion for me. No exemptions is a fking joke.
"Can we Ban MSNBC, FOX, CNN. The Biggest Virus is the Media."
"See some people think that abortion is a religious thing and some believe it's killing of a life, but it still is a woman's right. Now women have to walk around with dead bodies floating around inside of them. This is not the old dark witch doctor days, but it seems the right far right religious nuts want us to do. Everybody don't live by God every word."
"I am so ashamed to say I am a Texan. Abbott, Cruz and crew are HORRIBLE human beings and even worse for Texans."
I registered to vote this year specifically for abortion. I will be voting from now on.
"What if we just remove government social programs that pay for women's contraceptive and reproductive health bills.

 women want the government involved to pay their reproductive health bills, but then they go around saying I don't want the government to touch my body it's my choice.
The biggest problem women face today is thier own stupidity, and utter lack of perspective."
"Some will be happy that babies wont be killed, some will be angry that babies wont be killed."
"15 percent of pregnancies end up in a miscarriage. Women have known this but legislators do not. These bans will affect women choosing to get pregnant, because the risks are too high."
GOP Christofascists are the American Taliban. Forcing women to give birth is just a start for them.
"Women's rights being taken away are just the beginning. The GOP plans to take more rights away from many different groups. The GOP say the Democrats want all your guns, not true they only want to ban weapons of war being sold to 18 year olds."
Beto üíôüíôüíô
Texas VIOLATION OF THE PREGNANCY ACT!!!
"When children lose their mother due to a complication during pregnancy, I hope the fathers get worthwhile help from their pastors.  Jesus wanted your mom to die just doesn't seem that helpful."
"99 years?  Premeditated murder carries a life sentence, usually only 15-20 years depending on circumstances.  These people are waaay out of line."
Where and when is the next march?
We should either take away the penalty for doctors for making the wrong call or also put in a law that prosecutes doctors for delaying life saving treatment
America gives more rights to corpses than living women üôÑ
Texas is terrible
"This has worked just as well as banning alcohol, or drugs. Complete and utter failure."
"2 sides to everything.  If the state can force a pregnancy they could one day force abortion.  It's already done in China.  
The state shouldn't decide."
Those who take life will answer to God. All of this evil increase is just getting us closer to end times & Jesus' return.
"Does this mean we're gonna have organized groups that secretly provide adequate medical care for women, similar to people that were supping up their cars to evade police for alcohol running and eventually become the first Nascar drivers, drug cartels in Mexico, the underground railroad?"
IF THEY DNT WANT TO HAVE A BABY THEY NEED TO USE A CONDOM N THEY WONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HAVING A BABY JUST USE A CONDOM
"Democrats should use abortion, booms banning and other things to get support from both side to win this midterm"
"I Am an Example of Women that morally had NO ""Right"" to have Children. Zero. 
My children would have become burden on the State."
It's ridiculous that a corpse has more bodily autonomy rights than a living person.
"Conservatives: babies having babies, that's hot.(strokes m16)"
easy to pass laws . . . but the consequences????? . . . these right wingers are clueless
"Can a conservative please explain to me why you don‚Äôt want to save a dying mother, therefore her baby will also die? I‚Äôm so confused. Or why you want a woman to die over an etopic pregnancy, which is never viable?"
"The court that did this are bonkers, causing extreme unnecessary suffering for an already vulnerable population.
Poor women.  Government is bonkers.  Anyone who enforces this persecution of women (doctors, police, lawyers, etc) are guilty too."
Dump patriarchy
Sorry but if your going to make us wear a mask then screw you then the unborn deserves to be have life at anytime
I love to see the strength of women!
"The loudest group is almost never the most popular group. This is why we all must vote and vote for the candidate or issue that you really support, not just vote to be on the winning team. The quiet dont need to necessarily protest in the street, just actually exercise their vote."

Vote the anti-abortion jerks out.
Texas LUL she‚Äôs my cousin I seen her first! Go Murica
Why is nobody talking about NOT get pregnant in the first place? Other than extreme situations.   The pill is free and there is the morning after pill.
"Just wait til the people see the private water tanker hooked up to the Jackson Mississippi GOVERNORS MANSION while the 150,000 people have no clean, safe running water. Its way past time to eat the rich before its too late."
"Fortunately, none of these people were aborted and have lives and freedom to protest."
ABORTIONS is MURDER the INSIDES RIGHTS or Don't get Pregnant Simple as that.
People are welcome to move out of the state you're in to a place that is better for you. I'm planning and preparing to leave mine already. Is it quick and easy? No. Its not impossible.
Black is the dominant color. Lol if we as black men impregnate a bunch of white women I promise those white males will change the abortion law so fast your head will spin. Lol I'll do my part ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"America had a high maternal death rate before Roe was overturned.  Now its just going to get higher.  No one would be okay with being told ""sorry cant treat your failing kidneys until your kidneys have completely stopped functioning, just go home and come back when they've completely failed. Youll smell a rotting smell that'll make you gag.  Sepsis sorry the law told me I cant treat you until they are dead and rotting inside of you.""  So why are we okay with telling folks they gotta wait for their unviable child's heart to stop beating. And come back once its actually dead inside of them, when the child would have died shortly once labor starts or exit the womb anyway?"
Why don't you stop the false narrative. The supreme court handed it to the states and people to decide.  Fake news and the Democrats and nuts are causing chaos and should be ashamed their doing it.
"Yup, babies get to live"
If you can‚Äôt trust me with a choice. How can you trust me with a child?? üëÄüòê
This is similar to Brexit. A lot of people voted without really understanding how they would be affected. Then suddenly... üò≥
How can the United States hope to lead the world in important issues when they are busy fighting over problems that belong in the dark ages?
The democrats were in power and they did not sought this out.
"Shame on these lawmakers for not thinking of WOMEN‚ÄôS HEALTH, and only thinking of their own selfish religious beliefs. Whatever happened to separation of church and state? Maybe we need to ban vasectomies, and make it a felony for doctors who perform them? I GUARANTEE it would never happen, because it involves MEN."
They is the devil they know the world overpopulated but the devil wants a war
Conservatives should be the first to complain against abortion restrictions since they don't want government to be involved in their lives as little as possible.
"*The Republicans have created all of these problems that we are suffering from in our country right now! They have done this to try to trick American voters into voting for Republicans!*
*Every American voter needs to understand that Democrats are NOT to blame for inflation, high gas prices, rising crime, or any of the other problems the Republicans are blaming them for!*
*The Republicans DESPERATELY want American voters to be totally distracted and confused about the absolutely most important things to vote on! That's why Republicans are doing this!*
*Just vote Democrat all the way up and down the ballot, in the midterms, and in 2024! If you do this, and the Democrats control the country, all our problems will start to go away! Trust this!*"
"Here's the secret... *Every single bill and law the Republicans vote on is deliberately harmful to the American people in some way either directly or indirectly! And this is NOT an accident!*

*Americans need to realize that the only people who actually care about you are the Democrats! You must have faith that the Democrats are the good guys! You need to VOTE DEMOCRAT!*
*The Republicans want Americans to think that the Democrats are doing the wrong things so that American voters will vote for Republicans! This is the biggest mistake you will EVER make!*"
"OH I KNOW THIS ONE, it's barbaric.  That's what it means.  There is a reason most of the world offers abortion one way or another.  It's because when you don't allow abortions to be performed,  women die for no reason.  We have the technology to save them and we aren't using it based on the decision of a few judges that weren't elected.  They were appointed by a president who didn't win the popular vote.  Based on the preference of a minority of deranged religious fanatics.  A loud, caustic minority, but still a minority."
"Women do you think it is time to take to show we have power. Now is the time to fight.
This must be much bigger then my time of burning bras.
We never kept it going equal pay for the same work.
Why is it these men feel they have the right to a woman's health.
Who was the republican sob who wanted AS PART OF A BILL EXCLUDING AGE WHICH WOULD MEAN HE COULD MARRY A CHILD.
IF THERE IS A GOD THANK YOU FOR GIVI G WISDOM TO CATCH IT EXPOSE him for the predator he is and what wanted fing children."
If it‚Äôs your body your choice then why were people being threatened to be fired from their jobs if they didn‚Äôt get vaccinated? It‚Äôs the principle of the matter. My body my choice. Not to mention all the people who are dealing with the side effects of getting vaccinated. They won‚Äôt even publicize that. Our principles are ‚Äúnot your body and it‚Äôs not your choice‚Äù. That‚Äôs what we should stick to. So too bad
"I'm so glad we have put a stop to the wholesale slaughter of babies!!! Yeah, I said it!"
"0:02 TANGENT! WOW, face filter much? Does she really think no one can tell she's using a face filter? üòÜ"
Pretty sad when it's better legally for a doctor to let a woman die or become maimed by her pregnancy than to help her and give her the care she needs to maintain her life and health.
Why aren't OB-GYN doctors fleeing Texas? Why aren't pediatricians fleeing Texas? Why aren't women fleeing Texas?
they didn't ban abortion if dems hadn't promoted same day as birth abortions  then supream court wouldn't t have made that decision until Ms turned it into genicidal .murderof infants that's the reason they did this left it with states pluss pregnant teen sarearesultof leftist minoratracted persons
"About half of children in the United States (40 million) are now insured through Medicaid or the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program (CHIP)  the vast majority in Medicaid. 
54% of child support ordered by the courts goes unpaid so tax payers pick up the tab.
We should put a Human Services Dept on every corner there was an abortion clinic so women can enroll in all the entitlement programs possible in their state and federal programs. 
Every poor woman is entitled to WIC, Welfare, Medicaid, Public Housing, Free Day care, Phones. and internet.ü§î"
So glad I don‚Äôt live in the US. What a joke!
"Abortion is a woman's choice across the majority of the world.
The US constitution has been amended 27 times and it's easy to amend as abortion law.
Americans are like Taliban men who pretend they can dictate what women should do. Land of freedom?"
I am SO confused. 99 years for necessary health care while they fight for cops to have the right to murder. Can a Republican please respond and explain to me why a potential life is so much more valuable than a living one?
"Nickson Started a political war on drugs. Reagan made it a real war will laws. Clinton provided the prisons  and militarized police.
 
Politicians use abortion right for political gain. Nationalist made it a real issue. State's are providing laws and the same militarized police.  

Curious, Do history repeats itself?"
"I grew up hearing horror stories about the aftermath of back ally abortions. Of ""Doctors"" using the equivalent of a coat hanger to pop the placenta. Of women hemorrhaging and ultimately needing a hysterectomy in order to survive. The fact that the country took away necessary medical procedures based on religious beliefs is an affront to the very constitution. The freedom to believe/practice a religion or even to not believe in religions. 
The fact that only now people are realizing the toll that their close mindedness is  causing is as tragic as it is selfish."
"Choice is about letting the person have the freedom to choose.  Why are religious people so adamant about dictating over other people‚Äôs choices?  You don‚Äôt agree with abortion, then you don‚Äôt get one.  But who gives you the right to determine another person‚Äôs choice?"
"Your Body, MY CHOICE!"
This is really heartbreaking
Just get married and have children like granda ma did. What?
"Yea, we never asked for it the supreme court did it entirely against our will but go off."
"The simple solution to this would be to make Americans who want to force women to give birth, pay for the cost of raising those children. Medical bills, food, shelter, and education should be paid solely by Americans wanting to ban abortions. Take responsibility and put your money where your mouth is."
Let the voters decide. WOMEN bodies are not to be controlled by ü¶Ω üßìü¶ºüßì men telling them what can or can't do about their body. What's next. Bare foot and pregnant. It ain't happening. Millions of women in üá∫üá≤ can't and won't be controlled like their PUPPETS
These people have no idea what our bodies do.
"Sanction every state with a total abortion ban. No federal money, no loans, and no tax breaks for people in states with total bans."
"Yet every right wing seat has purgered!
Oh but pinks don't have laws, only color people."
"Elephant in the womb.

"You voted for Trump, knowing this is what he would do, and now you are mad? Do better white voters!"
"More vasectomies and women getting sterilization, is the result of this Supreme Court decision."
"SCOTUS didn't ban abortions.  They overturned an unconstitutional ruling and reverted the decision back to the States where it belongs.  If you don't like the laws in your State, move to a State that more suits your desire to murder innocent humans."

"Every a-hole is pro-life until their preteen or teen daughter gets pregnant

Unless pro-lifers want to pay child support for every orphan, you might want to let financially burdened parents make their own decisions. This is going to be a ton of kids depending on taxpayers to pay for them till 18"
"A lot of people were eligible to vote, but chose not to in 2016. Hillary Clinton tried to warn us about Trump-appointed judges overturning Roe v Wade.  Maybe these non-voters thought she was ‚Äúbeing hysterical‚Äù...

If you're tired of seeing red, vote BLUE in ‚Äò22!"
I simply don‚Äôt understand why women are allowed to vote in the USA.
These people want to make sure their position is very clear: The lives of women mean nothing to the white men who have control of all laws.

I strongly suggest that Each of you get EVERYONE you know who CAN vote, to GET REGISTERED/*Verify you're Not Purged*, and Exercise Your RIGHT to VOTE if you still CAN.
If *Revoking Women's Reproductive Rights, and Restricting Who's Eligible Votes Won't be Counted* isn't enough of a *wake up call to GO VOTE ALL BLUE* on Ballots, then what is?"
Yes. People realize that murdering babies is evil.
Texas AG shouldn't be fighting emergency abortions.
"Laws need to be clearer so that doctors know what they can and cannot do. Removing a dead fetus should be legal, of course. But banning abortion is still good."
Banning abortion with some exceptions is good policy. Enforce the law as a deterrent to reduce abortions. Keep your legs shut if you don't want a kid.
anyone that is against abortion should have been aborted
VOTE!
Most Arrogant/Irresponsible/Deranged/Delusional Step America has ever taken
Ridiculous that politicians and insurance companies decide on what kind of care we will get.
it's obvious that the majority of Americans prefer blah blah blah than actual social justice for all.
Just call abortion right guns rights
You want abortions? Allow fathers to have a right to deny paying child support. It takes 2 to make a baby but you crazies only want the woman to have a say so. Why should you have 100% say so in killing an unborn child if the father wants that child. That‚Äôs not equality that you clowns scream you want!
"Being forced to have children is more important than gas prices. ‚Äã ‚Äã the traditional birth control that contains estrogen strings the clitoris volume by half. They‚Äôre castrated. Only the mini pills w only progesterone is the one that doesn‚Äôt completely ruins women. ‚Äã ‚Äã. This is not a male issue. the fetus is not viable up to at least week 26, it‚Äôs not killed bc it‚Äôs not live yet, take it out and the tissue has  no possibility in any way with all the money and medical help in the word to survive, it‚Äôs not alive yet, so this is only about controlling females. Women need their clithead rubbed to get off, that does not take more than 5 min or longer than men=sex education, the angle of the dickrod need to rub the clithead while thrusting, that‚Äôs it, we all get off and live happily ever after. I‚Äôm just posting it here cause it‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt know these  basic things in the US. A law just passed forcing all men to have vasectomies, that makes u feel a way, that pain is what women are feeling now. I am an MD."
The GOP is an enemy of the people.
"lol, see the power of inertial mass"
The biggest unintended consequence is that doctors will choose to not go into obstetrics because of the insurance. All of these babies PL is OBSESSED about will not have proper doctors. And women will still get abortions because as long as you can get pills through the mail it‚Äôll continue and you cannot stop it. So all of this and you‚Äôre not saving lives like you think.
"The Republican Party is the Party of ""NO"". Their only Agenda is to defend a fascist criminal, Donald J Trump.  Democrats put people first over party.
It's a no brainer people."
Trump and the horrible justices he seated should be arrested because the agonies that they have initiated against women and their access to healthcare should be considered criminal.
Trump's  SCOTUS made zygotes more important than women. Rapists have more rights.   This is the what Republicans believe. Vote democratic if you want any democracy left
It‚Äôs called life happens!!! Abortion means murder!
"Exactly that is what emergency care is. An emergency is some thing that happens that must be treated or it could result in deformity, lose of lame, permanently damaged health, or death. 
Normally if a woman is pregnant she has an obgyn. If she comes into the ED her doctor would be notified, because that doctor has already been to care for the woman until her child is born. So it wouldn't be some unknown,to the case, ED doctor but her own doctor. So it isn't like some women is just thrown to the wind. Well it might be if the woman wasn't getting pre-natal care, but that is different level of stupid. 
People like the woman in this video who base their argument on hysterical emotionalism are no help to anyone."
"Women, and girls, in the USA are fkd."
The Hippocratic oath is more sacred than that of the Bible
If you didn't see this coming you are truly ignorant. If you are a woman and didn't see this coming you should be ashamed of yourself.
this is fake news. disinformation.
"There's more supporters for access to abortion then there ever were for Benedict Donald.

Let that sink in."
"Too bad you're numbers are no where near what you claim. You will lose, just so you know. Now."

"If you're a young woman in Texas, good luck."
Most voters are morons. It's a terrible idea to put such important policy in the commoner's hands.
"Ben Franklin anonymously published ""The Poor Planter's Physician"" in Virginia in 1727. It was a guide to living in the colonies without aid of doctors to treat a variety of things. In it, there is a section to treat the ""suppression of courses"". Entry states that it was an affliction to mostly unmarried women and included a recipe for a treatment used by the Greeks for contraception and termination. Where are the historians calling out these idiots using the founding against women?"
Leave women alone and neuter these men
And these said people that are going to get voted for who are running for congress Etc what's going to stop them from lying just like the Supreme Court justices?
Just another example of how the GOP crazies hate women. They hate everything that doesn't look like them walk like them talk like them or agree with them. Question I have is who died and made them think they are God? I don't think any of these Bible Thumpers actually read the Bible! What happened to God's free will? And isn't this between me and my judge... god?
Texas should go independent ‚Ä¶ problem solved.
Public Service Announcement: Don't feed the Bots in the comment section.
I am sick of people trying to control women's rights.
"Abortion is health care issue,  if it were not for religious influence we would not be having a debate about it"
"Yall think this will be expensive? Wait till the ""college bailout"" charges hit our wallets."
"Christine = most hateful group 

Hate and discriminate anyone with a different view from theirs.  They use the name of Jesus to hate."
"Irresponsible abortion legislation will lead to the deaths of mothers, the lengthened suffering of terminally underdeveloped infants, increased number of children suffering in the foster care system, and increased crime including murder. Abortion, unlike murder, is nothing but healthy for society and can only be painted as evil by arbitrary moral or religious arguments. I don't really care about personal morals about abortion, mothers should have a right to get an abortion just as much as mothers have a right to not get an abortion. At the end of they day it's the mother who has to live with any sins, society bears no responsibility for her actions."
"Unfortunately, as someone who lives in a country where abortion is illegal, it is very hard to show actual evidence to those people who are fervently against it.
They will celebrate when a woman dies in a backlash abortion, they will demonize her and call her death justice.
And as the many comments showed here: they will deny the examples of women suffering from the repercutiam of these laws, they will say those examples don‚Äôt exist, minimize it and say their suffering is justified.

It is sad how good humans are to demonize and remove the humanity of actual living people. Those things are easy to do when you don‚Äôt view women as humans anymore"
America's really going backwards and so many people are trying to fight forward towards a better future.
We should start suing every politician that has voted for this.
The world is laughing at you..
"Am I glad I don't live in the US, if it turns out that I'm incapable of carrying a baby to full term because I'm too sick, I at least get to live and to adopt and care for all the babies and older children me and my partner want."
It was such an insanely stupid and short-sighted decision to overturn Roe.
"Seperation of church and state, self autonomy and revamp the supreme court..."
"I feel like even women didn‚Äôt really appreciate abortions until now. Based on what I‚Äôve seen on social media and online, this is probably the first bad thing to happen to them collectively in years. They‚Äôve had a nice run and now people are starting to actually think about where all this is getting us. Low birth rates low marriage rates. No one needs a man. So why tf do I care? They aren‚Äôt having babies with guys like me. So why tf do I care?"
Republicans are clownsü§° they just like controlling people
"just saying, there was a reason why we okayed it in the 1970s a time when the nation was (by admission of todays opponents of it) was much more moral and grounded. if even they knew it was something we needed to allow, than why cant we figure it out? we just have to see for ourselves. and this is the problem with people who cant move forward, they forget all the bad things of their glorified past"
This backfired for the Republicans beautifully.
Prohibition will always cause trouble.
I don't know why anyone would listen to this old woman with purple hair.
Both sides are wrong on this. Abortion is not about cleaning a woman's womb after a fetal death. Abortion is killing a fully functional baby in the womb. It is asinine to say it is only the woman's decision.
"I hate abortions, but the fact is, they're necessary.  What we will see happening more and more are, dead or abandoned babies left in boxes, garbage cans, side of the road, and in parks, because people cannot provide for them.  You think the cost of abortions were high, just think of the cost of court cases will be, and the cost of finding homes for these abandoned kids. by the way, God hates those who turn their backs on the needy."
Pro Life people have created a religious tyranny.  They never meant to help women with unwanted pregnancy.  SCOTUS is nothing but a religious extremist court.  All GOP and conservatives that voted for extremists laws banning abortions need to be voted out.
"I think the G.O.P. now stands for something like ""Gruppen ObersterFuhrer Partei"""
It took 8weeks for all this to happen‚Ä¶ I
"For every woman who dies from not be able to get care during a pregnancy where they could die from complications, the governor of Texas and those who banned abortion should all be held accountable and prosecuted for each death."
"there should always be an evidentiary test for any ban or law.  it should be unconstitutional to take away any right without that.  just as assault weapons bans have no basis in evidence to show effectiveness, banning abortion has only emotional arguments; it is utterly stupid to ban either.   there are better solutions for both."
"abortion isnt banned you twits, its just up to the states"
Poor women being forced to have unwanted children is going to lead to a huge increase in the crime rate in red states fifteen years from now.
Kudos to corporations like Walmart that are providing transportation and time off to its employees seeking abortions.
The president this country elected put justices in the supreme court. And now they don't like what they've done? Oopsie!
"She's talking about extremism! ü§£üòÇü§£. These clowns are so unhappy they can't go on killing babies, boo hoo! üò≠ü•∫üò≠. I guess they don't call killing babies extreme; just another sign of the degradation of our country and all the values it holds dear‚Ä¶ I'll bet when their children get married and then get pregnant they don't hold fetus showers; but I wonder why not, after all it's just a clump of cells‚Ä¶ they should hold ‚Äúclump of cells‚Äù parties for the unborn! üòÅüòÜüòÇü§£üòÇüòÅ"

All this because a bunch of delusional cultists have convinced themselves that zygotes are people.
"Im a religiouly conserative person but I dont agree with this at all.  These people are forcing their religious beliefs on others.  I am happy to resectfully explain why someone should not end a life and the biblical reasons for it,  If they dont agree thats up to them and their conscience.  but I dont feel like forcing it on someone without there consent is right at all.   what if the reverse was true,  what if they ban religion because they did not agree with it.  forcing them to be secular, How would these people feel then?  God is our judge, not humans.  Stay out of other peoples lives if they dont want you there."
"Don‚Äôt let these Republicans make you (women) into a ‚ÄúHandmaid‚Äù‚Ä¶.  That is what the Supreme Court see you as (JUST A BABY FACTORY) and not a human‚Ä¶.

REMEMBER REMEMBER NOVEMBER ROEVEMBER!!!"
"Regardless of how you feel about abortion, the bottom line is if you‚Äôre not the one who is pregnant then it‚Äôs none of your business. It‚Äôs that simple. If you‚Äôre against abortion, for what ever reason, then don‚Äôt get a abortion. üá∫üá∏üó≥ Vote in November"
"The government needs to differentiate  between an abortion and a life threatening circumstance. Getting treatment if the mother or baby would 100% die or if the baby is already dead is NOT an abortion, and these lawmakers need to guarantee that right to health care. Other then that specific circumstance, then yes ban all abortion"
"Get out of Texas now, younger women leave while you can."
Vote blue!  Stay safe.
"I can hardly believe how stupid Americans are. Even if I support the ideology, I can't possibly think that the law with no exception is ok. They will rather let their women die then end their pregnancy...if a woman is dead the child in her womb is also dead, makes no sense whatsoever. This is insane situation. No exception to protect the health and life of the women sounds like a dystopian novel coming true."
Pro-lifers who care for the unborn while hating people who breathe.
Crazy religious zealots have caused this ban on abortion to happen. Religion  poisons everything. You have to be really stupid to let religion  guide any decision.
These laws about medical necessity are so vague. Medical practitioners are delaying lifesaving medical care because they don't want to risk going to prison for life. Poor women are disproportionately affected by these laws. This is despicable and there are likely dictatorships that have more sensible abortion policies.
Or why idealism is moronic.
If no one goes out and votes then the right doesn't care. Keep that in mind.
"Republicans will now have to provide. Provide healthcare, provide whatever it takes to raise a child, provide for what the ""father"" refuses to do, provide for the ignorance and disdain Republicans have for their fellow Americans. That's going to take a lot of money states won't have. Republicans really know how to screw up their own country. There's nothing like it you can see in other advanced and industrialized countries. US conservatives are the worst curse that has ever happened to this country."
"SUPREME COURT NEEDS TO PUT BACK ""ROE V WADE""
AND NOT TAKE ANY RULINGS ALREADY DECIDED BY PAST JUSTICES AWAY BY OVERTURNING THEM.
THESE RULINGS WERE FOUGHT FOR AND FAIRLY WON AND THEY SHOULD  NOT BE IN JEOPARDY BASED ON SOME MINORITY GROUP WITH A PERSONAL IDEOLOGY OR POLITICAL AGENDA OF THEIR OWN..

HOW CAN CITIZENS BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE LAWS IF THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER ITS LEGAL OR ILLEGAL BASED ON CONSTANT CHANGE OF IT..."
Its hard for me understand how other women going along with this abortions laws.
Who knows! Next they'll be wanting to bring back coporal punishment in the schools! Oh...
"SCOTUS didn‚Äôt ban abortion, if your state did take it up at the state level.

"""Pro Life"" unless your an actual living woman!!!!!!!"
"America got what it deserved when it put special interests above the people. It's easy to blame Republicans, but Democrats are just as much to blame. Lunatic Trump would have been cast aside like the joke he is if his opponent wasn't Hillary Clinton. This stupid choice doomed the country."
"Remind Republicans of this error years later. 
""Hey. Remember that failed experiment where you banned abortion in red states and it had dumb consequences?"""
"Abortion is a life-altering event that will affect a woman for the rest of her life whether she has one or not. She will have to live the consequences all of her life. I would not want to trust a Politician to make such a decision for me. I am quite capable of making my own decisions, thank you very much. Perhaps the voters need to elect new State Legislators who will accept the advice of a Licensed, Trained Physician rather than some Fascist who wants to take away a woman's right to direct her own life."
There is no reason women should not have power over their body especially how society says men can treat them.
"Abortion is killing a human, alive baby in the womb."
"Republicans are out in force out voting the Democratic Party. We saw this in the primaries where the majority of Trump supporting candidates won. If we want to see a change, Democrats have to get their butts out there and vote. I just don‚Äôt know if they will."
"enough out in the streets to fight maga Civil War.  Lock him up, lock him up."
"Nah, it hasn't even come close to showing the true ramifications of these bans.  Wait about 2-6 years, when all those forced kids are now taking moms out of employment, because they can't find or afford child care.  Wait for the social safety nets to really strain at the seams, for Welfare, SNAP, WIC, subsidized housing, smart start, school free lunch, and health care.  Wait for Ob/Gyns to flee states where bans are in place, and women who WANT to have babies can't find doctors to deliver them.  Wait until those forced birth kids become school age, and everyone's taxes go way up to provide for their education. 

Most of us never wanted to see huge numbers of abortions.  But there are much better ways to fix the problem.  This is nothing but a final failure in a long list of failures."
"The women in federal, state, and local government, as well as the Supreme Court judges that implemented this nonsense, threw half the population under the bus."
"Umm, we already knew what criminalizing abortion does.  It kills women who most often are already mothers, leaves children without their mom and families without a loved one. Have we so quickly forgotten the image of the young mother killed by her married lover when he tried to play surgeon in a motel room and left her to die alone as she bled out. Ms. Magazine published that photo."
Excellent!!!!
"These male lawmakers really haven‚Äôt thought this thru.  Pretty soon some of them will be in a disastrous lose-lose situation.  How long before one of their daughters has a life threatening pregnancy?  It already sounds like a woman has to be in great jeopardy for a hospital to treat her.  If that happens to a law-maker they have two terrible choices.  Run the risk of using your influence to run interference contrary to the laws and risk having the press find out, or having your daughter die.  In the first scenario the daughter will be inundated by the press and all those families who lost their daughters in that circumstance.  In the second she will lose her life.  You can bet in both scenarios that he will be cast out of his family by his wife and all the other women in his life. His political career will be over bc he will either cause a huge firestorm by being a hypocrite, or he will be the guy who let his daughter die.  Chew on that."
"I mean, they'd be about 40 years too late, but isent it about time for all those ammosexual's to put up or shut up?

"The Republicans go on and on about how the democrats are responsible for inflation. (They aren't.)  BUT What's more ""inflationary"" than having a child you didn't plan for and cannot afford? How does that compare to gas being over $4/gallon???"
"maybe how about this...until this all gets settled maybe women for once should stop getting pregnant all the time when they arent planning a family?....you know you can act like an adult,,its not like you cant control just how you spread your legs.."
This is why Bernie Sanders needed to win the election.
"The desire, the will, the goal is to never have a loss of life BEFORE ITS NATURAL FAIT. But reality is that we as humans have not evolved to that point, as yet, and as unfeeling as it may appear abortions come under that category. You have to look at the human condition as a whole. You cannot separate abortions into a different category. Politicians have twisted and used abortion purely as a political tool. The day we evolve and there are no more unnecessary loss of life is the day when we don‚Äôt have to bring laws to stop abortions. That day will happen, but not as yet."
"First off NO UTERUS NO SAY SO, oh yes, secondly thirdly etc."

"Yea but the federal constitution never protected access to abortion, and that's why it was struck down. If people want abortion access protected then they need to lean on their lawmakers to create laws to protect it. This issue is not, and never was, a constitutional matter."
Remember - voters - your vote only counts if you use it.
It‚Äôs just stupidity to punish the doctor or women for having a medical emergency to save her life. This is INHUMAN!!!!!
Please vote Democrat and don‚Äôt abandon the women like me in Louisiana and other states
ALL THOSE PAID PROTESTORS.  NOW I CAN SEE WHERE THE UKRAINE MONEY IS GOING
"Watching this from Europe is just painful. I really hope that people wake up and show those religious bigots the middle finger. And while the backlash lasts, first make sure personal rights get protected by law, and then fix your god-awful voting system."
Mandatory vasectomies.  Stop abortion at the source.
Texas is ran by Bible thumpers.
"Women. Stop sleeping with losers.  You abort when they don't want you and/or the baby.  Use your power, make choices before he dumps on you."
"There are so many children ALREADY in ""the system"" (e.g., foster care) and so many children ALREADY that are in homes where they are unwanted and often abused....it boggles my mind to see how this will be exacerbated. That's who I think of - the children who aren't in homes where they are loved and wanted. I don't think of the people who are pushing their own agenda and telling women, ""I care about you""? Do they really? I'm wondering if they care about anyone but themselves. They're clueless about what's going on in the world around them and most likely have never had to work with an abused or neglected child; it's heart wrenching. Let's ACTUALLY care about each other."

"I was horrified when Roe was over turned.  Abortion won't go away, it will go under ground and women will die, like they did prior to the 1970s.  Women are now suffering because doctors are no longer allowed to logical calls!!  The Supreme Court has made women second class citizens!!"
Banning abortion would create more Maga Republicans so of course the right wants to put a stop to it
"If I was in charge,  I wouldn't have allowed travel for an abortion. Make those people in States with illegal abortion vote the elected officials out. If you elect those people you should have to live by their rules"
Think of all those babies saved.
Shame on all mother effing Republicans!!!
"So much bad information on this video. Do your own research. Abortion is illegal in Texas. Treatment for miscarriages,  ectopic pregnancies are not illegal in Texas. The confusion comes from the doctors."
"I‚Äôd be curious to know what plans are being made to care for all the unwanted babies that will be born next year?
Are the anti-abortion states prepared to house, feed & give the babies medical care for years to come?
No-one seems to be addressing that issue..."
"Technology changed in the blink of an eye
yet her legs are stil up in the sky
while the nurse tells her to 
slide down lower
and the doctor holds his 
vacuum like it's a damned hoover

It takes a seed and his came by the thousands and it's her who they want to send to prison because she's free
but not really and it's her body but not really
so she can't drive and she can't vote and high school's feels like a damned joke
but here she's got a doctor's note,
and she is holding her doll
with her belly starts to poke

it's not your fault, baby girl
and it shouldn't be your burden to carry
when his sentence is to force you to marry
 your abuser and the state
will accuse her
 because it's her body
but not really and it's her right 
Don't be petty
 when his seed comes by the thousand and he still gets to walk freely.

She watches witch burnings on tv
and she hides in the alley not wanting to be seen
a hanger in one hand and a needle in the other
she's not ready to be anyone's mother
and it's her life but not really
it's her body don't be petty
he held her down like so many others
it's his seed one in thousands
Must she die to save her child
who will care for the millions
he walks the street feeling cocky
claims his innocent like it's his destiny

he walks into the office he claims his seat at the table
he lives his life like Cane met Able
it's his seed one in thousands
he feels no shame and no restraint

so who is trapped in this economy
when all the world loves new technology
should she bear society's hypocracy
when it's her body but not really"
America is going in the wrong direction after abortion ban.
Vote blue in November  so we can codify  roe v wade
"As per your headline‚Ä¶. The REAL meaning is that innocent babies will be born and not murdered. In the meantime keep your pants zipped guys, and your legs crossed gals. It has worked for centuries!"
"Understand this, the Bible is a fictional book‚Ä¶FICTIONAL! Everyone has a right to turn to which ever Faith they so choose if they choose to, but it has no place in the rules of modern society. If the Bible was used to make laws a father would be allowed to murder his children if they dishonored him and if his wife cheated on him or disrespected him she could be stoned to death or murdered by her husband. These are not concepts that should be applied to laws and rights of a modern society, not to mention that in this country we have freedom of religion which means that the ideas in the Bible are not the beliefs of the majority of people on this earth, they‚Äôre not even the majority of people in this country. That book of children‚Äôs stories does not mean you get to tell every single woman what she can and cannot do with her body, or allow her to die because you miss read or misinterpreted a fictional story to suit your own needs. If you think that an abortion goes against the teachings of the Bible and goes against God‚Ä¶ then don‚Äôt f@*king get one! That is where your contribution to your faith begins and ends. Keep it in church and not in our hospitals or our courts. Oh every Bible thumper is as bad as every other religious extremist, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre called beliefs because you choose to believe that they have no place in a modern society."
"It's not banning abortion, it's TAKING RIGHTS AWAY, that's what it is, and sensible Americans do not want a political party that is living in the dark ages to be in power."
What ever happened to using ways to prevent pregnancy?WHY are there so many unwanted pregnancy happening?
"Another consequence of the abortion ban is all the unwanted babies who will be born,  and an increase in the number of people on welfare.  And they will mostly be minorities, which the ""pro life"" people hate, so they should have thought this through more clearly."
"So they are banning abortion on a state and federal level but don‚Äôt medical students learn how to perform a DNC in the case of a miscarriage? If the procedure is taught it is for a reason and I‚Äôm going to assume that reason is to preserve vital life‚Ä¶what the federal government needs to concern themselves with is the homeless pandemic, hunger pandemic, gasoline pandemic, social media pandemic, because COVID blew the lid off of the real issues that aren‚Äôt being dealt with and making abortion illegal isn‚Äôt going to solve homelessness, hunger, or any of the other thousands of issues this country has. Banning abortion but doing nothing about the foster care system in place in America‚Ä¶I mean make it make sense!!"
They didn't ban abortion.  The SC made the logical decision that abortion was not in the Constitution and sent it back to the states.
"That 56% number does not say what about abortion will be an important factor.  ""I'll vote for anyone who will promise to make abortion legal"" and ""I will vote for anyone who will make sure abortion keeps being illegal"" both trigger that ""Abortion will be an important factor."" The 56% number means NOTHING."
Map is wrong.
I see this as a problem of Politicians letting their feelings determine their policies.  Religion and state are supposed to be separate right?  So why do we let all these political leaders stand on religious platforms and not call them out on it.  Religious zealotry should be something that makes it harder for you to become a politician not easier.
"Teach your children empathy, folks"
"So what?

Stop killing children.

Is that sinking in yet?"
The Supreme Court is going down the Donald Trump road of crimes. With Trump in office there won't a need for a Supreme Court.
"This has nothing to do with ethics of abortion, never did. This is goverment enforced breeding and mandatory delivery laws, as well as direct assault on people's medical safety regardless of the aspect of pregnancy alone. It's yet another decision over people's lives, actual existing living people. It will hurt wanted pregnancies and the safety of the wanted children and especially mothers way more than it will ever restrict the alleged harm of abortion itself. Once again, America, if you keep telling yourself you are the ""leaders of the free world"", start leading in example and not showing the rest of us the worst case scenario. Alternatively, mandatory vasectomies could be beneficial, in the meantime at least, just an idea since you're making people's medical decision for them now."
"Women of America, you outnumber men - if every women voted for abortion rights, it would be a slam dunk, especially when there is a large number of men who agree. USE YOUR VOTE TO VOTE FOR YOUR RIGHTS !"
"Just stop no one is buying the bs, We know when an abortion is right and when it is wrong. Stop playing games you trying to make it so that everyone can do it for no reason other than ""I don't want too"" "

"Biology is way messier than the average ignorant christian thinks. In their heads, every sperm+egg results in a perfect baby."
"Expontaneaus Miscarriage is not same as abortion. A miscarriage as painful as it is you are not going to bleed to dye in most of the cases. (Thank God, now Drs have to explain why the miscarriage occurs or if was poison)
Abortion is not a woman family planing thing ..but very irresponsable medical options if it is. Abortion is destructive,mutilating, killing,against humanity,.(specie). dreams,future... Etc"
Wonder if Abbot would send along some women wanting or needing abortions with his migrant busses?
"to Samual Flores"" for some reason I am being blocked from responding directly to you. Start with Exodus 22. God ordered the sacrifice of every firstborn male child as well as the firstborn of every clean animal. The firstborn human could be redeemed by replacing the baby with a lamb. Or by the payment of 5 shekels to a priest. That is why Jesus is called the lamb of god because he redeemed the sins of man by his sacrifice. there are a few verses dealing with this. God also said that humans were no better than the beasts of the field, just more arrogant."

For years Republicans have chipped away not only on Abortion rights but also democracy itself. And now you‚Äôre seeing those factors come to fruition effecting America‚Äôs standing as a whole. Hence the US is in decline, it‚Äôs turning into Gilead from the Handmaid‚Äôs Tale."
"Ladies you need to vote these creatures out of existence or they will just keep coming back and you'll have to deal with them again, give the Democrats the numbers they need to put Roe v Wade into law.

Why do Americans  die  when the Republican Talaban is in charge????????????????
Banning abortions is so dangerous‚Ä¶so many things could go wrong
"As someone who saw the abortion stories in the news in the 70s, I'm expecting we will see a lot more stories given social media."
"None of the men involved in passing those laws have mothers, daughters, or wives they love. Clearly. Disgusting"
"As the old saying goes, ""people tend to not appreciate what they have until it's gone""."
It's so stupid.  Women will get abortions.  Abortion in our state is protected by the law in our state.  Women are travelling here to get abortions.  There is more to terminating a pregnancy than an unwanted one.  So many medical reasons.
"the same people who melt down at the thought of government-mandated vaccines and masks that SAVE lives want government-mandated pregnancies, births, and maternal deaths. go figure. seriously, folks--let's teach EMPATHY, especially to republicans."
I don't want to hear any republicans complain about this.
Dark Brandon will abort the republican agenda.
"Anti abortion is a terrific way to make sure the poor get poorer. And the people who are anti abortion are the same people who want to end social security, ssdi, and other means of helping people to thrive. Dictators know that if a population has to struggle to put food on the table, a roof over their head, and clothes on their backs they won't have enough energy to protest the regime that's in power. North Korea is a great example of this."
ROEVEMBER!  VOTE BLUE!
A bunch of baby killers.. REPENT!
"You know who else wants more children? RUSSIA. 

WOMEN SHOULD DO WHATEVER THEY WANT."
you have the right to choose what you want to do with your body but that baby inside you doesn‚Äôt have the right to live cuz the baby can't talk on cam neither protest on the road.
"Republicans on Covid: My body, no vaccine, not mask.
Republicans on abortions: Not your body, not your descision."
This is what happens when you awaken the sleeping Giant The sideline voter
Imagine the irony of the women who supported these laws dying from miscarriages because they can't get medical help.
"I think the reason this is an issue is because people think it's murder.  It's not about women's rights.  There is no consensus on when life begins and those for abortion feel life doesn't begin until the fetus can survive outside the womb.  Those against abortion feel life begins at conception.  You have to resolve that before there is a chance at resolving this whole issue - not that it will really.  But, if there is law that states life doesn't begin until (blank) there will always be this stance."
Well Let‚Äôs HOPE this inspires the democrats !!
Why am I not allowed to post in comments?
"I don't think it's the act of abortion per se, it is the government telling women what they can do and not do with their own bodies."
"Lol, YOU elected these old azz rapists. Eat that pie."
Well the good news is getting dragged into a global war will bring y‚Äôall‚Äôs domestic focus on such nonsense as abortion issue into appropriate priority. I‚Äôm sure the Russia/China/Iran alliance is enjoying the destruction from within the US. Makes their takeover of the Western world so much easier. And they won‚Äôt give a rats a$$ what pronoun you prefer in the encampments either
"I am 78 yrs. old and don't like even thinking about abortion, but it is a woman's private life.  It's a woman's decision to make.  If you don't like abortion, then don't get one.  What others do is none of our business!"
"The Republican politicos that pushed the anti-abortion movement in the first place, never took ""pro-life"" rhetoric all that seriously, as we are seeing: abortion in the US still exists and is available, if you are willing or able to pay for it.   It was all about dividing the working class vote."
All the protesters that know one wants to have children with
"Taking away womens rights and endangering womens and girls lives is NOT democracy or American, THIS IS FASCISM. It must be stopped."
Republicans already lost the November vote with women coming to vote in masses.
"The ""Abortion is murder,"" rhetoric is a red herring. I don't care if the fetus is curing cancer or writing poetry, it doesn't get to use another's body without their permission, in the same way you don't get to take my kidney just because you need one."
"This is what FASCISM LOOKS LIKE. Texas is controlled by FASCIST, the GOP has become a FASCIST DICTATORSHIP CULT & MAGA DOMESTIC TERRORIST."
Abortion is not murder. A fetus is not a person. It's just a blob of cells. A fetus is not worthy of having rights since it's not sentient nor does it have emotions
Extremism is murdering babies.
From the outside - it‚Äôs hard to feel sorry for American women when they vote radical conservative policies! They have a choice! Elections have consequences- how‚Äôs that working for you!
"It's abysmal that rule of law and democracy in the USA have become fragile and vulnerable as they are under attacks by domestic terrorists in the shape and form of the so-called Republican Party. The world is watching the syndromes of the American Experiment degenerating into chaos, anarchy and threats unleashed by Fascist elements against democratic and Federal Government institutions and Public Civil Servants within the USA! The rot and stench of a Republican Party turned Fascist is there for all to see. The Orwellian spectacle is ominous. The world is watching Gibbon's Decline of the West."
None of your business. It's a woman's body her choice period.
It is really about women getting access to reproductive health care. Republicans don't seem to care about health care services. Funny how Republicans are NOT emphasing changing abortion laws.
How did the supreme court get taken over by the American taliban?
GET OUT AND VOTE! Period!
"All baby killers or anyone that facilitates the murder of a baby should get the death penalty.

"Oh now people are seeing what happens when women can‚Äòt abort. People sure don‚Äòt like to remember the past huh. Like, it‚Äòs in textbooks and even on the internet how it was in the early 90‚Äòs for women who had unwanted/dangerous pregnancies."

I don‚Äôt understand why there even needs to be a law for or against abortion. It‚Äôs a medical decision that a person and their doctor make and under HIPPA they have the right to keep that private. It‚Äôs no one else‚Äôs business period.
"Can we sell Texas to Mexico, then they wouldn't have to waste money on a wall!!!!!!!!!!"
"Unfortunately there is a population shortage crisis happening. This could be the government's decision to grow the population. Unfortunately I've always been against abortion , thats my moral decision. I understand emergencies, also believe women can choose what they want done within their bodies. God will decide in the end who to address."
Well at least we can sell our nuclear codes to Russia! That's really all that matters. Who cares about women when we can sell our nations security?
Maga Reps: Vote for us and you will never have to choose again.
"The states that have banned abortion and made draconian laws have made it very risky for any OB/GYN to practice in their state. When women on either side of this issue are no longer able to find a doctor willing to manage their pregnancy, it will be too late. OB/GYN's will have moved to a safer state for them to practice and no political posturing, rhetoric or finger pointing will change the fact that their state is no longer a safe place to live for women and girls of childbearing age. Which I feel they've already done. Politicians have zero business making medical decisions or imposing religious beliefs on the citizens of their state."
"Let¬¥s hope the logic and intelligent people understand to vote out the Republicans everywhere. There is nothing more damaging for a country than to have a Trump as President. He brings (un-understandable fear) among his party members. He makes them behave like headless puppies. Like Hitler, he has the power to blind the least gifted and poorest among the people. He has created his own SS. The Oath keepers are his troop's leaders. When Trump lies that the election was stolen, they believe him and storm the Capitol, end of story! Trump has tried to destroy Democracy in so many ways. Send him to jail today, use the document story if needed! But for me, his talk after losing the election, and before the storming of the Capitol, is in its self-evidence enough to put this Dev** behind bars until he dies."
"as a canadian, the rest of the world is losing all respect for the united states"
Imagine if the government stepped in and decided what men can and can‚Äôt do with their reproductive organs...
Long live babies!
This is a consequence of religion...

"Women have had control over their bodies FOR MILLENNIA. We don't need Roe or any man's laws. We will control our own reproduction, regardless. Abortion will continue because women's lives depend on it. Don't like it? TS"
Women go vote blue save your uterus
"Abortion is murder, and murder is bad."
"What's next? Will they find a loophole to eliminate our right to vote?  Are women going to lose the right to own property?  Will we once again become enslaved to others?  These are all legitimate questions. I am willing to die to prevent this from ever happening again. I only wish there are others willing to stand with me. It's time to fight for our rights, before they take them all away."
Give us back our right to choose.
Never forget that the Democrats want to murder babies -- even after birth.  They've said so.  Remember that extremism when you go to the ballot box.
"Some people care, but most of the Republicans don't give an f about anyone but themselves,  and only know suffering when it effects them personally."
Funny how I‚Äôm being censored on here a bunch of baby killers
Babies live!
"Americans rave on about being active in fighting for their rights and how politically aware they are but that is all BS. They don‚Äôt have a clue. While they vote Republican their rights will reduce. If you want more rights, vote in Democrats into every post. Stop banning and burning books. Stop using GodFilla to fill holes in your knowledge. Check your beliefs, your word definitions, and demand proof of whatever people claim to be facts. If you had checked Trump‚Äôs claims, you would have found nearly all of it was BS."
We need to rise up and get rid of the fascists in our government who are out here making insane decisions. Replace the entire house and senate
"Remove them from Office, no more! I'm sick of this obscurantism."
"Women want to roll the dice as many times as they like without ever losing and want patted on the back when they are finally satisfied.....you don't deserve a pat on the back, what you deserve google won't allow me to say.....it's very similar to what those babies you like to call ""mistakes"" experienced, difference is, you will have earned it."
They will never starve they will eat  each other.
Smart people will not risk a pregnancy. Republicans you have stop population growth in America.
"Baby killers take all the respect or reverence away from ""good mothers""."
"So, I just have one question. How come you all make this about the woman's right to choose to end the pregnancy or not, then these same people turn around and say that you have no choice whether or not to take a vaccine or not? Take the shot and shut up, if you don't you are shamed and ridiculed for making the obvious and right decision."
I didn't realise the GOP took their public health policy from the Taliban...
Doctors need to stop providing medical services to Republican elected officials
Republicans are the bane of humanity
Too bad they weren‚Äôt aborted.. so ironic.
Roe roe roe your vote blue..... No republican vote until they understand who is in command... We the people....!!
Pro-Choice is the only choice in the US. The Democrats are the real Pro-Choice Party. Vote Blue in 2022.
"Dropping Roe was literally the worst thing Republicans could have done, and now they're trying to bring back assaulting children in schools with bats.  Way to really fire up your opponents ya morons."
What makes the people banning abortion any different than serial killers whose motives is because they hate women and want to remove as many people as possible from voting?
"Just ignore all those ignorant people who believe a fetus is a baby. 10 week old fetus is only 1-3 centimeters long, call that a baby again lol. Put that fetus in someone's food and they won't even notice it."
"They want to ""protect all life"" so they will let the women die. Forced birth is NOT protecting Life. These laws must be changed and given back to the doctors and the women involved. This GOP insanity must end before more women, girls or even ten year old children die. Criminalizing pregnancy is NOT ""protecting life."" What is wrong with these people who voted to do this?"
The GOP is a cult enough said!!!
Well its hard to see or hear  the people who got aborted...
No bans on AR15s or abortions.
"The desire, the will, the goal is to never have another abortion. The same goes for any other loss of life. BUT, we don‚Äôt live in a perfect world and death occurs all around us. Therefore abortions are required. The same as executions and wars are required. You cannot have it both ways. To pick on women this way is wrong when THE FAULT LIES WITH ALL OF US IN THIS IIMPERFECT WORLD."
One dumb country üôÑ
Vote BLUE problem solved
This is why you commentators will never know power.
"Ironically it will be conservative women who will ultimately return us to some level of sanity with regard to abortion and bodily autonomy, bit by the predictable consequences of their own rhetoric. It's already happening."
Well then men should not be allowed to be treated for  prostate cancer or erectile dysfunctions.
‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self evident‚Ä¶.‚Äù Except for defenseless unborns.
Vote vote vote for life not the insane
"This is mid evil torture to have lawmakers change laws when we the people are going to work and are paying taxes. Stop trying to get us to believe in a fake false Illusion. This is absolutely absurd and barbaric to deny tax payer their rights is disgraceful distasteful, unconstitutional, inhumane and unacceptable."
There is no changing the Supreme Court's mind. A crisis situation is a very small percentage of abortions. North Carolina will be put in its place.  She is lying through her teeth and he doesn't care.
We need to be vigilant in everything. There not gonna stop there. They‚Äôre gonna strip people from every facet of their rights while still calling this country the greatest country where your free and have opportunities. I wonder when we‚Äôll decide to just say enough is enough. They‚Äôre pushing and pushing and eventually everything is going to go belly up at some point. Control seems to be the objective. There are too many laws within bylaws to even keep up with that I‚Äôm sure people are breaking them without even knowing.
You can aways see the baby murders in politics.  Just listen to this old bag
"Remember that when there is a new law put to a vote that limits your right,  and when  others don't like or feel the need for that right they'll vote against you. And pretty soon everyone is going to loose their freedom. Really think it throu ‚úåÔ∏è"
"Just like when they tried to ban alcohol, Prohibition!"
Come to California and we will happily get rid of your bad choices. You can take monkey pox back for free.
The Republican leaders don‚Äôt care how many women and girls they hurt or take the lives of with this. They need to be voted out.
Religion should play no part in politics. It does nothing but cause harm. Religious people should never push their religion on other people. What about those women that don't believe in your god? Why should they not get to choose?
"How effing political for the liberal media to leave out the following:

Embryo - an unborn or unhatched offspring in the process of development, in particular a human offspring during the period from approximately the second to the eighth week after fertilization (after which it is usually termed a fetus).

Fetus - an offspring of a human or other mammal in the stages of prenatal development that follow the embryo stage (in humans taken as beginning eight weeks after conception)."
"Indiana didn't get a chance to vote.  Our supposed lawmakers voted for us.  At least they had the grace not to claim it was the will of the people.  They know that if they had given the voters choice, it would have been another Kansas, or even a greater margin for freedom of choice.  I woulod tell you what I think of our lawmakers, but YouTube would block the comment."
"Didn't GOD destroy Sodom and Gomora according to christians. How many innocent fetuses died in that little operation? In fact if you believe that event then what about the flood, how many innocent fetus's died in that ""world event"". GOD wasn't worried too much about that, was he ...??? I can start hearing the double standards or host of other weird logic ready to burst."

"Better wake up White Republican Women! You sat quietly while your men has  screwed over every one else! Now it's your turn! How does it feel? He wants you bare foot and pregnant with a house full of kids, so he can feel Superior and not become a minority in this country!!"
Anti-abortionists always wanted people to die.
Funny the ones screaming loudest about abortion are the ones least likely to get pregnant
NO UTERUS = NO OPINION
Crusty old white men who know absolutely NOTHING about a. Being a woman. B. Being pregnant. C. Giving birth. D. Caring for a child. Yet these crusty old dinosaurs are making LAWS on ALL these issues which they know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT. Absolutely mind boggling.
It's going to require a Constitutional Amendment to set this straight once and for all.
"The Republicans are about to reap the Whirlwind, serves them right"
"Ban viagra, also"
I never thought we would see Taliban Mentality take a hold of the Largest Democratic Nation in the world. America is no longer a democracy. Old White Republican Males will have women in Burkhas next. Christians and Wealthy people are self centred people.
These people make it sound that EVERY woman that gets pregnant will want to abort it and if their state bans Abortion. Maybe they should be looking at less invasive forms of contraception than ripping a baby from their womb because they couldn‚Äôt control their sexuality
"We are going to see increasing instances of girls and women dying from pregnancy complications because doctors and health care systems in general are too afraid of or too hamstrung by anti-abortion laws to provide timely care.
You know, just like we did before Roe V. Wade's decision. We have completely forgotten the horrible things that just suddenly didn't happen anymore once the decision to terminate a pregnancy became the domain of the pregnant person and their team of medical professionals."
"A dead corpse has more rights. 
You can not use any parts of the body of a newly deceased corpse, to help another person stay alive, without strict legal permission - given pre-death ""organ donor permission"" - from that now dead corpse.
So a dead corpse has more say over what happens to their body, then a women does."
Pregnant women need to move out of state until they give birth or they might die.  Even cats die giving birth.   It is not simple.  Men are stupid idiots.   Women need to be in office to protect pregnant women from death.
Give it time. Republicans will start blaming Democrats for not stopping them when they (Republicans) started stripping rights away. They will never accept responsibility for their bad decisions.
"These laws these abortion laws and the penalties are unreasonable unwanted and unconstitutional to even be on the books they should immediately be expunged never to be repeated again and automatically we ought to put roe v Wade back into effect and make it a law proactively 
The supreme Court is fixed it is a primarily conservative supreme Court and that's not fair and I think that rovie wage will be overturned in time but I'm I'm really starting to think that these Republicans need to be taken out of office and never be allowed to go back in"
This is why the fascists don't want us voting. When we vote we negate their agenda.
Women need to change this in November! Do they have power or not? Let's see if they listen to old white men or if they call their own shots.
Okay you can still get abortions it's up to your state okay nobody is going to ban abortions it's just they're saying you can't have an abortion when the baby is fully developed and if you think that's okay then you were inhuman
The USA is a nation of religious violence. No wonder Christian USA created Islamic fascism. They are one and the same.
Lives to be lost that will never be conceived because getting pregnant is too scary now
Some extreme legislators what to impose travel bands on their citizens trying to control what their citizens may do in other states.  Insanity.
"I love all the comments about ‚ÄúVOTE‚Äù or ‚Äúvote blue‚Äù etc‚Ä¶ good luck with that!
No amount of voting blue will change the discourse in the US, it won‚Äôt get the church out of your life or out of your body.
Not when there‚Äôs political hay to be made by subjecting the masses to such inhuman conditions. 
If only there was some other option besides R or D but it‚Äôs a 2 party system‚Ä¶ both full to the brim with people that are the same age, old, the same color and basically the same insane views. Here‚Äôs a shocker for ya‚Ä¶ none of them care about you at all, at most you are simply a vote in their eyes.
Can‚Äôt we all just enjoy the descent into decline?"
im glad i live in the uk where for now sanity prevails and abortion is easily attained
"If 1 shoots and kills a pregnant woman, double murder. Even if she had an abortion scheduled for later that day.  Sup with that?"
"yes, their androgynous god Moloch is displeased and demands the infant sacrifices continue"
"Register and vote, ladies. Register and vote, vote, vote. FANTASTIC that women will be the ones who finally squash the arrogant, overreaching, authoritarian GOP."
It seems that the Texas Taliban cares more about their ideology than women's lives.
"Keep in mind that this is about power. Keeping women pregnant when they are not doing well, or don't want to be pregnant should be up to her. Vote. Vote for women's rights."
Our abortion is more liberal than China or Europe. You talk about abortion like it's some walk in the park.  It's a mom sitting in a bed with strangers that come in and remove a baby. Now people are fine with doing it late term? Or after.. I see society just wants conveniences rather than morality. The fear of God is no longer in style. It's selfish society that terms their own rules. What's next.  Msnbc you are so wreched. God will and is protecting these children. He has stepped in bc he heard the blood that is crying out for justice. Moms that have abortions don't walk out and have an ice cream afterwards.. if they do then their conscience is seared
"I was born in Soviet Union. USA is quickly becoming like Soviet Union. There was provision is criminal code, due to which non-traditional sexual orientation was punishable by 5 years in prison. I had been arrested there for being Autistic. USA is getting there. When it does, I will leave. I do not need another Soviet Union experience. Those republicans that shame communists ARE communists."
Should be banned. Killing babies is not a good thing. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY is a good thing.
"Surely every thinking human being is anti abortion.
no young woman or their mother ever sets a goal to have x number of abortions 
by the age of 30."
I find it ironic those who support Abortion are already born .
women will vote republicans out  Roman Emperors each and every one
"America are always shouting about free speech, free Will, a Women should be able to do whatever she wants with her body, I mean this is going mental, their are over 100 genders(supposed) now, the world has gone mad, I'm just happy in ma wee house in beautiful Scotland üëçüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†ÅøüçÄ"

Ooh Jesus. Look at all those baby killers
"January 6 the supreme court.. why not, you'll be patriots according to GOPers."
I agree it should be your choice to opt out of pregnancy whether it's for personal reasons or medical reasons....your life not mine who am I to judge. I can only make my own choices not others but I dont get that option because I'm a male whose opinion doesn't count just like every male in this debate because ladies made it clear its THIER BODY the only thing I can do is make sure my DNA stays in my body lest someone besides myself uses it against me
One good thing about Trump is that he exposed how stupid the Republican party really is.
"Judges made it dangerous to get pregnant or be pregnant!! Good way to slow population growth then destroy Social Security because less people paying towards it. I see that shell game !! They also harmed/destroyed Privacy Rights, doctors oath and safe practices, HIPPA law, besides destroying Constitutional Rights and Women's Rights...all in  one judgement call by rogue Judges builds Authoritarian culture and also races a 2 party system towards anarchy. They all need to be charged treason and obstructing our Constitution."
Things could happen...get rid of those Judges  now! Lock them up for harming women!! They LOST credibility. They are dangerous and biased and merging religious belief and destroying Rights. Can't wait until they decide to destroy more Rights.
"It's not to early to get stickers, yard signs, and t-shirts for November that read: ROE ROE ROE YOUR VOTE.  Get that message out in every community,"
We need to execute all these right wing terrorists trying to destroy the country.
All that is forced into having the baby should just give it to the state once the state gets the thousands of babies they will figure out it's to expensive to raise these kids until they are 18 then they may change their minds
"As Meidas Touch T-shirts say, ""Roe, Roe, Roe your vote!"""
"Abortion is just the present day Prohibition, pushed by religious people to try to make society better and more ‚Äúmoral‚Äù. What they don‚Äôt seem to realize is that it will play out exactly like Prohibition. People going to jail, being killed, cartels that control the product will rise and thrive, everything except actually getting rid of the product they are seeking to ban."
"If Texas were to jail all the doctors and women that they want to jail, it wouldn't work too well.  For varied reasons."
It‚Äôs not just about abortion. It‚Äôs personal freedom without Big Brother intervening.
"Theres a procedure that is used post abortion but also stops bleeding. Dr will let u bleed bc they fear the procedure being reported as an abortion. That means sepsis, death, or blood need. Banning birth control also is an issue. Ppl use b. control as a meds to cut pain due to other Med cond."
We particularly don‚Äôt want old saggy white men telling us how to run our personal health rights.
"Meanwhile, in the country that officially hates women.... üôÉ"
That's good no more murder of babies
It means whores are out in droves...

So the children of God is among this woman that is absolutely madness
"What it really Means is, far less Babies being Murdered by their Mothers! End of Story"
Don‚Äôt forget to sign the Petition to impeach Clarence Thomas!!
When all this happened I really didn't have any input one way or another! I could have never conceived the notion this could effect me or my love ones. I have a young family member who is married and they were trying to conceive.They did and we as a family were elated! They were 14 weeks and went for a ultrasound and they couldn't find the baby's heartbeat. They ran all types of test and imaging. Ultimately they had a  miscarriage. It's been two weeks and the doctors are trying to figure out how to proceed because the process of removing or anything is treading on the lines of abortion. I don't understand how because there is no longer a heartbeat. Why should a woman have to be subjected to the mental anguish of this situation? How do you move forward? I'm really confused on who this helps? One size does not fit all!
"I'm pro life and choice, but you need to know your choice, you child will likely be 'named', if aborted their spirits live on and are likely to spiritually and typically sexually enslaved by people running the clinics, and people running Msnbnbc, ze Vanderbourgh üò≠"
"If you don‚Äôt believe in abortion, then don‚Äôt have one. Do not dictate to me what I can or can‚Äôt do with my body.I will deal with my soul on my own."
"If people were not getting abortions 'just because' I doubt this ban would have happened. Imo this is a reset. No abortion and then slowly lift restrictions so that we all agree on when its acceptable. Saw a woman post a video a year ago about her being 7 months pregnant, her bf left her, so she nonchalantly was going to get an abortion and start over with someone that wants to stay with them.

Why not just save up the carcasses of the entities that are removed from women and pile them up in a public area. Just leave them all out in the sun to rot. Let the pile grow and then if anyone wants an abortion they need to go and see that pile and sign off that they are OK tossing their own lump of cells onto it."
"Pure propaganda democrats... what about inflation, the illegals, what is democrats plan for that! Trump 2024"
When the Democratic party hangs it's hat on abortion --killing your own for convenience - that is sick to see us fall this far ..
"A so-called principle of right to ""life"" for a foetus should never be upheld and enforced over the rights and desires of human beings who are real living. beings.   Since this has happened, women are made slaves or otherwise held captive to their wombs.  The whole issue is so clearly religious.   Church and state should be separate.  I don't transgress your boundaries by insisting you abide by my religious beliefs.  You don't transgress my boundaries by insisting I abide by your religious beliefs  This is how we agree to disagree and still get along in society.  We agree not to turn our religious beliefs into political issues."
"I would love it if someone conducted a research survey on who and how many ‚Äòobjectors‚Äô have had abortions in their families. This is the same with religious zealots, they spew God and violate every religious doctrine when it suites them. The hypocrisy is dripping from these people."
Over turning roe v wade shows the American people which party is really trying to take our rights and freedoms.
Oh look! Sexual promiscuity has checks and balances now for women the same way family court checked deadbeat dads. Live with your decisions unless it is from sexual abuse
"If you are a republican woman you should stay silent if you are angry about this for obvious reasons. 
To the rest of women when it comes to abortion‚Ä¶welcome to equality. Men had no choice financially even if he did not want the child. 
Women now have to live with their sexual promiscuity.
Sounds like equal treatment to me"
"People should wait until they get married and have a home established.   Then have children. This would solve many problems.  I can understand what some of the comments below are saying.  People would like to be loved and not feel alone in the bedroom.  They want to end the suffering. Condoms and birth control pills are the thing now.   

It really fires me up when I see Democrats using this abortion ruling by the U.S. Supreme court as a tool to attack Republicans so they can win in the 2022 midterm election.  I believe Chief Justice John Roberts has a hand in this.  I think Democrats got a hold of John Roberts and got him to put the abortion up for a vote.  Then when the other 5 republican judges voted for it.  John Roberts voted against it and said, "" It is not my fault because I voted against it'.   Even though it was John Roberts that put it up for a vote."

"Only person who should have any kind of say on a womans abortion, is her husband. But he can‚Äôt have veto power. Just ‚Äúhey, can we talk?‚Äù Power."
Dear Dimwits. Don't blame the Supreme Court for something they should not have been involved in to start with. Go to the State Legislatures if you want change. BUT FIRST DECIDE WHAT THE LAW SHOULD BE! It's difficult to accomplish when you aren't sure what you want.
This is so wrong I mean these poor transwomen have lost access to safe and secure abortions

"So giving states the power to allow people to choose is wrong. For over 40 years people didn‚Äôt have a choice. These democrats lie and inflate the numbers to scare people. Why do democrats want so much control over children? Abortion,schools,and raising of them."
"Yes, people are seeing what it means to ban abortion. It means: MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS. IT MEANS ABORTION IS NOT BIRTH CONTROL, AND IT MEANS MORE HUMANS ( ESPECIALLY BLACK BABIES) CAN LIVE."
this is a reason why religion should have no place in court decisions and even political arenas especially since texas and a few other states abortion ban laws pretty much proves our point on how far they can go by trying to shove their religion down peoples throats especially wen it comes to trying to control a womens body.
Looks like your tying to make people think there are masses of people but it‚Äôs a small percentage
It‚Äôs funny how you spread false information
"No, we are seeing just how much they want to MURDER FULL TERM BABIES!"
Put every wanted child on the steps of the Supreme Court.
"The outro says it all, ""this is who we are"" baby killers"
"If you see what these republicans did to ban abortion it created so many more problems and now laws. They should‚Äôve just leave it alone and let people make their own choices, these republicans created a problem for women‚Äôs rights and choices that didn‚Äôt need to be addressed"
"So, everyone needs to take note of this. This one issue should let ALL AMERICANS know that the Republicans want nothing more than to become DICTATORS if they come in to power in the future!!"
This is straight up an attack on women
Look leftists think SCOTUS is radical republicans think and has proven the FBI is biased and favors the left.

"Ladies, don't date Republicans,  they don't want you to make your own reproductive choices."
"If a woman get into any legal trouble because she‚Äôs getting or got an abortion, the the man who got her pregnant needs to face the same persecution.  She didn‚Äôt do this to herself and we all know how babies are made. 
Then again, the majority of these laws were passed by male officials. They would probably never think to to that.  Would probably never think a man should get in trouble for having a good time."
"My personal belief is that so much more could be done if we stopped saying ""abortion rights"" and actually call it what it really is; women's rights!"
"Is having our breasts removed due to cancer, also illegal?  They are part of our reproductive anatomy."
This bias anchor needs to be fired. How can his opinion of being better off before allowed to be on here.  Propaganda fake news
"Continue protesting, but OBEY THE LAW . Great job SCOTUS.  Thanks again RBG for sticking around long enough allowing this to happen. Your legacy will LIVE ON !!!!!!"
I don't like the republican vision for America.
"i like the ""NO CHOICE NO CHILDREN"". this would be worse than abortion if it came to play.  stupid law and justice would have real problem on their dirty hands. PEACE."
"Frankly, this is a good side effect of Roe v. Wade being overturned. Even RBG wanted this to happen--the voters will have to mobilize to protect their right to abortion and not depend on some unelected judges staying alive until they're replaced by similar-minded substitutes. That's a ridiculous way to preserve what ought to be a constitutional right. Now momentum will build over the next five years for the right to abortion to be enshrined in federal law passed by the U.S. Congress. Lots of work ahead, especially with mobilizing the huge pro-choice voter bloc. The best part, the anti-abortion forces now have to defend their radical, fringe notions at the ballot boxes. And it's not looking too hot for them outside the Deep South."
Voters need to vote out all these politicians and lawmakers that supported removing women's rights to have abortions and vote for lawmakers that support abortion
All this nonsense because the white Supremacist want to keep the white majority!
VOTE BLUE!!! Because we want our Freedom to Choose BACK!!!
Amazing how y'all ignore Hunter's laptop and Sleepy Joe's illegal business partners from Russia and China!
"""Reproductive rights""  is that the opposite of ""Production wrongs"" ???"
Somebody should tell some of these women that there are forms of birth control rather than abortion !
Let those who have an abortion experience the pain that baby in the womb goes through. Watch what is done to that baby.
"If you have to watch people actually suffer at the cost of your belief system, your belief system failed and you should no longer be affiliated with it."
"You baby killers and supporters have no right to point your fingers at anyone, criminal, murderer, rapists, nobody. Your the lowest of the low."
Been murdering kids for the last 50 years in the millions upon millions and now they are exposed and want to keep doing it. smh
Hopefully more republicans daughters and wives will die because of abortion banning. KARMA
"I really effin wish that so many people weren't so keen on the ""FO"" part of ""FAFO"". How can one rationalize letting one human die of sepsis because they were all for criminalizing a medical procedure? How can one make excuses for tormenting people with uteruses just because of ONE of the many after effects of sexual activity? 
And I bet, dollars to donuts,  just like the height of the Covid pandemic, there will still be yahoos clinging to the flag and their Bibles to soothe that ever encroaching feeling of desperation because their mother or sister or auntie or any other family member died because they couldn't access an abortion and didn't have the finances to travel to another state for one.
This is a human crisis."
I hope women (and the men who support them on this issue) really flex their political muscles and vote in force in the midterms so hopefully we can get the Women's Health Protection Act passed to insure a woman's reproductive rights NATIONWIDE. VOTE ALL BLUE IN '22!!! You go girl!
The land of the free. REALLY?
"Take away all your human rights starting from Banning Abortion! Maga ultimate goal is a white christian nationalist (KKK)Church Run Slavery system! Women, Minorities, and children are properties of KKK! Banning abortion so white men can make any women reproduce like life stock animals !"
All through history anything the government touches falls apart: housing railroads industry schools infrastructure farms natural resources health care etc etc the list goes on. Now people! Just let us all do what we do best. And you guys? Well I don‚Äôt know what you really do. Go somewhere and sleep I guess would be safe.
I‚Äôm a British man and what is being done to women‚Äôs rights in America disgusts me. If I could I would be voting blue with you.
"Don't try to stop the scum of the earth from killing their babies. CNN IS THE MOUTH PIECE FOR THE DEPRAVED.

"If this doesn't start it, I don't know what will"
This is why Supreme Court anywhere can¬¥t or allowed to be political or interfere with politics.
Roevember will hopefully be one to remember.
"Did the GOP have a meeting and say, ""How can we guarantee we lose the next election?"""
"All ""pro-lifers"" should have been aborted. The world would be a much better place.."
"Even if you are firmly and immovably Republican, tell you representative that you don‚Äôt want womens rights stripped away.
If you can‚Äôt do that, you are a horrible person and your god will judge you for every woman who dies from a failed pregnancy."
Again abortion isn‚Äôt banned just left up to the states as the 10th amendment clearly allows ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èGod how people can‚Äôt accept this and just vote people out who don‚Äôt support abortion is beyond me.
It means some innocent babies won‚Äôt be killed by some doctor who makes money off of killing babies
"oh poor satanic baby killers, dont want a baby, use birth control, better yet keep those legs closed"
"If these states are forcing women to have children, can the women sue the to state for the medical and care of the child until they‚Äôre adults?"

"That's a mere drop in the bucket.

"Republican,women think it doesn't affect them,but they just wait and see,unless their rich."
"A comedian named Hofstetter once said ""There was a time that widows weren't allowed to get married. Then one day, a really hot woman's husband died. The everyone was like 'this is a stupid law'"". The only time politicians care is when it happens to them. George Carlin also commented on this saying ""It's a big club, and you and I are not in it. They don't care about you. At all. At all. At all. At all"". According to the DSM5, one of the hallmarks of sociopathy is that a person doesn't care who they hurt or how badly, so long as they get what they want, and history has shown sociopaths make great cult leaders, as shown by Manson. The Oracle in Matrix 1 also commented by saying ""What do men with power want? More power"". Sun Tzu predicted this also. When you back an enemy into a corner, it fights hard and recklessly, for it knows its at death's door.

Also I encourage you to look into the college prison experiment. It was ended after just days when the guards got too violent with the inmates. They were classmates doing an experiment on themselves!


So what do we do? Keep pushing. This tyranny is about to break. It won't go peacefully so be ready for that. But talking, marches, Tweeting, these will not work. No tyrant in human history has ever, ever gone quietly. Yes, voting is the least you can do, but in times of life and death, do EVERYTHING you can do."
"The longer I've lived the more weird and twisted I see USA. WTF does anyone has to say in women own body!? Crazy, crazy..."
"Republicans pretend to care about kids but also don't care when they get shot in a school, can't afford food, or are abused by one of their catholic priests. 

Conservatives are hypocrites and liars, and it isn't difficult to prove it."
"Maybe Greg Adams was correct , why all the illegal immigration ? Because they have babies, lots of babies. The government is all about that."
99 years for abortion?  Meanwhile you could murder several people and not serve 99 years.
Keep the government out of people‚Äôs personal decisions.
Pregnant women in Texas are being hunted like animals.
See who is extreme  and vote them out!
What madness.
So if you're trying to say that you can have an abortion all the way up to the ninth month you're all sick and need serious help.
"Vote blue! Get rid of Abbott,  get rid of his cronies! Vote!"
"Why are Americans moving backward? 
The rest of the world looks at America and we see stupidity, bigotry, racism and truly uneducated and horrible people!"
republicans have sealed their fate. the blue wave is coming
Giving states power back is not extreme.  It would be more viable to argue the opposite.   She dumb.
"It's not really about Abortion.  It's about Freedom, Privacy, and Choice.  How can the government tell an American citizen what they can or cannot do with their own body?  In this case the Women of America! That's unconstitutional, and Un-American."
Using the word ‚Äúextremism‚Äù does not help. Life begins at conception. Period!
"There are forms of birth control and the majority of women (and all low income women) can get them for free.  They need to use birth control, abortion is not a form of birth control."
Something to think about pregnant lady gets murdered they go for a double murder charge? If it's just a clump of cells why double murder?
"I don‚Äôt think ppl who voted for banning abortions care. Too many of them aren‚Äôt impacted by it. Too many men don‚Äôt care how the women in their lives are impacted by this, and they‚Äôre not informed on women‚Äôs health issues."
"Dead women and children giving birth is the desired effects of these bans. The goal is, and has always been, for more white christian babies.
Christian nationalism is quite an old term. Anerican nazi sympathizers and Klansmen used the term proudly."
As A Canadian I find this unthinkable that the government can decide what I think. I am so glad to live in a truly free country in Canada.
Roe Wade never banned abortions..... it's now up to each state to decide what their abortion laws will be..... so this channel is basically lying to the uninformed
Maybe we need to put a personhood amendment for women. As in you are fully vested in the same personhood as men and therefore have the same right to bodily autonomy
Don't Murder Your Children.
How 'bout people keep their legs closed instead of creating babies just to kull them?
.... Woman have a choice... and it doesn't involve murder. pretty simple really.
The only  pregnant woman a man should be concerned about is his own.
Imagine a man that thinks another man's wifes body and her  health is their business. Men should not even have a say in this.
"This matter was settled decades ago. The USA has bigger problems, like preventing mass murder. It is mental health, the very stupid continue to try to bring us back to a time that never existed."
The Founders never put abortion in the Constitution: abortion has never been a Constitutionally-protected right! Why would the Founders have wanted to violate the rights of the unborn by allowing them to be murdered inside the womb?
"I find it interesting that the Republicans/Christians are die hard supporters of Israel, a country that provides 40,000 abortions annually. We provide aid to Israel, they have Healthcare. Question is why do republicans deny their own citizens?"
"I don‚Äôt want to pay your loans or for abortions. Your not gonna pay your loan, don‚Äôt take it.  Abortion: outlaw this inhumane practice. Narcissism run amuck."
It's not a ban it's the right of states to legislate a ban.  If you don't like it elect someone else who you favor.
"How about the politicians focus on the terrostic threats caused by Trump and clean up that mess? How about focusing on worrying about our national security How about climate control? Things that affect ALL citizens, themselves as well and quit trying to take women's rights away, banning books, deamening the LGBTQ community etc. None if that affects them, except maybe on the next election. Let's hope. We can turn this mess around with the right people in office. Vote Blue in 2022 and 2024. That's our only hope  otherwise welcome to communism!"
"Thank you for everything you do, Ms. Nancy. I love you. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"America is becoming South America, with it's harsh abortion laws, that ironically ranks among those with the highest estimated frequency of abortions administered. Abortions will happen, laws do NOT reduce abortion."
"No question
Wait until the "" important women"" are not able to get their abortions or become septic.."
Why do Americans have to put their hands in the fire to see if its hot.
Sad üòû NOOOOO LADYS U CAN NOT MURDER YOUR OWN BABYS ANYMORE!!! HALLELUJAH PRAISE JESUS
Not to the Christian taliban who want to control women.
That Roe was not codified is a failure of leadership. I'm a one issue voter and I ditched my Gop in Washington State in favor of the Candidate who was pro choice.
As far as I am concerned wherever women have voted Republican they must own the consequences of their vote!!!
"Complete idiocy! American legislators have not learned about history! They just need to look at the 18th amendment to the constitution created basically 100 years ago, only to be repealed about 25 years later!
Now they have the same crazy ideology in dictating women what they have to carry for the next nine months and raise for the rest of their lives based on a religious belief, just like way-back-when, even though the first amendment clearly states: 
*Congress **_shall_** make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.*
My grievance to the Government right now is their imposing on, and suppression of, the freedom of choice for women to do what they feel is right for them at the time.

_Murdock v. Pennsylvania (1943)_ *Plainly, a community may not suppress, or the state tax, the dissemination of views because they are unpopular, annoying or distasteful. If that device were ever sanctioned, there would have been forged a ready instrument for the suppression of the faith which any minority cherishes but which does not happen to be in favor. That would be a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.*

Today, people ‚Äî both the public and the ones in power ‚Äî lack the lessons of history and seem to have lost their sanity again. I fear for the future of our country in what it is becoming ‚Äî in what it has already become."
Are you telling me no one was aware that the ban of abortion would increase the oppression of women? And people think I am mistaken when I preach the failings of our education system... SMH
Let‚Äôs go Brandon I agree - joe Biden
"Remember: Christians set people on fire, threw acid on people, and assassinated doctors to bring all of this about."
Men and women both should be terrified about getting pregnant and getting a woman pregnant. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

"Let's be real. Americans are being agitated by American news again, as they always are, when a war is on.
It's obvious the Democrats are in control of this new Ukraine attack, another Viet Nam, and Washington,
as fronting for the Pentagon, is making it easy to keep that military activity going, the Republicans driving
American voters to the Democrats, making them look as legit as possible. Problems with abortions. Not."
"Well, when 10% of those miscarriages causes death or 50% of them causes permanent sterilization happens, we'll see whether the GOP realizes that blocking your own population from wanting to have babies is a good thing or not (hint: It's not. China has already proved it.)"
Time to vote out the  vile slime that think they can take our rights. Drive them back under their rocks where they belong.
"All you pro choice remember one thing, if your mother was at a time she didn't feel completely sure about her pregnancy, you wouldn't even exist right now."
"Forcing each State to codify and strengthen Abortion Rights, we will have Barrett, Kavanaugh, and Gorsuch to thank.  Let that notion consume them."
Next Republicans are removing birth control. They are at it allready.
DO you not believe in God. Anyone who is for abortion does not have one bit of compassion for Life itself. WHo cares right? Your living your life to it's fullest so it really doesn't matter huh. What if you were the one being aborted? God said I formed you by hand in the womb. If you do not want the child I suggest abstinence.
Praise God! Abortion is an abomination thank you Lord for this correction!

"Ladies it is cheaper to borrow money to go interstate to get back your right to decide, than it is to borrow money to allow a fetus to develop into a child you could not afford. 

What makes the supreme court think the state government is better qualified to make this decision on abortion for you. What does the state governments know about your circumstances, that you don't know yourself. 

From the Supreme Court:- Dear Mr Abbott you know better than all these women, so you decide if they can have a termination. (a crippled man in a wheel chair knows better???) I don't think so !"
I belive a corrupt Scotus has woken up a lot of people and will hand the democratic a  big win in the senate and the house. I believe 3  judges committed perjury under oath and should be impeached.

Boohoo
This is why Christian cultists don't want people to have their voices heard because they know that they won't get the ability to make women second class citizens when it comes to full autonomy over their own bodies.

It's 2022, and we still have people using religion and egotism as a means to write laws for other people that they have no right to choose for. I've had more than my fill of it, and it's enough. 

The US was never great but this just adds extra anchors to an already sinking ship!"
An individual's rights will only be protected so long as it doesn't conflict with the State. Nothing could be more dangerous to a society.
Why abort?
This is an outstanding example of why the individual vote counts ‚Äî-  taking away the power of choice from half of the US population ‚Äî is outrageous ‚Äî  particularly as a separation of Church and State matter which is a basic tenet of our democracy.
If you are going to ban abortion then why not make a law to get every man‚Äôs should have a vasectomy - it‚Äôs only fairüòè. This really shouldn‚Äôt be a political issue because it‚Äôs ridiculous. Just study the problems Ireland have had with this topic!

If I didn't have abortion rights I'd have 3 kids instead of one because men didn't use condoms because I was on birth control.

"With the country awash in guns, thanks to the Court, I wouldn't want to be a gutless doctor, especially in Texas. Just think about what is going to happen when someone's wife or daughter becomes disabled or dies because the doctor gives up power to the Republicans and refuses care to the woman.  It will be interesting."
If abortion rights were put to a vote in each state individually none of them would pass this rediculous abortion ban period. The Republiquanon domestic terrorists party know that & that is simply a fact.
Give this time some  woman related to these abortion haters will die cause of these crazy laws. Lets see how these gop nuts react when their daughter or wife or sisters dies when their pregnancy goes bad and an abortion would save them. It will happen at some point and it will show they are using this for votes not true belief.
I am disgusted that men in power can decide what a woman can do with her body.

Killing babies is EVIL!
The lesson from Dirty Dancing was never learnt.
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe."
"The worst results of anti-abortion are yet to happen once again. Wait until a woman dies from getting a back alley coat hanger abortion, then the worst results will have occurred again and the reason pro-abortion laws came about in the first place. Pro-abortion is not about protecting rights but protecting the life of the mother. What gets aborted is not much more than a parasite when it happens, a potential of being a person is fact but at that stage it is just a blob of cells leaching nourishment off the host.

Abortion and medical technology is also being held back, in the future right to life could be a thing of the past when it comes to abortions. Parasite removed from the host just like a standard abortion will still exist but the parasite will not be harmed but transplanted into a electronic/mechanical womb where it will gestate into a newborn baby. Newborn baby without the pain of being shoved through a vagina but a tank draining with the same butt slapping to cause the amniotic fluid expulsion from the lungs. Mother 7-8 months prior already put the child up for adoption, she just didn't need to birth it.

And point being right to life should also include allowing abortions, the focus of the movement should be on the technology not being able to save the parasite though it saves the mother. An artificial womb is not impossible."
Abortion was used by Republicans to get Christian votes.
just get vaxd
If a state is legally responsible for a banned abortion then the resulting child should be the legal responsibility of that state. All costs incurred until 18 years old

"Easy solution. Most if not all doctors have enough money in the bank to do without work for 3 to 5 years. A general walkout by doctors from hmos and private hospitals should turn the tide. The ball is in the doctor's court. The money running the hospitals in America has sufficient political clout to turn Supreme Court decisions upside down. 
America had ample opportunity to keep religion out of government, they failed and religion got the upper hand. That can be reversed, Christian Sharia has no place in America. If that is not so, then what we call Democracy is b*******, and the US Constitution is little more than toilet paper."
its funny how many people are pro murdering babies.  sad state we r in
You know who doesn't care? The majority of republican leaders and the majority of the Supreme Court. The voices may reach them but it's easier not to care.

"Hello !
Every doctor swear to follow the Hippocratic oath :
The Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians. It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear, by a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards. The oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the Western world, establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today. These include the principles of medical confidentiality and non-maleficence. As the seminal articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice, the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value. It is enshrined in the legal statutes of various jurisdictions, such that violations of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oath's symbolic nature.

"Even children know it's wrong, but not you."
As the old saying goes be careful what you wish for.

Abortion is ending of a fetus life so that it will not result to birth because of various reasons. What are your reasons? May God enlightens us in our reasons.
Alito and the maga justices on the court should be aborted.
Giving the power back to each state was a fair decision by SCOTUS. It gives the people of each state the power to decide for themselves and to vote for the officials that align with their pro-choice or pro-life ideals. If you live in a state where you feel you don't have rights as a citizen then you should consider moving to one where elected officials and citizens alike have the same ideals as you. It is only fair that through voting the people decide their own fate.

Still borns are not abortion please stop lying.
"Keep in mind that Supreme Justice Clarence has allowed Contraception to be 'on the table'.
Contraception has 'not' been outlawed at the Federal court level.

"Don‚Äôt let the stupid people win!  By stupid, I mean religious people."
Cool story. Think I'd rather go live in Texas or Florida then I ever would California. I'd go live in Texas like Elon musk. Elon musk is better then any dumb liberal California celebrity.
30% of women are unable to terminate a pregnancy in this country! An outrage which will not go unanswered by people whose rights have been trampled by the GOP.
"The reality hit folks daily. Desperate women are seeking clinics for abortion. Demand clearly exceed supply. Anger and frustration will climb and spread among women, folks will die and drive women to vote. Midterm will be a nightmare for Republicans."
"As an ER DR., I like many physicians won‚Äôt do locums work in any state that criminalizes elective and therapeutic abortion. That means, you take your chances with adequate ER coverage. Hope you don‚Äôt get into and car wreck or have a MI."
"The republican party is a party of taking away. It isn't a party of giving. They wanna strip away your rights, your human rights. They are extremist. The republican party after Trump became president has decided this is the decade to show people who we really are. White extremist, who hate minorities and hate women."
"Let‚Äôs not forget that in the Republic of Ireland, even when abortion was outlawed, the maternal mortality rate average between three and four per 100,000 live births. In 2021, the maternal mortality rate in Texas was nearly 34 per 100,000. It‚Äôs not simply a matter of access to abortion. It is also a matter of women having access to healthcare."
The two things that have always made murica an idiotic country. Racism and religion. It's going to end you soon.
"stop calling it abortion. it's murder. no one can justify murder of innocent children, and if they try to, it's a red flag."
"First Lady's Abortion?
Oh my goodness, I have a demand for sanitizer."
Certainly not just a women's issue. There must be millions of men who are scared to death of the results of their sexual activity.
"It‚Äôs really pretty basic, if you were against abortion, and you strongly feel that your religious beliefs do not believe in it , then don‚Äôt get one, however you don‚Äôt have any right to inflict your own religious beliefs on every other American in this country, who may not share them, who may not belong to your religion, or may not belong to any religion whatsoever, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs protected in our countries foundation,  that anyone can practice the religion of their choice or no religion whatsoever."
"All are garbage.
xD"
What most of the anti abortion people simply don't know is that many medical procedures pertaining to women's health that run from infections to cancer treatments can and do come under the abortion umbrella. They likely won't know until it personally affects them or someone they know or love.  The religious right and political extremists don't make that known because they know it will make them lose supporters!
Texas should be another country.

The bad part is that strawberry women s is on the side of evil strawberry weak men's
Just wait until they have millions of women living on welfare because they can't afford the children they are forced to have and also any medical issues they might have from carrying dead babies or ectopic pregnancies. I wonder how many abortions Trump has paid for over his lifetime?
abortion should only be allowed at the very begining otherwise live with your decision

First of all it's a woman's body and abortion use to be very private n discretion was always required alot of the woman issues are exposed to the entire public which is stupid only Christians try to interfere with woman's rights... It's none of your business is it?? Woman get fixed or take the pill like a daily vitamin
Seeing my home state of Wisconsin painted in Maroon as a total ban is extremely upsetting. I can't believe an awful pre civil war law was allowed to go back into effect the second RvW was struck down.
A a retired OB RN living in Texas I am furious with our state attorney disregarding a woman‚Äôs right to life saving emergency obstetrical care!!! Women are more ethical than the men in state offices here believe them to be. In the mid term elections this November they are going to find out exactly what we women think of them! I am so excited it‚Äôs hard to wait! Karma at it‚Äôs finest.

"This has happened before.

In 1919 Congress passed the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibited ""intoxicating liquors' in the USA.

The unintended consequences included speakeasys and gangsters, plus decreased government revenue from not taxing legal liquor sales.

Once the government realized it had made a big mistake it ratified the 21st Amendment, which repealed the 18th Amendment and made alcohol legal again.

In the same way, people will quickly realize right-wingers made a big mistake and repeal their stupid abortion laws."
"EDUCATE YOURSELVES BEFORE MAKING STUPID COMMENTS ON THIS FEED!
Can we please have a debate on here only with those who are well informed. Spewing comments based on misinformation or extremism accomplishes NOTHING. We don't have to agree but we can't debate if only one of us has bothered to read something other than extremist tweets."
"Had law makers bothered to educate themselves, interview women, interview doctors and other medical professionals, research before jumping to action, then maybe they would have been well informed enough to understand the consequences before they took action!

But ofcourse they did not do anything other than pick up the phone and do a 'YES-Man' routine when their Donor/Owners called about $$$$ in return for their vote against women's right to Healthcare.

Some of these law makers don't even understand basic biology or reproduction! 

We The People expect better than what our tax dollars for their exorbadant salaries are giving us!"
"1. Women are not going to simply give up having abortions just it is against the law. (Think prohibition and drugs),
2. If and when the Republicans get their hands on both houses of congress and the Whitehouse they will enact a nation wide federal ban on abortions,
3. Banning abortions is going to turn out to be one of those things Republicans are sorry they asked for because they got it."
"America already had an abortion law...

They just want to make it from clinics to street shops

...how many dead fetus will america produce in a year."
Why do you think the repubpigs are trying to take away our voting rights.
"Overturning Roe vs Wade may turn out to be one of the best things to happen to America. With one misguided effort, the repuglicans have alienated half of the population of the country. Alienated?

Baby murderers
"Here is an idea!   If you don‚Äôt want to have a baby‚Ä¶.DON‚ÄôT GET PREGNANT!!   This is NOT ‚Äúthe old days‚Äù when women had no methods other than total abstinence to avoid pregnancy.  Things are DIFFERENT today!!  If you want to have a child LATER, take birth control pill; use a birth control patch; get an IUD; use spermicide.   If you don‚Äôt want a child EVER, get your tubes tied!!   Bottom line: There is no excuse whatsoever for using ABORTION as your birth control solution."

No heart attack treatment for old men until they are ready to die. If they don't need a ventilator then they don't need any medical intervention. How about broke bones. No more medical treatment for broke bones until it has set wrong. It might set itself so they should just go home n see.

"You have some states protecting their own constitution's right to abortion, other states forcing children to bear their rapist's child, a lack of miscarriage care in other states, reproductive health care centers being shut down, and underage students starting activist groups across the country for reproductive education.... yeah I think the GQP bit off more than they can chew this time. Now choke on it."
Why can't women just let babies live?  Adoption should be the alternative not abortion.
Doctors that refuse to provide life saving care because they are fearful of being prosecuted for performing an abortion should have their medical license revoked.
It means alot of people have no self control or sense of responsibility

Keep voting blue till we destroy the right wing party.

"America needs to see a new political movement, like was seen recently in Australia.  We saw several key conservative politicians lose their seats to the ""Teal Movement"", which has changed our political landscape!  Republicans are too dyed in the wool to change their colours.  Overthrow them."
Abortion rights are human rights.
They are not concerned with taking the life of a baby that  could live if not aborted! It is murder any way you look at it.
The right wing HYPOCRITES who claim to use THE WORD in their name are BLASPHEMOUS!!!!!
"How would be the proposal?
Takes away a man's right to reproduce at any time.
Every 18 year old should get a vasectomy, which is only temporarily reversed if the partner wants to have children.
Men would take to the streets in their millions to demonstrate for their right to self-determination."
Abortion is murder!  Thank God Roe was gutted!!!!
This is why I reject religion. It's oppression.
Why always in the extremes never in the middle.  One extrem says no abortion at all and the other abortion in all situation. Shame in all both sides.

"The GOP are playing the Trump play book word for word, including the part about ""How to tank your own political career and go bankrupt.""

On the plus side, this crisis could be used as the impetus to rally enough sane adult Americans to finally end the absurd Electoral College, and/or make the Senate reflect the will of the people instead of a medieval minority that live in po-dunk red states. These institutions were created solely to get slave states to join the fledgling union. Any excuse that is made to keep them has now been proven to be outweighed by this wave of dark ages nonsense. /"

i am well beyond reproduction ability but what this Supreme Court has done to Womens rights.  I cannot beleive what is happening to our medical institution.  And not to mention our rights as women.  What is next?
"Women, either use effective birth control or abstain. All the women I‚Äôve known over the years who got abortions were just sleeping around."
That's funny because a lot of you voters don't know what your rights are so what rights do you think they're taking away ü§î
"there too many people on the planet, I just say that"
Yes democrats please dispose of your offspring.
"Didn't you guys just change the definition of a ""woman""? Saying this is an issue about women's rights is pretty transphobic, and you all should be ashamed of yourselves!"
"Nary a word about the 'terminated' having any kind of 'choice'; the majority of which were victims  of elective abortions, and not a threat to women's health."
"Abortion should be free and there should an incentive. They also be more available. Conservatives don't realize that abortion cuts back on poverty and crime. Imagin if one million less kids are born. It's like one less Baltimore or Detroit to complain about. Plus less population would mean better healthcare, schooling and public housing as there would be less to take care of.
There is enough people on this planet as is. There is no benefit to having more people. 
A mother of 5 gets pregnant. It's her right ‚úÖ to choose. But picking abortion should be $$$$ in her wallet.


Obviously women should have a choice."
need more non-whites to make love to MAGA groups
Why is it the left ALWAYS wants regulations until we talk about abortion or immigration. Abortion is not a form of contraceptive. ü§Ø
"So people, it‚Äôs great that droves people are making their voices heard about keeping choice‚Ä¶.but this won‚Äôt be remedied in a year or less. It‚Äôs going to take a few election cycles MINIMUM to make a lasting change. Budget on 4-6 years of activism. We need 60% in the senate to codify Roe. Vote! Vote! Vote! And help organize!!!"
Abortion is no more healthcare then the gas chambers in Nazi Germany!!

Dont worry...california will always have abortions....ALWAYS. I adore democracy.
Fewer murders?
"Yeah, but the Republicans are NOT allowing women to vote on it!! So the laws are not even legal not to mention it violates HIPPA."
Anti abortion people are idiots. They want to band abortion until what everyone was telling them effect their families. Now women cant get care because doctors are scared of jail.
Joe loved hot steamy showers with his daughter. Gross.
"Having been forced to have an illegal abortion when I was 15 and a half years old by my mother in 1966, let me assure people that abortion bans will not stop abortions. They will be done in back alleys, in some dirty office space by a quack like my mother forced me to have. I was saved when my father realized that my bed was covered in blood, I was unconscious and HE took my to the nearest place he could get help for me and that doctor saved my life. My mother had not told him what she had done to me. So you folks who think banning abortions will stop them are DEAD WRONG. What they will stop is safe abortion access. Moms will die, leaving young children without a mom. Poor women will likely die but then again nobody actually cares what happens to poor women regardless of what the ‚Äòright to lifer types claim."
"It was about time that all this republican anderstand was the Republican party is trying to do.They are taking the right of all the womens and this is the begging for what they have in place. Look at Florida, Texas, and all the states that are republican. They are even changing the history of the USA in the schools and taking the books so they would not know the real history, this is how Hitler started .We can't let this happen to America. We are in 2022 not in 1940 we have to stop them before they do more harm to the USA."
"Abortion is the killing of a child, bottom line."
"Doctors need the page from the police handbook  - write a bonus account of the incident with misspelled & illegible language. ""I feared for my life""

Seen where Arizona Republican erased his website's Antiabortion agenda. Knows he's losing so he hides his stance.
"Reproductive ‚Äúrights‚Äù where is that in the Constitution? How about the child and their Right to Life which IS in the Constitution?
Selfish selfish selfish to choose your life over your child‚Äôs. When your friend miscarries and is sad do you console her with the words ‚Äú it was only a clump of cells, why be sad. You just got saved from a life of aggravation and who knows what else ‚Äú I DON‚Äôt THINK SO!! Or you friendship would be over."
"Vote out EVERY Republitard, judges, secretaries of state, Govenors, AGs, ect. With 60% control of Senate We Make Laws. Democrats force Supreme Court to enforce laws we as the majority want."
"I want to know how outsiders are getting medical records of these females ü§î 
How does anyone other than the immediate  medical team know the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy ü§î"
Not to mention the fact that ‚Äòthey‚Äô want to send women to prison for having miscarriages
This is what happens when people place bumper sticker politics over human beings.
The people that wants to ban abortion doesn't have a clue what they are doing they are nothing but control freaks and blind with a one sided view without any knowledge of the risk and problems that a pregnancy can present it not the same for all women and every pregnancy problem do happen and will continue to happen that is why this decision should be between the doctor and patient  it would be better cheaper and more effective to help provide contraception and tubal ligation to women and those above the age of 35 that elect to do so but most definitely let it be a choice of the women
Guess White Males in Texas want all women to be Stepford Wives and breeders..
"VOTE BLUE ! ! AND VOTE AGAINST THEM WHO VOTED AGAINST YOU ON HEALTH CARE, A LIVING WAGE, GOOD PAYING JOBS, THE Republican Party HAVE CONSTANTLY VOTED NO ON ALL THIS ! !"

"Abortion will never be stopped no matter how hard the anti choice brigade try,illegal abortions will still happen,deaths of not just the foetus,but the woman as well,who may be the sole provider for other kids. Perhaps its time for compulsory vasectomies. It's a small operation and can be reversed,or is it my body,my choice for men?"
Vote BLUE.
Females keep your legs closed until you are ready for children. If you keep your legs closed abortion will never be an issue for you. Women have always had the right to keep their legs closed. Abortion is not birth control. Abortion is used by weak females who get impregnated at the club on Saturday night. Abortion is not birth control. Pathetic. Cheers!!
I don't understand why these people hate women so much. Why do they want to sentence women to die. Well they will learn in Roevember.
It shoud be called reproductive rights.

Not voting is more deplorable than voting Republican just to block our liberal agenda."

Shame they didn't see this coming as it's obvious it will if you let the Republican into power. I mean the Republican don't make a secret of this anti abortion stance and yet people affected either vote republican or don't vote. Same with low taxes for the wealthy and all the other antisocial ideologies. Vote Democrat before the Republicans get their way on other issues.
"Things have to change

"Any Reproductive Freedom Act should Also codify men's rights into law.  It won't, and major networks Never discuss this.  Until they do, I don't vote."
"Why does Texas always come off as being so backwards? After enough women start dying in emergency rooms because a Doctor does not want to get locked up for 99 years, Texans are going to kick every stupid republican religious extremist out of office.  We can't have gun nut religious zealots who want to ban books tell everyone else what to do. This all boils down to a minority rule. It's got to stop!"
"Regardless of your position on abortion, if we elect our politicians on that single issue, its just bad karma"
1 in 3 women! Unconscionable & Unconstitutional. The religious extremists are harming citizens by penalizing their autonomy rights of choice! The are committing crimes of forced birth against women!

"looking at this logically.  the cutoff for abortion should be the same cutoff for forcing premature birth.  no matter what, a woman shouldnt be forced to carry an unwanted baby.  either give premature birth and put it up for adoption or abort it.  

the world record for this is born 19 weeks premature.  so whether the cutoff is 4.5 months or 3 months or 6 months, no woman should be forced to carry it to term if she doesnt want to."
"Yes, we are seeing. That's a whole lot of murder sympathizers. YHVH is also watching. He created the lives of the innocent being slaughtered. Woe be unto these killers."
Texans need to wake up and vote for a governor with a heart. BETO will serve us well. Blue üåä
Reversing a women's rights to abortions was the final nail in the coffin for the Republicans as a so called political party .
"Please remember that YouTube comments don't win elections.

This is for people who were eligible to vote, but chose not to in 2016: Hillary Clinton tried to warn you about Trump-appointed judges overturning Roe v Wade.  

This is for people who are eligible to vote this November, but aren‚Äôt planning to vote: If you want to keep the rights you value, you need to vote (while you still have the right to vote!)

Whatever your values, it only matters if you vote."
Let's vote OUT as many of these fascist pubs as humanly possible in November. Before we start looking like 1930's Germany!!
Our loved ones are not F***ing property! And others should have no say in life altering decisions...as if it wasn't hard enough to begin with!
"Democrats must get Americans to focus on how RepubliKKKlans have used RepubliKKKlan-state legislatures to enact their 'non-existent' platform. A platform that is mainly a culture war. Attacks on women's rights, voting rights, minority rights, LGBTQ rights, and 1st amendment rights. They will make those barriers federal."
Women vote too. Maybe they are going to take that away too. The abortion rule is NO mistake a obvious control over women. That's the only way to look at it.
The myth was promiscuous women ( note not men ) getting pregnant and having monthly abortions ....the reality is a whole lot different
That‚Äôs the weird thing about most Americans: They only get it once they are PERSONALLY affected. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What‚Äôs so difficult about informing yourself BEFORE you make political decisions that have far-reaching consequences?
An observation from Australia like the FPOTUS the Federalist Judges need to be jailed. Judges should not accept money for positions in the Supreme Court.
This is how you know Anericans know nothing of history... They have to see the tragedy and suffering for their own eyes to fully grasp the situation!
"Well it's a good thing the people can vote on it.
Let each state decide not unelected judges"
The USA is not the CCP.
Coat hanger sales are through the roof. So are Bible sales.
If States let US decide
The turtle can see his chances of the top job in the Senate disappearing. And who can he blame? üê∑üêΩüí∞
"It means women are not allowed to murder their children!
It means we stopped child killers!
It mean more babies will live!
It means Trump has save thousands of lives.
It means we have a good lawful Supreme Court!
It shows DemonCrats are child murdering Demons we need to vote out of office!"
Women will not vote gop!
Shame on all that identify as a democrat.
"If we can't turn these abortion bans around, far too many women, girls and their families are going to cruelly, severely and needlessly suffer!"
VOTE BLUE BECAUSE FREEDOM IS ON THE LINE...WE MUST SAVE AMERICA FROM RUN FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS...
"Voting is like driving a car: if you want to go forward, select ‚ÄúD‚Äù; if you want to go backward, select ‚ÄúR‚Äù."
Let's hope that Americans realize just how the USA got into this mess.Thanks to the GOP lining the Supreme court with right wing members of the GOP that Court is now just a political arm of the GOP and they will not have the best interest of all Americans in their decisions...Now the minority of America will rule instead of the majority and that is just plain wrong...

If Texas sees a fetus as a human, can it be insured? I mean, if you have no choice can you at least make sure, should it go bad, you can afford to pay the medical bills? Or will they allow pregnancy insurance, so like after 9mnths you get a pay out for medical fees and extra things for this human? Real question. USA medical fees are crazy. Are y'all at least getting paid for the risk? You have to have the baby, did they at least increase maternity leave to at least 6 mnths? Paternity leave? What are the benefits of this law?"
The miracle of God and they throw it away like a gum wrapper it‚Äôs just plain murder

It means 50-60 million babies every year worldwide would be alive?
"If the Democrats retain or even increase their control over the Senate, and if the expected Red wave in the House is a washout with the Democrats retaining control, and the post election data all points to the elimination of RoevWade as the root cause, watch how fast the republicans abandon their stance on a woman's right to choose.

You guys love killing baby baby
"Doctors enmass in  the US HAVE TO go ahead with emergency care for pregnancies and proper DNC procedures now, and I know these States will back away from law enforcement of these legislations."

"For those who believe in God's will. God is the biggest provider of abortion ,15% of pregnancies are naturally aborted when things go wrong."
So called Christians forcing religious control over women's body is the same as Islamic Sharia laws
"Why would the Texas government want to imprison a doctor for 99 years, for doing what they have been  trained to do? That is to SAVE LIVES in a life or death situation!"
What's that? Pics of protests in Europe over stealing land from farmers? Or babies NOT being murdered by the millions as a form of depraved birth control. Or maybe it's the death of the elites sick evil form of eugenics.
No man dreams of putting a ring on the finger of a baby killer that can't keep her panties on. They are going to figure that out soon.
"This collective angry crowd is incredibly at least 100 times bigger than any of Trump's rallies. It's definitely bigger than Trump's inauguration crowd.

"I really believed a few months ago that Congress would be taken control of by Republicans. It happens basically every midterm of any Democrats first term in presidential office. The Supreme Court really poked a hornets nest by this BS overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Progressive base is not usually this excited during this time of the political 4 year cycle, but if we all go and vote we might actually give Democrats the tools they need to make significant change."
Yo ohuckkkk republicans and trunip supporterssssssssss
Those 5 SCOTUS members are gonna keep going until they get their bigoted evangelical paradise. The only way to stop this is to fight back and fight back hard.
"They are exposing themselves for who they truly are everyday more and more, excellent every man's eyes will be opened."
Republicucks screwed themselves by showing us who they actually are. Never again
I had to change my opinion on abortion after seeing the type of women protesting for it .  Do we really want that type of women to reproduce ???  I don't.
"Supporting and demand and cheering for killing your own children is not the path you want to take, that's all I'm going to say."
Random comment for channel interaction.
"Saying it for years and it fell on deaf ears, Racism and Abortion, the democrats bread and butter....funny how the two are also related."
Overpopulation people think about it we're already overpopulated
It also amazes me that they could even make a ruling like this.  Pregnancy is one of the most dangerous things a woman can do with her body.  Yes your body was made to do it but not all women can physically do it not all babies come out correct or develop correctly sometimes a baby dies during pregnancy.  And if you don't get that baby out you have a strong possibility of sepsis and many other problems.  This law is pretty much telling women that if they get pregnant they have no ability to protect themselves if there is a medical problem or condition with that pregnancy.  So for instance a 16 year old girl gets pregnant there's a severe medical emergency and the girl is going to die if they don't take out the baby but if they take out the baby the baby's going to die.  Now so that girl ends up dying then the baby has depending on the time frame how developed it is as you know a 20% to a 60% chance to live maybe even a 70 or 80.  And have a few kids later on in their life but how many kids could that 16-year-old still had so you're killing one person to save another person for what reason why is a infant's life more important than anyone else's.   And let's not forget for all you religious nuts out there God kills thousands of babies everyday why do we have to serve a 99 year term for killing one to save the mother's life.
"If you are miscarrying,you don't need an abortion. It will happen naturally.   Do people believe this BS."
The ONLY way to save the lives of women aside from voting is for the women in these states to strike.  Take women completely out of the workforce and their economies will fail.
Neither the elephant nor the donkey are capable of leading.  Vote independent
"*How did some women get so MILITANT that they put killing babies ahead of everything else?* Sky high has prices, soaring inflation squeezing family budgets, an invasion at the southern border bringing in deadly fentanyl which is the number one killer of our young people, and out-of-control crime in our cities! *Killing babies in places like New York right up to the moment of birth is INFANTICIDE?!*"
"I hope banning abortion, buries the republican party!"
"And you guys complain about Russia,  but not about Ukraine who has banned opposition political parties.  Ukraine Sounds like republicans who take away voters rights."
Do you actually expect the folks that pushed for this to care rather we live or die? This rolls back to when women were property. Men telling us what was what. I‚Äôm not sure the women who supported this thought was gonna happen. This means you can‚Äôt have a D&C if you mis-carry but still retains some tissues or products of conception‚Ä¶.guess what? You get to maybe die. My Lord! I pray for us all!
"The  same people that were screaming ""my body my choice "" about wearing a mask now want to control women's bodies.

It may save a woman's life."
Looks like a celebration of life to ban abortion.  Go to blue states for infanticide; let that blood be on their hands.  Looks like judgement already on Democratic states.
"No one is stopping anyone from reproducing.  What it is stopping,  is killing what you have produced.  So disingenuous."

Lol we haven‚Äôt even gotten to the part of all these babies going to orphanages then over burdening the social system.
Women in America have now become second hand citizens. Wow. Republicans will lose the vote of all women under 40!
Just vote BLUE
"Once that child is born and added to the GDP, these terroristic shills on Capitol Hill and holding office, could care less about that child, If they cared, we wouldn't have child poverty and homelessness in the richest country in the world. Your oppression is their profession"
Is birth control illegal?
"abortion hasnt been banned. just returned to the states where it should be.
this is what democracy looks like. each state can make its own laws
in NY and California you will be able to abort your kid up to age 21"
It wouldn't be a problem if some of these females stop using it as a form of birth control!
Liar liar pants on fire it‚Äôs not banned it just means I don‚Äôt have to pay for it because you can‚Äôt keep your legs closed or use any sort of contraception.
The Land Of The Free huh?  Unless you are female.
"Don't let the scammers distract you.
Biden lures in millions and millions of illegal immigrants bribing them with freebies through the trillions dollar social programs while Americans suffering from Biden recession,, high inflation, and soaring gas price. Now you know why the democrats are pushing the ""Voting Rights Bill"" - ""No voter ID's"" the democrooks scam American people, ""Voter ID's are racist.""

Extremism is KILLING BABIES as birth control.
"This is what you get with a totally partisan supreme court and the results of minority rule which goes against the position of the majority of Americans. Americans want to leave the reproductive rights in the hands of each woman, whether they themselves are pro-life or not."
Well all those rich people better start building more prisons.
"It's a ""mostly peaceful"""" abortion ban, right Mr. Velshi?"
Abortion is high on a list of concerns to me when I vote this year
"Now, the GOP and the Supreme Court have ""Woken"" the sleeping Giant.  Opps."
Abortion is legal killing period muff said lying thieving evil obama administration almost done Trump will be back real soon
We should have started castration back in the nineties
The religious people who think the overturn of RvW is a blessing don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. How is being denied medical treatment for a miscarriage by doctors afraid of going to prison a blessing?
"I live in Washington state,so we're ok here for now..I'm glad voters in Kansas voted to uphold abortion rights! I'd like to think and hope that the majority and common sense always wins in the end"
Men won this issue

Don't go backwards,  vote for your rights  !! LETS GO GIRLS"
Make sure you vote these extremely religious politicians away in the upcoming elections.
"Why people are not having the same response to the Law not being applied equally. The handling of Trump's criminality, even taking compromise material... He's getting special treatment.."
The supreme court has f-----d millions of women over by overturning roe v Wade..we will not take this s--t lying down and women will not be pushed around
"A fertilized egg is NOT a person.  There are a million things that can go wrong naturally to prevent it from ever developing even to the point of birth, and in the ancient times that these religious nuts want to return to, it was iffy for it to survive after that.  An adult human being IS a person and takes precedence over a pregnancy.  Many pregnancies end in miscarriage through nobody's fault.  Many fertilized eggs are defective in some way and should not develop.  Or they land in a place they cannot develop (ectopic pregnancy) and become a serious threat to the life of the adult.  Laws are being made by hopelessly ignorant religious bigots that profoundly affect medical treatment for these well-understood conditions, as well as manhandling the ability of any woman to make decisions about her own life.  It's not about somebody frivolously ending a pregnancy on the toss of a coin, it's about millions of people's physical, emotional, and economic survival."
ABORTION IS MURDERING BABIES!  MSNBC HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A LATE TERM ABORTION?  THEY USE A SUCTION TO REMOVE A BABY IN PARTS AND CHUNKS!  A LIFE BEING SUCKED OUT TEARING A LIVING BABY IN PARTS OUT OF THE WOMB!
"For women that think the abortion law is good, I only have to say, this isn't about whether you think abortion is okay or not.  I tried to explain to my daughters, this is about having someone else (the government) telling me what I can do and can't do with my own body.  For me, it isn't about whether you feel abortion is good or not. That is between me and my religion, or what is right for me and my family, or the particular medical circumstances someone is in.  Just recently a woman was denied an abortion when the baby she is carrying doesn't have a skull.  This is absurd - it was a medical issue.  VOTE these people out!  I respect other women's decisions they make for themselves, but I do NOT want my state telling me what decision I can make."
"Yeah, some are. It means to keep murder illegal. It means to enforce that no one is above the law, and that if you play around and get knocked up you have to accept the consequences."
To all who believe in abortion.  Most of you if not all do not believe in God or bible. But that doesn't mean God do not exist or the Bible isn't true. But it is. And God is real and he is going to judge you and he will judge you. And he doesn't play politics. You people are murders with no regard for life and you will be judged as such.
Imagine a man not standing up for his wife and children‚Äôs healthcare? They are just as bad as politicians.
I dont get how anyone is this upset over abortion. Add it to the november ballot and let the people decide. All this crap over laws that went into effect 1920 and before should be thrown out until new ones are replaced.
No doctors are leaving dead babies in women who have experienced a miscarriage.  Stop lying lady
"As long as people who call fetuses 'babies' exist, this will never get sorted out. You cannot reason with people who are unreasonable. I think it's best just to ignore them, vote BLUE, then change the laws to protect women's rights. I'm done with these mooks."
"""Hasta la Vista, BABY"" is what comes to mind when I see this. The fetus terminator."
"A blue vote today, keeps the GOP's deadly laws away."
Remember to vote in RoeVember.

"The same Judges that called Roe settled law, essentially lying, to get on the Supreme Court can do whatever they want and Biden is too worried about the Democrat's image to stack the Court.  He's already dropped the ball, for a woman right to privacy.  Let's see what else the Court has to undo, before Biden wakes up."
Don‚Äôt like abortion? DONT GET ONE!!! The government should have no say in your health care
Next they're going to say women can't vote anymore
"Why are politic stupid people saving what women can or can't do...It is not up to them..!!! !!They are disgusting,evil people......"

Whats awesome is now blue states will keep killing their kids and not even having them to begin with while Red States will keep havings kids and thus more power.
"Texas really, really, really doesn‚Äôt like women huh?"
Oh yes. Less dead kids. What a terrible thing!
"Ditch the electoral college.  For federal elections, forget about districts.  ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE!  Majority rule.  True democracy.  The electoral college was designed to keep rich white men in power.  Imagine Gore instead of Bush.  Possibly no Sept. 11 2001 attack.  Bush family and Binladen family business ties....
Gore instead of Bush, possibly more attention to climate change?  No electoral college equals no Trump presidency.  No tossing out of Obama's pandemic protocol. The majority of voters know what's best.  Time we listen to them.  Get rid of the electoral college."
"If Americans are supposed to have freedom of speech and choice, how did this happen?"
"It‚Äôs interesting also that the majority of people that support abortion ‚Äùrights‚Äù are men. Because ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs rights, bro‚Äù. Yeah. Right. They just don‚Äôt want the responsibility when they mess up."

Fascist."
The women will be voting democratic this year
Well that takes care of the vaccine argument.  People have a choice
a lot of women lost their human rights.
Libs stay doing nothing of course
Would someone please explain to me how 5 people get to decide the fate of millions of women?
Funny how the GOP says it's for smaller government but wants to tell women what to do with their own bodies and lives. Plus they refuse to help mothers and families in any way.
99 years n prison for a foetus over a human life??? I thought men and women were equal? Why is it that men are leading the way to deny women that right?
Your citizens must be of interesting intelligence when they only understand things that they can see?
"Are ‚Äúthey‚Äù really though?  I think just like all other topics, those that caused this to occur won‚Äôt ever agree they were wrong."
"It's not just about abortion. It's about treating women -half the population - as property again, unable to make decisions for themselves, for their daughters, without the approval of the mainly male lawmakers in America. It's shocking and shameful, and the supreme court needs to be adult enough to admit that they got it wrong, and change Roe v Wade back to how it's been for years."
"See, it's the dog catching the tire of the moving car it was chasing and is getting beaten to death until they finally let go of this issue of women's rights. DeSantis and Abbot are both very likely to lose their Governorship this Roevember."
"Alot of white babies and white women are going to die - but they didn't take into account this occurring as this is what happens when your politicians are out of touch with society and only go along with a minority group - just so they can feel loved and held in high regard by a bunch of SHEEP!  Baaaaaaa baaaaaa   - they only want the black babies to die, not the white ones."
"No, the dog has gotten in front of the back tire while the car is going forward. It is only a matter of if the car goes over the dog."
TexAss is a laughably backward state.
what the abortion ban really means is a woman forced to carry a fetus with no skull to term.
Contraception learn them use them. Don't tell me about the exceptions. Abortion requirements would be cut in half.

And the American public has never been over 35% on ""absolutely no abortion any time for any reason"". The incredibly out of touch Supreme Court has its lowest ratings EVER now! But Clarence Thomas wants to go EVEN FURTHER-no birth control for any reason. Their ratings would be under 5% of they go there."

"My first thought of this SCOTUS ruling was .. Welcome to the horror show.  And it's coming.  
We will all understand the difference between a ""red state and a blue state"".   I think there will be way more blue states soon.  The pendulum has already started the other way.  It will gain momentum.  Even McConnell see's it.  He will die in office before leaving somehow, 45 has decreed it by telling him to get out.  In other weird premonitions, I don't think Biden is gonna make it two more years, he will make Harris the first Woman President. But I doubt she is re-elected for a full term, she will lose in the dem primary to God only knows who.  By then, 45 will be on a never ending Court cycle."

Protesting is ok.  Voting is much better.  Get up and VOTE
"Yes. Millions of the innocent unborn, are saved from willful murder, behind the excuse of court - invented "" rights."""

As a republican i just want to say i totally support abortion especially if the parents are democrats.

It‚Äôs unfathomable."

"I‚Äôm pro life  it also believe EARLY ON  it should‚Äôve an option, but this abortion thing is being horribly misused it‚Äôs not meant to be birth control, 600,000 babies a year murdered is ridiculous. Why are these people so blown away that other people have a difference of opinion? If the people of a certain state vote as a majority they don‚Äôt want abortion and you‚Äôre not willing to be accountable for your sexual acts then I suggest you move."
"In the very near future in the states which have the most serious criminal penalties, it will be impossible to find an MD in an ER who has been trained -- and has the skill necessary -- to perform the medical / surgical care a woman in an emergent crisis must receive in order to live.   Medical schools in these states will not teach these procedures on the basis that state law does not permit a qualified MD to actually perform them during an MDs medical practice.  

Women in a crisis, rushing to an ER hoping for the care they need, will, instead, be hundreds of miles away from an ER which is prepared for these events.

I suspect we‚Äôll see most states pass laws putting abortion on a firmer state-by-state basis than Roe ever did and as the conservative Justices knew would happen. Within 10 years I suspect there will only be three or four states who ban or highly restrict abortion. These will be the four or five where there is a genuine majority against abortion.

"What boggles my mind is that a) they forget back when abortions were illegal (or in other countries that have similar laws) and b) they have no long-term thought process: What happens when people are forced to carry children they don't want? People were getting backdoor abortions, which weren't always safe and hygenic, often dying in the process. Women died in pregnancy/childbirth because something went wrong and the doctors were unable to give them the care they needed. More babies with life-changing disabilities and problems are born, causing stress on a system that already has limited healthcare. Unwanted children are more likely to be mistreated or abused. The already problematic foster care and adoption systems become bloated with kids. Babies start getting dumped (even more so than they already are). And that's not even touching the issues we've seen lately where *children* are being forced to carry their rapist's baby, despite the danger to a body and psyche that is not yet fully mature.
Yep, that sounds like a *great* plan. /sarcasm"

"So naive to think that banning abortion stops abortions. It hands it over to exploiters, drunks, extortionists, quacks, people who have lost medical licenses for a reason, and desperate teenagers. It massively increases the number of pregnancy deaths of mothers, the number of babies born damaged by medications and chemo (because mothers whose periods stopped during illness realised they were pregnant too late for these new deadlines) the number of babies killed soon after birth, the number of babies abandoned soon after birth, the number of babies born into massively dysfunctional families who end up being horrendously treated. And Republicans, be prepared for tax increases to support the number of people who will need total long term care because of being born with catastrophic congenital conditions."

"This is why ""all or nothing"" politics is the wrong way to go.   Compromise is necessary in a civilized society.  Lawmakers should NEVER vote on anything without knowing all the facts.  It is blatantly ignorant to assume you know everything about an issue you are voting for.  I personally need all the facts before I can form an opinion and I'm not making decisions that impact the whole country.  It blows my mind that citizens and politicians vote for bills they haven't actually read."
"Over the past 50 years, Roe has brought nothing but extreme promiscuity, depravity and¬† Mores decay; this resulted to the destruction of the family as we knew it. 

We didn't know things would get so bad when they promoted and encouraged abortion in the 70s, but now we know. 50 years ago, we could claim ignorance, but not this time. Passing a law that promotes or encourages abortion would undeniably be a curse this time, please men stay away from this.

"Message for Gregg Abbot, Texas governor: You want to punish women for having an abortion. You want abortion providers to serve long prison sentences and pay enormous fines for merely helping women. Yet you support the former president, who currently is the worst criminal in US history, having botched the Covid pandemic and therefore is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths. He incited the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection that killed five people, injured many law officers and did serious damage to our Capitol. Now he is under investigation by the DOJ for stealing classified documents from the White House that very likely has endangered lives around the world and caused great fear for millions. How you can hold any political office is a mystery to me, after your numerous failures, especially the Uvalde tragedy .

"Just like 1980's Moral Majority, our radical right-wing extremists are very immoral, and they are definitely a minority! Put ALL our issues on the ballot, and let's have our ""representatives"" do what WE want them to do!!!"
Letting women get close to dying while doctor's are on the phone to their lawyers because they are worried about going to jail is the result of this ban.  This is ridiculous!  How is this health care?   Ninety-nine years to life as a punishment?  Murders don't get that.
FORCED MOTHERHOOD IS FEMALE ENSLAVEMENT....
"Just wonder who would accomplish most, protest from baby killers for birth control that work at McDonalds, or protesting farmers and truckers that transport supplies?"
Religious zealots are the worst.
"Abortion bans harm the most vulnerable; POC, poor people, and children. Children are vulnerable, especially according to RAINN statistics; *every 68 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted. And every 9 minutes, that victim is a child. A person can get pregnant as soon as they get their periods, there are children under 8 with periods. Heck, the youngest I could find was an 8-month-old girl who was reported to have had period blood in her diapers. It disgusts me because I am a survivor of childhood sexual violence and I'm shocked at how common it is."
"More like the car running over the dog's head, it seems to me."
Does it mean that you need to be responsible for your actions? Or drive a little further? Or use a safer alternative method of skirting responsibility?
The Right evangelical neo-fascists now control the reproductive rights of 66% of all US women.  Donald Trump‚Äôs gift to the Right via SCOTUS appointments.
"I don‚Äôt understand, how is voting going to change this law back? Biden and all the Democrats have an opportunity to increase the court now, but they don‚Äôt . I‚Äôm not sure how voting blue will make Roe v wade reverse."
"The silver lining could be that some of the women who are going to experience these emergencies are going to be the ones who supported making abortions illegal. That will be a major eye-opener (or an eye closer, if they end up losing their lives because of it). But stubbornness can be a strong force and martyrdom is applauded by some. Time to vote!"
"Jazz how scary, what a crazy country the US is! It's so sick in so many ways."
"No matter how strict Republican men make abortion legislation, they still cannot get pregnant. No matter how hard they try."
Hypocrite Republicans like Lauren Boebert who is OK with having abortions herself but will vote to deny other women has no place in politics.
"Joe Biden on the cutting edge of 'boomer politics' . . watch out, kkk gonna get yer mama!"
"Banning abortion is impossible. Only legal, safe abortion can be banned."
I like to how women feel that the states owns there body ??????
Definitely bigger crowds than the rallies of the politicians responsible for the overturn. Bigger than the insurrection itself. I‚Äôll bet they hate those pictures of peaceful protest. They should be very worried. The insurrectionists are in jail or convicted and can‚Äôt vote. Most MAGA are liars about actually voting. These protestors and women WILL vote.
These self-righteous self-serving evangelicals act like the most oppressed people on Earth where they're trying to push their religion on everyone else keep your religion that you mixed with your politics out of women's uteruses apparently they want small government the Republicans small enough to use women and tell black people know your place as every Republican is crying to bring back the Glory Days of white Christian nationalism
It‚Äôs time for all to rise above this political madness! I will vote üó≥ for woman‚Äôs health! We must unite and fight this injustice! We need more kindness & grace! üó≥‚úåÔ∏èüíô
So if you have cancer & get pregnant you will have to stop your cancer treatment unless it harms the pregnancy!  That's worse than having cancer!
Yup and we still want to say the Lord's prayer in a natural disaster. Goodnight!
"Solution to problem:  *Say ""No"" to men's advances, and keep your legs together.*  Or is that too much to ask of today's women?"
VOTE
"Republicans don't care about women's lives.
All they care about are tax cuts and power."
Women now have the same rights as men in a case of pregnancy. When privileged people get treated equal it feels like oppression.
"Even the so call god, believed in abortion. 

Numbers 5:11-31"
They wrote these laws against abortion to be as cruel as possible because that was the point and this was never about a life this was about control and these people want to control their property quote unquote back and what is their property you ask everything women and anyone who doesn't share their skin tone included
I stand for the people who require care and rights for their own body because they are more important than a bunch of cells.
"Nice try msnbc, pushing the abortion issue isnt going to help the Dems. Lets see,what else can they run on?  Apparently nothing."
"California has a measure on the November ballot to make abortion access normal in our state.  It is Proposition 1 and money against it is again being poured into our state to undermine 
women.  We must vote to normalize our health care and take care of the 50% of the population that is female or pregnant possible.  My abortion was in 1965 & it was very expensive & difficult
to arrange.  But it was a very simple surgery and I have no regrets and no guilt.  Never have had.  Has anyone looked into what it is to be an Opus Dei catholic?  All 5 of the justices who voted to
overturn Roe are Opus Dei Catholic, recommended by the neo fascist Federalist Society."
"I live in Missouri, and I hope that the women and men in my state wake up and vote out the politicians who banned abortion in my state. How many women will suffer and die because of this? Why do these Republicans want to see women die? Vote blue this year!"
"Religious people need to keep their beliefs to themselves,  and keep thier noises out of others lives. Until the clump of cells can live on its own and not leaching off of the womans body, it's not a person,  it's a clump of cells,  just like cancer is. And if the person doesn't want a clump of cells growing in them and leaching off of them and possibly costing them thier lives, they have that right to have it removed.  Any person who believes that they have a right to control what someone does with thier own body deserves a trip through maximum security prison for a few months,  they can experience what not controlling what is happening to your body feels like."
You say people are finally seeing what happens when you outlaw Row versus Wade but people already know what would happen if you're outlawed Road versus Wade because it's happened before anyone old enough to tell you the horror stories of relatives who had to get back out abortions but of course these men who lived through that time said we should do that again
Unfortunately the American Taliban in the SCOTUS can't be voted out.
"Enough already, the Supreme Court didn't ban abortion!"
"AN ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC SITUATION FOR THE AMERICAN WOMAN...

STEP RIGHT UP LADIES TO HAVE YOUR LABIA TATTOOED WITH: PROPERTY OF [ INSERT STATE, REPUBLICAN POLITICIAN, CHRISTIAN THEOCRAT ]

YA'LL LADIES HAVE A LAST CHANCE TO UNDO YOUR DESCENT INTO PROPERTY >  VOTE ALL DEMOCRAT IN '22 AND '24 !!!

YUP, MANY OF THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WILL MAKE YOU COUGH UP A HAIRBALL, BUT THEY WON'T BE TATTOOING YOUR LABIA (UNLESS YOU WANT THEM TOO.......LOL).
...........and you can always vote them out later without any of them trying to overthrow the government and destroy your votes."
"Evangelicals who say they're ""good Christians"" because they care about the unborn baby, but then don't support funding for healthcare, food stamps, and other family welfare programs sure are awful Christians."
What it now means is Democrats will keep control of Congress. üòÅüëç
"Doctors have to check with lawyers and politicians about a medical procedure that is a private matter. Congratulations, America! You are now officially a backwards country. How about throwing in a witchburning while you're at it?"
ROEVEMBER will be very loud and very BLUE.
"Minority Rule in a Democracy?
WTF!"
"it would be interesting if Margert Attwood handmaidens tale, and Anita Diamant who wrote the Red Tent, had a conversation and what would that sound like?"
1:33 You‚Äôre wrong they don‚Äôt even want to do it when the woman is on deaths door these people think that a dead baby is more valuable than sentient human woman‚Äôs life who has been using resources for decades. They want a bunch of babies they can mold into being illiterate race baiting taxpayers.
"If you don't want a child, use birthcontrol !!!!!"
Baby murder.
Remember when Red Hats brayed that all people would care about was inflation and gas prices? üòè
"""From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."" Matthew 4:17

The lines are being drawn!
"States that enacted such draconian laws will soon get a response from the women of this nation.  Actually, there will be two major responses.  One this November 8th and again on November 5th, 2024.  I will stand and vote with the women of this nation."
"Where are you?  You have killed 63,000,000 American children because you did not want them to be there.  That is where you are.  That is more homicides than took place in World War II, the worst war in the history of the world.  You think you can get away with calling me extreme because I do not want to participate in your political party activity?"
"Does anyone out there remember being a fetus or being born? Abortion is necessary. Needs to be reformed not just have the baby and see what happens. Too many circumstances involved. Poor quality of living if complications, mother could die, or zero nurturing."
Just tell republicans that you feel that your baby is a democrat. theyll let you in...
"Abortion is not a right, and 'just staying out of peoples' private lives' is an inane argument that ignores the moral recognition of human life within the womb. Pregnancy should end with birth and life respected always."
Looks like a Big Blue Wave.
"Here's something Republican Jesus Freaks may not have thought about, which is people can, and often do, say they believe in something when they know there won't be any consequences (it's a big reason why so many claim to be religious).

But with abortion now there will be consequences, and they will effect conservative women just as much, if not more so, than any other group.  And we're already seeing signs some of them are now thinking, ""You know, maybe I don't really think abortion is murder after all."""
BUT HER EMAILS!
"There are 18 states that allow abortions.  Oh and Washington D.C. too, I almost forgot.  It may be a further drive but saying it‚Äôs banned is kind of poor reporting, especially since it‚Äôs obvious that there are states where you can have this procedure accomplished."
Once again the religion posions everythin
Roevember is coming
Oh yeah demsrats the party oh killing babies
Why aren't all the doctors protesting and striking???
"That¬¥s what happens when religious wackadoos have influence on society! People get hurt,killed and made to suffer! Think the Gop has stepped in it this time and they are starting to realize it! Show them the door,give them the boot come elections! Get rid of them,kick√©m to the curb! HARD!üëä"
"Please start covering the origin of this story, a corrupt SCOTUS, which was illegitimately stocked with Right Wing Extremists, not Good Judges of anything apparently."
You want change? VOTE. VOTE. VOTE.......All this talk and marching means nothing if you don't vote and the other side votes in the people who makes the laws.......VOTE.
"One book actually worth burning?  The Handmaid's Tale.
It was meant to be a cautionary tale, instead the GOP is using it as a ""How To"" manual"
I was thinking about buying shares incompanies who manufactures birth control since abortion is or no longer be an option in many ststes.Any opinions?
"If Republicans only would have known women demand the sovereignty over their own lives, they would have asked the Supreme Court to wait until after the midterms. Who would have thought women don't want to go back to the dark medieval times, when they were part of the possessions of men? Not Republicans."
"These radical nutcases need mental health evaluations BEFORE they are installed in governmental positions! If they were later deemed to be lying, they need to be terminated!"
This is what happens when you mix religious beliefs with biology/science/reality!
"Roe v Wade wasn't decided because people loved abortion; it was because women kept dying, so the system changed. It'll go back. Just have to see a lot of women die first."
"Put it on the ballot in every state.
Let the people decide whether or not they want abortion in their states.  Get the government out of the abortion issue!"
"And Texas will Reelect  Abbott  and those pushing this because  they  put party over what is best for themselves.

Christian Taliban strikes again!!!
"I wouldn't drive my uterus through a fascist fiefdom. They might not let it leave. Also, I wouldn't risk having to buy 50 cents worth of gas and giving them a penny of tax support. These are fly-over fiefdoms."
Isn't is funny how quickly liberals decided that men couldn't get pregnant and have abortions after all?
Two political parties... One is trying to keep this nation together... The other one stormed the Capitol and stacked the supreme court

Well women are second class citizens.  It would be interesting if women end up losing their rights to crossing state lines let alone drive by themselves and have to have a male family member in the car and if crossing state lines women and teen girls have to pull over and step in a out door bathroom and take a test to prove she‚Äôs not pregnant and get questioned as to why your going to your destination.

Old men have no right telling women what they can or can‚Äôt do with their own bodies.
The Republican party has spent the last 50 years working up to the point where they could gain control of SCOTUS .......and overturn Roe ..........and during all that time they never realized they were on the wrong side of 80 % of the voting public ?????   That's kinda like Trump surrounding himself with a circle of would -be felons .....and surprised that someone dimed him out on the stolen docs .....!!!!!!    Color me shocked !!!!!
"I still believe it was bought.  A conspiracy to distract Americans while we're fleeced by the oil companies and the corrupt system/ politicians who allow them.  Something to fight for INSTEAD of fighting the higher price of oil.  Even though the demand keeps falling with every EV sold.  Like I said, just a conspiracy I believe.  Why else would they do something so blatantly stupid if it wasn't for money?"
"Democracy is on the ballot 
We dont want no fascist mallots"

"This is a horrible situation for the women of America. 
Incomplete miscarriages cannot be medically treated until the life of the woman is in danger.
There are no humanitarian considerations happening in these circumstances and the quality of life of these women going forward is in serious jeopardy."
Conservative today means we need to go back before the Age of Enlightenment. Say maybe the Dark Ages.
Republicans know that the only way to get elected is to cheat. So what do you expect them to do?
Roe vs wade disappears under joe biden‚Äôs dictatorshipüòÜ
"If the democrats, women as well as men, can‚Äôt see what the republicans are trying to do to 50% of American citizens then I feel very sorry for women in the USA!

"Far right christofascist goofballs went too far in banning Roe. Women are now showing up in droves to vote for the Democrat. If enough win this November, Roe will be codified into law. Vote Blue. üíô"
"Roe v Wade didn't ""fall"".  It was executed by Trumpublican Christian Nationalist Nazis that lied, and deceived, under oath."
Agree 100% women should have right to do what they want not to be tell by the GOP who what all male white nation.
"We see more media propaganda. 
    Abortion is not banned. The Supreme Court examined the Constitution and found that nowhere within the framework of this document is there any mention of abortion. They came to the realization that Roe was an improper decision and they corrected it.  Now the subject of abortion or abortive procedures goes back to the state legislatures where it should‚Äôve been in the beginning.
    It is now the duty of activist on both sides of the issue, both sides of the issue‚Ä¶ Pro-choice and Pro life, to convince their elected state representatives to do the job that they were elected to do.  Some states will allow abortion and aborted procedures and others won‚Äôt. What we are seeing is democracy in action. We need to support democracy."
"That's a hideous and fallacious analogy with a  dog hitting a car. Clearly, you and Katie Phang have a contempt and disregard fo dogs. And moreover, the analogy is fallacious because the differences are greater than the simliarities."

Keep ur sins from our laws.. abortion is not constitutional..God overturn abortions..teach God's laws n they won't need abortion
Oh the bots are out in the comments section
"Aww look at the desperate trolls trying to convince the other 70% of the population that anti-abortion is more popular. You trolls are laughable at best, but pathetic would be the more accurate description.

SCOTUS and Republicans sealed their fate when they went after women. New voter registration among women is at an all time high. All polls are shifting, and popularity for those who are in support of a woman's right to choose is off the charts.

MAGATS better get their Kleenex ready, because you're about to see what happens when you motivate the voters. We outnumber you Neo-Fascists by A LOT. By a whole lot."
People are seeing the result of democrats failing to protect and codify Roe for the past 40 years.  Turns out campaigning on the pledge of protecting rights - and the fear of losing rights - is preferable to actually doing something that would have prevented this.
