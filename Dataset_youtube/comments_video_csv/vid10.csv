Wake up
They are not going to clarify anything except take away more of our rights
"If your amniotic fluid broke at 18 weeks, the doctors should have been able to determine whether the fetus was viable through a c-section or not. Lastly, the should have been able to determine whether her life would be at risk especially since the fetus would no longer have the safe environment of the amniotic sac. This sounds more like gross negligence/oversight and had nothing to do with the abortion law. Condolences to the family and glad she is physically safe now."
"Sue Texas, screw these stupid laws, and impeach the Supreme Court. politics needs to stay out of the medical field"
"This whole story is BS ---  What they described is a miscarriage, NOT AN ABORTION 
 They claim the doctors told them, ""Tough noogies. Our hands are tied because we can't read the law.""  ??
  *50% of the story wasn't told* - Notice they have only the interpretation of 2 traumatized, biased, activist people with no legal or medical education. 
    What do the doctors have to say? they didn't ask the doctors any questions about the case....   

NO doctor is going to send her home and say, ""whoops! Maybe you'll live or maybe not.  We don't know what to do with a pregnant woman or baby.""

 in the written article, the woman claims they reasoned that it would be too dangerous to drive 8 hours to cross state the line to obtain a ""legal"" abortion in a neighboring state *but waited 3 days at home w/o using her prescribed antibiotics* and developed sepsis.   *REALLY?*   smart choice?

TX law :     (b)  The prohibition under Subsection (a) does not apply if:
 	             (1)  the person performing, inducing, or attempting the
 	abortion is a licensed physician;
(2)  in the exercise of reasonable medical judgment,
 	the pregnant female on whom the abortion is performed, induced, or
 	attempted has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by,
 	caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at
 	risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a
 	major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced;
 	and
 	             (3)  the person performs, induces, or attempts the
 	abortion in a manner that, in the exercise of reasonable medical
 	judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to
 	survive unless, in the reasonable medical judgment, that manner
 	would create:
 	                   (A)  a greater risk of the pregnant female's
 	death; or
 	                   (B)  a serious risk of substantial impairment of a
 	major bodily function of the pregnant female.
 	       (c)  A physician may not take an action authorized under
 	Subsection (b) if, at the time the abortion was performed, induced,
 	or attempted, the person knew the risk of death or a substantial
 	impairment of a major bodily function described by Subsection
 	(b)(2) arose from a claim or diagnosis that the female would engage
 	in conduct that might result in the female's death or in substantial
 	impairment of a major bodily function.
 -----------> (d)  Medical treatment provided to the pregnant female by a
 	licensed physician that results in the accidental or unintentional
 	injury or death of the unborn child *does not constitute a violation
 	of this section* <----------------

that's not so difficult to interpret that the hospital's lawyers and doctors would do what this article claims."
"Let's deal in facts.  It has already been put that the doctor was incorrect and told so by legislation.  Unfortunate as it is, it's to be expected.  When measured against the lose of life of unborn humans, this isn't extreme."
"Obviously, these so called ""Pro-Lifers"" don't care about any Lives at all, all they really care about is Control and Power, no matter at who's Expense."
These stupid politicians don't know how to balance.
So she's alive and this is just to make a point. Weak.
That doctor is at fault. Obviously she was in a state of life threatening doctor should've done his job that's not legislation that's malpractice
"This is extremely sad and my heart breaks for them and everything about this situation. I hate saying ""because I'm nurse"", but I knew this during my clinical rotation in OB that after a woman has been in labor for too long after her waters break, you give antibiotics! It's open surface and any organism loves them, as well as if a woman that tests positive for strep B you automatically hang antibiotics as soon as they go into labor to protect the baby. I don't care if she was about to miscarry, she should have treated like anyone other women with a viable baby that waters broke too early. This woman/husband might now be able to have a baby now. It just goes to show how twisted some people can be in their own beliefs when they choose a living human over a baby they say won't survive. I highly doubt this is a doctor mistake because they would be suing for malpractice too!"
"I don't underestand..her water broke and they said there was nothing they could do? Why didn't they perform a c section or an induction and try to ssve the baby 😢..and if the baby died and she got an infection they still should have done a c section or an induced delivery

Those doctors are idiots.

As a doctor you took an oath to provide your patients with the best possible healthcare so they can live happy and healthy lives. But her water broke too soon and these doctors just go damn that sucks..sorry? Umm sounds like a personal problem. They should be charged."
"If I were to become pregnant and see, the baby had no brain stem, and the doctor said this baby is not going to be viable. Or if they told me you and the baby could die from this. And see the baby and I die. My thoughts are one they can do medical research testing on me and my child, learning from my child and my death. We do not know God‘s plan if we are meant to die, then we are meant to die for a certain cause maybe. TRUST IN GOD 👏 Not mankind."
"The difference is an abortion kills a living developing baby. This is very different, this is a situation where a baby has died but was not expelled which is bizarre because if your water breaks you usually start labor and deliver very shortly afterwards. If anything she should have been given oxytocin if labour didn’t start. It seems to me like something is missing here"
Story sounds traumatic and horrible but I can't believe anything CNN promotes. Can we fact check this?
She almost died from septic shock. She wasn’t developing sepsis. This is absolutely abhorrent and the medical professionals should be punished.
sue texas broke. texas is a dumpster fire of regressive & barbaric ethics.
The way these bills are means doctors have to Wait till what they Know will be life threatening Becomes life threatening 😢
"There was zero need for an abortion. Early delivery should’ve been done straight away either with an induction or c section. Her doctors are idiots that’s the real crime here, not an abortion ban"
So how did they remove the baby? Did they give her a c-section or did they do the same process as an abortion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ccc7FSq_JN0
Texas is THE battle ground state! All you self-righteous Yankies get your asses down here and fight with us! The fascists would never win another election if you did!
"THIS IS ABSURD! listen, I am PRO-LIFE. but when I women’s fucking water breaks you deliver the baby! You don’t have to abort it first but they should have delivered her! Ugh prayers for her experience. I’m sorry for your loss!"
Texas yall gotta get your shit together. You continually fail to make change and actively contribute to killing people everyday
"She was SEPSIS !! 
 My GOD they WAITED UNTIL SHE WAS ON HER DEATHBED before she got the healthcare she needed??BARBARIC! 
VOTE ! BLUE! TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY & OUR FREEDOMS! 
 In the 1800’s , pioneer woman died in childbirth quite often , because they had no proper healthcare care available. 
 PIONEER DAYS have long since passed! 
 OR HAVE THEY?? 
I wonder if the people who outlawed medically unnecessary abortions would be OK WITH THEIR PASTOR’s WIFE being LEFT TO DIE?? Or THEIR WIFE or THEIR DAUGHTER?? 
Pro life my foot!!! 
 IF your religion requires you to be left for dead that’s your choice! 
Others may want to LIVE! That should be THEIR CHOICE!!!"
The all-or-nothing attitude toward abortion is not a solution; it is a problem. Amanda's harrowing story at a committee meeting in Texas was ignored by Cruz and Cornyn both.  That's what I have a problem with:  MAGA mobsters who clearly think that they already know everything there is to know.  They think they own this country.
Soo sorry to hear that you guys went through this…I say this with tears in my eyes
Oh yes you can finally have an abortion when you’re hours away from dying like wtf
"Explain this to me. In relation to abortion laws most Republicans are pro life. But in relation to gun laws most Republicans are pro what? Selective outrage is real and the motivation is not life, it's greed."
Really feel for the women who will go through this in Texas and other states willing to curtail personal liberties and access to health care.
The GOP have shown and time and time again that they hate women. They’re not “pro life” they’re pro misogyny and patriarchy.
Medicine does not end at conception.
Inhumane to treat women like this.
"For the men that want to control women and are happy with this shlt controlling monster law, yall will get back the fck fired, mostly on the red states theres going to be a big wave of women not wanting to date men/hook-up/serious relationship or even marriage because they will be god damn scared to be pregnant basically sperm is going to be considered a weapon so get ready to either be gay or accept trans woman as your new girlfriend/wives/ intimidate partner, get either your balls snipped or be single forever without any women sleeping with you. (This only goes for men that support this law im not saying ALL men, I know there's amazing men out there that are against this and respect women and are decent human beings)"
"She's lucky she didn't lose all her limbs from the sepsis. Or die, like Savita Halappanavar in Ireland."
Nonsense. What a poor story. Shame on you CNN.
There's also another scenario. When a woman gets pregnant and needs to go through chemo for cancer or something like that...
Lies.
"It ain't pro-life, it's exchanging one for the other. Oh and btw...for some of those people saying that it's only 1 percent...you wouldn't feel that way if it was you in that group and that 1 percent of a population of over 300 million is about 3-4 million people. Forcing Women to give birth is a form of mass murder and torture, especially if it's forced nationwide. Let me know when you Feminists are done playing games with the men, drop your failed ideology and join with the Gynarchists to form Gynarchic communities. they are murdering Women with these laws and they won't stop with abortion. Some of them have gone online and advocated to take away your right to vote. Sooner or later, submissive, straight Women and their dominant men will strip away your civil rights. After decades of arguing, discussion, of tireless education, what did that bring you? There's still rape and sexual assault, sex trafficking is on the rise internationally, your civil rights are under assault, your issues are downplayed, minimized, ignored, denied, and your dignity and autonomy are trampled on daily by men who care nothing for you beyond what you can do for them. Is this the kind of life you want for yourself? No more arguments, or discussions with the men who keep abusing Women and their enablers...it's worthless. Become business owners, form Gynarchic intentional households, then communities, learn Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, etc. Economic, physical and social power will get you a lot farther than wasting your time elsewhere. Real power is what you can earn for yourself and frankly, power is the only quality that men respect at the end of the day. To the men out there who have made themselves enemies of Women and their rights: you waged a war against the third and fourth waves of feminism because you were afraid of people like me and of Women ruling. Ironically, those people you attacked weren't Gynarchists at all. All they wanted was to have the same privileges and to be treated with fairness and respect. However, i know what you're like in private and what are lot of you really are when Your Mothers, Sisters, Cousins, and Aunts leave the room. The reality is that men in general will never see Women as equals and will keep shining them on, until they inevitably strip away their rights. It's all tactical for them and once they finally manipulate you into a position of political vulnerability, you'll see what they think of you. You were afraid of me and my brothers and Sisters and perhaps you were right to, because there's no evidence you'll ever change collectively. You'll learn that unlike the feminists, Gynarchists have no fear. Unfortunately for you, we can't be bargained with and won't listen. You had your chance with the Feminists to be reasonable and you threw that out the window. It's interesting that You attacked them, when you know nothing of what authentic Gynarchists believe or why we think the way we do. In a way, i thank you for doing this because it showed us how you think and operate and what your weaknesses are. Gynarchists are doers, not talkers. Self-cultivation is the path to salvation, not waiting for the ethical and moral development of men. And even if they do get what they want, do you honestly think that's a good use of your time? Arguing and discussing things with people who are going to do what they want to anyways, regardless of what you say? Coding, mathematics, science, work-related skills...these are the keys to winning in life and it's a real investment of your time. To the dominant Women and submissive men: The time is coming for us to join together, to fuse our energies and bring balance to Gaia. There is no need to ""smash the patriarchy"", patriarchies are self-sabotaging and self-destructive. When the men have finally fucked up beyond any doubt and the culmination of the cycle of resentment, destruction, abuse, and violence leaves billions in it's wake, our time will come. Survive, and thrive, my Sisters and brothers."
Texas republicans will live to see brown immigrants breed them out of existence....
These laws are insane
Abortion is murder
Republicans don't care. They want to torture women.
"ohhh, so sorry, are you being subject to the consequences of your beliefs and actions????"
Based Texas law
Well it was the woman fault for getting abortion and killing her own child
Every man or woman who wants an abortion must be sterilized. Playing parents is for mature people who are responsible for their sexual conquests.
"As long as people like them live in Texas, they'll always be in a prison like environment without any control over their own bodies. The only solution for them is to relocate to a State where the State Government doesn't interfere in their personal lives."
IF SHE died that is one death. Compare that to 50 million babies murdered since 1973.
I am so pissed this isn’t right and now these people may never be able to try again for another child because of something preventable
They could have not listened to the doctors and had faith. But no. They speak nothing but negative now. And are used by a network that drip feeds child murderers who are desperate to f*ck and kill.
Old white men who control Texas decide when a woman can get medical care or not. They way they feel is woman are nothing more than a host for a baby.
Absolutely horrid and a total shame 😞
Not being able to murder a baby did what 😮
Almost only counts in Horseshoes
"This woman was sacrificed to make a stupid point. The fact that the law was vague at the time was all the more reason to go ahead and perform the life saving procedure. It was a stupid defiant excuse to wait and not help this woman. Why do people have to be so extreme? Is balance too hard of a concept for humans? On one side they want to abort all and on the other side they want to separate none from the mother. None, why not?  Isn't that what the NICU is for? Also how difficult is it to check for a heartbeat? The baby was obviously on its way out. They could have checked for a heartbeat everyday until there was none. They could have induced labor. They maybe could have replaced the amniotic fluid and repaired the sac."
I am glad she cant have kids because having kids is selfish and horrible. But I am also glad she still got to get the abortion. Pro Life should really be called Pro Sadists because they only want you born so you can suffer. They only care about us when we are not born. Once we are born they just want us to suffer. Thats why I wish all women would get an abortion because every abortion saves a child from being born in this trash world. I am for everything Trump does but the abortion bans are the only thing I dont like because I am only for abortions because I wish I was aborted and every time an abortion occurs a child is spared from being born and having to deal with this corrupt government and crooked school systems. Hopefully she wont be able to have kids because its not a good idea to force another human being into this trash. But I am also glad that most women know that when abortions are banned they can just end the pregnancy themselves. Thats what most women do anyway. They either end the pregnancy themselves or go out of state. Abortion bans only stops clinics. Not the actual abortion. Thank you to all the women out there who had an abortion. You saved a child from this trash world.
The infection is not what caused the scarring. It was the abortion. Abortion causes scarring and damage to the uterus because it causes trauma to the tissue.
Sounds like the doctors killing people cause they're afraid of liability.
"There's so many people being killed, why? Because their being told that life has no value! Do you value life? Give the baby a chance. Do to others as you would have them do to you. Matthew 7:12 If the tables were turned would it have been okay for your baby to abort you? Instead repent/believe in God's son Jesus, he loves you and can change your heart."
"Maybe people should care less about an unborn child and more about actual fully grown human beings
People are getting dumber by the day"
Sue the Texas legislature and sue the hospital
"The Texas women who voted for Abbott and the Texas GOP, I have no sympathy for you when you find yourself in this situation this is what you voted for! Beto would have got rid of this extreme law SB8"
That is awful...smh. Ridiculous.
"Abortion = killing in horrible pain of unborn children. Abortion by saline injection feels like being burned alive, while abortion by curettage rips off all the child's body parts (imagine how that feels). The nervous system is already developed at 6 weeks, so that the pain these children feel are very real (but unlike pro-abortionists, they do not have a voice to express themselves). With the exceptions of the pregnancies that put the mother life in danger (which are very rare), abortions should be illegal. If a driver kills a pregnant woman on a pedestrian crossing, that driver faces TWO charges for murder (in that context, the life of the baby matters). Instead, if his mom decides to kill him in horrible pain, suddenly that is not a crime anymore?"
"Well, this really wasn't an abortion because the baby was essentially dead already.   Needless to say, no doctor wanted to touch her for fear of being sued or prosecuted.   Texas anti-abortion law probably needs to be tweaked."
😢
To hell with Greg abbott and to hell with this rotten anti abortion movement
"Do a caesarean and try to save the baby. Prob wont make it, but thats more prolife"
Dont kill babies
"This is totally BS, they let people have abortions in life threatening situation's, incest or rape, another out right lie of the radical enemy of the people CNN not surprised, some people need to wake up, their book smart but don't have any common sense what so ever, y'all better learn your rights so people and establishments like this can't incite and brain wash you!"
"Babies this age are usually born totally fine without any complications. If your water breaks before 34 weeks, your doctor will probably give you antibiotics to fend off potential infections, plus steroids to help your baby's lungs develop. You may have to stay in the hospital to be monitored for signs of labor."
"None of cnn's story made sense medically, if her water broke she should have been made to deliver the baby. When your water breaks it doesn't mean your baby is going to die, it means you have to give birth, Cnn is getting desperate. Like wtf"
Such a disgusting lie. You don't perform an abortion for PPROM you induce labor. CNN is lying through their teeth right now. Virtually all abortions are performed to terminate an otherwise healthy baby.
What an awful situation.
"I was certain comments would be turned off. Another unnecessary tragedy. Hope they had the best insurance you can buy, being bankrupted is the next notch in the American way"
Imagine having to keep A DECAYING DEAD BABY INSIDE YOUR UTERUS becasue of the government
"Don't tell the truth here and expect it to stay, tried twice now and realized it was CNN, move on."
I’m a Christian. So obviously I heavily disagree with abortion. No one I know is for it. So I want some people to reply why it’s right. Especially pro-life Christians. I want it to be a respectful debate so I can understand why you people think abortion is right
"This doesn't make any medical sense whatsoever. 

If your water broke, delivery should have been induced. 

None of this adds up. 

But keep pushing this propaganda as if it's factual."
If the doctor cant set his foot down and say the only way we can save the woman is to deliver the baby (and pray work and hope the best for the baby) the doctor laces  bone in the nose and should not be a doctor    and that people working in heltcare  are turning this uppsid down putting people at risk to make a point  and te point being we dont have the balls to stand upp for life Just hiding behind the law of No abortion to not take a needed desision of delivering to save the women is putting bouth the lives at risk  I am pro life all the human lifes and sometimes hard desisjons have to be made  bretter to save one than none but if possible tray to save bouth
"“When pregnant, the cells of the baby migrate into the mothers bloodstream and then circle back into the baby, it’s called “fetal-maternal microchimerism”.⁠

For 41 weeks, the cells circulate and merge backwards and forwards, and after the baby is born, many of these cells stay in the mother’s body, leaving a permanent imprint in the mothers tissues, bones, brain, and skin, and often stay there for decades. Every single child a mother has afterwards will leave a similar imprint on her body, too.

Even if a pregnancy doesn't go to full term or if you have an abortion, these cells still migrate into your bloodstream.

Research has shown that if a mother's heart is injured, fetal cells will rush to the site of the injury and change into different types of cells that specialize in mending the heart.

The baby helps repair the mother, while the mother builds the baby.

How cool is that?

This is often why certain illnesses vanish while pregnant.

It’s incredible how mothers bodies protect the baby at all costs, and the baby protects & rebuilds the mother back - so that the baby can develop safely and survive.

Think about crazy cravings for a moment. What was the mother deficient in that the baby made them crave?

Studies have also shown cells from a fetus in a mothers brain 18 years after she gave birth. How amazing is that?”

If you’re a mom you know how you can intuitively feel your child even when they are not there….Well, now there is scientific proof that moms carry them for years and years even after they have given birth to them.

I find this to be so very beautiful.
Just a clump of cells right?"
Don't Murder Your Children
Prefers the castration cry from school kids due to school imposed sex change...
"The Republican Church- ""That's too bad. But Our imaginary deity still wants us to force all women and girls to comply with our religious beliefs."""
I call B.S. SAVE THE BABY MOMMA'S GOING TO HELL
(Murder) MAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE!!!!
Why do they continue to vote 🗳️ for abbot against their self interest? He just won re-election despite all the things he’s done and continues to do
Texas is a pro life state. Murderers of innocent babies need to live elsewhere. We don't have 20 pro life cities in the state for no reason.
"The GOP do not care about this.  They don't care!  To them, a few dead women here and there, a few women in ICU who become infertile after being denied treatment - this is a price worth paying.  Don't expect sympathy or revised laws from the GOP.  They do not care about anyone other than ""the fetus"", right up until it's born.  Then if you dare ask for assistance, you are a deadbeat welfare cheat, sucking the nation dry on benefits."
Abortion should remain legal but only for liberals same as suicide
"Well, I hope all you anti abortion people are happy"
So it's apparent the baby died?
My mother is a cps worker and saw she was so upset and asked her what was wrong . She came to see a child that was in a watchlist. She found out the girl was pregnant. She’s only 13 . She was molested how can she be a mother . She’s barely trying to figure out her life. I don’t understand why a child needs to be forced to have a child ??! I don’t understand why people choose to point fingers at women who aren’t even ready to be mothers yet there is nobody doing anything to help out in adoption centers.
"There is nothing in Texas that prevented Amanda from receiving the medical procedure to remove the already dead baby. This is not an abortion and not related to pro life bills in any way. These are activist doctors who played with a woman's life rather than giving her the care she needed. We now have activists pretending to be journalists using this woman's tragedy to further an agenda to electively murder as many babies as they can.

You people are vile."
"I love how abortion is ""murder"" but creating a law preventing a women from being saved when she's dieing isn't. What the actual fuck. This is such a violation of women's rights is sickening."
Ohno
These anti-abortion fantastic need to say out of people’s business
What this coouple went through is horrible and inhumane on multiple levels. And what happened to them makes me very glad to be living in California.
Oh well....
"And 63,459, 781 baby girls and boys have actually died because over 63 million women were given one."
"I think those elections need To be scrutinized , gone over with a fine tooth comb. He cheated I know it."
She needs to SUE GREG ABBOTT THE CAVEMAN
"So tell me, how did the caveman  abbott get reelected ???? Don't get pregnant in texas...that's all I gotta say..."
So I'm guessing the killer mom killed the baby?
What I want to know is did she voted for GOP politicians who pushed for abortion ban? If she did then she'd needs to shut and put up with GOP policies/laws. What did women in these red states think when they're voted for Republican politicians? Republican politicians do not advocate for women!
"I am a republican, and I am first hear say how sorry I am for Amanda. Next these abortion laws need to be for causes between a woman and doctor but only for the right reason. Not just to get an abortion because you don’t feel like you want to be pregnant that is murder"
Yes women will die and you can thank Republikkkans.
It's always a bad idea for ignorant politicians to make decisions that a Doctor should make.
Right-wing and Christian conservatives don't care if you almost die after being denied an abortion. They care if you have sex.
How all the babies died in the abortion
"I had severe sepsis after getting some of my bowel removed. I was septic for 3 days and was told it was in my head. I prepared for death and everything. Told my parents not to come visit me that day. I was very very lucky because usually when sepsis symptoms shows itself, it's already too late. Was revived 4 times in the OR"
"Never forget: ""pro life"" = ""oppress women"""
Awful yes. But this is a VERY isolated event. Doesn't happen very often. Leave it to cnn to push an agenda and try to make the public believe it's a national emergency. Just like covid which was bs too
Now do one about how thousands of children die daily BECAUSE they're aborted.
"Let people make their own choices, and let God discern their hearts not you. People wish they were masters over others, smh. Grow up."
"That's what you get for living in Texas, a state where people elect a government that enjoys your suffering. Enjoy 4, 8,16, possibly 32+ more years of this happening to women in Texas, where ""God"" guns and football are more important than your freedom"
"Abortion is a disgusting act. But Abortion should only be applied under certain circumstances. It's shouldn't be I got pregnant I don't want the baby I am not ready , my body my decision type of reasoning to get rid of the unborn because that would only promote irresponsibility on both men and women. On her case on other hand, the doctor or the hospital should have done something about and put it into details why she is required to have one. It is their responsibility to defend the need of their patient since it a life threatening case. It is common sense. I'm pro-life anti-abortion. Again Abortion isn't applicable to all so don't abuse it."
"This is beyond ridiculous and barbaric in 2022. She almost died amd now likley can't have children. It's like the government in the U.S. have zero education, common sense and empathy.  
 Come on!!!! We have the resources to help and save lives, relieve suffering. What happened to her medically wirg the pregnancy was tragic enough. This is not the 1700s."
Some lawsuits needs to be filed
Yea got no shame pro choice all day
😥
"Of all people you would think that ""oppressed victims"" would be the ones to care for these little ones ¿¿ Every man for himself I guess ?? ..or shall I say every ""victim."" 

Imagine a world where people don't care about babies being murdered in the womb, and where Life itself isn't a basic human right ?? Now add a zombie apocalypse and rants about ""justice"" and ""equality""?? 

..or here's one ""stop controlling my Life"" followed by fighting for the power to snuff out someone else’s Life ¿¿ 🤨 ..yes I need the freedom to snuff out a perfectly healthy little baby in the womb because I'm against ""crazy people trying to control women"" ¿¿ You just can't make this circus show up, it's pure comedy yet still very twisted and sick."
"You all in Texas still put back the idiots in power, so!!!!!!!!"
Remember the Republicans are the prolife party🤦‍♂️.
"Basically turning a perfectly healthy baby into hazardous medical waste is now ""healthcare"" ?? 

Via ""a woman'$ medical deci$ion"" hundreds of thousands of pre-born black babies are aborted every year, and millions have become hazardous medical waste since 1973. All we need now are some white robes and pointed masks 🤫 Who would've thought?? ..all this woke ""liberation"" is starting to make Republikkkans look like a bunch of saints.

..and how odd it's only ""a baby"" when it fits the narrative ¿¿ We need to care about mothers being in danger while our most vulnerable in society are being murdered ¿¿ ..and tough luck I guess you can't be ""oppressed"" or a ""minority"" if you're in the womb ?? ..there's no place for you in this WORLD OF VICTIM$!??"
"This is unfortunately the inevitable consequence of this fascist and insane policies by republicans.  But republicans don't care if women die because of the sick and intolerant policies.  To them it is all about maintaining power at all costs.  

At some point the public will become educated enough and remove the cancer that infects Texas politics as well as many other red states."
"This is not just a problem in states with anti abortion laws. 

Catholic hospitals will never provide abortions as medical care. They will let the mother die to save her immortal soul."
Get a good lawyer! This isnt right!!
This is how GOP cares about people?!
"So, I wonder what all the pro-lifers have to say about this that all said that the mothers life isnt at risk and when it is she can abort..."
SUE THE LAW MAKERS!!!!! SUE SUE SUE!!!!!!
"Barbie's Abortion ""Barbie's Abortion""
https://youtu.be/RW1f3yLHiY4"
"Exodus 21, for example, suggests that a pregnant woman’s life is more valuable than the fetus’s. This text describes a scenario in which men who are fighting strike a pregnant woman and cause her to miscarry. A monetary fine is imposed if the woman suffers no other harm beyond the miscarriage. However, if the woman suffers additional harm, the perpetrator’s punishment is to suffer reciprocal harm, up to life for life."
Yet Texas keep going red.
Laws made by people in offices sick
A New Jersey woman was killed waiting for a gun permit because of her abusive boyfriend. You know. An actual right that none of you seem to care about.
Maybe women should do a better job at vetting their sexual partners. This is 100% women’s fault. Maybe they should be more responsible eh?
Restore roe!
Oh come on already. If it's a medical emergency it can be done.
Where are the pro-life Republican commenters at? What do you have to say about this? I noticed none of you are commenting. Because there is no defense for controlling a persons life.
CNN is ran by Satanist
Mother's killing their children . Change my mind .
Sorry don’t believe this
Quit voting for republicans.
As more cases are Iike this happen it wiII turn the most conservative person and their entire famiIy to vote bIue.
Horse crap. I work in obstetrics and they could have admitted and given IV antibiotics to mom to prevent infection they do it all the time. Infection is not the fault of the baby and abortion would not have prevented it. Dumbass people believe whatever for the benefit of this assault against unborn babies and children. 😡
Time for governments and insurance companies to back out of health care.  Leave the decisions up to qualified physicians.
"This is what happens when you rush through a law without thought or discussion. It is MASSIVELY irresponsible on the part of lawmakers. Folks, get the heck out of Texas and Florida, before this happens to YOU."
Apparently Pro lifers don't care about the life of the mother
It sounds like she was just used as a political piece of the game.  Her abortion was medical needed. There was no reason doctor didn't give her one. They knew everything that would happen to her if they didn't do it. Abortion that are just use by women as birth control is what should be stop. Not this.
"Ah.... good ole Texas..... the hell hole of America.

Thank god I live in a blue state.🙏🏾"
They both look like they need more sleep
"Well, women in Texas have done this to themselves. Good luck, you keep voting for misogynistic men and this is what you get. Women literally voted for turning women into property."
"Texas  white women voted overwhelmingly for walking crime wave  Cheetos Jesus,   Who put  Far Right Extreme Judges on the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade. Yea!  do that,  Vote for him again."
"Kinda like the babies life that is denied?  Gtfo out of this country, u sex obsessed disgusting baby killers"
Prayers for this couple. This is the true consequences of not thinking through  overturning Roe vs Wade. Hope more women and their partners see this so they make sure this doesn’t happen again.
"I worked in womens health always did d&c after incomplete miscarriage
Why is this a political issue and not a medical issue because their asking for trouble if this continues and women could sue the government for negligence of care"
"GOP Response: 
How did we lose Women’s vote 🗳? 
How did we lose Gen Z vote 🗳? 
Anti-woman policies!"
They won't answer because there are all stupid people.
If the GOP now pretends to moderate on issues like abortion - don't buy it! The will LIE like their scotus nominees. 2024 must be more blue (or independent). Pro-choice Republicans want to have their cake and eat it too. It won't work. Fanatics never rest. MAGA = Taliban
The healthcare in US is so much worse than in many really poor countries. Its not socialism to pay for your healthcare via your taxes...
So then maybe you should stop voting for people who would rather let you die .
OH. NO.... NOBODY SHOULD BE PUT THROUGH THIS.  .I COULDN'T IMAGINE.. ..MY PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU GIRL.....YOUR. FAMILY IS BEAUTIFUL.... GREATFUL SHE HAS A GOOD HUSBAND.   THIS IS JUST WRONG.   I WAS 11 RAPED. BY 10 MEN. N. LEFT FOR DEAD....OMG. WHAT IF I HAD GOTTEN PREGNANT . .I WAS. DEVOLVED. EARLY ..BUT. WAS. A CHILD......THEY HAVE GREATER TECHNOLOGY NOW....I AM TRULY SORRY. .. I'VE.

KEPT A CHILD...I WAS. A CHILD
Stop having b.a.r.e. sex lady and you might keep your life
Yet another victim of Dobbs that wouldn’t have been had it not happened
"Republicans don’t care about a woman’s life.  This religious right wing wants to control women and kill them over their religious beliefs. 
 

What ever happened to separation of church and state ?

We are not England."
Being a Texan is often embarrassing.
Her race isn't the most terminating babies. Its blacks
Stupid Texas laws.  Last year I had a Septic infection in my bladder from a kidney stone day surgery operation that went bad.  I almost died and I was rushed back to the hospital by ambulance when I had a temp of 105.  It was very scary.  I was in the hospital for 10 days on IV antibiotics.  This is not an infection to play around with.  This lady could had died because the doctors had their hands tied for these ridiculous barbaric laws.   If I were them I would move out of Texas.
"You get what you vote for. Leave Texas, if you're smart."
Move out of the state . I feel incredibly sad and bad for this couple and so many others
"Texas state elected legislators not doctors almost cost this woman her life with their ignorance and may have destroyed her ability to have future children. This is why a bunch of idiots shouldn't be given this kind of power. I hope she sues the Texas State lawmakers to Hell and back.

In what can only be seen as a punitive and hateful punishment of women who have abortions, Tea Party Georgia Republican Rep. Terry England, in support of a bill which would ban abortions after 20 weeks (HR 954), says that women should be forced to carry dead fetuses to term. Why? Because cows and pigs have to do it and that’s apparently how his god wants it. Never mind the health risk to mothers being forced to carry dead fetuses to term. Republicans hate mothers and want them to die early and often.


Legalizing the Murder of Abortion Doctors Tea Party 2012 
South Dakota tried to pass a law to make the murder of an abortion doctor legal as self-defense
When South Dakota was forced to drop the idea of murdering abortion doctors, Nebraska and Iowa picked up the idea See also HB 3308 Life Defense Act of 2012 which has implications in this regard."
Made up story
"RIP Little Angel Vote does those idiot’s out of the SENATE,the House never another President who doesn’t support abortion rights 😢😢😢"
"So.... old guys determine that women are not allowed abortion. They don't have a womb so they can't give birth. How can they even think about it. These old men have no clue at all, let alone about politics.........."
"Nothing to do with the anti abortion law.
This law doesn't prevent abortion if the doctor judgement feels that the mother is risking her life.
So it was a WRONG human medical decision.
My prayers for Amanda and Josh, I know what they feel."
This is bullshit propaganda. Dislike.
"I'M REALLY, REALLY, REALLY SORRY FOR THIS COUPLE!!!!

BUT ‼️‼️‼️‼️
THAT'S WHAT TEXANS VOTE FOR AGAIN AND AGAIN ‼️‼️‼️
THERE WAS A REAL CHANCE TO CHANGE THAT AND BRING FREEDOM AND SAFETY BACK FOR WEMON
AND FOR SCHOOL KIDS

BUT NO ‼️‼️‼️. TAXANS DECIDE THEY CARE A 💩💩💩 ABOUT WEMON, CHILDREN AND PEOPLE AT ALL.

SO, SORRY BUT NOW YOU ALL HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE A BETTER DECISION NEXT TIME ‼️‼️‼️"
Fake propaganda. She could have had a c section and removed the dead baby
"I'm going to tell some thing not expected at all
if Texas under islamic law non of that happened .
I'm just saying 🤷"
Most women who want to get an abortion aren’t at risk like this lady 😂 Pro life and pro choice are both wrong. It should be in the middle closer to pro life. You have 8-10 weeks to ‘figure it out’ or else you gotta keep that baby. Simple. You pro choice retards get your choice and you pro life morons get your wish.
...
There was a good set of reasons for ROE v Wade.... we WILL remember WHY it HAD to pass.  The toll of human suffering was abhorrent.   If Anti abortionists don't want one don't get one.      SHOW us FIRST how you became the superior person....     Save Up and Adopt EACH AND EVERY ONE of those wee babies birthed by ill prepared parents. Gonna do that?       Not Too Chickensh*t are ya?             WRITE THE CHECK and keep your Mind on your own damn crotches....
"How many more lives will be at risk of being lost needlessly? How many more will suffer damage by these barbaric restrictions? How many more lives will be forever scared?

So sorry for your loss and your health issue. You telling your story helps so many more to understand the reality of the new law. Please know that the majority of Americans believe your heartbreaking story should never happen again. The blessing is that you both have each other and your Love is probably stronger as a result if your tragedy."
Yep welcome to 2022 inconceivable and what a shame that men laws can decide how a woman can do with her own body.
Fake news.  Doctors wouldn’t leave a miscarriage to decay.  Don’t believe the propaganda.
"People just don't realise how disastrous being anti-abortion is until it hits them, personally. I know that life is precious. This woman's should be JUST as precious as her unborn child's was. But, that's not how she was treated. Shame on the doctors!

I'm sorry for what they went through. It didn't seem to matter to the rest of Texas, though. They re-elected Abbott and I'm sure all of their House Representatives on the national level are Republican.

No amount of stories like these or what happened to the 10 year old in Ohio are enough to sway these monsters."
"Put aside the fact that they had to focus on a “nice, white, homely couple” who “met in kindergarten”, when there’s undoubtedly 100,000 of the same stories in black & brown communities, THIS is the travesty of American anti-women laws. You’re abhorrent USA."
"Common, those that voted for Republicans to represent them, your vote for any republican has caused this and many more. Own this couple's pain and anguish, i hope this pain befalls all that voted republicans into office.."
Shame on people who vote for this
"Abortion is every woman's choice across the majority of the world.
Republicans are like Taliban men dictating what subjugated women should do. Land of freedom?
The US constitution has been amended 27 times and is the reason they are called amendments."
And yet they kept electing those same people that are opposing those laws or just they didn't vote... The only people i'm sorry for are the people that did vote for the right persons and get dragged down with the rest of the stupid fanatics
This is all GOP BS.  Punt Abbot for his ineptitude
She's high risk for issues with another pregnancy and does she want to risk that while living in Texas?  She could die for sure.
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners, immigrants, the sick, the poor, widows, orphans. All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible, they all get thrown under the bus for the unborn"
I'm so sorry for your loss and heartbreak.
"She’s not dead though, and most abortions aren’t to protect the life of the mother.  Most are for convenience."
"Nothing is going to change in Texas until businesses and more citizens affected by these extremist laws start standing up and speaking out to not only Abbott's office but to the state's courts as well.  As long as you live in Texas with Abbott as governor, he will continue to force you to live by ""his principles!"" Blue voters need to start reaching out to rural and suburban Texas because those are the places that kept Abbott governor of Texas. He probably thinks you both are sinners and deserved what happened. Imagine someone running your state that thinks that way about you. 😢"
One shouldn't get pregnant in such a state. Young couples should leave. Too much risk.
This is going to become a more and more common story if these barbaric anti-choice laws continue being implemented 🤦glad she didn't fucking die.
"That sounds more like a hospital who didn't know how to interpret the law. It's clear in this video, she qualified the moment her water broke. She should sue the hospital."
republican polices are responsible women are second class citizens thanks to them
"Almost died = still alive.
Am I correct?"
Texans who voted for Abbott and the other Republicans should share the blame for this!!
"Well, Texas… They keep on electing the same people who brought them nightmare."
"Blame the republicans and their barbaric christians "" pro life """
There has to be a law firm willing to take these cases pro bono & sue the States.
That is despicable that Amanda did not receive the care she desperately needed 😡 Shame on Texas and their barbaric and backwards laws. I would never live in that state even if you paid me . God bless you Amanda for your strength.
I just think that baby almost died before she got done an abortion
They should sue the state!
"And yet, most Texans still voted Abbott in as a governor!!
They will never learn!!!"
"Used to want to go to Texas...but with these barbaric laws, the racist governor,  & judges giving murderers bond...it would be the last place I'd want to go !?"
I hope we elect Warnock is so much more competent. Pro-Choice and he was co sponsor of S.53 - Raise the Wage Act of 2021. Hope it passes in the Senate. Too bad we don’t have the 🏠.
I would get a damn good lawyer and find a way to sue the state.
"Dose CNN Ever report About a baby that was not Murdered 😮. 
Or report alive saved from somebody’s bad decision from a night of drinking 😢
However medical required termination should be automatic if Complications arise."
By the GOP packing the Supreme Court and planning the demise of abortion rights more women might end up like that woman or die. Roe vs Wade MUST BE CODIFIED.
It's incomprehensible to me how people keep voting for people like Abbott and his cronies from Hell who make these laws.
You didn't mention the names of the ones you contacted and refused to comment. Why?
She doesn’t have to live in Texas. There’s plenty of states she can go to vacuum her baby out if her. She didn’t die so what’s the fuss? The left is all about killing babies and grooming children
"Doctors could stop this. They are cowards. They could easily band together and do right by their patients and  not the expedient political thing.  But their country club lifestyle is at stake, can't have that jeopardized."
And yet Texan still voted for Republican. So what that tell u?
I think America needs the Iranian women to show them how it's done
Thanks to Republicans.
Based Texas.
Sounds like they passed laws halfbaked.
Talking about one woman we are talking about thousands of babies being murdered. She is still alive all the babies are dead.
I guess this is what happens when politicians make the medical  decisions and not the physician. We already have an AG threaten criminal case against the physician who performed the abortion the 10 year old case. So I can see why physicians feel like their hands are completely tied with anything concerning abortion.
"After being a republican for almost years 20, I'll never vote for them again.  This makes my blood boil."
Żurawski is a Polish surname. Unfortunately similar cases caused deaths of women in Poland because of barbaric law. People do fight for our human rights across the borders!!!
No story on the guy whole stole billions of dollars and funneled it through the democrat party through Ukraine our tax money what nobody cares about that. That’s just shows you how messed this world really is
What a bunch of bull shit. Talk about pushing an agenda. Just call yourself the Democrat news network
"This is a Governor that believes he is making the right decision for all women regardless of the outcome and Texas keeps voting the 3 pack back in. Women need to unite and bring a major lawsuit. 
I am so sorry for what this young couple had to insure. No one is a second class citizen. Blessings and love from San Antonio Texas. ❤️❤️❤️"
These laws are pro death if anything.
You need to move to state that can help you when pregnant for all women.
Murdering a million Americans with covid wasn't enough for the bloodthirsty pro-life crowd.  They're going for another million in childbirth.  They have zero respect for human life.  That's always been fake news.
Where I come from doctors would put saving a life before the law and the courts would agree.
"Thanks to the unaccountable Catholic oligarchy known as the Supreme Court, woman like Amanda can now be hunted by vigilantes for a $10,000 cash bounty and force to prove, in court, that they suffered a miscarriage, not an abortion.  Morally foul religious right builds its path to power on the *destruction* of women."
"Politicians who try to kill pregnant women must not be allowed to stand for election in a free democracy! Even the Taliban are more advanced in human rights then Republicans these days!
Wake up, American conservatives, you are voting for criminal assault and female mass murder!"
Thanks Greg.
This makes my blood boil. How can Republicans be so f..ken stupid.
The government should not have the rights to a WOMAN'S BODY!!!🤬🤬🤬
🤡
good heavens. i say those doctors are cowards.  they could have defended earlier actions to save her life...blessings to all
"Republicans would rather have a fetus burst through a woman's abdomen like an Alien then claim it was ""God's Will"" with a Trumpy smirking shrug than let her terminate an unviable and deadly pregnancy."
Crazy shit! Leave our bodies  ourselves!!!
Nazi doctors were better than republicans
I’m so sad and angry. I think this whole situation is ridiculous
My biggest nightmare is literally coming true. Wtaf. All decided by men who will never ever comprehend or understand the joy and horror of carrying life.
"This story just breaks my heart in ways I can't describe!!

Politicians need to get OUT of our Healthcare!!!!!!!!"
https://youtu.be/lDX52pEC7_w
Congratulations Republicans   you can't blame the Dems for this one
"How about all the failed abortions on when the baby was born and taken to a room to die??
They were issued both life and death certificates
https://youtu.be/lDX52pEC7_w"
"This is TOTAL OUTRAGEOUS!!!

GOT OUT OF TEXAS.... FAST!!!"
"And what about all the babies that did die because they were denied a life to live? It’s crazy how people don’t care. Reproductive Rights, oxymoron. Call it what it is, Terminating Rights."
SWEETIE I'M SORRY...WAS RAPED BY 10 MEN. AND WHAT IF I HAD GOTTEN PREGNANT...WAS LEFT FOR. DEAD.   MY. HEART GOES OUT TO YOU ..I CAN'T HAVE KIDS CAUSE THEY DAMMAGED. ME.....I AM PRAYING FOR YOU ALWAYS... . MATHEW 4.24 ...BLESS YOU BOTH
What a nightmare! I'm so sorry you lived and are still living through it. :(
Young parents do not have a certain future in Texas and neither do children. Neither do doctors. Death to barbarism.
How is it an abortion if the cells are already dead? I’m so confused.
If she died trumptards would say it was god's will. 🙄
"I almost died walking across the street, what’s your point?"
One of my best friends died from sepsis two days after her child was born.
She probably would have gotten less  time for shooting a Texas politician than a doctor performing a life saving abortion in some states. This is what it has come down to.
I know this network isn’t considered a news station. But don’t they have some sort of obligation to telling the truth or is it simply what democrats want to hear? Where’s Jackie?
"Welcome to America in 2022 ...moving forward :(
And for all the dems wins...there are so many places now where womens lives are at risk daily.  So sad...but we still gave women killers the house...:("
"My heart goes out to Amanda and her husband. The anti abortion laws should be fine-tuned to better address Amanda's situation. But there should still be a total ban on elective abortions. The extreme cases like Amanda's are extremely rare (less than 1%). I'm not mad that CNN is showing the extreme cases, one life lost is many. But the lawmakers should fine-tune the laws to serve the people better. Our mantra is ""Save them Both"". We need both the mother and her child alive."
omg this makes me so sad.
"0ver 300,000 babies murdered in one year by Planned Parenthood!!!"
Thanks Ted?
"Marsha here. ABORTION HAS NEVER BEEN A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT??? Planned Parenthood, which has a financial interest in keeping abortion on demand legal, will keep fighting at the state and national level to make abortion a (BS) constitutional “right” again. The organization’s most recent annual report showed a record number of abortions (383,460) and a record revenue ($1.7 billion)."
All the dumbasses who want abortion banned no matter what 🖕🏼
This could have been prevented by not fucking in the first place
"While I detest the idea of abortion (I believe it's murder), I also believe there are certain times when an abortion would be necessary. For instance, if the mother's life were in danger. The people that make me mad are the ones who get an abortion ""just because"" or ""it' an inconvenience to me"" or worst of all, they see a potential human being as nothing more than a mere parasite. Abortion should be left for each state to decide, not the federal government as a whole. All life is sacred, no matter where you come from, and all life deserves a chance to enter the world."
That's what happens when the Republicans (particularly the ones in the Supreme Court) decide to do more harm than good.
The US is quickly becoming a global pariah
Lmfao. False. Can't believe anything from CNN. Trump 2024!
"📝🖌📝🖌📝🖌📝🖌📝🖌✏️📝🖌📝HOW TO BE SAVED:
There Is only one God, in three persons, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.  ONE God.
Humans are ONE person ( in three parts) The body, soul and spirit.  Three parts, ONE person.
The Bible says that we are all sinners.
As it is written:  There is none righteous , no not one.  Romans 3:10
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.Romans 3:23
But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness are as filthy rags. Isaiah 64:6
For the wages of sin is death. Romans 6:23  (The word death in this verse means eternal separation from God in hell).
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Isaiah 1:18
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that He was buried and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures. 1Corinthians 15:3-8
In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Colossians 1:14
For by grace ye are saved, through faith; and not of yourselves.
It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9
I do not frustrate the grace of God, for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.  Galatians 2:21
If you would like to receive Jesus as your Savior.  Realize that you are a hopeless sinner and tell Jesus that you trust in Him and only Him to save you from hell.
Your trust in Jesus and His shed blood on the cross to pay for your sins, is what saves you from hell.
The moment you trust in Jesus and only Jesus, you are saved.
Then, you should be  baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
"Hello bots 👋
And the women who almost die from getting one?
Won't cover that. SANTINO BLANCO"
"But it's okay to kill the baby, huh? This is political BS, and you think it's all about DEMOCRACY at stake? Our democracy will never be at stake, for we are a constitutional Republic! Definitely need some term-limits on our SCOTUS though, Left and Right!"
you should be protecting the option of abortion for people who weren't impregnated by their high school sweethearts.. that was an unnecessary detail.
"This is why the government should never get involved in a woman's health care.  An abortion is a medical proceedure.  It is up to the woman, her doctor, her family and her god.  It is no one else's business. Period!!!"
They still voted for Abbott sorry you get what you vote for sorry but they will be more
The GOP doesn't care about women health or rights.
"It's not pro-life or anything, ots BEING RESPONSIBLE WITH WHAT ONE DOES WITH THEIR OWN BODIES BEFORE THEY NEED SURGERY  (and then special cases: incest victims ,rape victims and special circumstances that threaten life) so stop the fighting and realize it's ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE!!!!!"
"I think these doctors are cowards, they take the hypocritic oath and do nothing. In the past people with clout have gone to jail for their believes .It happened in ireland and a woman died, but the laws were changed she did not die in vain.If a doctor had aborted the fetus no court would have convicted him there would have been hell to pay."
Absolutely abhorrent. These laws are insane. Shame on anyone who pushed for this.
"There is nothing at all ""pro-life"" about a Doctor having to wait until a woman is near death, suffering through Sepsis with a temperature of 104, before they can legally remove her naturally dying fetus."
Here we go again with CNN not using common sense just common ignorance. Any FACTS on the total number of people that this happens to. CNN thanks for the useless non-information again. How many clicks did you get?
Propaganda roll out post midterms
So sad. This didn’t have to be this way. This story needs to be told so the law can be amended to protect Moms.
Also Republicans: “We don’t understand how we lost women and Gen Z in these midterm elections. . . “
I am Still surprised Kkk QOP Abbot still in office .
An abortion always ends a human life
They call Texas The Lone Star State not because of what’s on our flag but because that’s what our state is rated……one star!
I believe there will be more of these stories over the next 2 years. I’m sure it will affect the next election.
"When our border is secure, we can deal with this."
"If you want somebody to blame for this, blame Christians."
"So Republicans,  you're now feeling the ramifications of your laws. Hell hath no fury than a woman scorned or suffering.  They'll make you regret passing those laws."
"Texas is like living in a other country, and I can't tell you what country but it's a very discrimination nation."
Why anyone would live in a 3rd world $#it hole like Texas is beyond me. It's hard to believe that place exists in a western democratic country.
"One thing that we the people know: Social Conservatives follow the principle of ""the ends justify the means.""  They lie, cheat and deceive for what they claim is their God.  Doing such immoral actions for God means that they can justify any unethical behavior (e.g., winning at all cost, God sanctions slavery, flying jets into World Trade Center buildings, etc.).  And they do justify any and all of their unethical behavior.  Nothing good nor decent has ever come from social conservatism."
"Bs. Here's one, Equality is a two way street. If you wanna keep pushing infanticide and calling it ""bodily autonomy"" then it's time to talk about ending routine infant circumcision and starting federal protections for bodily autonomy for both genders, and address the fact that only one gender has had their bodily autonomy protected by law for decades now. You can't only focus on women's issues and not even try to cover men's issues any, it doesn't work that way if you want true equality."
When a man can birth a baby out his body then he can have say as to life in the womb.
"This is the biggest bullshit story EVER !
So after all she got here abortion. It wasn’t as fast as she wanted. 
Where are the doctors  ? Why aren’t they there to confirm her danger ? Why are they there to confirm how sick she was ?"
I’m so sorry for your pain and sorrow. I say bring suit to the Texas legislature that made this stupid law. It is barbaric.
Fake news if a woman's life's in danger she can have an abortion that's between her and God.
"Anytime a woman is attacked over her healthcare it's misogyny. Anytime a woman nearly died or does die, it's misogyny. Any time a woman loses her fertility because of treatment delay, it's misogyny. Anytime a child who is raped is denied an abortion, it's misogyny. So called ""pro-life"" people are hypocrites who hate women and don't even support fully funded child care."
All hail Texas!
So sad
"Why can't Republicans ignore abortion? You know, like they do school shootings."
"Despite the economic downturn,I'm so happy☺️. I have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my $7,000 investment every 13days."
"Explain the 600,000 babies that actually DO die each year from abortions. Please report on this truth. She had a bad experience. 600,000 babies have a worse experience than her each year because of abortion. Can you please do a story on these 600,000 babies killed each year by abortion instead of the one mother that never came close to dying?  You liberals are propagandists. You all suck!  Fact!!  Cheers woke low IQ liberals!!"
I would advise any women of child bearing age to move out of Texas until those barbaric laws are changed. Those abortion laws are written by misogynistic power hungry men who have no medical knowledge or concern for a woman's health. And they are backed up by the corrupt members of the SCOTUS! 😡
It's just awful what Amanda and Josh went through. It's tragic that she might never be able to have a child. And I know this isn't the only case like this. The government has no business interfering in  a woman's medical decisions.
CNN this is beyond bs your creating hate and war.
"Don't Ya Love Cold Blooded American  Capitolism and Americans,,""Trumpers/Christians  telling another to medically receive  treatment They Only approve of!? Ain't that Coll. Go ahead, keep voting Republicans, Trumpism ,lol."
"Republicans can be pretty stupid at times, literally the only thing they are good for is kinda protecting the second amendment but they fail at that also"
You mean the baby almost lived
DEMS LOST THE HOUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY RIGGED IT BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Can anyone here fathom 230000 illegals in a month? That's 30 days. Absolutely unbelievable. Wow!
Maybe take steps  to prevent pregnancy next time ?????
Come Back to the modele age.. How sad… Hope the doutor take off the dental anesthesia when those stupid and low  lawmakers and politics need dental care..This is America now …
Anyone who can see stories like this and still say abortion isn't health care is crazy... it's not pro life..
"Whooptie do.,."
Don’t expect republicans to care.
When y’all are ok with removing a full term baby piece by piece from the mom’s womb I have no sympathy
"Republican: ""Well, I guess she shouldn't have had sex with her husband anymore if she didn't want to die from an infection.""
Yes. Because that makes sense..."
More fear mongering.
Texas lawmakers CAN'T spell!
If she hadn't made it? There would of been incoming lawsuits towards law makers.
"It seems the law statement applies to the situation she was experiencing. The doctor seems the most liable to have not reacted, responded appropriately. Unfortunate their loss of the baby, seems they really wanted to deliver and care for the baby."
And Texans still voted Republican. Sick.
I have nothing to add but ARRRRGH you idiots. You're killing already born people to save wishes and prayers.
"So she could have one, except her doctors decided to play politics by blaming the laws even though it’s clear to any moron the law says she qualified… blame the activist doctors. 👍🏻"
"Boy, if I didn’t like this, I’d move to one of plenty of other states that do allow doctors to preemptively kill babies for ‘health sake’"
"No government should get involved in such a delicate, and private issue. Women would be encarcerated for political power, if it wasn't for the Democratic Party who has worked none stop to secured woman's protection from unscrupulous politicians, like Herschel Walker..."
As see the New Russian Republican party ☠️ 🖕 🤡 💩 🇷🇺  dosen't care if women will die. Because the Supreme Court and the Republican party wants  to run there lives.
I am so sorry to both of you and your baby. Willow is a beautiful name. This is because of politicians and doctors Running Scared. My mom had sepsis and died. I'm so happy you lived. Peace and love.
"HOW BARBARIC!! IS THE CORRECT WORDS. PRAYERS AND LUV FROM ONTARIO, CANADA."
And that abortion is as safe an operation as appendicitis? No woman was harmed during an abortion? the next step is forced abortion. The banks will decide if you have the means to have children. It's fair too
"Texas, explains everything."
That's what radical Republicans want for America!!Keep showing these stories until 2024 when  Democrats take back FULL control of Congress to codify Roe into law!
WTF already!
Texas does not care...hell under wheelies texas froze and children also the elderly passed. Do not forget the gun bill which is one of the reason why the tragedy in Uvalde happeded...texans choose that for them.
Nothing like a bunch of self riteous old men deciding health decisions for women.
"The USA, the first officially recognised 4th world country in the world."
Omg!  But still you voted for Abbott so....I guess other Texans don't care about you Amanda...how sad is that?!?!?  I pray you do have the children you so very much deserve!!!
You need to have abortion in law because of this shit 🤦
Texas it's the America's Afghanistan :D
"Amanda I am so sorry you had to go through this much  heartbreaking pain, stand strong, keep your hope and health up, we will fight with you."
That's so wrong!
And then we prayed …. Nope
How many more women are going to suffer or die due to facistism laws?
Wow situations like this kind of make me glad I don't have any kids😲
Yet these geniuses voted for these disgusting so called Republicans again!
Texas sucks!!!! So thankful I live in California
How did the baby fare?🤔
Sickening psychopaths.
"Stupid, right wing regressors. Uneducated, buybull driven idiocy. Trash that must control a woman. smh"
She was already born so the GOP don't care about HER life.
"Gen z voters got suckered by Joe,  no student loan handout
Use a coat hanger and keep your legs closed"
"Yet TEXAS voted for ABBOT … voted him in for a third time !!! Shame shame shame on all those that voted for that man !!!! 
They were sacred someone was gonna take away their guns … as if that would happen … well as I said SHAME ON TEXAS 😡😡😡"
Omg
"Big shout out to the GOP winning the house majority,  now subpoena Pelosi over January 6th"
What does this have to do the title?   CNN bullshit.
"Abortion on demand. 
No Questions Asked. 
It's not your business."
Thanks Lying Ted Cruz.
Did the baby survive?
I almost died skiing once I don't know why It didn't make it to CNN 🤔
"“How come when it’s us, it’s an abortion, and when it’s a chicken, it’s an omelette?” (George Carlin)"
"I'm standing up for the victims of abortion because they, obviously, lost their voice"
Torture and death is the point of the GOP. They want to make women suffer and slaves.
What a bs story.
