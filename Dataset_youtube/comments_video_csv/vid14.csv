She thinks this is an own. Haha
I want to salute all these people. You guys saved so many life. Keep doing it peacefully. Just offering support from a distance can help save lives and I mean for both mother and daughter.
"This large, wide, and strong women shouldn't have to worry. No one would want to grape her."
Abortion is wrong it is murder. I am thankful these men are standing up and trying to get through to these selfish women.
It is sad how people get singed of as creeps for trying to stop the killing of a child
"Abortions ARE, and always WILL BE, one of the most SICK and WICKED acts one could commit (smh)🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢.

Once I researched and SAW a video on something called ""Partial Abortion,"" I realized how CRUEL and AWEFUL abortions truly are 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮❗️❗️❗️

People SHOULD stand in front of clinics, such as these, and protest  🪧🪧🪧🪧🪧👍❗️"
"GODDAMN, these people need to GET A LIFE."
It is so so sad that it is necessary to have escorts in order for women to make their own choices regarding their own bodies 😢
"Before a child is born these people are so eager to protect it, but after a child is born,  they leave the child into the world to suffer. Substandard elementary education, substandard high school education, no healthcare, no free college, no parental leave for parents and no government aid. I think abortion is a lot less cruel than letting the child come and live in the USA"
"4:12
And 16280000 lives were lost to abortion since 1977."
I busted a gut when she said this is life risking work.  No kidding.  A life gets terminated almost everyday in this work.
And dont forget the psyco senator's. 😮
Mostly old white men. Vote Dems.
"Well, my grandmother raised me, but I sure am glad my mom had me but you know Women do you have the right to close their legs…."
She’s probably just jealous because well it look like she’s probably hang had  many offers…😮
"They're not ""protestors."" They're ""harassers."" nothing better to do."
"Why can't these pro-lifers care about kids who are actually alive? Like the kids being killed in schools? Get a job. Stop harassing people outside health clinics. And of course it's all men. You can't call yourself ""pro life"" if you're threatening a clinic."
"...Hey, wait a minuite.
No possible way ""Shelly"" is an escort. None."
"When we were a young broke couple my wife had female problems and needed a partial hysterectomy. Planned parenthood was the only ones out there that stepped up and would help with it all.  Every visit we had to walk through these people calling us names, not even knowing what we were there for. They made me a lifetime supporter of PP with their “protests”."
They are hypocrites. More religious women have abortions then everyone else look it up
Government needs to force vasectomies.  Eliminating the need for abortion.
Abortion is murder common sense. Hypocrite evil selfish human beings Repent Or perish Jesus Christ is God Almighty manifested in the flesh for mankind's sins Hallelujah forevermore AMEN 🙏💗🔥
"This video is so freaking bias!! If they were telling the truth they would say that those embryos/fetuses have a heart beat, brain signals, feelings and pain! That they are brutally killed alive in their mothers’ womb while they have each of their members pulled, twisted and pulled until it’s dismembered off their bodies, each arm and legs, then the body is pinched and pulled to achieve the same goal - rip off everything into pieces - until only the head is floating around into their womb and then the abortionist crushes it down with a tongue tool and sucks everything left with and intra vaginal vacuum. Minutes earlier though there was a happy and peaceful baby protected at his/her mother womb, the most sacred place they could/should be! 
And ohh, before I forget, they also forget to tell the women that she’ll most likely live forever with emotional and spiritual and/or physical damage - things that can vary from like hating men and having hard relationship issues, way higher chances of all sorts of cancer, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and tendencies, having their uterus perforated during the procedure, having a hard time trying to get pregnant again in the future when it’s desired, having nightmares with that lost child, feeling empty and hollow like they are only existing and like there’s no life left for them and yes, even dying!! 
So yes, while you all celebrate and fight for the right to kill another human being - a powerlessness one - while you celebrate this oppression to the weak, this ability to kill the most pure being that you’ll ever face, that one that can love you like nothing else, cure your heart and bring you strength like only God can, you deny the fact that your killing your soul in the process and that you’re losing hope for your own self! You’re getting cozy in hell! Good luck and keep finding excuses to let the Devil slowly carry you down to denial, as you say to yourself “all is well” but you know you can’t even find the light switch of your own existence anymore. 
I hope though, that when you realize that your inside of one of the darkest and the deepest hole that you could be living in, I hope you’ll know and remember that there’s One that died for your sins and that He’s waiting for you with open arms, with immeasurable love and peace that He’s the only one capable to offer. I hope your path into repentance will help you to find healing together with your real self while enjoying the real freedom that living with Christ can only bring. He lives!"
Thinking it’s ok to murder an unborn child is sick.
How many of these hypocrites have adopted kids
So you make killing babies easier by volunteering weekly to stop people who want to help.  Makes sense

"I am fed up with fake news and people who think killing innocent human beings is a right. 
29 year old female here. Go shove your pro-hate and pro-killing agenda. 
Abortion is murder. How about u stop pushing your morality on people in the womb."
If a woman chooses to have an abortion she should never be allowed to have children again
"Baby Inside🫄👶
Oh, baby inside
Soon will not be able to hide
What will I choose
If baby lives, will I lose
God help
Can’t decide-
My deciding to engage in the physical

Oh, to go back to decide again
Now will I choose to take away life
Or will the life I save be baby’s and mine

Lost and searching
Empty thirsty souls

When seeking love turned you into a mother

"Women, the way to take control back from men is not to have sex with them if they don't want to legalize abortion.. They have a right to their body, but we don't have a right to ours."
Combine adoption with artificial wombs; would there still be a need for abortions?
Hey abortion protesters what about my right to choose what is best for my life?
"Believe 👏 your 👏 delusions 👏 I 👏 don’t 👏 care 👏

"If people appreciate the value of existence, then they should realize that life will be faced with hardships, both expected and unexpected. When faced with a decision, women should understand that whatever decision they end up making, there will be scorn either way. Is there a tie breaker? Yes. Whichever leads you down the path of honor is the path you should take. Then whoever scorns you will have nothing but empty words because they’re angry you didn’t take their advice. 
Final word, those women who have love for their fellow humans should realize they can’t kill unborn children because they didn’t ask to be created, but they would ask for a chance to be human like you."
"You guys are delusional . All the hate and anger comes from the abortion side . I had an escort on Saturday say the most foul things to an elderly women that was with me . Call her a filthy cun* and that she stick her brochures up her cun* and wished death on her and her grandkids . This was a 20 something male speaking to a woman that way . Where was the feminist females ? Laughing as he said it to her . Hypocrisy at its finest . Apart from the God you know exists you have no bases to call anything right or wrong without appealing to Gods law and absolute morality 
Repent and turn to Christ that you may live . 
Grace&Peace"
"Bombs? She just made that up, so everybody thinks anti-abortion protesters are violent. I haven't seen any violence, maybe the only violence is the babies that are getting killed. 😮"
There are zero reasons for killing a human in the womb.
These NO LIFE people who push their beliefs on others. Why can't they mind their own DAMN business. Get a life. Stop bothering people. Trump is the reason Roe Vs Wade was pushed through. These Maga republicans are the most horrible people. Anybody who supports Trump are crazy people. These people love Trump. I can't wait until Trump is convicted and sent to prison with his 91 felonies and 4 indictments.
Man abortian is evil. She is quite mean and confrontational tho
"I don’t believe in abortion, but I don’t believe everyone should be allowed to have a kids. I believe in eugenics . What the pro- life people don’t understand is we have a lot of useless and worthless people in the world."
"I'd be fascinated to see how much ""help"" they'd actually offer if a patient walked over and asked for help..."
Abortion should only be allowed if the fetus consents to it.
"""What is this?"", asks the escort.   This idiotic escort can't appreciate that many people view abortion clinics the same way they would view the gas chambers at Auschwitz. If they feel strongly that abortion is the murder of an unborn child, what should they do?  How should they be behaving?  Like it's no big deal?  Frankly, given that many view abortion clinics as baby-killing stations, I am really surprised more clinics are not burned to the ground."
0:33 take a gander at yourself 🤣
"When protester scream murderer and ask if your interested in signing an petetion thankyou for my interest inthe abortion clinic protesta my desire to know more about these protesta im familiar with all of these sir,."
The bottom line is abortion is killing a gift from God.
let’s go. this old man knows what’s up. #keep babies alive
40% of women who get 1 have more than one.
Baby killer NPC
Why does she look exactly how you think she would look
Why do these moms feel so bad about getting an abortion?
"All cellular life is sentient, it's just common sense theory of Cellular bias of Consciousness...

the main argument for the termination of human multi-cellular life, is that the fetus doesn't feel pain...

well there are multiple ways to terminate Multi-cellular life without being pain involved... for instance Captive-bolts are absolutely painless, because the brain has no pain receptors, and the brain is destroyed before the brain can receive signals from pain receptors...

vegans constantly state plants don't feel pain so it's okay to eat them, well the brainstem the hub of the nervous system doesn't actually feel pain either it interrupts it, destroying the nervous destroys the argument it's immoral.   

if it's acceptable to terminate any cellular life form on the bias that it doesn't feel pain, that's a Pandora's Box that should not be opened..."
It ain't no cookie cutter solution. Humans lead difficult and complex lives. Don't matter which side your on Pro or Anti. Hope we all can come to a middle ground.
Abortion is not reproductive health care. Especially for the innocent unborn babies.
I hope the Army Of God finds where this is
"lmao as if making tiktoks is going to change shit, these pro- “””””””””””””””””””choice“””””””””””””””””””  people are hilariously idiotic."
I love that she has the same name as a legendary jazz drummer.
"I'm sorry I'm pro choice but third trimester? That's a bit much unless there is a serious health threat to both the baby and the mother. Not going to judge the guy or the mothers, not my place but whoa."
A BOMB?
Good for that man!
"The devil is very respectful and nice.. very kind believe me 
What make you think that Jesus was stupid ?? 
God defend and make justice to this man that are praying for this innocent souls.
You women.. shame on you 
Ofcourse evil CNN will support you.. what is new 
Disgusting CNN and this women you are not doing any help..
You are guiding people to a eternal tormented hell"
"I'm kinda surprised that people feel the need to stick their noses into other's businesses. Yes, abortion sucks, but we can't deny that it's necessary at times.

We can always do the one thing some tend to do: Shut up, because it's not your place to judge. 

We can also... find solutions to to the problems that lead to abortion. Ideas anyone?"
As a protestor please know that you are litteraly harassing people over there with your opinion. Well turns out people can have different opinions about the same topic. Learn to respect it.
Men need to use contraception all the time
It would be nice if these busybodies actually helped the people they are trying to bend to their will with financial support if a patient ever decided to keep their baby.
It's always the men who can't find the cl*t and/or never made a woman c*m outside of these abortion clinics.
Good job joe ! GOD bless you brother.
For people who say the pro life why would you shoot somebody 😂
"She is a hero. We need to network support for people who help us keep our rights. Both of those individuals, the doctor and the escort, are truly amazing people."
The anti abortions are the same people who shame single mother
"the mom from Detroit rock city said "" im here to support the mothers right... to choose life"". 100% chance she hoards cats and calls it a rescue."
God wants unsullied warriors. He gets them from abortions. Do you want Satan to win?😮.        Why else would a all powerful god make pregnancies he knows will end in abortions ❤
"This has become the hearts of people, cold, abortion is murder: Revelation 9:21"
Abortion is Murder
"I'm pro life, but actual medical abortion,  as in one that is needed to save the life of the mother is obviously something that has to be done. But apart from that I don't agree with abortion.  If you don't want a child use protection. What gets me with the whole ""pro choice"" people are the way they dehumanise unborn children.  As a father who watched my son grow throughout the pregnancy,  saw him in the scans and watched him being born on what was the best and proudest day of my life, to then lose my beautiful baby boy at 2 years of age.  The past 2 years have been hell for me, but its taight me that every life is precious,  an unborn child is very much alive and deserves protection."
"1. Why blue some of the posters? Do they show disgusting acts done in the clinics?
2. I’m not saying that there have never been death threats, but lots of people in the comments are talking about them and how much screaming the protesters were doing and how violent it was. From this video, which is obviously edited for maximum drama by CNN to only show the worst of what they saw, all I saw was passionate people pleading with women to not make the terrible choice of murdering their own child. They offered help, and they tried to inform. The escorts were yelling just as loud; everyone wants their opinion to be heard.
3. These violent attacks/murders all happened before 2009 from what I can tell. Most in the 90s. I cannot justify these attacks, of course, but crazy people exist, and when a large group of people believes innocent babies are being murdered legally, violence is going to happen. This is not a threat; I would never do this and I strongly disavow anybody using violence in a movement that is supposed to cause peace and life for all people, but when a system like the one we have currently is in place, it is one that breeds violence by default, so maybe it’s time to change the system. I’m surprised there haven’t been more deaths honestly. Furthermore, in the past 2 years alone (so this is recent), there have been hundreds of attacks on pro-life churches and pregnancy resource centers. These include firebombing, physical assault, and more that aren’t counted like the murder attempt of pro-life Judge Bret Kavenaugh. I’m not saying because there is violence on both sides that that excuses violence on one side (can we all agree that all of this violence is bad?) but please stop trying to paint an entire movement through the actions of a few crazy people in the past 30 years. Again, statistically I’m surprised there aren’t more crazy pro-lifers who are willing to murder in this large time frame. Also, why pregnancy resource centers? I kind of get churches, although that’s bad too, but why attack places that provide a bunch of resources, help, and love to women in need (everything except murder basically)?"
“The right to life!!!” You mean the right to forcibly use another person’s organs against their will? That’s not a “human right”.
"Forced birthers: we want to kill people for having abortions

Me: i DEFINATELY dont see the irony here"
Lol why are these pro abortion woman always the last woman any sane man would want to knock up
VOTE BLUE! It is our only hope.
"Abortion is murder. You don't want kids , keep your legs closed."
"I find it funny that the far left can get through their thick skull’s that even though abortion may be illegal in some states, it doesn’t stop people from getting abortions in those states, but they can’t comprehend how making guns illegal will not stop criminals from obtaining firearms. The irony is ridiculous."
The bloke in the red coat your god hates you
"If prolife people are so sure they are wait, they should wait and let god be the judge"
Killing people kind of sounds like the opposite of prolife to me
Prayers don't pay the bills
"A baby being able to suck its thumb in the womb is a reflex. All animals have reflexes. Therefore, we can equate a fetus to the level of an animal in terms of its development at that point. If prolife people eat meat, they shouldn't have a problem with abortion unless they believe in the bible."
"I think maybe i should protesting outside of pregnancy crisis centers telling women ""don't let them talk you into a choice that isn't right for you"". Maybe they will finally realize how annoying it is to not let people go about their business."
"Come on
You're being extremist with this false portrail of the anti abortion activists
If they are anti abortion then they believe they are being anti killing & anti murderer 
They will not hurt anyone 
They are just giving a chance to mothers to reflect 
Had you, leftists not been aware that you are dis-empowering women & robbing them their rights
You wouldn't have been so scared of dissent
I am not pro not against abortion,  & at the end of the day no matter what you or your opposition try to either push for abortion or prevent abortion 
It is going to be the parents call
Not either one of you
Can decide 
But you leftists, 
Your fear of opposition is what alarms red lights on my side
Dictators are afraid that their subjects realize they are being oppressed 
Dictators are afraid that their subjects will wake up one day
& overthrow them
That is what makes them afraid of opposition 
& that is what make you (leftists) also afraid of opposition 

Guys what I am trying to pass to you, is that
Your handling of the matter
Shows that you are
A bunch of
Dictators"
Welllll 🤔 to tell you the truth the violence shouldnt have happened but i dont feel bad for the people who were killed because they were the ones helping kill hundreds of innocent babies. In a way it was karma. 🤷 I see them as stupid people that allow the Devil to use them because theyre not smart enough to see thw truth or the fact of they just dont care. 😢 I feel sorry for the people who have tht mindset that abortions are ok.

That walk should be hard... 2 go in alive.. 1 comes out ..the innocent baby murdered.. it doesn’t matter their story.. there’s no excuse for killing babies.. and this lady is evil.. she would of been assisting Hitler.. it should be hard.. you killing babies.. babies.. BABIES!!!!!
Thank u for showing the world we are trying to save babies.. your a demon and you just exposed yourself.. why don’t u protect the babies your helping murder.. 🤔.. u think?

Why don't anti-abortionists start with labs that create embryos for IVF?  At least attack labs before women!  I have yet to see a bunch of these people picketing labs.  It's a desperate play to control women that comes before actual love for life.
This woman is brave and committed.  Thank God for people like her.
How many abortions should a woman allowed to have ? I have done this myself and I really regret it after loosing my 15 year old son
"0:16 ironic she says that. I FOR ONE think folks don't have a knowledge what goes down INSIDE the abortion clinic and their history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A16gzm9eaa8

Planned parenthood aint interested in yo ass. They literally had a history of forceful/tricked sterilization of minority groups so they can't have babies, and these are the people women goto to abort kids. They were first established with sterilization and castration for men and women in mind. Don't let the cute name fool you look up their dark history. And even with that 1% shouldn't be an excuse for the 99%. People need to stop using something as bad and horrific as rape to push their agendas. Sure rape and imminent danger to the woman's health are good reasons to abort. But the reality is in a good chunk of pregnancies the women are in ABSOLUTELY no danger just giving birth but they still abort. Heck abortion has WAY MORE danger and complications than just giving birth, kill the kid and risk moms life. Abortion is not contraceptives' and shouldn't be used as such. They literally giving out day after pills etc... etc... for free go use some."

What is so wrong with just keeping your legs clpsed? I just dont get it
If kids didnt want the baby they shouldve never gotten pregnant. But when the baby is killed they go to heaven. This is like the same when jesus was born when the soldiers were killing babies.
The people abortion need jesus and its wrong killing babies
What a brave woman!
"Are you seriously trying to have me empathize with a fat, abortion loving women who thinks disagreeing with people is ""life saving work"". I sincerely doubt someone advocating for execution is someone to empathize with. Also 5:16 - For those who are not aware assault by mutual consent is defined as ""an application of force that arises out of a consensual fight cannot be an assault because both parties have consented to the physical contact"" - also known as she was also responsible for engaging in violence but, CNN wants to make it seem that she was victimized."
People need to mind their own business
THESE PEOPLE NEED TO GET A LIFE.
"I wonder how men would REALLY feel if the child they made, INSTANTLY became the full responsibility of the FATHER and he then owes big bucks for pain, suffering and permanent physical disfigurement and also future mental anguish of mother AND child when that child comes around to be mothered ect.? Oh, lets not forget to RIP open THEIR tiny hole 20Xs bigger on their sexual organ N make them gain 20X pounds on their abbs. never to come off again...stretch out their  pecks to sag, all that fun stuff they judge us on.  Also its the end to working that good job w no paid leave but expensive child care and loads of chores for 16 years  Just saying it takes two to tango so why is it only the mother that gets all the pressure ?  Wheres insurance paid MALE birth control ? Afterall Viagras covered by insurance.? 😢😢😢"
Those anti abortion people who target abortion clinics should be put into the gulag express train and make them work hard labor and teach those prolifers the harsher consequences for making woman have miscarriages and forced pregnancies.
"Assault by mutual consent? Really, do you think the poor woman trying to protect these clients consented to the assault? Sounds like the ""authorities"" in the area are sympathetic to the right to life folks. What a load of shit!!!"
I dont agree with that doctor being murdered. All murder is wrong. 😢
Kids are being killed inside but let’s joke around
Stop killing the innocent babies. If you're so pro-choice let the choice making begin before the sex occurs
good arguments on both sides tbf. That's why it's such a dividing issue. I feel like its left vs right with every issue tho.
Goddess Bless these brave escorts doing the Lady’s work protecting these women from the abuse of anti abortionists.
"Everyone has the right to life, no one has the right to live at someone else's expense. I'm quite certain that every-ONE of these protestors do NOT want someone else to make a major decision in their life for them. WHY then are they so insistent on making decisions for others?"
Apparently the doctor’s killer was home sick on the Sunday they taught the commandment “Thou shalt not kill.”
The main lady in the video giving me communist Karen vibes lol
What's a little funny is that a only 11 adults have died in the last like 20 years. Just imagine the thousands of babies killed in that time.
Just walk up and ask them to adopt the child. That will stop them in their tracks.
"How is it not illegal to stand outside an abortion clinic and yell shit at people? I would love to see all these ""protesters"" thrown in jail. They're literally just there to harass women."
"THEY ARE NOT CHILDREN OR BABYS ITS A CLUMP OF GOD DAMN SEELS IS YOU LISTENED IN SCHOOL THEY FUCKING TEACH YOU THAT (sorry for the spelling mistakes english aint my first language) and also why just why what do benefit from doing this trumatizing YOUNG woman. ok yeah you can ""pUt It Up FoR aDoPtIoN"" what do you do when they come to look for you what do you say you cant just say ""oh yeah i didn't want you"" thats heartbraking for the child. what do you do when you got SA WHAT DO YOU DO! keep the baby NO FUCKING NO you dont want a reminder of what happened to you like who wants that. these people are so selfish saying its ""wHaT gOd WaNtS"" like no one gives a shit NO ONE."
"My grandmother is pro-abortion. She gets mad when a woman has lots of babies, but then goes on about a woman's right to choose, and a woman's body. I guess that only applies when you want to murder a baby, not have one.

You will eventually find out what side you should be on…
"The ignorance of Anti abortionis kills women. Some of them bomb clinics and attack people, others are voting to ban abortion. Maternall death rate in abortion ban states is at least 25 percent highter than non ban states. 
They have no idea of the health reasons for abortion. 
When pushed about the mother's health they back track and try to make exceptions. At the root they are about slut shaming really."
Your ignorance of reproductive difficulties killd women.
Men who have never had s cimplicatec pregnancy telling gjose who have they cant have an abortion.
"Goodjob pro choice or should i say pro infanticide. Wow and the fact that the pro choice woman forces the camera is the face of a poor grandma. Also, why is she insulting the peaceful protesters so aggresively like walking up to them and yelling. saying that your adding humor is just messed up when your talking about murder."
"Men have no right to say ANYTHING. Plus, who thinks the choice is an easy one??? These people who help the clinic and the patients and amazing."
"I wonder how many of those probirthers have filled out paperwork for adoption, or have actually adopted."
Notice that its mostly white males leading these protests.....who gave them the right to make decisions about women's bodies...?
I wanted to hate this but the comments says i shouldn't i still don't know if I hate this or not
"During the third trimester, your fetus continues to grow in size and weight. The lungs are still maturing, and the fetus begins to position itself head down. By the end of the third trimester, the fetus is about 19 to 21 inches long and weighs, on average, 6 to 9 pounds.

That ""Dr"" murders babies."
"Some men and women are too stupid to be able to avoid unwanted pregnancy, so we have to allow the murder unwanted children before they are born"
"How do they know they weren't married women who had an affair and got pregnant?! According to the bible the husband is supposed to make her get an abortion!  Oh what great christians we have in this country!....reserving judgement for god alone, murdering doctors and nurses and staff, harassing peeps, littering, and not helping out the poor.....bet they didnt give away their possessions to the poor either.......bet they've never adopted a baby so they could be a part of their own ""solution"".

Birth Control, Paid Leave, Child care, Food Stamps, Social Security and Medicaid?
""Fuck You."""
"Matthew 6:5. ""When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on street corners so that others may see them. Amen, I say to you, they have received their reward.""

Learn it and throw it back into the face of any uppity Christian you come across, they probably don't even know that verse or have ever read it to be serious here. If they couldn't cherry pick their religion they'd have nothing."
"God bless those men and women encouraging 🙏 and praying for life. Children are GOD'S GIFT, not a burden. Our Constitution names our God given rights as unalienable, LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Without life, there is nothing else."
"Notice the differences between prolifers and prochoice. Prolifers think they have the right to enforce their beliefs and opinions onto others. One woman who would rather die than abort expects all other women should agree. Um hell no. Another woman who would rather die than have a baby wouldn't expect anyone to agree with her. Prolifers stereotype abortion as being evil and those who have them are evil sluts. One woman chose to die so her baby could live. The baby was never taken off life support and only lived 17 days. Not so much being noble as it is senseless and futile. If someone else wants better than that for their baby how can they be faulted? People have debates between length of life vs quality of life in hospice, it's no difference for beginning of life."
Shame on these religious fanatics who persecute and bully vulnerable women.they have no right over women's bodies and shd mind their own business.they shd be put on prison instead
"Pro-lifers, killing and making death threats. Who would have thought. 😂
Amazing how they are completely blind to this equating to exactly what they're protesting against."
Simple way to get rid of them is pressure them with adoption papers
"On my pack of cigarettes it says “smoking can cause my unborn child to die”. If anti-abortionists are serious about saving fetuses, then they would also have to treat smokers like criminals. That would mean no more smoking in the red states like Kentucky and Virginia where the tobacco grows.🤔 Just another example of Republican hypocrisy?"
Oh is he is for a BIG SHOCK WHEN HE REALIZES THAT THERE IS NO ONE THERE.
"Lady you are a SAINT, or better still you are a good HUMAN BEING."
"They so called pro-life and anti-abortion they take away abortion rights but then after birth of the child they will do nothing when the kids are killed after starting their  K-12 education, its like a delayed death yeah we support you being born but when you start pre-k bye bye baby."
Abortion is a violent and barbaric act. It has no place in a civilized society.
"Dan, when were you pregnant? Did you have an abortion or did you give birth?  Were you ever forced to become pregnant and then forced to get and aboprtion? No, never, etc...then MIND YOUR OWN F-ing BUSINESS."
"MY BODY MY CHOICE.  Thank you to the escorts, you are sadly needed but women are eternally grateful for your time and effort. THANK YOU"
They respect life but will on occasion kill someone involved in receiving or assisting in an abortion.  Very Christian of them.
Sad to see these comments you people need to take responsibility when having unprotected sex.And CNN shame on you for thinking abortions are harmless
"Yep
Turn the spotlight on them
Their ridiculous platitudes
Their lack of compassion
Their ignorance of basic science"
"Bloody good on her! These people are criminals, not to mention hypocrites. They really couldn't give a shit about ""unborn life"", they only care about their money and their guns. Put them in maximum security jail!!"
"I'm glad these guys are trying to do the RIGHT THING. Have any of you seen that video of the BABY in the process of being aborted on the ultrasound trying to fight off the big scissors? The baby is trying to push away the tool by which it is murdered at the hand of an abortionist. It's heartbreaking. These ""doctors"" punch a hole in the skull of the baby and suck out the brains depressing the skull to KILL THE BABY, how can anyone supporting this procedure call themselves human?"
"I've been looking so much of this and it's so horrible and depressing that people think it's okay to murder their children, in the end it's God who will judge these injustices and Jesus will come and wipe away every tear and I'm happy to know that all the babies who were slaughtered are In heaven, Jesus come soon"
"Sick to see women believing they are some kind of heroes. Truly shameful that they are so immoral. They waste the time the should use to go on a diet, lose that fat, find a man, go to church and build a family for the betterment of our country and the world. It's tragic what has been done to the young women of this generation."
Who ever thinks they have the right to tell someone what to do that is none of their business and  if you really believe in God and meeting your maker when you die and paying for your sins what you are doing is making no sense at all because who ever chooses to have an abortion will have to meet their maker when their time is up but there’s nothing you can do because it’s not your sin to confess so why do you think you have a right to take choices away from others because you are not God! We are all living the laws of this free country to make our own choices and in this case these choices have nothing to do with anyone except the woman who should be able to make her own choices whether anyone agrees or not so If you disagree with them choices that’s fine but it’s not your choice in a free country to make decisions about anyones life or choices. Instead of ridiculing them or yelling at them maybe just pray for them and let God be the one to judge their choices. I know God would not condone the violence being used to make a point either. Let’s not forget who ever does these violent acts which in some people got hurt and in the end these people will also be judged. This is my opinion on this subject.
"The doctor said if women cannot have access to abortions that ""...women will start dying, which is horrible....""  If he thinks this is ""horrible"", imagine the absolute horror of having all of your body parts literally torn off of your body one at a time while resting ""safely"" inside your mother's tummy. He can have compassion for the women dying but not the babies dying, where is the logic and morality in that? If we take the baby's right to life away, it is only a matter of time until that right will inevitably cease to exist for the remainder of us. This will undoubtedly lead us down a path where if someone decides in the future that your life doesn't matter, they just take it away from you and you cease to exist. Is that the kind of world you want folks?  

The doctor’s last statement is “I just pray that it wakes people up.”  Ironically, the one who needs to wake up the most is the doctor.  I do not think God would be pleased with anybody who takes the life of an innocent person and especially those who make their living slaughtering innocent children.  If the doctor is a truly praying man, he would be wise to repent from his taking of innocent lives and to pray for forgiveness that God might be merciful on his soul.  That doctor is in his sunset years, and it won’t be long now until he will stand before God and will have to give an account for his atrocious actions."
"These people need to sign a legal agreement to give 20% of their income to sustain these women in dire straits, and to place their hand on the Bible and swear to God to fulfill the agreement."
This is terrible what if you were aborted
I wish people stop talking about this stuff. This society hates anything truthful.
Shelley sums up the pro-death image; looks like a bulldog chewing a wasp!!!
How many kids has Dan adopted?
The sad people who believe that their views should be forcefully imposed upon others demonstrates their fanatical tendencies.. the deeply held belief that their have the right to scare and intimidate others show that they are akin to Nazis..
I wonder how many of those self righteous religious extremists have adopted?
No not to choose life. Your not letting her choose her life.
Whatever it takes to save a life!
"""we're here to help you---we are praying for you...""  but would you adopt my baby, or help pay for prenatal care, or help support me so I can stay with my child?  Unfortunately, all these dimwits can offer is ""prayer"".   They won't spend one dime and vote for political hacks that echo their baseless ideology."

"So since 1977, at least 11 people have been killed in anti abortion attacks. And people claim to be pro life?"
"I support abortion if a woman/girl got pregnant from r@pe, or if giving birth will kill the mother. But having an abortion because you just don't want a baby?? That's selfish and inhumane.

If you don't want to get pregnant then just don't do it in the bedroom, if you end up getting pregnant then that's on you. And the sad thing is that near 97% of women who get abortions do it because they feel like it..."
Thank God for the amazing men and women who oppose the murder of innocent children... shame on those who support abortion. Repent and follow Jesus Christ he will forgive you and give you peace like you've never had.
"Since this seems to be a religious issue, has anyone asked the anti-abortionist where in the bible it says abortion is wrong."
We don't know their heart we don't know know their story. What we do know is they are murderers. 11 people have been killed at abortion clinics. More than 60 million fetuses have been killed.
The reason for shouting is the patrons are murderers.
I see that if people die because they should abort and the state should be held responsible for ALL DEATHS. Open the court. Imagine killing a doctor. May all repub's that ignore a death of a pregnant women rot in jail. It is now the blame of anti abortionest if a woman dies.
Abortion is evil and you don't have the right to kill your child.  No one has the right to kill another human being unless it is self defense.
That one guy had been doing this since 1973? That is a mind that has been unable to alter its position in 50 years. Geez...like living in a cave.
"So, They're anti abortion but think it's OK to Murder someone who's just doing their part to keep women safe. You'll find that the women who choose Abortion usually don't have a choice. Leave them alone and live your own life.."
Looks like the average street anti-abortion protestors are on Social Security or unemployed.
Making money by butchering small bodies what a shame
"I would literally I volunteer for this job.  These people will harass people over their beliefs, which is absurd.  I would love to use my sarcasm against them.  Every day, I drive past a planned parenthood in my town.  They have protestors, any they don't even perform abortions there.  They send you off-site to another town.  The planned parenthood in my town provides many other important services. Again, they dont even do abortions there, but they stand out there with their signs protesting their beliefs.  I would just let them hit me and laugh."
Why are pro abortion women always the ones that don't have to worry about it.
God bless her
"Until those abortion protesters do more to alleviate social injustice, it is clear that their real reasons for their stance is they want poor women to have their babies so they can have soldiers to defend their standard of living. They don't give a fig for unborn babies in any other country."
"They say it's hard to them to do their job as a Murderer of a innocent chilld. 

I know this isn't right to say, because maybe they have their own reason. 
BUT REMEMBER ""IF LIVE BECAUSE OF BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS, YOU'LL DIE BY THE SAME THE BLOOD IN YOUR HANDS."
Sanctimonious murder
"Shelly, Shelly, Shelly! You are not humorous at all! I wonder how much humor you’ll find in Hell. 

She said “this is literally like life risking work”…. HELLO!!!! NO SHIT SHERLOCK! Risking the lives of innocent children. Wake up Shelly and all you naive people!!!!"
Woah Such Empowerment We Are Killing Baby's Yay
"You can't pray and  perform abortion,praying is talking to God, He doesn't give consent to kill He said thy shall not kill"
Shelly is a hero
Pro life moms got birth to all of this pro abortion activists. Irony ha?
Did She filmed her Mom on Tiktok too?
".08% > of women have health issues from having birth,.....my daughter told me,....that she support abortion,..1 TIME THEN  her name goes on the whore list! Also the whore needs to pay the bill,...not tax payers!"
The irony of these people crying about 11 deaths at abortion clinics no one you literally murder babies everyday
I know those evil men who you know care about babies being murdered and she should be more concerned with the fact she doesn't have a neck. Diabetes and heart attacks are in her future.
These are strong people protecting babies and protecting the lives of people that cannot protect themselves. I'm actually surprised that there has only been 11 deaths compared to hundreds of thousands of dead fetuses. There is no excuse for people that do this to other human beings that are born in the so-called greatest country in the world and say that their life was not going to be good. Just a bunch of excuses
"Should carry a sign asking the pro lifers if God is pro life then ask them to answer. Except Noah's family God drowned every man, woman, child and fetus..  Doesn't sound like pro life to me."
All the forced birth ppl here is sick
Who has this much spare time to protest against someone else's choice 😂 their body their choice
these murderers
People outside the clinics protesting pro-life need to foster babies so many that they need help. You are so pro-life then take care babies in need of foster parents. Instead of complaining and protesting outside clinics and praying occupy your time taking care of babies.
why is it that most of them dont need to worry about getting pregnant anyway
"Chossing to get a abortion is a painful enough decision, without putting up this judgment and endangerment, if you don’t believe in abortion don’t get one’, but please don’t hinder everyone’s rights"
"Personally, I don't like the idea of abortion BUT people have no right to decide what someone else wants to do with their life, we are not the ones raising it."
What is this land whale talking about?
What a dog. Leftie women are all ugly. Only good looking people deserve to have opinions.
How you gunna fight for somethings life that ain’t even alive than kill an actual living person 💀💀
Why all ways prochoice look like LGBTQIA’s ++ gender fluid cat’s whatever they call them self !!!!
I pray for these protesters in Jesus name. Great is your reward in heaven❤
There is deadly violence at abortion clinics every day. It just doesn’t matter because those lives don’t have voices yet.
i don’t care who you are. but if you don’t make ANY exceptions for SA victims then you’re disgusting.
Zog propaganda
"I loved the very loud leaf blower!
Let's get this straight if these ppl think it's ok to murder ppl who help women get a abortion they are the worst type of hypocrite! It doesn't matter if they use religious beliefs as justification or if they are simply saying all life is or should be protected once they commit murder or advocate for it then they are doing the same thing they accuse the clinic employees are doing. No man has the right(either religiously or morally) to take another life!"
What people don't have a realistic picture of is what happens IN AN ABORTION.
"People need to understand that these people don't need help from prayers or gods, they need help financially. How are you supposed to raise a child when you get minimum wage and even if there is a way to raise said child what will they turn out to be? Prayer doesn't help it never does, sure praying makes you feel like someone is helping you but that only strengthens your will"
The reporter at the end is so misinformed.  There has NEVER been a Constitutional right to abortion.
"Let's not act like everyone that goes to the clinic has been r*ped, 90% of them had sex and didn't wear protection and now want an abortion because the baby is an inconvenience... I understand people that get raped ... But most of them are sl*gs that have been normalised in society..."
Don't worry sweetie. You will never be in the predicament to gave to choose to murder your baby
"What a line. Graphic and violent messages? No way. Why would someone do that to people wanting to tear babies apart piece by piece? And proclaim it as a right? You really shouldn't be trying to guilt-trip other people for responding to your heinous and atrocious actions. And fyi, violent protests come from your side of the aisle, not mine."
These people are decrying murder while facilitating it.
"A baby shouldn't have to die so u can be a 304. It's wrong. Don't care what the trolls say if u add up rape and incest it accounts for less than 2 percent so ur argument is trash. Everyone in support of this disgusting procedure should sit in and watch. Watch little faces being put on a table. Arms, legs, brain tissue, etc. Then tell us it's not a baby. You are some vile, disgusting people. It should be illegal it's murder plain and simple"
Thank you for helping women
Wack conservatives
She's awesome. She must feel really good helping out those womsn kill their babies.
We should be using artificial wombs. It would give people far more options and the parents wouldn't have to make the horrible decisions. Ask all women what type of birthing they would prefer. I bet artificial wombs gets chosen first. If you explain it correctly.
The baby is alive. Give it up for adoption. Its murder. Satanic murder.
How about the rights of the baby you are murdering
Abortion is murder end of story
"""this is literally life-risking work!"" yeah exactly, risking the lives of the unborn"
"Once again to people that get abortions, the baby inside,..the unborn baby is in your body it's not your body if it were your body, you would be the one getting aborted."
"I mean yeah these are abused by people alot and do need to be closed. People use them as ""magic eraser"" factories for disposing of humans in some legal round about way. Whether people want to hear this or not. Most of this comes with irresponsible choices and very few from seemingly legit unchosen decisions. But at the end of the day. The human growing inside of you. Didn't get to chose the circumstances as to how they appeared and formed inside of you. You chose to make them and then destroy them. Such nice people."
What a hero! Wow! She risks her life to help women end the life of the innocent baby.  It is a tragic death of those involved in the premeditated taking of thee innocent.  Women are dying and maimed in the process of abortion. Every day babies die at the hand of the these people who will answer to GOD.
Third trimester abortions should not be elective expect in very rare circumstances such as a baby developing in a life-infeasible way. I am more pro-choice the farther back into a pregnancy but if a baby can survive outside of the womb I see no reason it should be ok to kill it. That third-trimester abortionist is disgusting.
"You can also look for the telecommunication lines going into the building.  Although electrial wires are likely in thick conduit, telecommunications are lines that go to peds next to the building property lines.   It only takes a second to cut the lines and to disable the building."
"Hey if the protestors want to make it difficult for abortion clinic to function, there is a very simple fast way to do.  Wait until dark when the clinic closes and quickly apply super glue or Epoxy to all the door locks.   The glue will harden making the locks impossible to open."
Shelley is only helping selfish women. She is not helping babies to live. Abortion is the most extreme form of child abuse.
Can we not normalize killing babies ? I understand that certain situations are sensitive but most are just inconvenienced by a baby. Just don’t have sex lol
Even especially if the woman is raped she should have the right to have an abortion
It should be a woman's choice to have the abortion 100%
Of course she was a rainbow vest😂
"Finally a rational  comments section. Feels like coming home after fighting a battle out there. 

You're doing amazing work! Keep it up!!

All of you here are amazing and I appreciate each one of you 💜"
Performing 3rd trimester abortions is murder. No one should be murdered including staff.
"I'm against the murder of unborn babies to but NO ONE likes protesters. This is why so many people don't like groups like political groups like ANTIFA, BLM, LGBTQ+, NO OIL. These groups dusrupt the community and don't care about the people that they are supposed to be supporting."
"Why does it matter to these ""pro-lifers"" what someone else who they do not know in any way shape or form do with their bodies? They will never see these people again! The fact they get so involved for literally 10 mins and then move on to the next person to scream at is despicable. Jesus would not be standing outside these clinics, and they believe they are following in his footsteps. Pro Choice literally allows pro lifers the ability to have their babies and not abort them, but they want to take that away for everyone else? Give me a break. Theyre a bunch of clowns hiding behind this veil of being a ""good Christian."" there is nothing holy about the torment they are giving the most vulnerable people."
Those protesters stop the support after it's too late
Those protestors LIE about abortion
"All humans babies to adults have a right to live. That’s a god given right, and no one should take that away from you. Protect all lives, protect thy unborn lives. But good thing the anti abortion support grows. More n more younger generations are actively protesting against abortions. More ppl waking up. God bless America."
Funny how most of these pro-abortionist are the ones least likely to be pregnant
I really can't wrap my brain how anyone who thinks they are christian would think that taking away my freewill which was given to me by god can possibly think they are doing gods work WOW
I'm proabortion as long as they destroy the vessel during
"""life risking work"" yeah not your life tho right. Just the babies."
"How many fake ectopic  pregnancy storied can there be? And no pro life doctor, pro life  hospital or state would allow a woman to  die due  to an ectopic pregnancy. It's silly. That's all you pro baby destroyers got?   The ectopic stories are just not true."
These same people (protesters) are the type to death threat someone’s trans child… maybe even they’re own.
"Because she’s so likely to get pregnant, right?"
"instead of encouraging people to kill their poor little baby, why don't you hop on the treadmill for a bit help yourself first"
She is not a hero.
Your killing a innocent baby the Bible literally says their innocent people are stupid and you women that has had an abortion you are disgusting and a horrible person for killing a innocent baby your literally carrying the new generation in your stomach be more responsible because abortion is disgusting and you are disgusting
That’s honestly disturbing to lighten the mood that much about death. You don’t have to get political or religious to get the feeling or sense it’s morally wrong to kill any living thing.
I don’t think she EVER has to worry about getting pregnant.
Its always the crazy religious loonys.
"They need to get a life,mind their own business they have that crazy
look Evangelical nut look.Not one 
looks normal I believe they all have
mental issues just look at them tell
me I'm wrong."
THIS IS SO FUNNY OMFG HE WAS ON A LADDERRRRR
"Let the WOMEN decide for themselves whether or not to carry the seeds of the evil MEN do to them. I will agree to ban abortion only if  they also pass a law
that will allow the court to order the castration of men who commit the crime of rape and incest."
"Yeah, this go is SO HORRIBLE saying things like ""you are wonderfully and beautifully made"".
What kind of horrible person would try to convince a woman from murdering her unborn child?

Abortion activists are SICK.
This woman should look in the MIRROR and ask :""what is this"".

Lady, YOU are the big mouth.  These people are NOT on the murder clinics grounds.
The fact is she just cant STAND it when someone holds a position that she disagrees with.

Lady, you are a sick, horrible person.  You should be ashamed of yourself.
Or better yet, track down those sickos the vandals and arsonists who terrorized and firebombed crisis pregnancy centers."
"Since May of 2022 there have been 99 attacks on pro life organizations and facilities, just thought I'd share that."
I wonder how many adopted children all these pro lifers have?
"Can someone please explain.

If a 15yr old has been raped and Dr’s say that continuing the pregnancy will severely hinder her chance of children in the future, when she is  physically and mentally ready for motherhood. You demand we follow your minority view based on a fictions gods book. 
My thoughts are towards the pregnant child’s life and I make no apology."
Resorting to Tic Tok says everything
Shelly shows up to protect the business of treating the unborn as just bags of money making parts.
A rubber fetus. REALLY? And the liberals claim they know science?
A rubber fetus. REALLY? And the liberals claim they know science?
"O Lord, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth! Rise up, O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve! O Lord, how long shall the wicked exult? They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast. They crush your people, O Lord, and afflict your heritage. They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless; and they say, “The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive.” Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise? He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see? He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge—the Lord knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile. Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O Lord, and whom you teach out of your law, to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked. For the Lord will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage; for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it. Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers? If the Lord had not been my help my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence. When I thought, “My foot slips,” your steadfast love, O Lord, held me up. When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul. Can wicked rulers be allied with you? Those who frame injustice by statute? They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death. But the Lord has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge. He will bring back on them their iniquity, and wipe them out for their wickedness, the Lord our God will wipe them out. (Psalm 94)"
Abortion bans on demand and without apology.
"And now NYC has abortions up to 9 months , wow now we murder a full term baby"
This pitiful woman. I hope she realizes soon that by supporting abortion she is supporting murder.
"Lol, kinda an overreaction to protestors, these people ARENT protesting abortions out of survival, nor miscarriages. The recording was fine, It was mean blowing them with a leaf blower, they’re allowed to speak their mind without getting leafs and dust in their face and eyes. Anti-abortionist who commit CRIME are CRIMINALS."
"what a pathetic job, abortion escort, a new low in humanity"
"Pro Life call women irresponsible and stupid for ""not keeping their knees together"" and getting pregnant. By their logic are they expecting irresponsible and stupid women to also raise a baby?"
Murder is murder.
"NO TO ABORTION! NO KILL BABIES; don't be killers. When God's judgment comes, what will you answer to your creator?"
"There’s a difference between needing an abortion and willfully killing your baby because of selfishness or irresponsibility. The child is alive no matter what you tell yourself and everyone knows it’s wrong to kill. People rationalize evil practices in today’s world. People who are against abortion are there to help people really think about and be honest with themselves about what they are really doing before they make a decision they’re going to regret for the rest of their lives. Don’t listen to the world, listen to your heart and listen to God. God is that small still whisper inside your mind and heart that ultimately knows killing your child is not right. That’s hard to do in an evil world that promotes and standardizes evil."
"So in the last 45 years 11 people have been killed by unstable people claiming to be right.  Okay.    Taking away your virtue signaling point.  Yes those 11 people did not deserve to die.  They deserve justice in the prosecution of their murders.   However, that stat along with your own video and claims of how prevalent protest occur, suggests that the vast majority of those protestor are peaceful, even when being antagonized."
this lady is EVIL beyond belief
THEY ARENT WASTING THEM  THEY FEED THEM TO THE PRISONERS
PRETENDING YOU HAVE A MAKE BELIEVE FRIEND IN THE SKY AND PRETENDING THEY TALK TO YOU MEANS YOUR  NUTS !!!!!
"Women know what they do.. we are not incapable of making decisions.. and we know the full consequences of abortion. We are not children, we can decide .. and until this fetus ""child"" is in my womb..it a part of my body.."
Lies
Biased report from CNN.
Baby killers
*BABY KILLERS MAD* 🤣🤣🤣
That moment when people have a problem with killing babies 😡
"The murderers in the abortion pretend to care with their lies, without realising the utter hypocrisy and insanity they speak!  
3:49: ""This is literally like life risking work..."" Can you not hear the hypocrisy of that, and how laughable that sounds? 
YOU are helping to END the lives of innocent babies in that ""clinic"", so you can't talk! ""Life risking work"", oh what a joke!

There is absolutely ZERO reason for abortion to exist. Abortion is murder, which leaves mental and physical scars, and you'll have to give an account of that on the day of judgement! Murder is NOT a ""right""! You'll find that out the hard way when condemned to the torment of Hell if you don't wake up and REPENT!"
"If you don't agree to the possible consequences, then you shouldn't have it."
"The people comparing ""your right to abortion""  to property rights and stand your ground laws 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡"
The baby has every right to be there (as it's a natrual stage of human development for everyone)
"She needs to learn to accept different opinions. Liberals always want to preach tolerance, but they are intolerant themselves."
"Why are people always bringing ""God"" into this? Im not even religious wtf. Leave me and my body alone. I make whatever decision i think its better for myself."
😂😂😂
"That protester says ""when he meets his maker....he hopes the good Lord has a lot of mercy"".  He should hope for that because he's going to need it.  He is not treating his fellow humans with honor or dignity and he spends his time in judgment of others which is not his place.   He will be judged harshly by his ""good Lord"" for being a lousy human along with the rest of the protesters."
These people are delusional.  Let these people be and let them get their Healthcare in peace. Mind your own business.
according to science when does life begins?
That clearly is a demon woman. She will escort you straight to hell.
"abortion clinics are mostly in poor black areas....
everything else is rascict but not that?"
"in Islam religion the abortion is not forbidden before the 40 days of pregnancy if the woman raised her child that better for her but if she doesn't want it she can do the abortion before the 40 days of pregnancy in her womb but she must understand something very important if she do the forbidden adultery she must stop ✋ after that sin and if she was a victim of a crime rape if she doesn't remove it that is better for her because the great God will give her great boons after life because she was a victim innocent woman but if she was married she can't do it it's very big sin but sometimes the doctor says to her your baby in your womb is to dangerous to your health care we must remove him before he kills the mother and that happened rare in life that happened because some women's have accidents like when she falls into the ground or she have accidents in car or anything else etc , why I said before the 40 days of pregnancy because the great God doesn't put the soul in the body of the baby in his mother womb but after the 40 days of pregnancy the baby became a human with a real soul in his body that is not my talk or my words this is in holy book holy Quran not me ."
"I have a friend who is a volunteer to escort people into abortion clinics. She has a few pairs of noise canceling headphones (she can link spotify for any music) for those people, so they can't hear anything the protestors are saying."
"Republicans be like: 
War? YES! 
Torture? ABSOLUTELY! 
Guns everywhere? YOU BET! 
Abortion? NO I’M PRO LIFE."
How much do you want to bet these “pro life” idiots ate bacon and sausage McMuffins on their way to the big “pro life” rally.  😂
A more attractive woman would be an easier sell...just some helpful advice.  You have to make the face of the campaign someone a man would actually want to impregnate or else it's just not believable.
I wonder if any of these “pro life” losers are vegan or if they only care about specific kinds of life.
"Why do all the women who appear to be the loudest pro abortion voice also appear to be the ones least likely to have to worry about ""unwanted pregnancies?"" It's a trend I can't help but notice, haha, they really are some BIG UGLIES, am I right, though? 🙃"
Big respect for these people risking their lives to make people able to make the right choice for their life
The piety makes me sick.
I want to be this woman when I grow up.
Ignorance is loud and wisdom is louder through silence 🤐
Never seen so many low IQ sky wizard worshippers with a hot line to GOD knowing what he wants and doesnt want.....
I'm so glad that I live in a civilized country. I pity citizens of the USA.
Delusional fake Christians
"Any one of those obnoxious protestors butting into the lives of those unfortunate women, if they get too close or in the way, should get the firehose -- full blast.  It's why God invented firehoses."
"Bottom line , women choose what you have to do , but DONT use it as birth control and think the rest of the country will pay for it !!!!"
This video is downvoted into oblivion I’m sure
Yea it's wrong to tell  pregnant women to tell a women not to get an abortion due to rape or insects but what about the women that gets pregnant due to there own actions with there partner but still get the abortion and they can keep up on doing that bc it's normalized now adays but we don't want to pay attention to that part of abortions just the ones from rape are insects smh.
"So what ,think they care about TikTok lol"
"In Australia, it’s illegal for these Christian extremists to protest within 100 yards of a sexual health clinic"
"Love this lady. These idiots believe in a so called all knowing, all powerfull god who foreknew the outcome of everything that would happen and chose to create that world. He could have just as easily created a world where abortions didn't exist."
"The sheer arrogance of these bible thumpers. ""I'll pray for you""? Save it for someone who cares, you are no better than anyone else."
"Weirdos for Jesus, did you see the size of that cross, I, love God too, but these people are extremist."
They say pro-life but vote against funding foster care and jails to house all the unwanted kids.
I support pro life advocates with my heart and soul. Good job escorting them into the clinics. I feel for those who were killed in their line of duty.
Thank you for your work at the clinic. You are a heroine!
"They are sad, bored, lack attention, have strange friends and most importantly
...in desperate need for serious mental evaluation."
It's all fkrd up... sadly is early years...men were pissed killing mother's father's and such because of dangerous work... education...the other fkrd up thg is ...too popular for the other...fame fortune...Looks... amenities as of extras to provide...the all too infamous booze pharmaceutical.... another demeaning is fame fortune... moving on with a better career... divorce married...the infamous latter stepping...the sickness goes on... wooing to some fandom oof delusional realities... ambience and VANITY... alongside perversions with Ill intentions with Walt Disney facade etc.  Giving these ideas for children...
"So, the anti-abortion/PROLIFE people MURDERED someone...a pro-life person MURDERED someone. Listen to how that sounds."
Do these people not have jobs? How are they there every day to harrass these patients?
"when he gets to the pearly gates God will ask him, who died and made you boss?."
"Well done walking woman with their unborn baby to dead 
You must be so proud 🤮"
Why do these assholes think they have the right to force their religion on others. It's not their body and not their choice
As a Christian I believe it is a sin   to have an abortion. But every one has a right to choose their own fate.
"Here in Greece we don't have specific clinics, hospitals have to provide all sorts of healthcare. So those lunatics would have to stand in front of a normal hospital and try to guess who goes visiting a relative who's had a heart attack, who is having an x-ray and who's having an abortion."
"This woman is so brave, protecting women who have a already suffered enough mentally (and probably physically) before even getting to the clinic ❤️❤️ ❤️❤️❤️
My response to half of the anti-abortion protesters is “If you weren’t born with ovaries and a vagina, then STFU”
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
What a country we live in that those people spend all their lives harassing women.
A lot of these folks are paid to protest at the clinics.
Abortion is a crime. Don't kill babies! Abortion cannot be a choice like murder cannot be
God Bless Shelly!!! You are doing what is in the Bible. An abortion is LEGAL in the bible. Life doesn't even start until a child takes their first breath (Genesis)
"""Its a tiny rubber feotus"" !!! That's exactly what they are. And between a patient and their Doctor will always win since 78% of Americans are Pro-Choice and NOT ANTI-CHOICE!!!!"
"Shelly is an Angel!!! She is helping people with difficult decisions, but who have made up their mind. I respect her Pro-Choice stance!!!!"
Notice they're all men
"It pains me that these self righteous jerks do not understand that abortion is necessary to save the lives of women whose pregnancies have gone horribly wrong due to no fault of their own. 

I knew someone who nearly died of sepsis when a minuscule hole in the amniotic sac allowed germs to infect the fetus. The fetus was already doomed, but the doctors could not do an abortion until the fetal heartbeat stopped. 

My friend was lucky that they were able to bring her back from organ failure. Considering that this was the 1970s, she was lucky indeed.

When abortion is banned, women die. What sense does it make to value the life of an embryo or fetus over that of the host, without which the embryo cannot survive? This is religious tyranny as far as I am concerned."
"They have no right to stand there and yell at women ! 
No right to hold pictures and posters. 
These protesters say they have responsibility to do this.. ......they are not helping.
They could help by providing baby clothes , diapers , formula , changing tables , baby bath tub , car seats , pay Dr bills , give maternity clothes , nursing bras , maternity underwear , baby blankets , provide transportation , housing , childcare , daycare there is so very much to do to support new life and the mothers ! 
What they are doing out there , now , is useless !"
"How those shitheads protesters will help women that decided to have an abortion? Will they provide them for 9 months ? And then take the baby away and take care of it?? Yes , IT !! If it's not after birth creature it's not a human yet"
"Those protesters look lunatic , who doesn't even understand what they talk about and should get their heads out of strange women's wombs lol"
These protesters don't give a damn about the born
"all this yelling and protesting when they can DO SOMETHING USEFUL by actually helping kids in foster system, kids in the streets who are homeless and hungry... and not actually be judgmental which is ironic for them to do when they say ""pray""."
"Obama and Biden had 8 years to pass roe vs wade federally………….but they didn’t
They had the White House, Senate and House and promised they would pass it"
Religious nutbars pushing thier shit on everyone..they should put their energies to the poor.
Just like nazi killing jews in ww2
I'm sorry third trimester abortions this is disgusting to me that's to far along
Doesn't the bible actually command one to abort a pregnancy if it's from adultry? Why does nobody ever speak about that.
"Men have no business speaking about abortion! It's not their body or their baby! Dan, the person you call your maker is also the only one that judges! You or no one has a right to judge anyone! Read your bible! ""You who have not sinned cast the first stone!"" You have no right to judge anyone. Only God has the right to judge!"
They look like lunatics.
At least 11 people have been killed by anti-abortion activists. Gotta save those fetuses but it's okay to kill fully grown living humans.
This is why abortion care needs to be something provided by every OBGYN so that you don't need to go to some weird place that announces what service you are in need of.   It should not be legal to try to interfere with a medical procedure.
How is this allowed? Can they a restraining order?
"11 people… seriously, 11 people a day/week die here in philly over stuff they had nothing to do with now thats a real problem foh 11 people… cant be serious"
What is it with these ridiculous men?
Was there ever a bomb? Why sensationalise like that? My goodness.
"Are they going to help pay for the pregnancy, birth? Daycare? Food? Hmmm that’s interesting how this is so important that they spend their time harassing women than volunteering and donating at food pantries and shelters and funding free healthcare. How bout just mind ur own business."
Of course they support the unborn because they aren't a burden on pro-lifers.  They don't require money they don't require caring they don't require anything until they are born and then they are no longer unborn and that's the moment when pro-lifers don't care about that child who could now starve and die in swallow and strife.
"Thank you, Shelly for being there for women in their time of need. You are a terrific and noble person."
"You are there for woman when they need help most. The protesters have no interest in helping anyone they get a high off of feeling superior. They don’t adopt ,they don’t vote for health care,education,housing they just terrorize women at their most vulnerable"
"These men need to really go sit down somewhere. Dan, God doesn't like it when people get in the middle of other people's business."
"No man should ever have a voice over what women do with their bodies. As someone who is not female and does not have a womb, these male idiot anti-choice losers have no rights to have any say in the matter. If I was a cop I'd sit outside that clinic and arrest all those fucking protesters for harassment and abuse."
"If ""pro life"" activists really stood by their words, they need to take fully economically, social and emotionally responsibility for both mother and future child for the rest of mother and child's life. I some how doubt they are willing to do that. If not, -they are nothing but self rictus hypocrites."
Well you'll find your muclh and theres nothing bug darkness dan.
Christianity is pure EVIL!
Tell God when you see Him. It won’t go well. Abortion is murder.
Everyone for abortion has been born
Abortion is baby killing.
"yeah, those idiots cant hate, or kill you for who you are, unless you are born.  They just want more death, more inmates, more abuse, more poverty, more homelessness, more unemployment, more of us forced to obey their personal religion.
I should stand out front with pictures of murdered clinic workers, and mothers forced to carry babies with no skull..or raped & abused children forced to carry babies at 10 years old-  
 how christian.   right up there with nazis, sadists, and other psychopaths."
"Funny how they want to take my gun, my freedom of speech, my freedom to think what I think. Not what they think. But take the option of abortion off the table and the freaking world is ending. There can't be that many white girls getting abortions. The whole reason democrats loved abortion was to keep the black population down."
"Adding an element of humor anout killing babies… yeah, so brave…"
"Thank you escorts for what you do for women and girls obtaining abortions. Let’s focus on why a woman needs an abortion: rape, incest, poverty, illness, ectopic pregnancy. Does making abortion make these causes go away? No. So the need for abortions doesn’t go away neither will abortions. They become dangerous and even deadly. Trust women to make decisions for their lives."
Oh I can't wait to see this!
"""At least 11 people have been killed"" Pro-life huh?..."
Trespassing is illegal
"Shooting, bombs and threats of death?  These  anti abortion hypocrites  are not pro life. They are pro control."
If you have to remain name less. You really don't believe in what your doing. Why not just wear something over your face while your at it. And who are you to push your beliefs on someone. When most Christians break the commandments probably more so than non Christians. I think the clinics should release all names after verification that are Christian women that had abortions. I'm  sure their are millions. And if you think not then your plain stupid.
They want to force mothers to have babies but help with taking care of said babies no thankyou. They say we are pro life but turn around and kill doctors that could have saved more lives or kill people they do not like . sounds like they are only some pro life.
"A bunch of ignorant religious nut jobs,who are they to tell a woman what to do with their own body."
"I will decide what I do and/or do not do with my body. These self righteous delusional religious hypocrites can stuff their bibles, their crucifixes and their bullshxt up their backsides and then they can fxck right off to somewhere very, very far away."
Obviously somebody needs to tell them that prayers don 't feed a child...
"Wow! So brave! Enabling the murder of the unborn isn’t an easy thing to do, but faking compassion while doing it is even harder!
Stunning. So strong. So beautiful."
Sadly these guys think we all need their personal approval. Dman them.
What accent does the narrator have?
"Sure, you're walking next to a patient RECORDING WITH A CAMERA! They must love that!"
"These protesters, supporting life, are doing the right thing. 

Sad about the doctor, and the 11 people, who lost their lives to extreme protesters.

Sadder still the millions of babies who lose their lives to abortion."
"I'm watching this again and I have a question: those women who died because they couldn't get an abortion, the bombings of the abortion centers etc, I think the same people who banned abortions should be made to pay for all the destruction they caused. Thoughts?"
She's a legend
"PRAYERS don't buy diapers, PRAYERS don't pay for pre-natal care, PRAYERS don't buy food to feed your little ones, PRAYERS don't give you a job, PRAYERS  don't put food on the table, PRAYERS don't help with your post-partum depression, PRAYERS don't help you live in a safe neighbourhood.....etcetera, etcetera!!! Stop the government from funding Viagra, MEN HAVE NO SAY unless they have: uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina!  MAKE VASECTOMIES MANDATORY FOR MEN AS SOON AS THEY CAN PROCREATE and have it reversed when BOTH want a baby. My Body My Choice...!!!"
You are fake News and everyone knows it so we can not believe a word you say and it's called a staged interview and murder has always been illegal and turns out it still is it's just so very very sad that a judge had to tell grown people that murder was Rong so nice try but most American people are not stupid ask Liz the truth will set you free Lonnie ray
"I agree woman should have control over thier bodies, that's why intelligent women use precautions before murder. If you can't control your body than get sterilized. Abortions are for health, mental, incest or rape purposes only."
"All I see is some people concerned about abortion, pretty calmly trying to talk to people and convince them to not get an abortion. Most shown here aren't angry, aren't yelling aggressively, and aren't getting in people's way, burning anything down, threatening or killing anyone... They're not taking over half the street, occupying the building, or anything crazy.

Maybe stick to showing only the worst of the worst anti-abortion protesters, because showing the typical ones that aren't that bad is really exposing how overblown people make this whole ""OMG PROLIFE PEOPLE HARASSING ME"" thing is. Maybe try showing the ones offering tons of money to help support the child, adopting the child, etc, too. There's a million other options out there than to choose abortion, most obvious of them is to try actually using birth control methods. Some people don't even make the attempt."
"What a wonderful woman, protecting women about to murder their babies from a crowd of old people.  Is she a saint or what?"
Men!
"How come all these anti abortion protesters are all altacocker men?!  Maybe women should start voting in laws restricting their bodily functions, like banning viagra, for example ..."
THey look like friggin' ZOMBIES !
What's so upsetting is that the Republicans sided with the terrorist the logic of that is beyond me!!
"Imagine if American women were legally allowed to forego motherhood through abortion and adoption, without being legally responsible for child support; yet American men are unable to legally forgo fatherhood without permission from women and are forced to pay pay child support. Double standards and female privilege are fun kids. Hands off their bodies, Hands off our wallets"
How about the protesters give that attention to homeless veterans?
Shelley is a freaking superhero! ❤️❤️❤️
"When they aree so pro life why they not protest against guns, protest for free healtcare, free childcare, free education for all children, payed parental leave from the company, the right of home and other things to help this woman and kids instead of threaten them!"
Especially crazy anti supporters
Let's lighten up and help people feel more comfortable about killing babies.  These protesters are very polite and kind.  They are PROlife not prodeath like the escort is. This is so twisted.  I pray your minds and souls will be healed.  May God have mercy on you.  Very sad to think what will happen to this escort after she goes to the other side.
"If my mom aborted me in the womb, i wouldn't care because i wouldn't be conscious enough to know and also i'd be dead so i couldn't have cared. 
Why are you all so obsessed with human life to begin with, honestly? Obviously it's cause it's self serving. Though we don't like to say that. No, it's gods will, or whatever. So noble.
Where is god when all these unwanted children are being forced into the foster-care system after having been born to parents who can't have them or don't want them? Is he too busy turning a blind eye to kids being raped and forced to go through with abortions? Too busy giving people cancer? But praise the lord! Praise him from the dusty old book written by people 2000+ years ago. 
Did anyone ever play that game of telephone? How did it go? 
Oh but the bible is as true and untainted as the day it was written right? god bless. 
If a woman want an abortion let her have it. Life is too short to have it dictated by people who think only their opinion is right cause their god has a bigger dic than your god."
Abort and Sterilize
What sort of evil is it that would kill a baby in the 3rd trimester. I just can't believe how twisted you would have to be. Those predominately fat ugly man hating cat women that guide people in are exactly as I would imagine they would look like.
Future GOP candidates.  I’m not joking.
"Abortion is sometimes a necessity! It should be a woman's choice, government needs to stay the hell out of everyone's business. My body my choice!"
He wasn’t yelling at anyone 😂
99.9% of us are ok with early abortions for convenience.  Let’s negotiate a gestational age. 99.9999% are all in for abortion to save the mother at any time. We got used to you reducing life to a “clump of cells.” You lost most of us when you try to claim abortions of convenience are for “health” and went far left looney for convenience abortions until the moment of birth.  Men getting pregnant and not knowing what a woman is didn’t help.
the protesters seem to be extremely respectful. what a bunch of pro baby murder propaganda
"You don’t have to listen, they have a right to be there. There not going in the clinic. Don’t want to listen to them, walk away. Simple"
Yet another pro death propaganda piece
Abortion escort? That's a thing now?
notice most of these protestors are older men!!! and before anyone comes at me yes I see there are women there too I am just making a point. I am a survivor of minor sex trafficking severe child abuse and CSAM(child sexual abuse materials) I work with minor victims of trafficking these young girls are usually around the ages of 12-17. after coming out of trafficking they need so many different services. they need time to process and heal. I had one girl who was 16 she had a child with her trafficker who had taken her when she was 14. when she was rescued she was 5 weeks pregnant again by her trafficker. She was so lost and didn't want another child with the man who had kidnapped drugged raped and sold her for 2 yrs. imagine for a moment being this CHILD because she truly is still a child. put yourself in her shoes. also ....think of all the children that are out there in broken systems all over the world.
Absolutely mind-numbing how many people in this comment section are insisting that patients in with life-threatening pregnancies are not being denied appropriate medical treatment due to these new laws. YES. THEY. ARE. Take responsibility for the effects of your extreme ideology in action.
This is TOTAL fear mongering. So sad.
"*- A letter from the voiceless-*
Dear Mom,
  I want to start by saying I love you, you were my first connection with another person. And I hoped I would get to see you face to face, hear your sweet voice sing to me sleep, But that never happened. Whatever I did I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you or cause you any trouble, I just wanted you to be my mommy. What I went through physically hurt me, and I hope no one ever has to go through that again. But what hurt me even worst was the fact that my mommy that I love so much hated me. So much that you wouldn't even acknowledge that I was alive(lacking the ability to breathe unaided), you called me it(a clump of cells). And after all that you threw me away(like garbage), you wouldn't even do that to a pair of old shoes. Now it's to late for me, but on my behalf can you try to stop this from happening to any other babies. PLEASE!
                        Love
                  The Unwanted

P.S. I forgive you."
a hail of gunfire...hmmm..so much for Pro-Life huh?..hypocrites...all of the so called Pro-Life cultists..
"See the problem with the anti abortion lot is it’s mainly made out of men.Men who will never get pregnant or have to have the child, and so suffer none of the hardships.Women should be the ones to decide if they want abortions or not, since it’s them who get pregnant, them who have the child, them who would have the majority of childcare problems if they did have the baby.
I just find it funny how women don’t seem to have a single say in the matter, despite abortion being for women not men."
"Pro-abortion protestors https://youtube.com/shorts/sa5wZjshIjg?feature=share.

The sheer degeneracy is palpable."
I'll save the suspense: This is about a security guard at an abortion clinic
"Dr. Leroy Carhart, yes, he's the victim here. Making money by bullying the unborn with his scalpel."
"In the 90's, I went to Planned Parenthood and ran into these type of people. They didn't believe me when I told them I was just there for birth control. They kept saying things like ""I was going to hell"" and ""give up my baby instead of killing it"". Their faces were priceless when I walked out holding up the birth control for all to see. Only one of them apologized."
"nasty to escort woman to kill a baby,it no differnt than leading a slave in 1800 to be sold at auction"
"Sad woman can't hear about those woman who die at the abortion clinic's getting their abortion and Realize abortion is Murder, That ALL Lives are Made in God's image and a Gift from God and should be LOVED by mom or someone else, if the Mother isn't ready to be a mom, people protest Black Lives Mater, Yet there's more abortion clinics in Black neighborhoods killing and has KILLED more Black's since 73 than ANY 1WAR IN HISTORY Or COMBINED, people get their Souls in the womb,all these Souls that were aborted, are crying out for Justice ⚖️ 💙 ❤️ 💔 in Heaven. kid's could have grown up to be doctors to save people's lives or a firefighter or be President, their Future is Gone Forever. God will have mercy on the children for being innocent, Look up the Great Tribulation. God's Wrath on Earth for All the Evil, that has been done, it's not to late to Repent and be saved from what's coming.if you have a contrite heart when you come to Emmanuel Jesus and ask for forgiveness, He will forgive You.Confess your sins, what you have did wrong, to him and he will take them away, He will set you Free."
This is what religion does.
And then went home and ate a dozen donuts
Now you may notice everyone that is against abortion is a crazy brainwashed catholic. Non separation of church and state anymore
"I do not believe abortion should be used as birth control. If you have sex, be prepared for consequences. If you don’t want kids, use birth control or get fixed. It really seems extremely simple. No need to kill an unborn child."
His maker is the most prolific abortionist of all.
They always look like that
This is insane
We need a woman just walk right up to them and ask for money for rent and diapers
"Funny how most people that are for abortion like this tiktoker,  are usually people you wouldnt want to ""F"" in the first place 😅😅.   She butthurt because aint nobody wanna do her lmao 😅😅"
If abortion isnt murder then why do people have funerals for miscarriages?
"All very sad, and poor unborn children that will never get to take a breath. This person walks babies to their death. she must be very proud."
"Why is Al Qaeda more compassionate than pro-lifers?

The 9/11 hijackers got to die instantly."
If you don’t like babies why do you make them? Just don’t make them. How easy is that? Seriously!
The greatest challenge of the human race . Getting the pale face to mind his business
Assisting in the murder of the unborn doesn’t make you a hero.
That's another CNN producer acting in their own story
Abortion is a business to people they make money off of killing babies but there going to end up in hell for eternity
The good lord is not letting you prolifers in heaven. That’s a fact.
Every man is pro life until we get the wrong woman pregnant.
Wow. What genius she is.
"“prolife” people are all about choosing life, yet they are violent ????"
Shelly is awesome
I was 15 15 when I had to give birth 15 when it was married off to somebody who beat me for the next 10 years you don't know what the f*** is going on in people's lives mind your business God gave us the right to choose that right was taken away from me and I'll be damned if I let it happen to anybody else
The next idiot that tries to pull hate into this just remember God gave us free will God give us the right to choose God gave us our bodies and they are ours
God gave us free will God gave us the right to choose those are our god-given rights
For every Marjorie Taylor green we have we need about a hundred of you sweetheart keep it coming mad love mad respect we have a right to choose this is our body women are losing their rights we must stop it now vote against Republicans that try to take our rights away thank you woman thank you for everything you're doing
"These ""pro life"" people send death threats to people.  How pro life is that."
"The killers profess to be ""pro-life"".  They're so pro life they killed people."
"It's ironic she uses ""self righteous""."
Abortion is not a constitutional right. That is why it should be up to the states.
"It breaks my heart to see how degraded the world has become. I feel like I have been watching freedom and empathy slowly slip away, like sand through an hourglass for so long. People are worse than I've ever seen. Filled with hate, envy, ire and SO obsessed with control. They could be spending their short lives doing what makes them happy, making choices that affect their own lives. Instead they choose to lash out at others, strangers even, for disagreement. At this rate, I would guess 2 to 3 years before we are completely overrun by the true depths of human depravity."
"ALL ACTIONS  HAVE RAMIFICATIONS .   Once pregnant it’s no longer JUST your body !!!!

If you go out , on the turps , have  an unprotected “Wellington boot ” then  fall pregnant ,  your actions have results .  Such as having a living child under your care / protection .   Adopt the child out 
It’s not the babies fault , a woman uses abortion as contraception.  

What about the father ?  It takes 2 to tango 

Abortion is infanticide -  before an abortion , mummy must be shown an abortion video

Planned parenthood was started by KKK member, Margaret Sanger . 

Abortion is only permissible if the mothers life is at immediate risk due to the baby . EG - Ectopic pregnancy  - Only physical risk , not mental health, therapy can combat that issue snd is treatable"
"when those lazy protestors start praying for you, it sounds like the 'thoughts & prayers' white male domestic terrorist's who don't think twice about murdering innocent children. so spare us the phony lectures about protecting babies because you are going to sit back and hear about priests raping children and republicans murdering them and vote to cut food stamps, health care and education. go do some voluntary work that counts and that literally protects children.."
Well at least these folks aren’t burning the building down like janes revenge destroying pregnancy crisis centers where they do help women keep and take care of their child.
I hope you are as concerned with the babies after they are born
Maybe if this people wher aborted we would be in a better place.
"👍Great job Shelley for helping women with their RIGHT TO CHOOSE, you're awesome 👏💚. Those anti- people have nothing better to do than harass that clinic, pathetic, if they want to save a ""life"" they need to start with their own. Jesus did not force his truth on anyone and neither should they! 💚"
"Hey, at least these scums are doing their part and showing people that there is still good/hope left in the world"
"She shows up to the same clinic to protect the women from the protesters who are violently screaming at them ""you're beautiful, your baby is beautiful, they deserve to live""................ and then they offer to help

This lady is pretty cringy"
Im not personally against abortion on occasion but think it’s good we keep it discouraged and frowned upon because at the end of the day it is cheating life.
"Seriously people … if you do not want or cannot afford a child, please do not put one in the oven . Just like you wouldn’t put a pizza in the oven if you don’t like to eat pizza, get it? Be responsible. Ask your parents how not to get impregnated. Not hard!"
"Has ANY woman EVER changed her mind due to protesters like this? 
Because I've never seen it happen. Just saying."
"Deep in everyone's heart, everyone knows, abortion ends a human life."
"I’m pretty sure not a single one of those protestors have any adopted children. They’re not pro life, they’re pro fetus."
Abortion is absolutely no men or f.....g religion's business!
"But what I wonder always always is that why do this pro-abortion people see it as a right for a woman to have as many abortions as she wants ""cause cause it's her body"" but when a woman wants to have a lot of children they forget the right that it's her right and her body why?
Some even call for legislation on the amount of children a woman can have which clearly goes against their principle of ""it's the woman's body and she can do whatever she likes"",some even go to the extent of looking down on this women,why?"
Let them defend what is right. Also not news worthy.
"Shelley, you are an angle some of us have prayed for to protect our loved ones during one of the hardest times in their lives.  Bless you."
The so called pro-lifers 3:59
I wish anti-abortion protesters would stop bringing religion in their arguments and actually bring up stuff that can be proven
This lady doesn’t have to worry about abortion
"I appreciate the escort's patience and good natured approach, which is beyond me.  I am irritated just listening to this harassment.  Good on you!  I can see women are in good hands with you.  Much respect!!!"
"It's weird to hang out outside of these clinics and yell at people. These ""good"" Christians need to go practice their faith in a way that's not harmful to others but they can't help themselves."
Why don't they build a security fence and have people buzzed in by appointment?
"One of the reasons I get sick of entertainers politicizing everything especially musicians and actors is their overall cluelessness about how things work. ""Heres my obligatory Pro-Choice PSA"". Whether Children of the 60s who attend Woodstock or weren't alive during GW Bush's presidency or are Cuban immigrants who don't understand how a real democracy work.  How the system works. Its nice ""for women"". Yeah whatever the fuck (proceeds to post clueless observations on Twitter). I've stopped listening and following a huge chunk of various forms of entertainment due to their stubborness to constantly push personal political views on their audiences."
I applaud the escort's work. It amazes me how removed from humanity the anti-choice group is. They believe in faeries and wizards that don't exist and ignore the realities of people and life.
"Where does a woman’s right to choose end and the unborn child’s rights to life start? In my opinion, that’s the question that must be decided. It’s a sliding scale that as each day and month passes moves from the mother towards the unborn child. I don’t believe that just because the female is the one carrying the baby it gives her absolute rights over the life of the unborn child from conception to birth. In my opinion, after looking at medical information, after the first trimester, the child has its own right to life. Now, this could and should be debated, but somewhere in the time between conception and before birth the child’s right to life takes precedence over the woman’s right to choose. The physical health of the mother and possibly rape or incest are exceptions that should be debated.
Why is no one talking about using condoms, contraceptives, and even abstinence until you are ready to have a child? Yes, it requires more effort but doesn't the prospect of aborting or bringing an unwanted child into this world make it necessary? And women because you will have to bear the burden, your first Choice is refusing to have unprotected sex until you are ready to have a child.
Also, access to contraceptives must be cheap, if not free, and easily accessible. Child care has to also be cheap, if not free."
All men protesting should get mandatory snip snip. Then they would be doing their part instead of telling women what to do with their body's. Fair is fair.
"Why do women wIt
 after3mo 2 get an abortion?"
If women got 2 c a picture  if their fetus they wouldn't get an abortion
Most of the ones protesting look dumb af honestly lol
kill babys at the borders but dont kill babys in the womb
Why can't they put up a privacy fence?
so many bigot retards in the USA (you don't see that anywhere else)
"If women can have an Abortion without any input of the man, Then a Man can walk away without paying a dime! that's equality. 
Women ""my body my choice""
Men ""my money my choice"""
Dan should be protesting at the pub to remind the men not Rosie their seed and keep their junk and sperm to themselves
Its a protest they are excersing there american right people died for
"Great Dan, we'll drop off all these babies at your house  for you  to raise then? You and your uterus got then ?

Were you graped 🍇 your moms latest boyfriend/ ""uncle"" they  brought home? By an actual relative that supposed protect and nurture you? By somone that was supposed to be your friend? Have your boyfriend leave you once they find out you're pregnant and say it's not theirs and you're a sl*t that slept around? Have fetus die inside you?
No? Well Dan maybe you and your non-uterus ought to sit this one out."
Maybe we should adopt a non religious view point. Also for you snowflakes that are anti-abortion. This country is not your church. Don’t force your religion on to other people.
Shame to all REPUBLICANS!!!!!
Abortion was created by the KKK to EXTERMINATE minorities. Margaret Sanger was also a DEVIL WORSHIPPER!! STOP STABBING BABIES IN THE VAGINA!! SMDH
Pro lifers are mostly Christian men saying the same arguments and being a thorn to all women
"Hey America, welcome to the middle ages!"
So are you supporting the women that have to have the children Dan? Oh Dan gives us our daily bread by your hand we are all fed...
"Shelly Man’s job is to prevent women from hearing any other option. Last I checked, a “choice” requires at the very least two options."
God bless these anti-abortoin protestors. They're trying to protect the vulnerable unborn babies.
I'm not into butt sex. But I don't go out every weekend saying it should be illegal.
"If you were really ""pro-life"", you would want these babies to have healthcare, housing, and education after they're born. You would want to help their families provide those things for them. But you don't. You don't even want to help the women who have to carry those babies to term, or help in the smallest way in their postpartum recovery by providing adequate paid maternity leave. You're not pro-life. You're pro-birth. And after those babies are born, you could care less. What you are is anti-choice, and anti-woman."
"Most of them are men,take note. Also how are these people pro life, when this woman has to search for bombs. Makes no sense! These are old retired folks who are also sinners, with nothing to do."
If men shouldn’t have the right to talk about women’s bodies I also feel people who are not parents should not talk about parenting
I want this job. Do you need help?
"Why do you ''''WANT'''' an Abortion?          WANT it so bad you act like it is a Wonderful Choice in Life. Not the unborn life that's for sure.
If you NEED it, I am all for you getting it. Otherwise, hell if your WANT it I wouldn't want you to be a parent either."
All I see is peaceful protest unlike George Floyd BLM ones.
"Babies Lives Matter .
Evil satanic lost souls chanting to abort babies."
God believes in free will
We will emancipate the unborn. Just as my ancestors were released from their chains - we will stop the Democrats (yet again) from denying the humanity of others to fit their political agenda.  We must end abortion nationwide.
Could you imagine planning for a baby then you have a medical issue and it dies so you need an abortion you go and are greeted by men shouting don't forget your baby is it a boy or girl like dude she wanted that baby and your out here making it seem like she's murdering her child screaming at her. Not only that but imagine being raped then going to get an abortion and your greeted with men telling you your awful for not keeping it. I don't even know how that's allowed to be honest. It's just sick and wrong. These women are being punished for things they can't help. And they are going to die because of things they can't help.  What is wrong with these people! Funny how pro lifers protest to save life then have no problem killing the mother when the life saving abortion she needs isn't allowed. I think they forget women who want their babies need abortions too.
Yall a bunch of baby murderers
"My body my choice! also lets give the medal of honor to Dr.Mengele. also anybody that doesnt put a covid vaccine in their bodies are terrorists. 670,000 murdered babies per year in the usa. that is the biggest silent holocaust. The prosecutors should arrest the doctors that dissected whole babies from the mothers wombs and charged with murder. The Mother also."
And now with it being illegal… woof.
Imagine telling a little girl to carry her child when she doesn’t want it or can’t take of it- referring to the 10 year old Ohio girl
My body my choice but not vaccines ..  I don’t care about women dying .
Third trimester abortions are infanticide
You don't have an Accurate picture of what goes on inside an abortion clinic. These abortion clinics sell your baby parts to pharmaceutical companies. Are they cutting you in on the profit.
This is why I hate free speech
If it wasn't for abortion women might resort to plan B 🗑🚮
If you were a meme. You'd be a great one. Keep up the awesome work. Fk the protester's
They sometimes protest outside a Toronto station. They are loud and have no consideration to any children that are passing. Disgusting mostly old white men who have no right to say how a woman chooses her healthcare. Revolting to try and force their religion on others.
So much drive and tenacity to comfortably walk up to peaceful protestors. So brave.
"CNN is downplaying the significance and immorality of abortion. They are making the pro-life party out like they are ""uncool"" or somehow primarily linked to insane people who just so happen to be ""pro-life."" Most liberals aren't smart or wise enough to realize that they are just being manipulated."
"It is a simple math equation: 

alive + human = has rights

Once you begin adding more to this equation: 

alive + human + sentient + autonomous = justification for ulterior prejudices"
"Make contraceptives, sterilization and reproductive rights readily affordable/ accessible. Killing babies should not be available without medical reasons. It will wake people up to not have unsafe sex and to protect themselves as much as possible. Hook up culture should die down a ton because of this. Sex makes children it is for procreating biologically. If this becomes a landslide into making birth control illegal that is NOT ok at all. Women need those things to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies to begin with."
Good for her.  I don't think I could stomach those loons all day every day without beating the shit out of them.
This woman is a hero!
Can we hold up signs in protest with the riddled bodies of children that have been shot with AR-15s
Anti abortion law should accompany with mandatory Male vasectomy (atleast over 40y old men).....then it will be more sensibles.....
Why ppl don't understand that abortion is women health issue
Does anyone know where to find data on how many unwanted pregnancies would be avoidable by making better sexual choices and how many are simply unavoidable like ectopic pregnancies and drastically changing situations after wanting to get pregnant?
She was fed up with them so she focused on them!!
since 2007 11 workers have been killed and also over several million humans as the direct result of abortion.
"""this literally life risking work"". yes idiot, that is exactly what it is, its abortion, it is literally risking the life of every human with intent to kill."
"""that walk is the loneliest walk if you are by yourself"". those women do not walk there alone, they only leave alone, thats what abortion does, it kills humans."
"All the way from Norway, full support for you and your pierce Shelley!  
I cannot wrap my head around these morons? Pro-life? This is christian fanatics with the narrowest view possible! 
No sense of the real world, and what is going on! 
This is deplorable!!"
"I started trading with forex trade late last year and till date have made over 12.7 Btc even with the ups and downs since the journey . With forex trade help I no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin , you can easily get in contact on my channel."
I don’t understand why an unborn fetus is more important than a woman’s life. Give people the opportunity to choose what they want for their body
Good for this lady actually caring about other. Not like these dimwitted fucktarts who harras families who are dealing with reality.
Shelly is an evi person l. Abortion must be  stopped.
"And if any anti abortion activists assault me, you Will end up in the ER"
“If there’s something here that looks like a bomb 💣 “ 😯
"These antiabortion protesters need mental health assessments, they claim to protect a Fetus, but in doing so threaten the lives of those protecting others. Their Religious beliefs show they don't care about other people either, false prophets."
"What's wrong with them saying there's help and other options than killing your family member? 🤔 They said deadly violence but there have been bombing at pregnancy centers. There has been violence on both sides. The facts they try to present are horrible. Women will start dying?? We've been dying, since the womb. Especially us black women. Women's rights start in the womb."
"Just like people can protest for abortion, they can protest against it. I think everyone is being a bunch of idiots."
"Ridiculous, wouldn't scare me at all. People have the right to make their own decisions as to what they'd like to do with their bodies. Assaulting folks and threatening to kill them? Does your little black book encourage this behavior? Is God sending you DMs asking for violence towards innocent people? Bullying people into submission will never work, you'll encourage folks to give you the fight you're looking for!  💪"
"My favorite is when pro abortionist say “it’s a fetus” do you know what a “fetus” is? It’s the third phase of the first stage of the HUMAN LIFE CYCLE, look it up. You terminate a fetus you ended a human life, it’s appalling that you’ve dehumanized the HUMAN LIFE CYCLE to support your perceived right to end an innocent human life. History is full of people that dehumanized others Hitler did it to the Jews America did it to the blacks and now y’all do it to your own children."
Religion does this to people.
"Pro-lifers don't have a damn life, ironically."
"Ride dick, get pregnant. Run from your responsibilities ."
it's so funny how it's literally just old men💀
Haha I got an ad for TikTok before this video
What I want to know is how many unwanted children have these anti-abortionists adopted?
What child gets to choose life the mother's choosing death for the child every single time. Want to talk about the inter workings of Planned Parenthood. Show the baby being aborted at 9 months.
"These hypocrites aren't pro-life. They are anti-choice. If they were truly pro-life they would care about what happens to that child after he/she is born. Is that child going to get proper care? Is that child going to get shot with a gun? These hypocrites have no moral standing. They have the right to believe what they want, but they don't have the right to force their beliefs on everyone else. To them I say 🖕"
Conservatives have a fetus fetish. The bible states that a fetus is not a child until God breathes the breath of life into it. Unfortunately the anti choice folks ignore that and think they are above God. They will try and force their beliefs on God and everyone else. These are not good people.
This woman is really sad😔
"The utter arrogance of the protesters is mind blowing. It's like they believe their own preferences should be the forced upon others. And, that their chosen religion should be forced on people making a very hard (in many circumstances) choice. The utter reprehensible hatred of those protesters is vile."
"*If one day they changed a woman's mind in abortion and then that woman casually ask them to take care of the child, do y'all think they would accept that child!? ABSOLUTELY NOT.  They will definitely not do anything to that child and leave it to the mother, after a pro-life movement that can't even take care of a life in the real world.*"
"Only in america, killed by pro life people"
Nebraska?!! NO NO!! I am in Kansas that is so terrible.
"keep this thought in mind if its not beyond your comprehension when someone walks with the real Christ they never have to look back wondering when someone is going to grab or harm them, live in the world and do these heartless cold blooded murders of children or twist their minds with sodomite perversion you will live everyday wondering when someone will obey Gods laws and commandments and send you to judgement, its time to quit being puppets and open your eyes to the wickedness and heartlessness around you and either take a stand against it or burn with them"
I do believe my body my choice but what about the baby's choice? 💔😣
Bless her & those putting their lives on the line to protect & defend these women!  Only God knows what’s going on & their needs/reasons to make the decisions they have.  ❤️😔
"I wanna butcher babies !!! 👶 
Come on ???!!"
What a gutsy and courageous person. & that doctor deserves credit too. What’s happening to my country?
So I get pulled over for doing 5 mph over speed limit have to pay a $210 fine this guy man assaults a woman and gets a $50 fine what the f***
That poor old man first of all the Bible is phony there is no such thing as a god so he's an idiot there after that he's just a fascist
It's killing a baby it has its own DNA it's not your body it's a babies body
It is always better to force women who don't want children to have babies so they can neglect and abuse them for many years during the most influential parts of their life which makes them who they are as a person.  It makes for great human beings in the future who are very appreciative of being put through that.  It's also better to have women go to illegal abortion clinics where unlicensed physicians can perform them or just do it themselves with hangars and then rush to the hospital afterwards bleeding internally.  Go Pro-Life people!
"The problem with ""pro lifers"", they focus on their zealous beliefs and not the children that are born and are in horrible situations.  Once the baby is born they wipe their hands of any responsibility and thought.  They should mind their own damn business and stop pushing a fictional book with antiquated beliefs on to others.  I hate religious fanatics.  Practice your own faith to yourself and to anyone who wants to listen.  Not everybody believes in the same thing.  Most people who claim to be Christians are the least Chris like people I know.  Rarely do anything productive to help people."
She'll never have to worry about making the decision
Lets talk about why you're so guilty. So instead of making amends and repenting. You decide to harass innocent people
Boy that virgin Mary couldn't get any paler
This just brings back memories of the people begging me not to have the abortion I was having to save my life. They are so incredibly selfish and thoughtless.
Pro-'life' anti abortion protesters killing and assaulting people in abortion clinics speaks volumes of their christian convictions
I drove a friend to a clinic before there were escorts & it was INFURIATING! They mobbed my car!
"Shelly serves the devil. Killing gods greatest creation is not the answer. God forbid anyone use contraceptives. Humor about killing babies? Shelly promotes sin, and she's worried about a meme? Show your narcissism Shelly! If you don't change your ways, you will not live for eternity,  just the moment."
"Who’d want to knock up Shelley???
That big f’cking wildebeest!!
Mrs. Mann!!!
She should have no need for an abortion, that raggedy-ass pro-choice walrus!!"
"“Women will die”. Every state allows women to get abortions if birth risk her life. Scare tactics. Most abortions are just another form of birth control for the majority of the women. Women Close your legs, men keep it in your pants, or both use protect. It’s really simple."
Look into how much these clinics make on the sales of the body parts of the unborn they murder to labs for studies that’s on top of the price they charge the mother to murder there unborn……….. can’t you see it’s a business and the mothers are the incubator for the product and that woman’s rights to be used as a cash cow and incubator for a product they sell ?
Why r they showing her and the location?
"How come none of y'all are saddened and hurt and distressed over the terminated babies? Or as y'all like to call them, fetuses!"
I rode my bike past protesters outside of an abortion clinic. Across the street was a huge billboard with a picture of a child and the message that 60% of American children live in food insecurity. Do these protester even care what happens to these children after they're born?
This subject is between the woman and GOD ❣️ 🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸
"Anti-abortinists need to understand that the Bible has two iconic characters mentioning use of the abortion pill, “bitter water” (Joseph and Isaiah) divorce during trial-marriage (Joseph offering ‘honorable separation). Until the 20th century, most societies allowed ‘forced birth’ aids until ‘the quickening’. Whatever, these types of self-proclaimed saints of their Judeo-Christian “God”, will stop at nothing to be violent."
"Their religion  and its dogma are irrelevant on that soil. Find a pulpit somewhere, but this isn't it.

Notice there sperm is past its expiration date and so they are upset."
"You never hear about these anti-abortion people adopting children, or starting foundations to help pregnant women who feel they are too young to have a child. You know how many children already suffer abuse and neglect? How overpopulated our planet is? Which contributes to negative impacts on the environment, poverty, the economy, etc. They don’t want women having children to be on welfare, but that’s what’s going to happen more if you force everyone that gets pregnant to carry to term. These people are all about making a woman have a child, even if she was raped, or if carrying to term could kill her, but once the child is born, nothing. They care more about an embryo, than living women or children. Religious hypocrisy! You never see pro-lifers protest to get better childcare, or better options for women who don’t want a child, but also don’t want an abortion. This is why there is a separation of church and state. People should not be affecting the lives of everyone, because of THEIR religious beliefs!"
Judge not least you be judged. Christianity is so selective these days.
They want to keep bringing more children in the world and tell women on what to do with their bodies but the children in foster care or live on the streets they don't care about! Explain that
they should arrest these nuts preventing people from heathcare
She's extremely snobby and forces her unscientific personal emotionally charged views. The pro life community ate offering help. Why is that being demonized? It's a baby they ate trying to save and saving the mother from murdering the defenseless baby.
Once born they all could care less
self appointed saviors.   doing GOD's work apparently...because god needs them doesnt he......only they decided that
How many kids have these clowns adopted themselves? Ya...that's what I thought
"MEN! instead of protesting at clinics, GO VOLUNTEER FOR A VASECTOMY!!!"
I demand that you can’t have an abortion and also that every lunatic & psycho can have as many guns as they want.
THESE WOMEN CHOOSETO GO OUT AND ALEEP WITH EVERY GUY THEY SEE AND EXPECT AMERICANS TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THET DONT BELIEVE IN .I GUESS TO MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEMSELVES
Be more outraged by the overturning of Rowe v Wade America!! This is The Hadmaids Tale. It here. It’s now. Be more OUTRAGED!!!
Killing babies is not okay
Thank you
"These bloody 'Pro-Lifers...' offer to 'help' these poor women with 'thoughts and prayers' (but bugger-all else,) send death threats to escorts, and have even KILLED medical staff -- but noo, *they're* the saintly ones, caring about a fetus that, even if it DOES survive its birth, will most likely struggle in poverty and/or a potentially dangerous home environment. These nutters need to stay out of other people's business."
Im pro choice but what irks be is “activists” who make it out like its just like going to dr for a normal surgery/procedure. A life / potential human is most def being killed and that ie HEAVY shit . It should be like a last option kinda deal for woman who are raped or their life is in danger . It bothers me who some woman just be huge irresponsible hos and use it as a form of birth control and then brag about it as if its some kind of activism.
"If you're going to take a life and it's not an unborn baby what makes you better leave people alone and live your own life, everyone has their own cross to bare, it's not your business"
"I would happily escort women safely to their doctors in these cases. If there's one thing these women need, it's not a group of self-righteous elderly bigots screaming at them outside the door. They need a kind, compassionate ear and guaranteed safe entry into the clinic."
Shouts out to the escorts! You are doing amazing!
"When he meet his maker, he’s going to ask him when did he hire him as his hit man. And killing people at abortions clinics? Way to go pro-lifers. Way to go."
"Dan and the other protesters could actually help the children.... living ones... like foster children. I bet that would actually quench his ""guilt""."
"These clinic escorts are such wonderful people, thank you for protecting women💚💚💚"
Raising a child is a heroic act. But should never be mandated.
Anti-abortion is completely misogynistic. WAKE UP LADIES .
"Right to life should start with the man not dipping his wick, and end with a young person not dying in a BANKER""S WAR."
Poor lady to stupid to know there standing up for her rights to if they get by with this next time it mite be her voting rights
"always using god as their backbone, there is no god, its just a big scam"
"People are literally attacking people going to church and firebombing pregnancy centers and trying to kill the Supreme Court Justices but the terrorists at CNN want to talk about crimes that happened in the early 90s when I was still a toddler as if they are relevant today.

Leftists are irredeemable monsters who know they are going to hell and that is why they want to cause as much chaos and destruction as they can before they suffer the karma they have wrought upon themselves."
"Does she broadcast them on TikTok so they're up on a social media platform for everyone to see?  Pretty awesome right? It's kinda like that person that posted content of people that, in their OWN WORDS we're saying all kinds of radical stuff. What was the name of that??..... OH! ""Libs of TikTok"" it's called!! Yeah. Wait,...CNN you hated it when they did it/do it. But, ya think it's great when this person does it? So, ya have zero moral compass. Just follow an ideology and if you agree with someone doing it, It's amazing, stunning and brave. But if you disagree with the person doing it then it's awful, deplorable and they should be deplatformed & maybe threatened or intimidated. Ya see where this train is heading right? Not much of a leap to go from here to ""throw em in jail if they disagree with our po!itics/ideology!"" & 'seperate rules & punishments' for people based on political stance. Ya know how this movie ends. ""Throw em in jail!"" becomes hurting/killing based on politics."
It’s crazy how u trying to show this women as brave and doing the right thing when she’s actually trying to justifies killing potential human beings!! there is no excuse  u can utter that can justify giving anyone the right to kill. Stop sleeping around and stick to ur families and drop that feminist way of viewing the world.
Thank you protestors! You make such an amazing difference! There have been countless women that changed their mind due to pro-life advocates and ended up choosing life!
"I love this, Don't worry women won't stand for this much longer and Abortion will be legal again...
-we should pray hahahahah.. too soon?"
God bless those fucking assholes.
These escorting employees are so appreciated! Thank you so much for all that you do protecting these women and their right to choose!
I wish i had 0 issues and free time to make someone else problems mine
Abortion is murder!!! Repent and turn to Jesus Christ!!
When you meet your maker he won't ask you about the sins of others. You've lost the plot
They are praying for you. Give me a f........ng break.
Why do these people think only their opinion counts.
"The Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia is in the gay section.  There used to be weekly demonstrations there.  I remember watching one and I loved it when these activists were saying “don’t kill your baby, don’t kill your baby” to a man dressed as a woman."
All I heard is I've been harassing people since 1973.
There’s a good reason that there are only a few doctors left in the country that will perform third trimester abortions. And it’s not because they’ve all been killed off. Most doctors know better than to think that killing a 6-month old fetus and beyond is just “terminating a pregnancy.” You’re seriously mistaken / delusional if you think this man is a hero for what he does.
Dr. Carhart is a hero. I hope that he finds someone to replace him.
get an air horn
"""I've been in this movement since '73"" - awesome! So, how many parentless children have you adopted and raised in that time, Sir?"
"Wow, 11 deaths don't really seem like much when you consider that over 1.5 million babies were sacrificed last year alone."
Amazing woman!! Keep up the fight! We shall overcome.
i love her so much thank god for her
I would love to know if any if the anti-abortion people adopt? Cause if ya dont' you are NOT doing the work of our Lord Jesus Christ....you are working for the other guy.
"Don't these folks that have nothing else in their lives to do. Like protest the
BIGGER PROBLEMS for our world."
Adding an element of humor...she says. Abortion is nothing to be humorous about. Let's  not forget abortion is a big business. Follow the money. Just look at how many people they have escorting the clients.
How is 3 trimester abortion not murder when all of these fetuses are viable
"Pro life and Pro Choice is all about divide. No one is listening to the victims. After listening to 50 testimonials from girls/women that had an abortion, some of those were SA and are minors. I can say for one is that these beautiful females did suffer mentally and emotionally, most of which is guilt. Most of them could not let go of that strong bond with there baby despite there circumstances they have faced. Some of which lasted for a period of 30 years or more. Simply saying abortion is health care is a far cry what it really is. 
Some of you on both sides and I don't care which really need to listen to the victims of abortion except really having your own opinions. 

If I could try to explain the connection between human beings of experiencing unconditional love.
It's like this, my friends had a new born baby...I didn't have children at that time and they told me ""you'll never know what love truly is until you have a baby"" I was like yeah what ever and it didn't matter what it meant at that time. A few years went by and I settled down, she is 2 and half now and now I understand what it really feels to love unconstitutionally. Something I cannot explain. 

That bond if taken away, even if earlier...I would not be the same person, I feel for these people that chose abortion. 

I hope you all find peace in knowing that your baby is back with God."
Anti abortionists are right ... abortion is murder ... why bash chritians ?  They have to blame someone ...
She not exactly easy on the ole eye..
"Hey cnn instead of posting this old video why don't you interview the elephant after the roevwade decision , I really want to see it cry on live news , like all the other unhinged sjws of tiktok."
Pro-life activist embarrass me as well as the other behaviour made by pro-choice activist. And the fact that the 'clinic escort' is trying add humour to this very sensitive and sad topic. How tragic is it that people are fighting for the right to kill fetuses.
Our souls never die
Screeeeammnmm mm
"The pro lifers, also like to complain about ""poor people"" and how much money they get to support a child someone couldn't take care of."
Absolutely disgusting that people stand & yell at people who are often making the hardest decision of their life.  They don’t need some pro-lifer yelling lies at them or “praying over them”.   Leave them the hell alone!  It’s none of their business.  Really sad that escorts aren’t necessary
It’s sad that normal people are being terrorized by religious zombies.
Y'all are messed up
if you need an escort that would be a wakeup call for what I'm doing
"You do not need to kill to have a good life. You may opt for an adoption to give life for the child. However, if it means a life and death situation though, so be it."
Would you ever abort your cats or dogs.?? Why humans then??
"I'm sure the ""help"" they offer is to send you to welfare and sign up for the circle of never ending poverty."
this lady is a monster. the doctor is a monster. how horrible of a person do you have to be to take a job were you kill (or help kill) defenceless babies?
3rd trimester abortion are you people nuts...that's capital murder.thats a fully developed baby.it can live outside the mother in the 3rd trimester.may God have mercy on your soul
Desperate!! Sure because shaming those crying over babies being slaughtered is so much more righteous than shaming those slaughtering babies to keep from having to raise their own.  Choice begins at consent.. after that I still call it murder!
"Maybe men should stop getting women pregnant. Go into schools, talk to boys about birth control, about treating women with respect. No women gets pregnant on her own."
"You people expesselly the men how gullible you are, a women can choose but a man can't choose no child support.wheres the equal rights.my wallet my choice. You know why women cry at abortion clinics hummm because there killing babies"
"I am not for abortion, but let's be honest, no one can force his or her believes on anyone that think otherwise. God gave us the right choose our own destiny. Love thy nabour as you love yourself. 😢😢😢"
"They are crazy, it's it harassment ?"
"Anti abortion idiots are dangerous, violent, imbecilic, and need to be arrested."
"All these protesters should have to sign a legal form....for all babies that are born unwanted, for them to each adopt one baby.  Start saving now..
.adopting is more than you think. How many of these protesters would agree?aybe a third....at the most. The rest go back into the system. So 
 are these protesters willing to stand for the unwanted babies?"
Good thing some of these are about to pass….
"What a stupid thing, people are so scared of kids getting murdered at school but not afraid of babies being murdered before even being born."
"Send all those anti-abortion activists to the cities and tell them to take care of all the homeless people. Instruct them to instead tell a homeless person that he or she is beautiful, to feed him or her, and to make a lifetime commitment to continue doing so. THEN - maybe - I’ll take them seriously."
These protesters could better spend their time adopting or fostering children.
Pro CHOICE
"Conservative extremist: "" I'm pro-life. it's wrong to kill another living being."" 
But will support the death penalty. 
Conservative extremist: ""government mask mandates violate my freedom and rights, my body my choice."" 
but have no issues with the government telling a woman what she can or cannot do with her body. 
Conservative extremist: ""Cancel culture is ruining our society.""
But will support a man who uses social media to incite hate, division, and bigotry. Regularly attacks people on social media and demands they are fired or ruined politically/ financially for disagreeing with him. 
Someone, please help me understand the dichotomy that is the Conservative extremist. 
(Conservative Extremist aka Trumptard)"
"How do u sleep with a 3rd trimester abortion on ur hand really, the world needs to end coz we r becoming mad too mad"
Thank you. You do a incredibly tough job that I’m sure is mostly thankless. Our country needs  more people like the patriots in the video.
Cnn is a demonic antichrist channel that needs to repent
"""I believe these children are being violated....""
I wonder what he thinks about the 10yo from Ohio who was raped and impregnated.
Would he have been outside the clinicnshe had to go to for services when she couldn't go to one in her own state?"
I guess everyone missed the fact that God will judge them .
"This is just harassment by self righteous lunatics, nothing more. There should be a safety zone of at least one mile around any abortion clinic where harassment like this and protests are not allowed."
"I went to a clinic one time where protestors were constantly out front.

I went in to ask some questions and get some information about the services they provided.

I wasn’t doing this because I had any involvement at all in a potential abortion.

I did it because I wanted to be informed .

As I pulled into the parking lot, the protestors started yelling at me. Presuming I was someone going there for some nefarious reason instead of just trying to educate myself.

That speaks VOLUMES about these protestors."
Keep your legs closed
How many kids have they adopted? How many are foster parents? How can you be a “Pro-Lifer” but racist at the same time?
Try to take a gun away from a Pro-Lifer and see how that turns out
"Escorts to protect people seeking health care? Wow - the USA is a sick country. You have no idea what it's like to see the insanity of that country when you come from a freer, saner, safer place."
I guess I don't understand why those same people care so much about the unborn but don't protest gun violence that is actually killing children in schools.
"None of these people have permits to protest there. Why aren’t they forcefully removed by the police,..?"
"There’s nothing more Christian than shaming, threatening, assaulting and killing those who doesn’t share your view,..? 🤔

Say it together with me, people: Christian extremists!!"
"In the city I live in there are laws (with real punishments) that excludes people from protesting with 500 metres of a clinic.  But we have legal abortion here in Australia and I doubt that will ever change.  No illegal abortions, no backyard butchers, no rabid Christians shoving there bullshit beliefs down people's throats."
The USA are such a strange place...
"All these anti abortion protesters should just be asked, How many children have you fostered or adopted, Rj in Oz"
"Shelley is a new hero of mine.  Thank you, Shelley.
And HEY, anti-abortion cruds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You are concerned about human life?  Fetuses?  Then how do you justify killing abortion clinic workers?  Or not providing child care and paid leave for new mothers in red states?
Since when is THAT ""pro-life""?"
Is. Dan going to take responsibility financially and otherwise for these children
Those religious nuisances are the American Taliban!
That's exactly what we need to do
Them people are amazing theyre trying to save lives
how can I donate to the Clinic Escorts. How shameful those people screaming are.
I remember my abortion the Planned Parenthood I even went to initially didn’t do abortions I had to call different doctor. I didn’t want to have an abortion now these ladies he’s harassing wants to have an abortion it’s a need it’s a necessity for me it was life or death this man is despicable and disgusting and his maker will probably condemn him if he actually took the time to read the fucking Bible he’s throwing everyone’s face at and forcing upon everybody else maybe he would realize what it actually says.
"Dr. Tiller was killed in a church, just down the road from me."
God bless these people for fighting those people who need their service.  It’s not anyone’s business.
"They're pro-life yet they kill and hurt people???lololol Such hypocrisy, these pro-lifers are stupid."
"Anti-Abortion protester,,, I am here to help you...... but I won't give you my name."
"What even sort of bullshit charge was that? ""Mutual consent"" that says something about how messed up the law is. I hope Shelley and all abortion clinic escorts stay safe. They are doing depressingly necessary work."
I have been watching her TikTok for quite a while. I think she and others who do this are amazing people. They deal with the pro-birth people days so women can get healthcare.
"""we're praying for you right now"" = we're not doing anything."
"Her reactions are gold. “Joe, cmon are you done?”"
What a hero she is.
"""Imma take a little break from escorting ""😂 😂"
"would  any  human being end up with these guys , for sure not. that is why abortion is invented on the first place."
"I love reading these comments complaining about not killing babies,by ""people"" that are alive and breathing because their own mothers allowed them to live.... stupidity much?..why don't any of you take one for the team,take yourself out if life is so meaningless to you?..one word.. HYPOCRITES"
"I volunteer to be a honker. 
I am SURE I can drown out those protestors."
Didn't God send the angel of death to kill all the first born sons? 🤔
The Taliban has a a's new Heartland
Till all these poor people are forced to have children and their taxes ho way way up to pay for their welfare. No one looks at the long picture.
"Already saw this video. But yeah, Anti-Abortion laws and Protests are not gonna work if there isn’t a healthcare system in place to solve all of the fundemental issues related to struggling and vulnerable mothers and children."
"THANK YOU to all the protectors who stand with clients going to the clinic. 
You are so brave. You make a huge difference.
(And countless thank yous for the medical professionals who chose to take on this work and put a target on their backs. You are all heroes)."
"They could be volunteering in the community, with kids who need attention. But no, spend your time harassing people trying to access health care! I’m sure god will be so pleased with how you chose to spend your time…"
Do they think women who have scheduled abortions should go to prison for life and/or be executed? Because those are the typical punishments for 1st degree murder. (I’m sure some extremists have this view but the vast majority don’t - because it could always happen to them or someone they love.)
"Story time: I was 7 months pregnant and donated time to PP for election call purposes. It’s important to mention I love being pregnant, I love my children, I’d even consider being a surrogate, however I do believe in a woman’s right to choose. Anyway, driving in to PP I was harassed and almost blocked from getting in, it was scary and very overwhelming. I wasn’t even going in for an abortion and still felt the weight of whatever emotions the women/girls feel when going into the building. I guess the moral of the story is that “abortion clinics” are used for so much more."
"These escort women are amazing, 
The protesters should be  ashamed, they have no idea, the men especially.
Hypocritical sods. They have only followed their own agenda, not the truth of suffering. 
Jesus said, never to judge others, or you will be judged.  Don't look at the stick in someone else's eye, look at the plank in your own.  
Be strong ladies, your doing a great job."
😂 seems odd the only females protecting abortions are the ones nobody wants to get pregnant in the first place 🐄 🐮 🐷 🐖
"Truly abortions should be available right alongside other care.  Then for all these wackadoos would know, they might be heckling a women on her way in for a tonsillectomy. Joke’s on them."
Love this woman.
"So these anti abortions kill people … and yet they protest about “ pro life “

This is what happens when stupid organize religion takes over !

We need to DESTROY ORGANIZE RELIGION!!"
I don't think that people understand what goes on INSIDE an abortion clinic!
"Amazing that derelict men take no responsibility for the fruits of  their sexual abuse, violence or exploitation!"
"Thank you so, so very much for the work you do, Shelly!!! You are an incredible human being! 💚💚💚"
"I’m watching ‘The Handmaids’ Tale’ and looks like that book/series is slowly becoming a reality. Starts here… so scary America, so scary!"
"I think when a minor gets raped they should implement law with death penalty for rapists. Other methods should be castration, or injection for infertility for the rapist. If the woman is adult she should decide what to do with the rapist s life  since her free will was taken by force from her I think he should no longer have free will. If she decides she wants to marry him, he should comply with her demands and be forced to work and be a provider for her and the baby."
😂😂😂this country should be purged they have people ok with killing babies but get mad for people who don't support them😂😂😂 blessed be the God of Israel please show this country no mercy
Yiu dont care about women!! You just love money!!!
Imagine a group of people being so dangerous that people make a living being protected from them...
"I dink the male does terrible job . 
Abortion is a sin"
Men need a womb !! Nobody's business !!
The religious extremists huddle together like bowling pins. sure would be unfortunate if the incoming patients just… 🎳
"Mostly men and a few brainwashed women
Hmmm

EDIT: The fact she has to look for bombs every morning is beyond disgusting"
That was brave of Shelley.
Why is it almost all old men 💀💀
"Why do they not offer to adopt the children if they care so much? And that's IF they could even be able to support it properly. Unfortunately we DO live in a world with limited resources... well who am I kidding it's the greed why the resources aren't enough more than anything else. But if they want women to stop having abortions, they should go to the root of the problem. Start protesting against greed and then against abortions."
All these crazy religious people are ridiculous. The irony that they want the “baby” to live yet they’ll attack the mother & clinic. These people are full on narcissistic crazy people
Stop pushing your religion on to us!  Not everyone is a Christian! Not everyone believes in God!
Funny how these god soldiers aren’t protesting in front of Walmart because their starvation wages create child hunger. Guess they don’t care once your born
"Studies show liberals have a smaller amygdala..,you can stick a plate of rotting meat in front of their faces and they won’t react as badly as a conservative would. Liberals are not biologically capable of feeling reluvsion at things that disgust a normal person."
They should put headphones on the clinic clients when they get out of the car and also have a covered “walkway of support” or something.
"God will be the Judge ! NOT men and women !
I wonder, will they be there to raise the child for 18 years ?
House the child as it grows, feed, educate, pay for Medical care ? 
When does the commitment begin and end ?
If it happens and is followed through! 
We never seem to hear them ... other than, ""We can help you"" !
Yes, perhaps carry the child and then be coerced to give it up for a so called perceived life with an adopting family ! Who may or not give the child a better life !

Or, as I stated, help the mother raise it to 18 years old !?"
"The fact she has to inspect the surroundings for bombs every day, says all you need to know about how far these self righteous nutjobs are willing to go to push their extreme christo fascist ideas onto the rest of society."
She acts like she's walking sometime down a red carpet.. but she's helping to kill babies!! And she's so proud of that. Hate to see when she meets her maker!
"My sister had an abortion a few weeks ago.
The cells stopped dividing and wouldn't implant but also not spontaneously abort on itself. So she had to if she didn't want to risk a sepsis.
I'm glad we live in Germany where it wasn't an issue as soon as she found a doctor"
Thank you to the brave people like Shelley who stand up these sanctimonious zealots. And male anti abortion protesters have nothing to say on this topic. Power hungry control freaks. Please go home and stop harassment of women already going through a horrendous ordeal.
"Thank God I was a Christian before I heard of these so called right wing Christian anti abortionist.  God has told us that killing is a sin whether it's those who do abortion or the murderer who kills the doc who does the abortion.  However, we can't get away from the fact that sometimes aborting a fetus is necessary for whatever medical reason. God is the ultimate judge and if he does not strike these people dead why should a human kill them. These people are the same type of Christians who use to lynch blacks after church on Sundays. Now that past time is forbidden they must find another cause celebre to exercise their violent traits. Sad that the name of Christ is misrepresented and vilified because of these people.  God is love."
Why are there men protestors? Sorry what do they know? Speaking of a man myself.
I miscarried conjoined twins. I needed to have a an abortion afterwards because my body could not pass them. It’s called an incomplete miscarriage. They died. I saw a ton of specialists. If I would not have had the procedure I would’ve become septic and died.
You don’t give a crap about those kids once they’re born why aren’t you fighting for those ones? The kids in foster care? The kids who are looking for people to adopt them? How about the mothers that are basically forced to have babies they can’t afford and can’t feed? What are you doing about them? Instead of wasting your time doing something that isn’t going to change a thing don’t you go and do some thing to actually help. What is your God gonna say to you about the fact that you’re judging other people when his word says not to. Not everyone has to have the same beliefs as you. Also it depends on what version of the Bible you believe in. In original versions it talks about The fact it is not all life until quickening which is moving around four or five months. The worst part is there are people out there who have genetic mutations and illnesses that can’t have kids Because their children would just suffer and die. They would never be able to even afford the care for these types of children. Yet these people are forcing them to be born to suffer and then bitch about the fact that we the people have to pay for them. These people are so two-faced it makes me crazy
"Last week, my wife and I, had a scan for our baby. Yes the scan is lovely to see and hear the heart beat and find out the gender. But that scan is also finding out if the baby is developing properly. It finds out if mother and baby are healthy and the birth will be safe with both surviving. If not... if one or both may die or live a horrible life, then an abortion needs to be talked about. If that happened to us, we chose life, but an abortion is what would happen."
"My girlfriend in 1977 had an abortion when she was 17. A few years later, when she was ready, she married a man and they had two children. She's a grandma now. My mother, born in 1918(!) knew women who used coat hangers, and she was pro-choice before there was such a thing. Glory be to a woman's right to choose what is right for her own body!"
"These protesters are stalkers, and they are sick."
It's 2022 and since 1977 11 people was killed I'm not saying I have no sadness in my heart for those people who has died that is something that never should of happened but do you know how many children are denied the Chance just because there mother's decide there not ready to be a adult and take responsibility for her actions even if it's under the situation of rape or father left what is another example of someone choosing to stay a child instead of taking responsibility for there actions abortion is never a good thing if you was raped or the father left and you can't take care of the child on your own give it up for adoption the only time the practice is a good thing is if the mother and the child is going die if you don't terminate the pregnancy if there is a possibility of saving one of those lives you need to take it if you can save the child's life by getting it all the mother's womb as quickly as possible but the mother will still die then you need to save the child's life but if there no possible way of saving the child's life and you can save the mother's life then save to mother's life but other then that it is never ok to take a life
So WHY does the Supreme Court allow this type of harrassment at legal medical facilities but expect   freedom from protesters at their homes?
"I wish they would do a piece or all the clinics posing as Medical Facilities provider ,when in reality they are religious groups. How is that not against the law? If I set up a stand outside and say I’m a Medical Provider I would be arrested in less then 30 min!!!"
Thank you for your service to our rights.
God bless these escorts goddam the evil protesters. They be overturned Roe but they won't be satisfied even that
These peeps protesting are wasting their precious lives trying to save some
She is a bad ass.  Thank you Shelly.
"Yes, praying for them is the biggest help they'd get from you to raise a child they can't afford to. And money & time just falls from the prayers."
I do NOT agree with 3rd trimester abortion. That's a full grown baby. A person has plenty of time to get an abortion before the 3rd trimester.
I didn't think the walk was lonely at all. There was no way I was giving life to my rapist baby who probably would've been a rapist too. I also needed to protect my son from the monster! It was 26 years ago & I never regretted it!!!
WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE!!!! IF YOU GET AN ABORTION AT 6 WEEKS ITS NOT EVEN A BABY!!! LET MEN TRYING BEING PREGNANT WITH A BABY FROM YOUR RAPIST!!!
Baby daddy’s don’t pay child support or approve insurance
"Hopefully no one trust this child murder to watch their children, because she would rather see that child in a trash can/ dumpster instead of a crib or paying games"
Shelley is a literal angel xoxo
The difference between the 11 deaths by anti abortion and the babies whom have been aborted by pro abortion is a huuuuuuggggeeeee difference..... I'm just saying  .. it's a touchy subject but pro abortions aren't any better then the ones whom have displayed any acts of violence on others..
"If only they would stand infront of orphanages, group homes, homeless shelters to help the children who are already alive."
The protestors don’t offer to adopt the unwanted children nor do they offer financial assistance for unwanted childrens welfare. They are all talk.
These anti abortion protesters sre nuts.  Im not crying crocodile tears over an direct action that happens against them.
4:15  only 11 people killed in anti-abortion acts since 1977??!?!  thats sounds 100x safer  than being a teacher in school.
"A Message to Evangelical Radicals..., ""Be Not like the Pagans who shout and pray on the streets or in the open market."" 
(NIV)"
More men telling woman what they can and can’t do American freedom I don’t think so
"""And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.  So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."""
This picketing kind of reminds me of this s*** those westboro Baptist Church bastards do.
God bless you keep the faith
If you are a man you have no responsibility of being there.
Wow they say choose life but they kill people  now isn't that an oxymoron and and hypocritical
Funny the lady in the video says she wants the choice of life but that kids are a choice if you can't have an abortion then you don't have a choice if you're pregnant and living in one of the backward states.
"The escorts are heroes to people seeking abortion. Protestors think they’re doing good work, but they’re just making a nightmare situation worse. No one goes to an abortion clinic without being in a very tough place in their life. The shouting and guilting is awful. It’s her body, her choice. End of story."
I just never knew what venue I could use get to young women living in Red states.  But Get out now.  Get to a blue state you don’t have to live in big cities but there are a ton of medium cities with job opportunities and reasonable housing.  Save your money get on a bus and get to a Blue state and start a new safe life.  Do not be controlled by a man who loves his gun more than you.
"OMG, I would probably beat these crazies with their own placards.  Notice they offer nothing for the women who are seeking abortion."
"""We're here to HELP you! Wait--what? Your baby is born? Ugh. Get lost, chump. You're on your own. I've got kids of my own to take care of."""
"I'm sure she wouldn't oppose the illegal protesting at the houses of Supreme Court Justices. That's not harassment or disturbing the peace, that's women's rights! She should record Jane's Revenge and Ruth Sent Us firebombing crisis pregnancy centers since Roe being overturned.

That being said, many pro-lifers use the wrong approach (imo) and any person who physically attacks these women or kills the doctors is a disgrace and should be locked away."
"Instead of standing and saying they're praying, why don't they donate that time to a homeless shelter, lots of young women with children! Do they really think God will be proud of them for harassing women who are making the hardest decision in their lives??? That behavior is not the God that I love."
So your anti-abortion but you're willing to assault or take people's lives? WTF! How about all of the children already here that need to be adopted or are in foster care? They're definitely is not enough people helping and providing homes for them. Why not spend your time doing something that could really make a difference in the life of children?
It’s not cool because I didn’t have insurance when I was 17 and was going to get a check up at plan parenthood and had a bottle thrown at me I wasn’t even pregnant I was just there to get a pap done so they don’t know why girls go in some of the time.
"I had an abortion almost 40 years ago and later an ectopic pregnancy that almost killed me. I have 2 grown daughters and no regrets over the 2 I lost. These protesters are fools. If it was their child who was raped or had a pregnancy complication,  they'd be getting it taken care of (most likely hiding and denying it)."
Anti abortionists should be ashamed. I don't see them stepping up and taking care of unwanted children. They are not righteous they are selfish. That guy Dan in the video I have one to say... How many children have you adopted?
You can see why they're anti abortion. They look like the ones that probably should have been aborted
"Of course CNN makes a hero out of the abortion lady and mocks the people that would like to save lives. Discusting CNN, mirder supporter"
I would LOVE to be a clunic escort. I'd be screaming at these people to get a hobby or go to work
Prayers are not going to help these women who need medical care.
God given right to be ignorant. Though it pisses me off they choose to be willfully stupid! 😮‍💨😤
I'm just puzzled at what antiabortion protesters and clinic bombers are going to do with themselves now. Will they find a way to keep living? Or is the spice of life all used up now.
These are probably the same people complaining about babies on the border getting formula.
"The hypocrisy in the US! It's revolting! ""I HaVe tHe riGHt to oWN a Gun beCause it's My FreEdom to DO What I want! But YOU don't have the right or the freedom to choose for yourself and your family. You have to give birth to that child woman, or else I'll kill you with my beloved guns because I'm sooo pro-life and goes to church every sunday like all good christians! Not MY problem that the child I force you to give birth to is raised in poverty because you are in debt after paying hospital bills because the US healthcare system are a joke to all other civilized countries. Not MY problem that your child that I forced you to give birth to ends up being shot in their classroom at 8 years old. GunS DoNt kiLL PeOple, PeoPLE do... Background checks you say! Nooo,that is treading on my freedom! My right to own a gun even if I am a raving loony toon is my freedom. Freedom to walk down the street without being afraid of being shot you say? Never heard of him... Thank f**ck that I live in a civilized country that gives a sh*t about their own people and not ONLY about money and power. Disgusting!"
I love her
I am so sick of listening to all these religious zealots force their beliefs on others.
They’re all pro life until the baby is born…
"You wanna protest? Show me how many unwanted children you have adopted personally and are raising - one for each woman you've harassed. And any number under 50 doesn't count. If YOU don't live what you force down other people's throats, you don't count."
Moral or religious protestors which have more of and which group is more aggressive? My guess is there are more moral protestors and the religious ones are more agressive. that would be my guess. I could be wrong.
She is awesome!
The abortion choice whether it be a sin or not is between the woman and their God.  NOT self righteous pieces of crap that have nothing better to do than pass judgment as if they can walk on water as Jesus did.
These religious nuts are just living in their own lonely fantasy world. I bet they don’t even get along with one another. If you talk to them they are really hard to relate to. They are so lost and looking for purpose. Just lonely crazy people. It’s kind of pathetic.
"You know what I find so funny about this video is that Liberals have a record of NON PEACEFUL protesting and have a history of causing so much damage to property and especially physically hurting people.  I'm sure on the pro-life side, there are always gonna be people who do not protest peacefully, but the side that mostly causes damage are the liberals, which carry a majority of pro-choice advocates.  Look it up.  The pro-choicers are known to protest violently.  Recently, a pro-life institution was burned down by protesters."
People need to mind their own business….”we’ll help you”😂😂😂 these people don’t give a crap about the child after it’s born
"At least they aren’t firebombing and destroying the property of family planning facilities and their mobile vans, like the pro-abortion extremists. Do a story on jane’s revenge next, cnn!"
"I believe is a women’s right to make her own decision but, waiting until your in your third trimester should not be legal."
I'd setup a big screen tv or projector that plays something really loud on loop to annoy them. Maybe a biology lecture or a heavy metal band.
Why don't these  people adopt children and care for them in their home instead of this...... more importantly...... now what do these self righteous freaks do? Are they at home looking for another cause?
"I'd say, ""okay, give me your address. As soon as I give birth, I'm leaving it on YOUR doorstep and YOU can pay for and raise it""."
What do you think will happen when these self-righteous people meet their maker and are asked: What gives to the right to interfere in someone else's life?   Didn't you trust me to handle my children?  How do you know that I didn't give them permission to have an abortion?  They all prayed and asked me what to do and I referred them to a safe medical procedure and forgave them.  WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE?????
None of these men look like they even BABYSIT. 😒
"I don't think people have a realistic picture of what happens INSIDE of abortion clinics... Please, SHOW US!"
Hold on.... let me get something straight..... so if someone murders a pregnant woman they are held accountable for 2 counts of murder because 2 LIVES were taken. One for the woman and one for the fetus REGUARDLESS of what stage if pregnancy the woman is in.... BUT..... it should be ok to go ahead and kill your own baby and not be held accountable for that life..... yep makes perfect sense. Now youre thinkin.
God gives you the right to choice.
"Baby killers justifying their existence. Looking for bombs, As if anti abortion people are the killers."
"An omelet does not kill chickens.  Abortion prevents life but doesn't take life.  If these pro-lifers want to save children why are they not protesting gun companies that kill 1300 living, thinking children every year?  Why are they not protesting car companies for the 1000 child deaths every rear?

Today, 12 million American children do not get enough to eat.  Why aren't they protesting that?   These pro-lifers do not give an ounce of effort toward the quality of life the children that are born will face.

500,000 children have their lives ruined by sexual abuse _every year._  Why not protest state administrations that have weak abuser laws?

In 100 years that one fetus if taken to term will average 32 additional people on the planet.  What about population management?  Do pro-lifers think about how to feed all these new people?  3 billion world population in 1960.  8 billion world population 2022.  The population will grow an average of one billion people every decade.

Pro life isn't about life.  It's about the noise.  It's about morality.  It's about religion.  It's about putting their noses in where it doesn't affect them.  It's meddling.

They are pro-birthers.  Those lives that are lived doesn't matter to them."
Thank the clinic protectors. Those Women are just getting health care.
Revelation 2:18-26
"Anti abortion means anti science , anti democracy , they go hand in hand with that group of goons. Why wait go meet your maker in a history museum . Australopithecus.  Oh , wait the goons think the planet is only 6000 years old  and some guy gave e rib to make a woman. Brain dead people are very dangerous."
"Crimninal murders are ""Pro-life""... how ironic these Republican PEASANTS are?"
Hold on you murder people who have families and friends and responsibilities but want to stop abortion to protect fetus !!!!!! Why some the can grow up have a family have friends then you can murder them?
Oh I want to do this... but the restraint it would take not to choke out these nutcases!
Omg I can’t stand Christians. Always a pain
They don't show up with their checkbooks to support children.. they rail about welfare..
Our society has become so sick…that the elderly man who is trying to protect the life of an unborn child is looked at as the monster and is confronted by grown women trying to protect the women who is about to walk into an office to kill her child. Like WTFFFF
All this energy could be spent helping kids that are already in the system instead .  How about their lives?
The people that call themselves religious are the first ones to criticize single mothers and block them from any help or resources.
"This is really yet another crazy, uniquely American thing ....
Mass shootings, school shootings, anti-abortionists who call themselves ""pro-lifers"" .... until the unwanted child is born."
Thank goodness for her. She's an angel. The protesters can go to hell
"Abortion clinics should be eliminated and all reproductive healthcare done at the hospital, that way nobody outside would know where the people going in are going.....  No more protesters...Ridiculous that someone had enough time to waste to sit there outside of a clinic and not mind their own business.   If you don't believe in abortion, don't have one,  what give's you the right to know what's best for someone else?"
50 bucks for assault? Welcome to Saudi America.
You have the choice to close your legs or use protection… any one who abort is evil
Imagine your life is so pathetic you stand in front of an abortion clinic holding a sign all day.
I love how we have people  running  around killing  kids and random people  with guns but yall got energy for this. Like what wheres the gun control? U would  rather save this life so they can be killed  later in a classroom/or anywhere  else they are not safe i would  rather not have a child  suffer  that at all. And god forbid its a girl because  it looks like we are going  to be living  like the hand maids tale soon in this bitch. Also lets not not forget the fact we are killing  our earth. They wont have a place to live anyway. And with the cost of living  shit rising damn i can go on forever 😒
Shocking how it’s mostly men w their ranting. Such a joke. Ok so she keeps it & than those men can pay for that child for 18 years!
"America, isnt it time to not have dedicated abortion clinics which are just begging to be targeted? Have abortions in regular clinics and hospitals (like in my country), so the woman gets anonymity!!"
"This lady's attitude is so bizarre...but you know, she may be another Abby Johnson in the making."
They supposedly value life and then murder people ... the hypocrisy just astounds me ... maybe anti religion protestors should counter demo 🙄🙄🙄 (there are many arguments against organised religions ... wish i could do it damn my 'original sin!!!')
"Just mind your own business. Is your life so perfect that you really have the time to involve yourself towards a PERFECT stranger for living theirs how they see fit?  My belief is simple. Do you! I will do me as I see fit. That goes for religion, abortion, your sexuality, for everything that does not DIRECTLY effect others. You don't believe in abortion, don't have one and don't push your agenda on others! ."
"The amount of hate American have for each other, is sad to see. I hope one day, you forgive each other and live peacefully. 💙💙💙❤️"
"People are sick, in their minds thinking they have the right to dictate to people through their ""god"" ."
"Miss ""Withheld Name "" I want U tell children that have been raped that got pregnant to keep the baby because it´s a beautiful gift of life .. tell them that !! ... Tell that to the girl in Indiana who was 10 and denied ..

Let women or young girl have their right to choose what it is best for them !!"
It would not make much sense to plant a bomb. If they want to save life’s!?
This is the woman's choice.  Leave them alone.
"Quick question, all these 'pro life' protesters that murder doctors, sick women, and occasionally healthy women seeking non-abortion-related prenatal care like cheap vitamins, how many of them have been killed? How many sign-waiving pedophiles and terrorists have been gunned down by heroes defending women?

None. Huh. That seems.... strange to me."
"Every single one of those protesters should be arrested. Each and every one is a rapist and a pedophile, and should be locked away from civilized society."
"Jesus wept.. every time they use knitting needles.. and the US is exporting this trash policy.. I'm not happier with my mum's illegal abortion in hospital, not on the corner shop lady's place. than anything. I'm Norwegian. there's no way someone can convince me my mother made a bad decision, regarding her abilities to carry out a pregnancy. .. what we have now, .. information, free access and freedom WITH responsibility.. is so valuable. .. no child should be born unwanted. Or families experience the tragedies that follow unwanted... what solves this is.. short decision times and long preparation periods."
The supreme court should now hang their heads in shame.
"It seems to me that these protestors are engaging in intimidation and it should be stamped on. They are ignorant self rightious bullies, they should be moved on, in fact banned from doing what they do."
People should stand outside regular protesters homes on public property and yell things at them non stop.
^  ^ I can tell you what it is...... psychosis in American society and religous fundamentalism Now its happening in Scotland {Alba} UK. We Scottish people will not tolerate it ! Foxy Pagan love fae Scotland VVxx
If you're pro life then just don't get an abortion.
America is soooo f*cked holy sh*t 🙈
Equal protection under the law and a right to privacy ought to be the legal basis of reproductive rights.  Instead we have a bunch of nuts on the street and idiots on the supreme court telling women what they can and cannot do.
"I am glad that The Pro-Life Movement has protested against that clinic in Nebraska, and everywhere else in this nation. Thank The Lord that The Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade. Thank The Lord that the institution of abortion is now illegal. The next tasks that The States must do now is to: 1) Make all abortion illegal and punishable as a the horrendous crime that it is. 2) Finally, make abortion pills illegal as well and aggressively pursue all people who dare sell those horrendous, horrible pills."
Abortion is healthcare. Telling people someone got an abortion is against The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
"Thank you. We need more people like you, who are willing to help people, who NEED the help."
It's ironic that Dan worships the most evil character in fiction.  Poor delusional Dan will never be able to ask God why he had 2 she-bears savagely kill 42 children.
"I am SO sick and tired of the religious sects coming and trying to push their religious mumbo jumbo agenda on everyone else. If it’s their choice to be anti abortion- cool! That’s your choice as that’s a deeply personal choice to make. I cannot believed this choice was taken away for all women. I don’t believe in God and just because these people do, doesn’t give them a right to vote away EVERY womens choice. But they did. Now here we are. Another big WTF America. I seriously struggle with my daughters future here now with what little rights she has with her own body and the safety of this country. Truly disturbing and sad"
Anti-abortion protesters are just bad people. They’re completely full of themselves.
This is good propaganda.
She's a hero and so is that Dr.
She's a hero and so is that Dr.
"If you are anti-abortion, don’t doit, it’s your right. However, don’t tell other women what we can or can’t do. Mind your own business and back off!"
"What really pisses me off about anti-abortionists is their hypocrisy. They say that the babies should be born, but once they are they don't give a damn anymore."
"Democrats have not been this angry since we took away their slaves. Those who worked to abolish slavery were called fanatics and told to keep their religious and moral beliefs to themselves. Shelley is no better than a slave auctioneer. 

God bless Larry and every person who spends their life trying to protect babies. 

Also there are 36 families waiting to adopt for each baby that is put up for adoption. So stop with your lies about how people who are pro-life don’t care once the baby is born. We care. We adopt, we donate money, supplies and time. 

If you are pregnant and know you can’t parent reach out to a pregnancy center. They will give you free medical care. They will help you realize options so that you and your baby can have the best life possible. ♥️"
"I'd say ""so what? Freedom of speech."" if they were just standing outside with signs, but harassing everyone who goes in is just a crappy thing to do. Plus, how do they know they're not badgering someone who has to terminate because they won't survive the pregnancy? I saw a video of some protesters who did that to a woman who was heartbroken about having to abort. Her husband ripped into them, and rightfully so."
"I would love to see the reaction for all those people protesting when their daughters tell them that they got pregnant by minority man !!! 
Those same people protesting will be the first ones to fly their daughters across state lines and get an abortion"
"These people are so hypocritical they are making death threats  to harm a living person 
Self-righteous people are the worse !!!!"
Man Americans are creepy and so effed up
Sheroe 🦸‍♀️
"As this report states…11 people have been killed in anti abortion attacks since 1977.   That is 11 people too many.  However, how do all the supporters of this video support the over 800,000 U.S abortions that occur Every. Single. Year?"
I don't understand why the pictures of the aborted upset people. If you believe in abortion why do the pics bother you?
"Life is a gift from God. (Genesis 9:6; Psalms 36:9) He considers all life to be precious, including the life of a child in the womb. So if someone intentionally kills an unborn child, that amounts to murder."
"""when I meet my maker""
If he and the book you read is real it looks like he will turn you away from heaven and send you to hell for your sins of judging others. According to your specific religious beliefs, you, not everyone you run across, but just you are not to sin. It's not your job to judge everyone based on their decisions, nor is it your job to tell them what decision they should be making. That said, I don't think your religion is reality nor is god, but if you feel the need to save kids so much, spend more time in church with signs that tell your priests to stop molesting the kids. A clump of cells can't feel pain, nor does it have a brain at the first trimester to register pain, that clump of cells will never know it was eventually going to be human, nor will it feel pain. On the other situation I spoke of, those kids do feel pain from what is being done to them as well as the psychological damage being done. That ruins the child's whole life. So ask your God if he exists when you get to the pearly Gates why he helped some people with cancer(because you know it couldn't have been the medicine, doctors, or your body doing it, it had to be god) but he never stopped kids from being molested in his house? That means either he doesn't exist and that's why he can't help them, he agrees with it and is fine with pedophilia, or as most Christians think, it's all part of his ""plan"". So it's either a waste of time being religious and praying because he doesn't exist, or he is ok with pedophilia in which case he isn't worthy of worship at all. Either way, I'll never waste my time on this disgusting religion that has stupid people who don't know their history thinking we were founded on Christian principles (we weren't and most of the founders thought Christianity was disgusting, were atheists, agnostic, or deists.) Rant over."
MIND YOUR BUSINESS! GO TO A HOMELESS SHELTER AND USE YOUR ENERGY THERE OR FOSTER AND ADOPT. JUST LEAVE WOMEN ALONE.
aye that’s down the street I didn’t know that
"Where do I sign up!!! These ladies rock! I remember the taunts and yelling when I went to an abortion clinic in my early 20’s. Having an abortion was the last thing I wanted, but having no money or family or support left me alone and scared. I didn’t want to be another single mother who then needed to turn to public welfare. I was young and alone and the father sent 1/2 the abortion money from 15 states away and went on his business. It’s not that easy for us. I wish men understood that, the pain of an abortion and the pain afterwords not just physically but mentally. I still feel badly for having to make that choice but I’m not upset that there wasn’t more support. Instead of trying to take woman’s rights away why not make it easier and more supportive as a country to welcome children in. Stop punishing woman in the work place just bc ur worried they may get pregnant! Make health care and child care more affordable! Hold men accountable! How is it fair that men are the ones that get us pregnant but they can ghost u and their responsibilities until what??? We track them down and force a dna test at our own cost while raising their bastards without help. No wonder the birth rate is at an all time low! Men are crazy out here murdering their kids and wives. Smh. Woman need to start building ALL WOMAN COMMUNITIES (vaginas allowed/males under 14) This world is only going to get more dangerous for woman BC OF MEN."
"My 6'7"" stepdad is a clinic escort. He's not had too many problems so far. I'm really proud of him 💜"
"To whom does he ""have a responsibility"" to be there?
Does he feel guilty about forcing a young gf to have an abortion?"
Creepy old men 😢
"These overly religious people doing everything ""in the name of god"" are pathetic."
"Classic, a man telling me a women what to do with her body 😒"
Interesting that those who are pro-life don't mind KILLING YOU if you don't agree with them.  Hm.
"So the old guy claiming he hopes God has a lot of mercy on him because he’s doing this… He pretty much just admitted that he’s harassing these people because he wants services from the Lord. If you really believe in a cause, you do it because you believe in it and not because you want good favors from up above. He’s pretty much harassing these women because he has nothing better to do with his life. 🤡🥴"
It's cold...squirt them with a hose then turn on a large fan.
"Black Lives Matter sign at abortion clinic. Well til your 4 years old and can’t go to preschool cuz ya’ll cut the programs, or they need food. Just shut it."
THANK YOU . IN 2018 I WENT ALONE AND PROTESTERS REALLY REALLY WERE IN MY FACE AND NO ONE WAS OUT THERE TO HELP
"I was born to a very poor family that was unmarried, dad was on drugs, mother was a very young single mother. I wasn't planned for, born prematurely & we lived in substandard housing.  Some might have said I wouldn't have stood a chance and that my mother was irresponsible to put a child through such circumstances but my mother chose not to abort me. As an adult, I love life! I for one am greatful to be living & not to have been torn apart & dismembered in my mother's womb. There are too many other choices than to kill a child. Abortion is infanticide."
Those anti-abortionists are truly vile and wicked people!
Blow leaves in someone’s face you get what you earned b****
It’s funny how the “heroes” that CNN was trying to push came off as worst then the guys saying they care about the women and children
men telling women what to do.  that's the gop cult
"The left can dish it but they can’t take it.
These are the most benign prostesters.
The rainbows are funny you can’t get pregnant during homosexual sex"
"“Abortion is wrong so we’re gonna take it away and cause multiple people to die bc of it, I’m pro-life🤪✌️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸“"
GOD BLESS THIS LADY
"""We will help you,"" yeah until they are born. I adopted from DCFS and seen how bad it already was, cannot imagine how the foster care system will collapse after this. The escorts and doctors are amazing."
Professional Protesters….many they should direct their attention to the foster system.
Im not anti abortion but 3rd trimester??? Thats murder. I had an abortion at 22 years 4 weeks along. I would never have one when i can feel my baby move. I now have a daughter.
"I think we should throw used tampons at anti-choiceers in case we spontaneously abort. They can raise them as ""children"" since that's what they believe clumps of cells are."
Old Men have no place in pushing their views on young women who are generations younger than them.   Enough!
"I have a feeling all these people who waste their time most days begging women to not get abortions, are on government assistance. Regular people can't afford to stand around all day for a cause that does not even concern them or affect them."
Sneaky but their actors paid for fake news
Notice how most of the protesters are men? Creepy bastards. I was so grateful for my escort. These protesters can be very intimidating and in your face.
They hang around clinics to so called save a life just to take a life. Make it make sense.
"No one is asking these people for help or their opinion.  For those men, when you have the ability to carry and birth a child then you can have your opinion.   Girls and women who get pregnant from rape should have a choice!!!!  These freezing evangelical are nuts!!!"
"funny how they are not protesting outside IVF clinics.  if life ""begins at conception"", then why are they not protesting the disposal of extra unneeded embryos left over after IVF treatments are done. 
The fact that they don't, demonstrates how it's NOT about the ""unborn"".. it's about the control of women and slut-shaming them..."
"I actually feel sorry for these religiously brainwashed people. They have been culturally conditioned for all of their lives to believe in something that doesn’t exist. They honestly think they are doing a good thing, all the while hurting so many around them. I know about this because I used to be a fervent Catholic, and now I feel ashamed at the ridiculous things I thought were reality."
"And they say they’re pro-life !! 11 murders !! Jeez the hypocrisy is sickening!  Well done to this woman, she’s an angel for these women .."
Hypocrite Christian Fascists.
Why would she literally broadcast how to end appointments for a day?
People need a damn life!!!
I honestly didn't know about the escorts before I found her on TikTok. I love what she does and her videos.
women should have the right to choose. I wonder how many persons who are against a woman's right have adopted or assumed the responsibility for unwanted children?
Ya gotta love when other people tell you how to live
"Dan (from video), how many foster kids have you taken in or adopted? Or do their lives stop mattering post womb? How much have  you donated to planned parenthood to help young women get birth control or is that bad in your eyes too? Can I be a fly on the wall when you meet your maker?"
These abortion people how come each one don't go and adopt five children children that need homes thank you very much
I think Dan is hoping his maker will look past his lifetime of earthly sins if he harasses enough woman and children. 🙄
Lol certainly a problem She or her or wtf ever will not need to deal with anytime soon. Unless of course she's at border bar with unlimited tequila shots. And a morning after chew your arm off coyote on stand by. Imo
My Body My Choice?  The Baby has no say because you are selfish and only thinking of You!  And You are willing to Commit Murder. I'm sure that Baby would love to enter this World.  Stop being a bunch of Sluts.
"I wonder how many of these “pro-life” folks have actually adopted children, or at least have foster kids."
Let me get this straight- they want these women to have children but if said child grows up and is anywhere on the LGBTQIA+ spectrum all of a sudden they're an abomination and should have never been born? Sounds to me like they don't actually know what God wants or how it works (I'm a Hindu and we dont believe that Brahman (God) is a man or woman but rather encompasses both energies (masculine & feminine) and not these human biologic labels).
Walk up to each one of them asking for money to feed said child… that’ll get em to shut up 🤐
What help are they offering? Where are these people when the moms didn’t have an abortion and they can’t afford to feed their kids? Are any of these people foster parents or adoptive parents?
She's obnoxious and self-righteous.
I think education needs for some American.
"Let's be charitable to the anti abortionists. You have to realize it takes at least 5 generations of inbreeding to get to be this dense' , stupid and incapable of logical thought. Most anti abortionists have gone thru the 5th grade but because they are the product of brothers having sex with their mothers,sisters and other female relatives. They also cannot stand up to the world so they usually like to b molest children. As in anti abortionist men who want sex with their own daughters and expose themselves to children. Let's pray for them"
"The idea that women just change their minds and decide to abort so close to giving birth to a fully developed healthy baby is simply an anti-choice myth used to anger people. 2nd-3rd trimester abortions only happen when something is terribly wrong. I have a friend who was unable to find a doctor to terminate her pregnancy after the 20 week mark. She gave birth to a baby that didn't have the top of its skull. She started to show signs of mental illness after the anatomy scan and it became progressively worse with time. By the time she gave birth to the baby and watched it pass away in her arms with its brain showing, she was never the same person again. She became distant from her other children then turned to drugs. Long story short, she is in recovery now and clean. Still traumatized though."
I have os o describe her display of self righteousness.  Like getting hit in the gut.
Boomers🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sad. These people dont help. They just feel better about themselves judging others. Once the child is born they do nothing but say get a job take care of your child when they have no idea how the baby came to be...despicable people...its only their right to choose not to wear a mask...deplorables...
Good for you lady
These men are doing great work! I’m thankful they are standing up for life. Just a matter of time until Abortion is banned nation wide! The Pro-Life Generation will NOT be silent!
Nobody is helping me with my children.
I just hope the protesters are for childcare and other programs that are set in place to help mothers and children.
Not all hero's wear capes but she deserves one!
“We’re so pro life we’ll kill you”
The same anti-abortion protesters who wouldn’t hesitate to unalive an actual child in an exorcism and blame the devil for it.
"""Absolutely not, nobody asked you."" 🤣 She is so respectful and calm."
"To all those self sanctimonious twats who think they have a right to someone else’s decisions on their body… the frelling foetus is a parasite! It’s not a human being! If you really want to do something wonderful, go an be a mom or dad to a child that was forced to be born into poverty! Stop eating meat, and killing insects when they bother you! Get your own frelling house in order first. And then, just maybe then… if you think you are holier than thou, may you possibly be in a position to dictate to a woman on her rights to her choice. I want to remind you that this insane comment about women using abortion like contraception is NOT the norm… women have abortions because they were RAPED, or they are not financially in a position to look after a child. You might even say ”she should have kept her legs crossed then”…. Well how about the men keeping their dicks in their pants??? There are also situations where the FOETUS dies in the womb. Do you really expect the mother to carry this to term and give birth naturally??? Seriously? So again… to all those stupid ignorant people standing outside these clinics spouting crap about pro-life… YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ANY OF THOSE WOMEN!!!! So stop judging!!!"
"I'm pro-choice but I don't care for Shelly's actions here, as they do increase the likelihood of altercations. This is selfish of her, making her political points when she's supposed to be there for the patients, who don't need to see or hear about confrontations at the clinic."
"Just ask them how many kidneys they have.

Either you have sovereign ownership of your organs or you don't. Their opinion must be that you don't and they can save a person's life by donating a kidney. The operation is very low risk and actually comparable with the risk from pregnancy.

Maybe they think women's uterus is uniquely not owned by its owner?"
These people belong on Fox opinions network.
"American “evangelicals” seem to be bent on proving that they are the complete antithesis of what Christ commands us to be. No one in my church or family behaves like they do, and we love the Lord and try to share His love, mercy, and grace with others. Also, not our job to judge. We are all sinners (in my faith that is our belief…that everyone is equal). On the other hand, they (AEs) completely foil the work the rest of us out here in the world are trying to do, and they chase people away from the message of Christ. It is so infuriating. If they want to do something positive, stop voting for a party that refuses to support vulnerable citizens, and especially single mothers, with a robust social safety net…healthcare, food, shelter, education, child care, fully-paid generous parental leave, mental health care… . But they refuse to support the babies that they think they’re saving. It’s not saved if it lives in poverty and has no healthcare. Such narrow minded selfishness."
"Jeeeeze, theses people are weird..nuts.. ..they should be off the streets.."
"Am I the only one who sees the irony of ’pro-lifers’ killing and injuring people? If they were really pro-life they would adopt unwanted kids, and give money to families in poverty… but no… killing doctors and nurses and harassing women is all they can think of doing. Sad, pathetic, digusting humans!!!"
"Here's a reality check: 
#1 NONE OF US ASKED TO BE HERE!! To assume you did, thats not tethered to reality.
#2 It's A LOT of moms who will take to their graves how if they had a chance to do it again, a lot of y'all wouldn't be here. It's mother's praying for the strength to deal with the circumstances as they have unfolded outside of her initial intentions.
#3 Ppl aren't gonna stop their sexual activity or fulfilling their desires. Trust if a woman don't wanna have a baby.... She AINT gonna have it, laws or not... Period 🤷🏾‍♀️"
"Completely respect their point of view… 

That being said….those same protestors are welcome to spend their resources on raising all those  unwanted “beautiful gifts”"
Bunch of old men with NOTHING productive to do trying to control young women. That's rich. And the self-righteous pro-lifers murdering abortion doctors? That's even richer. I guess these people are not really religious after all.  They are just self-righteous sinners.
How can women be okay with forcing a 10-year-old to have a baby cuz that's what's happening right now because of the stupid anti-rovy weight stuff we're forcing little babies to have babies like it sounds like some type of weirdo pedophile b******* to me
Shelley is great! I’ve been following her for a long time. Her work is important. I worked at a clinic when I was 18/19. The things I saw changed me forever. We have to keep this legal and safe for anyone who needs this medical care. Please! And the lengths protesters will go to is gross. They have no souls.
I just love men who think they have a right to speak on a subject that has nothing to do with them smfh MEN PLEASE STFU
Its gods will that they abort those cells
How can you support them? Go fund me or anything?
YOU GO GIRL! Fighting the good fight! #mybodymychoice
😂😂😂😂😂😂
There is goes their motivation. They want to be save by their god when they die. Due to their own sin(s) . The only for them yo get rid of their guilt is by judging others.
I want to know how many unwanted children these protestors have supported.
"I wish there was an in-between. I hate the idea of abortion but ultimately it is a woman's choice, and I don't think anyone has a right to choose for her."
"So the anti-abortion folks are there to fight for life, even though they possibly could be placing bombs in places where it explodes and take lives. Curious, just curious."
Ask Dan what he thinks about kids getting shot in schools and people being shot anywhere and everywhere
"If you don't care after, you never cared before🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨"
"Let’s be honest, by the looks of her she will never need an abortion"
"🤦
People are dumb."
But they’re ok with everybody and their mom buying an AR15.
"This is a form of eugenics. For the first time in the entire history of the human race, even of all life, Women can now choose with whom and when to have their baby. Women did not have to be forced to accept their fate. It was up to them whether or not to start, continue, or cancel the process of childbearing. So they can stop that process, rather than have to endure an undesired pregnancy. This was a decision that never existed until recently in our evolutionarily timeline. Now, we are one again set back by primitive thinking, forced unnecessary to accept one's fate, rather than having control of their own lives.
Religious lunatics thump their Bibles and cannot come to terms with how technology has changed our world."
Anti abortion zombies are the worst of the worst. When they turn up in hell they’ll be totally surprised that their shallow selfishness wasn’t taken as holy.
"People need to stop. Abortion is wrong if it's not a cause of rape. To abort a child just cus you wanted to have sex is just wrong and if it inconvenience you then so be it. There are a lot of f up mom's...for real. Some people would love to adopt a baby or two, but you have itches that wanna abort innocent lives. I don't feel sorry for any adults murdered , a life for lives. Yeah...sorry I don't care. If it's not because of rape or health issues, then no. I don't care cus there's birth control etc., These are grown responsible women upset cus they can't abort a baby and go back to whoring or whatever...no that's just wrong."
Why don’t they spend their time screaming at men not to impregnate people?
Register to vote to stop the GOP from making this country worse and shape it in their Handmaiden’s Tail like draconian society where white old men dictate how we should live.
"""Is that enough? Have u had enough  of feeling righteous today?"" _I ❤LOVE❤ her!_ She somehow says it w/o sounding confrontational or condescending. It was n a lovey, jokey way like when u tease ur fam!🤗✌♥️🌎"
"I am absolutely astonished that millions of women aren’t protesting constantly. The courts have made all women second class citizens, whether you agree with abortion or not, as a man , I would never be silent if the government took control of my rights! . It’s a national problem when fewer numbers of women, blacks, latinos turn out to vote than middle aged white men! Before this comment makes you angry, check out voting statistics nationwide!"
This clinic saved one of my friend's lives after her assault. Thank you so much to this woman and every single volunteer who protects those who are seeking healthcare.
"If a man beats a woman to the point where she loses her unborn baby , that man is charged with murder. If a woman kills her unborn baby by having an abortion it’s not called murder."
"How hypocritical, not to mention insane, is it to call yourself Pro-Life and then murder people?  And they keep invoking God but God says that ONLY HE can judge us so they are actually the sinners themselves!  Another woman’s difficult choice is none of their damn business!"
"Somebody should go up to them and say fine you can help give me half a million dollars to pay for the ruin of my life. Raise the baby for me. Pay off my student loans. If you're not going to actually help, stop lying and gtfo"
Exploiting the vulnerable
In the 80s I picketted a clinic with fetal info from the American Medical Association to give to clients-escorts lied and said the pamphlets were false!!! Lying murderers!
Speaking of life . . . these protestors need to GET one . . . WAY too much time on their hands!!!!
"She’s a national treasure.
We need more of her."
These people protesting are judging others which is something their God tells them not to do. They should keep their noses out of other people's personal issues. Thank you Shelly for doing what you're doing. #MyBodyNotYours
"These so called. Pro choice , are the same ones who oppose to death penalty . Hypocrites POS. Want to kill a innocent baby but want to save a scumbag from death… what you expect from CNN liars"
Sanctimonious bunch.  SMH.
Trash
Selling babies to wealthy families has always been a pro life agency cash cow. SAW THIS FIRST HAND
"None of these anti-abortion protestors appear to be very bright; have you noticed that?
This seems to be the only way they can feel powerful about themselves.
By making young girls miserable."
"3:58 they call themselves ""pro-life"""
"As a man I'd like to ask all 3,5 billion of us to just shut up and let women decide about their bodies."
"Would they pay for a child or even take the child(adopt)??? I mean how can people and politicans be sooo behind...I'm really sorry for you..and hope that there would be a other option that opens...but i think first they need to see what that does..and that, will be cruel."
It's the longest walk from the car to the clinic because it's the walk of shame.😔🙏
They're the creepiest group of geriatrics I've ever seen in my life.. I'd be soo ashamed to count myself as one of these anti-abortion ay-holes.
Abortion of turtles are punishable by jail time or a fine up to 100k. Let that sink in.
"""After fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being...[this] is no longer a matter of taste or opinion, it is not a metaphysical contention, it is plain experimental evidence...."" - Dr Jerome LeJeune, Professor of Genetics at the University of Descartes, Paris, discoverer of the chromosome pattern of Down's Syndrome, and Nobel Prize Winner"
A bunch of religious nut case who has too much time on their hand ✋
I don't have a problem with people wanting to protest abortion. It the way some of them do it. Protest the practice not the patients. The Protesting in front of a medical facility should be illegal. Don't force yourself on people who want nothing to do with you.
"These same people were willing to kill grandma in 2020 so they could eat at Applebee's.  
They don't care about living people."
So much love from these protectors of life.
"Protesters impede citizens and they don't work?
Parasites!"
"Those anti-abortion crazies are just going to get more violent in states where abortions are still legal now that Roe was overturned by the lying Christo fascists on the Supreme Court. It’s terrible what women who need this procedure will go through, and like the Dr. said, many will die."
"They're just upset, there's not enough kids in the world to religiously abuse."
Dan I hope you've earned points to really meet your maker
Those religous fanaticss should move to Afghanistan....
Old men TAKE AWAY VIAGRA…
"Religious people are the ball and chain of progress and civil society. They are dangerous, vicious, and violent."
"Go to college,  read the Bible , get some sense... They refused. Now America is gonna continue to pay for the prolificacy of ignorance and laziness, for allowing a career conman become president, for voting for a party that continues to mislead and brainwash folks who continue to vote out of fear and hate rather than open their eyes and ears to the carnage of gun violence and physical and mental health importance of Abortion. 

Until the PEOPLE of America wake up and understand that the pretense of morality that's become the ideologies of the GOP and their faithfuls recognize that they been in decades long running con by elected officials who care more about power and money over their voters safety, the country is on it path of internal implosion. Republican senators, reps and supreme court justices have money and  access to security and abortion if they so need it. The rest of y'all can continue to perish ok the altar of their fraudulent ambitions"
Religion is a factor of the ignorance being celebrated as a virtue in the US
They need security at clinics
Thank you for this important coverage of women helping women
I used to work for  abortion clinic and the word abortion is the complete wrong word. From what I have seen the correct word should be dismembering or killing.
"""Pro-lifer"" killing people, that's just rich man. This stuff is so Hypocritical you couldn't make it up if you tried .."
"I truly want to go there just to distract the people protesting... lol 
Like pretend like I'm debating on the abortion so the real people they are victimizing can get in with out being harassed."
"For the abortion doctor that performs third trimester abortions, I swear if I get my medical license I will take on any position of yours necessary"
"Ryan State is currently passing laws to sue any medical worker, lawmaker, judge or executive official who put bans on any point in the abortion process"
"OK, prolifers are injuring people with guns. So I guess they just don’t give a shit about life or death after The fetus is delivered"
"First of all God‘s not real, Second don’t be an aimless douche and deny people quality healthcare, third it’s not a child it’s a zygote that’s not even a human yet, forth it is not wrong for women to make decisions about their body’s"
I really really really really really would LOVE for a woman to go for an abortion and to tell them aaaaalll the reasons why they are getting an abortion and calling them out for their bullshit
Maybe we should be able to make certain spots free drive-bys to get rid of the trash just a joke
"Are they gonna pay the medical bills? Will they care for and feed that child? Educate them? 
If not, stfu"
Like the women having an abortion haven't already had a hard time coming to that decision.
"60 million babies unborn have been killed since 1973.  Now it's your turn, the consequences of this sin are the shootings that are held weekly against civilians in schools, colleges, shops, discos, etc.  Let's count how many are killed."
I want to ask these pro-lifers if they actually think about the child after it's born because if the answer is no then you don't have a fucking right to sit there and say well we care about these children.
Send this video to all the right wingers you know.
That guy is right about people breaking the law and having abortions. Then people will not follow a law that says guns are ilegal.
"20% of my generation was aborted. If America were a family with 4 kids, mommy and daddy government would have to explain to the other 4 why they said their brother or sister couldn’t live."
If you can't speak for yourself. Democrats will kill you.
"When the guy named “Dan” stated he thinks the children are being violated and being murdered. By definition they’re not a child. They’re not born. They’re unborn. 

Do you think anyone of these women are doing abortions like they go to Starbucks? WTF. Be better!!"
She’s a hero for those women. Keep it up!!
My gf and i make 120k collectively i would love to have a kid but we cant afford the life a kid deserves in Seattle. Why should a forced birth be a thing if it would make 3 lives worse?
"Makes me wonder how many things haven’t been accomplished, how many  children are without a friend who could have been the perfect one for them! ALL LIVES MATTER!! And yes, I’m ALL FOR GUN CONTROL because human life, from
beginning to end…MATTERS!!!"
"""We'll help you. We'll help you right now.""  I don't believe it.  I wonder what they would actually do if someone actually said ""Yes, please help me.""  I bet not a lot other than useless words."
"11 anti-abortion murders in the US. 
50 million abortions since 1973 in the US. 

I like how people talk about anti-abortion violence like it happens often."
Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
Keep religion to yourself. 🙄🙄🙄
"It's not pro life, it's pro birth then it's all about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps when you don't have any bootstraps, forced birth is basically forced poverty."
"They're not pro-life, they're anti-woman. They couldn't care less about the baby once it's born."
"Want to see insane, unreasoning fanaticism?  Just look at any one of these delusional, anti-choice zealots."
I wonder how many of these well-meaning people are willing to take care of these children they’re forcing people they don’t know or care about to carry to term.
Alot of men are gonna hate child support
"ANY one that kills to stop abortion is exactly what they preach against! They only care about these fetuses until they are born then they could care less what happens to them! Get shot at school, starve, get abused, get sick, get rapped, get into drugs or alcohol,  etc. They don't care as long as they get born to suffer!"
I wish they could put their passion for life towards the living already here. They don’t give a damn about those babies once they’re born. And they look down upon the mothers. These people need to mind their own business or really help children that are already born.
"anyone who thinks abortion is a right should be eligible for euthanasia at the whim of anyone else, it's the same thing. You can end a baby on a whim, we can end you on a whim."
The good Lord is gonna call you a jagoff
"Germany has a liberal abortion law but also one of the lowest rates in Europe? Why? When it is legal you can get accurate statistics on age, economics etc, then you take action. Free contraception, free childcare, increase welfare, housing. These are proven to reduce abortion. Bans drive them underground so hypocrites can ignore women taking pills and traveling and pretend it's not happening. They never take the actions proven to reduce abortion do they?"
Get ready for hell Shelly. Because it's coming to you
These decisions of having a child has nothing to do with these people.
Too bad these people don't do some real good by volunteering at a shelter. I wonder how many of them have adopted kids or fostered them. I'd guess none.
All these people she is talking to are Tent Christians bottom feeders they suck the life out of communities for money and power!!! Patriots for a better America 🇺🇸
Thank you!
This woman is a hero to every pregnant woman who is a victim of DV or attempted murder. What people fail to realize is that the number one cause of death of pregnant women is murder.
"I like how she talks to them like they're poorly behaved dogs. ""Hey, hey, no. No. Noohhhh. OK? Stop."""
and they're like all men lol
SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS- that’s all that is. Shame on those people. Shame on those people for shaming women. Shame shame shame
The protesters have a right to freedom of speech and the clinic escort has a right to their freedom of speech
"Best feel guilty for interfering in the Lives of Unbelievers. Bible says not to do it. So, doing it is going against Gods word. Only people you need to be tellen not to have an abortion are the people in your church. And as for the unborn.    Ecclesiastes 4:2-3 So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living. But better off than both of them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun."
"Wonder how Dan treat people of color? Are you an all around good person. God doesn’t look at one good action. If your granddaughter was raped by a beast, you’d want her to carry it, deliver it? Would you look at that child lovingly?"
2:12 He has NOT been in this movement 'since 73' lmao. Bc 'Pro-life' was NOT a 'movement' in 73. Lying clown 🤡
"Really is a shame when people fight so hard to kill babies smh.
Instead of telling people that are pro life to find ways to help children in foster care, how about learning to abstain from sex if you don't want a baby? That would also prevent more unwanted kids from going into foster care."
"I use to be ""Pro-Choice"" UNTIL I watched a 5-minute video on YouTube.  It's of an Abortion Doctor testifying in-front of Congress describing (in horrific detail) the entire abortion ""process.""  He's performed thousands of them.  That video completely changed my way of thinking!  I'm now ""Pro-Life"" and so is he!!"
The anti-choice protestors are the scum of the earth and you can't change my mind.
Pooor   people
both sides are lunatics. look at yourselves in a video.
For them to actually think that yelling at these poor women will change ANYTHING is extremely misguided.
I would so lose my shit when somebody like this would approach me .
"Instead of wasting your time protesting, adopt an orphan and make a difference."
"Anti-Choice thinkers are hell bent on controlling others as an escape from their own lives. The false rush of ""heroism"" they feel ""defending"" a cluster of cells is much easier and much, much, much less risk and sacrifice than *actually* helping actual children."
Communist media!
"It’s sad these self righteous anti women’s body choice will heckle and preach to preserving life while not help those thousands of children in foster care. Yes, all
life needs to be protected and cared for not just heckle people into their political ideology."
They are paid to be there. Sick.
"It's really dangerous, proceeds to show video from 1993"
"It's simple. If you believe abortion is wrong, don't get an abortion.
If you believe women should be forced to birth babies, then you should be more than willing to pay MORE in taxes, so the money you pay goes into social well-fare programs that help raise unwanted babies. Prayer doesn't pay the bills or feed children."
Self-righteousness is something else....
If there's any pro-lifers out there just know that part of being pro-life means caring for the fetus and the pregnant woman. Even if their decision is against your morality you're supposed to be respectful to every human being. Pro-life for all humans not just the unborn.
These doctors who perform late term abortions will be judged! We will all be judged!
Why don't they spend their time helping those who choose to keep the baby? Because a born baby is not worth their care anymore? Damm Hypocrites!
"Escort work. That is something I can do. It didn't occur to me. I'm large, scary looking and trained in multiple martial arts. I've learned how to project my voice to terrifying volumes. I can easily out yell a loudspeaker. I am going tomorrow after work and find somewhere to help."
Democrats live killing babies.
Shining the light of the truth on the cockroaches on the right. That patriotic woman made my day.
"Reproductive freedom begins in the bedroom.  It's YOUR  choice! Nobody's taking away your rights to have a baby  only your choice to kill your baby because mainly of convenience.  Be responsible and be accountable! Abortion is not Healthcare  unless life of mother and baby is at risk, in which case it's done in a hospital setting by your obstetrician, not a clinic Abortion doctor."
"""I think that abortion is terribly wrong; I have a responsibility to be here.""
No Matter What You Believe, No Matter How Strongly You Believe It; Under NO Circumstances is it your Right much less your Responsibility to try and dissuade someone from a life changing decision that is likely Already Hard Enough.
Get a life and stop interfering in everyone else's."
I had just say how crazy it is that you have to look for a bomb that may be planted by someone that is PRO-LIFE!!!! Want to kill u to what ?? Save lives?? How ludicrous
"100% the only reason these creeps do this is because they think they will be rewarded in ‘heaven’, they’re literally doing it for themselves."
Now fix the welfare system. Give those single moms with 4 baby daddies a pay hike. For they can raise their children well.
"I love how these people “speak on the behalf of God” 

Also, the “strongly religious” ones, if we could find out if the baby was going to be GAY, or TRANSGENDER. Would they be against abortion?

That’s what I thought"
"I'm cracking up at all the comments of people thinking you need a God to know it's morally wrong to kill a baby. How about we thank the 96% of thoses of you had those abortions for no reason other than convenience and thank them. the reality is that the 4% that actually did require that procedure like those that had miscarriage or a topic pregnancy or those that were victims of rape and incest like that little 10 year old girl from Ohio this week,had the 96% not misused it all  these people would be able to still have access to it in their states with probably hardly any pushback considering it's a lifesaving procedure. But I guess you're not ready to have that conversation right? we're just going to keep blaming all the anti-abortionists and all the religious nuts right? It most assuredly has nothing to do with the fact that 96% of women who had the procedure since Roe v Wade used it as a form of birth control and not needed it medically, just it was inconvenient time to have a baby. The level of narcissism it's seriously laughable and I'm literally laughing as I say all this because we're acting like that's not the case here we're acting like it's the other side's fault and not the pro-abortion side. You don't think all those videos of your advocates screaming they will gladly scrape their babies out and all those videos a father's crying outside of abortion clinics because they got caught cheating so the mother decided to end the pregnancy rather than try to work it out because revenge is always better that way I guess?. Or maybe it was the fact that 74% of abortion providers in America are men and they have been giving testimony before Congress for years now about the trauma they experience as a abortion provider. The fact that they see these little babies faces the fact that they go into great detail about how they are ripping babies inside the womb from limb to limb. But it's totally totally the anti-abortionist fault that this all happened they MADE the pro-abortions do all these things. And let's not forget that you can't have abortion and racism separately because the whole reason abortion exists was based off of racism and eugenics something that you can't cherry pick around. So be mindful when you're saying pro-abortion you're saying I'm pro racist I'm pro eugenics I am pro a master race because that was the whole reason abortion came into existence in the first place here in America on a mainstream scale it had nothing to do with providing women with birth control or alternatives it was to control the populace and remove the undesirables and for those of you that are saying well I'll go and get my tubes tied well guess what they also did that to 350,000 Americans that they deemed undesirable same industry but with the US government backing them. The fact that most of those that are pro abortionists have some sort of mental health issue makes them the prime candidate so you willingly doing it to yourself means that they don't have to go behind your back and do it you're still fitting into their agenda and a quick Google search would tell you everything I'm saying planned Parenthood admits to all this you all just don't read the first couple pages of their website. Stay woke"
Hey Dan your wasting your time there is NO god(s).
All these old men thinking they are helping people lmfao 🤣
Jesus (if they believe in Him or the Bible) would NEVER act like these a-holes. So bizarre. I will never understand.
“we will help you?”…. What does this protester do to help?
Keep it up Shelly. You’re inspiring❤️.
I'd really like to see pro-abortion people start   protesting at churches.
"Why would there ever,in the history of human beings,an acceptable reason for a third trimester abortion? 
With that said I believe in the right of a woman’s right to choose. But this isn’t a direct to consumer product. There should be limits. Same thing with guns.

The second were written when we were a fledgling country with no military and the weapons were musket loaders. Guessing no mass shootings back then."
It’s drives me crazy that People don’t realize that only 48% of the US considers themselves self religious
"Wait is CNN saying there’s something wrong with being against the killing of  b@bi€s? These leftists need to give it up. Life won! Murderers lost! Imagine living in a world where you have all these medical ways of preventing pregnancy but you lean back, chill , knowing you can just erase your mistake by taking a life. Well those days are over! Go do something and prevent pregnancy in the first place since you’re so against being able to give birth like a normal human being"
"Ask these protestors what Jesus said about abortion.  Anti gay protestors, what did Jesus say about homosexuality.  Of course they will deflect, but they can't give an honest answer."
"I wonder how many of those protesters would be willing to support that woman and her baby. Give her a home to live in, babysit while she works, buy food and gas. Every time I ask those people about the born children their answer is that it's not their problem. I've never hated these so called Christians so much in my life! All they are doing is turning people away from Christ and I hope one day they'll see his wrath. I hate to hate this much!"
How many millions and millions of mothers chose to kill their unborn children since 1977? A hell of a lot more than eleven. Tell both sides of the story.
Radical Christians are going to destroy this country... Not radical Muslims.. That's even more terrifying.
11 people got killed by pro life protesters?! 🤔.
They would be useful if they were at an orphanage helping but I guess that's not their problem.
Glad she’s getting our message out 🙏🏻 keep it up. Shame people are ok killing babies.
"How can you be pro-life, say that an unborn life has more rights than someone who is already alive? How can you call yourself a pro-life when you have no sympathy or care for existing life, and you are willing to kill that existing life to exert your selfish beliefs?"
I had an abortion while i was 15. I tried to kill myself first but then ended up in the emergency room. I was raped by uncle for 4 years. It is not anyone else's say apart from the mother. Period.
I think these people who work at the clinics should be able to shoot protesters if they get violent
"Can't believe that the US is regressing back into the middle ages. In a few decades, Saudi Arabia will become more progressive than the US."
These so-called pro lifers are pro birth. Not one of them will take one of these babies after they are born. The hypocrisy of pro lifers angers me no end. Why aren’t they advocating for things that will help the women AFTER the babies are born. They are supposed to be pro life but yet send death threats to people. I despise the lot of them. They are hateful hypocrites.
"Dan and the rest of these creeps need to shut it. 
I hope she get some people to whoop their ass."
"you can have your opinion, great now leave others to have theirs."
Thank you for what you're doing
The only person that has any say on wheather or not a woman terminates a pregnancy is the father( and if it is rape/incest his opinion doesn’t matter). The decision to carry and deliver a baby belongs to the woman
You’ll notice that the protesters are men!
"Killing people for the right to life - that makes sense, right?"
nobody's talking about anita bryant?
"Just like the mothers feel an abortion is the right decision, they feel being there protesting is the right decision.. I have a solution to this problem..

 I am a man so I really don't have a say so in this I don't personally believe that abortion is ever the right answer, but putting a kid through a rough life or even worse isn't the answer either.. 

If you're not ready to have a kid you should not be having unprotected sex no matter how good it feels you need to fight that.. Because as good as that feels, having to go get an abortion probably feels the exact opposite. 

 If you want to write to kill a baby without the father's consent then the father should be able to opt out of not wanting to financially take care of the baby and you, if you were to have the kid.. women trap men with babies and then take half but put maybe ⅛ of that to the kid..  The rest goes to her because she ""deserves this""."
Protest these protesters
"Here after Libs firebomb and vandalize a 3rd pregnancy help center in the  last week🤷🏽‍♂️ just saying it’s not about “safety of the mother” or “rape and  incest” when less than 2% of all abortions counted in the US(63M since  73’”
It’s about you affording that latte in the morning lefty, ain’t it?"
Call out Taliban terrorists and fascists for what they are! Complete criminal scum.
"No one knows when the soul inters a fetus,  the Bible never mentions abortion 
  I am for freedom of choice as long as it's early or life threatening or rape and insist. 
No one knows your story until they walk a mile in your shoes. 
  The Supreme Court is wrong on this one and we must fight for justice for all."
"How ironic that the lady at the beginning said their focus is the women and the children and their right to CHOOSE life. She doesn't even realize the crap that's coming out of her mouth. The whole point of abortions as an option is so that women have the right to choose what they know is the best choice for them personally. Without it, there is no choice. What a moron."
"Wtf she sounds proud, it’s my job, “it’s what I got to do”, I’m like this where we are as Americans I understand the society place for this but fast stop pop and go is probably sending the wrong message that reverberates long passed that sad lonely walk, please think about that? Or not and someone else will then what we should argue maybe more education maybe parks that unstable people can kill them self before turning on other’s or even better we mind are own business keep eyes on phone and never help talk or care for anyone but are selves, just saying slippery slopes creating dopes is so American God bless everyone I mean it I believe and I believe you do to."
It’s difficult to keep in mind that this is the 21st century.
"Numbers 5 11 to 5 31, god describes how to perform an abortion.. these religious fanatics don't know their own binle"
"More emotional manipulation. The anger and hate is on the pro abortion side. No matter how hard they try to condition your mind to soften and accept the horrific process of murdering a baby. This reminds me of the soft lies that lead the Jews to the gas chambers. The sick twisted mind it takes to believe you are doing the victim a favor, is unimaginable."
Those “protesters” shouldn’t be there! I don’t even know why they care so much but don’t/won’t go adopt or foster kids! Leave other womens vagina alone!🙏🏾♥️💕
It’s ironic to hear Dan say those babies are being violated. Individuals shouldn’t be violated by others. Do you think girls and women are violated when they are raped? Do you think little girls are violated when they have to endure the trauma of undergoing pregnancy or postpartum? Do you think women are violated when their government criminalizes their conversations between their doctors. I’m pretty sure all these things take away life as they knew it. Children are not citizens until they are born. Born children cannot make medical decisions about their bodies until the age of 18. Are we going to see Dan outside his elected officials office trying to fight the violations of these living beings? 2 guesses…
Goddess Bless this Woman.  She is a HERO.
I love Shelley. What an incredible women. Thank you
Typical one-sided CNN report. Eleven people killed in abortion clinics since 1977. How many millions of babies killed since 1977?
So the guy who said when he meets his maker he hopes god forgives him. Because he holds a lot of guilt for not being there more…..BULLSHIT. It’s because he did something in the past he’s trying to make up for period…
I think the 10 year old that was raped and had to cross state lines to get an abortion was violated three times..... first by the rapist second by the Supreme Court and third by the state....
The abortion doctor is an example of what to think regarding women's right to choose. Women will suffer the consequences due to the bans and all for what? Some cells.
Deathcorts
"She’s not the hero we deserve, but the one we NEED! Go Shelley!"
I love it when they say the right to choose life cause that leaves it open to the right to not choose life!
"Shes not even the good kind of escort...... is the irony lost on anyone that the ""escorts"" are dressed in gay pride colors and one has a gay pride umbrella.... its a womans right to choose is my personal opinion. That being said its extremely disturbing that we live in a society where people are more concerned with the rights to kill an unborn baby than the rights of the unborn baby."
"We defend life,God sides with those that protect children not those that out of selfishness demand the right to kill their children. You've got to be severely mentally ill to want to kill innocent children and think that's okay."
"I wish I was close by to help block these protesters, I'd just walk in front of them with a big ole white board"
"I don't see anything wrong with the protesting, but I don't think it's very effective, better to hand out pamphlets with information and engage in dialogue."
"The shear irony of pointing out the 11 people killed in anti abortion attacks, deeming them as extremists, then following up with an abortion doctor who kills babies in the 3rd trimester… when they’re viable…. This world is upside down."
Learn science you will find your maker
God kills more babies in one day than all abortion clinics have in 10 years
"Only 11 deaths sense 1977? That doesn't make things sound dangerous to me, they have more of a risk of death while driving there. I hate when people threaten others with different opinions though."
They all seem well intentioned just horribly misled
You're doing a great thing helping those women
"🆘️Your are in  trouble wih your soul Shelly.
Go and look at the open vision of hell

🌍🕊⛪🙏🔥⌛"
The protestors are fighting for 'the children' but there are children who need abortions after being raped and they don't care.
"Pro life, pro death, all annoying af, took me a minute to figure it out"
"Bad logic. Saying people will do abortions themselves if we dont legalize it (for doc supervision) is like saying people will do drugs and wife-beating themselves if we don't legalize it (with doc supervision). So the logic implies we should have heroin facilities, abortion facilities, and beat-your-wife facilities."
"My heart is breaking for America right now.  How women are stripped away from their rights and forced to endure an unwanted pregnancy is cruel.  Pro-lifers don't value life.  They just value giving birth, no matter what"
Why is it always weird nasty looking old men that hang outside abortion clinics. It’s true. I’ve been there. This is truly beyond my comprehension. There’s something wrong with them.
Jesus told everyone not to judge or condemn others. To treat others as they would want to be treated. To love their neighbors. These people protesting are judgmental people who want their will obeyed. I bet they feel proud too. I know where that pride is coming from... They are not getting into Christian heaven.
I think the lady mad cus she can’t get a man.
Thoughts 'n prayers.  Votes on the side of guns guns guns for everyone.  Protests for the right to not wear mask during a global pandemic.  Protests to take away the rights of women to make a decision that only affects THEIR bodies.  It's severe and dangerous mental illness.
"They are killing, to save lives… what a bunch of crazy people."
Those protestors are from God.He will keep them safe❤️
"Welcome to the Unitedstan of Murka, when’re the Cristban are controlling their women, but at the same time are bombarding other country’s because they are controlling their women amd put them only in burka’s… Bravo you freacking bunch of hypocrites that are protecting preachers that are raping 10 years old little girls that need to get an abortion paid by the church to protect the reputation of those freaking pedophiles preachers. BRA… VO. This is why your country is now the laughingstock of the world."
"Oh no, 3rd trimester abortion?....that is so fucked up..."
"Catholics should believe prayer works, but that's not all we do. We have pregnancy centers to help those who do not wish to be pregnant. There are adoption centers. There are other options than killing the child, which cannot be blamed for being conceived. Blame the rapist, blame the drunk, blame the irrational actions of humanity. But do not blame the child.
Further, the people who attack pro-life and pregnancy centers and commit arson against them should be held accountable. Not because their views are different, but because they destroy public/government property. All they are doing is taking options away from people who might need them. I do not agree with abortion, and I can try to persuade pregnant people not to go through with it, but I cannot force them not to, nor is it right to bomb or destroy abortion clinics just because I do not believe it is right."
the crazies and nutjobs.
"Abortion is a terrible thing that nobody likes. Just like cancer! Just like heart disease! Why would you stop providing top of the line medial attention for it? Why would you ridicule someone for having to deal with it? Why don't you stand outside of an oncology clinic and harass cancer patients for being in their situation weather it's their fault or not? Because that's stupid. I will say it again for those with short attention spans like me, these woman and doctors/medical staff are not ""pro abortion""  just like oncologists are not ""pro cancer"" and firefighters are not ""pro fire"", NOBODY LIKES ABORTIONS."
I would just hose them down.  Give them a blast of water on a cold day!
Nothing is more entertaining than seeing upset leftscum!
"""Assault by mutual consent?"" It's not a boxing match. She was assaulted, had it on film and they were like yeah...but no.  The heck is that"
Who would ever know that a rapist would have more rights than a 10-year-old rape victim?
"The thing is they are Not ""going to help you.""  Despite what that protestor said."
"Stupid people, you going to financially support the woman and her child after birth ? Of course not !!"
Sick people!! The ladies made hard decision to abortion leave them  alone.
"Yet these people want to ban guns ""to save kids"" 🤦‍♂️"
They don’t care about the life; if they did they would do more to support children after they are born
How do I become an escort?
how can someone be “pro-life” and go and murder random doctors and patients ???😀
These holier than though American Taliban specimens from the shallow end of the gene pool are CREEPY.  This zygote obsession is just bizarre.
"Nothing as hateful or judging than christian "" love"" nasty bullies of the worst sort. They only focus on this one topic instead of the THOUSAND of others things that can help people."
Abortion IS healthcare!!!! That woman is a fucking hero. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I don’t think she has to worry about getting pregnant
"Is it too late for my friend to get an abortion? How late is considered a later term abortion? Is 37 too old for one? I mean, the kid is actually 37 and doesn’t know how to change the damn oil in his car, or mow his own lawn!!"
Those people need to get jobs. How do they have all this time to stand around and try to force their views down some poor women's throat. This is insanity.
Interesting that the only bombs have been left BY PRO-abortion folks. But no point in letting facts get in the way of good old propaganda.
Of course most of them are men.  They have no say.
"Can we drop off all the unwanted babies at the houses of the protestors? 

No? Because they're not financially or emotionally secure enough to handle America take care of a child? And it's not a good idea to force children onto prepared people?"
Why would you think the clinic for the procedure is the place where these women haven't yet made their decisions... clearly they have decided and you just don't redirect their decision and are harassing them to change their mind.  That's not what I would call a choice.  If you really care move your picket signs to politicians and ask for better funding for women and children- particularly people fleeing abuse. 60% of women that abort will have another baby later. Most people getting abortions are teens. Afterwards they go on to get educations and start families with people that aren't abusing them. Many people who sorry consider their fetus and the life they would have lived and decided that's not a good enough life for them. They know their decision best. 75% of reported abortions happen to lower class women. So if you REALLY care about women being able to have babies you would work to make sure the babies we have can afford to live.  There is a formula shortage. Babies are dying from a formula shortage. Common. We visit can barely feed the babies we have.
Tell them to write A check for 21 years of care.
"OMG these people!🙄 the woman in the blue jacket, Go Home and mind your own business.....The Escort lady is fabulous!"
"What you see are old men, former rapists and pedophiles, pissed because women didn't have to carry their unwanted zygote as a life long burden."
"The people fighting so hard need to be exposed! 90% are Addicts that get paid. Also if you ask a lot of people against it 9x out of 10 they had 1 or more abortions when they wanted it. But is against anyone to make that Choice! 
Alway remember the one screaming the loudest is the one with the most to hide!"
Protect her at all costs
Why always the anti abortion people are the ones you don't want to f#ck in the first place
"I would love to have this job! Every morning i could low key make fun of anti abortion jerks, while helping a women in a rough time? You dont often get to choose both renegade and paragon points. Neat!"
This guy is disgusting. He literally rips babies limb from limb. That is so truly horrific.
"Thank God people fight for the child. No one is killing them and protesting abortion. Their thought is to protect life, obviously they care enough to try and help the people."
Too bad they dont spend time with the foster children who are neglected instead of shaming women.
Who needs the Taliban when you have the Christian Right in America
Living in the USA is like living in Afghanistan
"If Jesus was here, he would volunteer to work as a clinic escort."
"Why aren't they protesting rape or deaths in foster care or working in a children's home or teaching the next generation or mental health issues... you know, something to actually help."
#SHERO!!
"Good for her! 
Vote OUT all anti-abortion politicians!"
"This is so fvcking weird, clinic protesters, really?? They're crazy"
Hypocrisy!”I think these unborn children are being violated having their lives taken away”? And they turn around and rape them? Why don’t these righteous “pro-lifers care about the already born children being massacred in mass shootings. I don’t see these pro-lifers picketing outside Washington demanding strict gun laws. “ protect the unborn” but once they are out of the womb they become a fair game.
The religious people who are anti-choice  forget how many pregnancies ended when their diety's flood supposedly wiped out millions. They don't read their garbage book close enough. Nothing fails like religion 🤦‍♀️🤣
I don't feel sorry for anyone performing 3rd term abortions. F them!
Hmmm didn't she say CHOOSE?
"It's so sickening that those so called pro-lifers killed doctors.

They're not pro-life, they're pro-birth.

Once the child is born they don't care."
The right to convince someone to not abort the unborn is as fundamental as a woman's right to deside. Codify Roe v Wade please so I can compel a woman she is beautiful and doesn't need money to have children. Boo on gal don't like it. WhoRa servants of life keep up good work.
What does your fake sky daddy say about this matter. Go read that good book? No god cares for the babies?
"So....now it is right for a person to choose babies live or die??? Think about it. Whether it is a risk to you or you're raped or whatever your reasons are, never justifies you deliberately killing an unborn child. And woman think its only their decision to make. Wow!!! We all have a responsibility to protect babies...or???"
"""Their right to choose...life"" asshats"
"Be mean. These people need to be told ""fuck you, get out of here scumbags"""
The pro life movement is a religious movement.
"News in the future: Research has shown that the ""God pill"" works. The Pill that was invented a year after Abortion was banned in America in 2022, and has now largely reduced worldwide religions, making the world a peaceful planet again. The religious fanatics who were responsible for so much suffering around the world will be given an option from now on; keep your beliefs in your home or face mandatory chemical treatment. The last generation of self-righteous god believers are expected to be died out within two years.."
Protesting loud and proud as long as they don't have to tell their names. It's a pathetic clown show.
All these Republicans arguing about the value about life...ok let's ban firearms that have been responsible for so many school and public shootings.  I can bet the caring of life stops there for most of these hypocrites.
Hahaha 🤣  Only 474K views 🤣 💩
Scary times were living in...
It's always people without the ability to give birth that want control over it. Those old men need a hobby.
"Yo, this woman will never have to even THINK about getting an abortion....nuff said."
What a wonderful example of strength and love this young woman Shelly. These people are so fixated on their self-righteous rhetoric that they can't think logically. I hope when we revisit role v Wade in the near future under another case the stop the protesting. Women on a federal level will have the right to choose again.
Lol what 3rd trimester abortion that is farked
"Those anti-abortionists may be well-meaning, but totally naive and deluded."
"Instead of these pro lifers trying to guilt or assault or cause bodily harm to someone making their choice to do something that isn't their business, they could be more productive adopting a child in the system that doesn't have parents. That amount of attention could shape a kid and be more pro life than this."
"Hey women!

CLOSE YOUR LEGS!!"
It made me laugh the opening was all men. I cant imagine these people change the mind of many people. Probably less than .00004%
They should show what the pro choice do to the pregnancy centers!
"If  ""Dan"" has such a problem he and his nosy friends should got to an adoption center."
Somehow these nutjobs forget the woman's right to HER life. What a waste of a life to stand and ruin someone else's.
"Don't these old, white men have something constructive to do? Maybe help in a soup kitchen?"
"More than 60 million legal abortions have occurred in the United States since 1973. 

Are you telling me the United States had 60 Millions medical problems and rape?

There is a different issue."
"Zachary King a ,'Satanic High Wizard' said without fail there is at least one Satanist in every abortion clinic!!!!!
I wonder if she is that one????"
The brainless goop has control over a woman's body
"To those Anti-abortion, please take all the homeless kids, abusive by parents of kids back to your home to raise them before to shoot your mouth on somebody else body business. Those idiots are not understanding raise a kid need 2 things ready before you want to have them. 1, mentally to be ready as parents, be responsibility. 2, financially has to be ready. Stable income for long run."
"To those Anti-abortion idiots, please take all the homeless kids, abusive by parents of kids back to your home to raise them before to shoot your mouth on somebody else body business. Those idiots are not understanding raise a kid need 2 things ready before you want to have them. 1, mentally to be ready as parents, be responsibility. 2, financially has to be ready.

"Shelley, G*d bless you for your courage, and for your commitment to women's rights to reproductive freedom and autonomy.

I was at an execution's-eve vigil outside San Quentin when I saw someone wearing an Operation Rescue.sweatshirt. I went up to them and thanked them for being there and for witnessing that pro-life means pro-life. Shooting at, injuring or even killing someone is not an act of love and compassion, but of rank hypocrisy at its vilest. You cannot be pro-life and support the death penalty. You cannot be pro-life and not be a pacifist. Or else you prove my thesis that the ""Christian Right"" are not Christian — not are they right."
"""their right to choose life"", isn't the use of the word choose ironic."
I love this young ladies drive and tenacity to stand up to those who want to impose their religion on a free society.
I wonder.. how many kids have these pro-lifers adopted?!
Funny how people have to worry about bombs from pro-lifers.
"Kinda wish these anti abortion groups would just mind their own business. Women going to these clinics probably have a reason to be there. What if it's a young 12 year old girl that was raped by a relative. Is she not allowed to have an abortion? Or a woman that has to have one due to medical health problems? These pro life groups dont know the story of that woman, and they need to leave them alone."
"Good for her!  An abortion clinic bouncer, awesome idea!"
This is sad
Crazy religious lunatics
"I wonder how many of the protesters actually help any of the children once they're born, since they're so concerned about an unborn child?  Do they help any homeless children or any hungry children, or any children who are being targeted by pedophiles and sex traffickers?  Do they do anything to help prevent all these tragic mass shootings that take the lives of innocent children, like the ones in Uvalde who were really just babies?  Just wondering, since they're so concerned about an unborn child's life."
Don't like abortion? Then don't have one!
Love this woman!!!
This gal is awesome!
The anti abortion protesters should be sent to do missionary work on North Sentinel Island.   Good luck.
It's female right to do whatever they need to do
"Amazing support.  Why are those men even there? It is NOT an easy decision for women to make, and they (only them) live with that decision.  Whether we agree or not with that decision, I bless those who allow woman this procedure SAFELY."
"Everyone is here to help until they have to actually do something. I don't hear any of them offering to adopt, or to pay for the kid? How many kids have they fostered, what if its sick? What if its from rape or incest - should they still think about their baby??? What about the little girls who end up pregnant from their own family members, should they keep it too? Yeah, these guys are just assholes, they're not helping anyone, and if there was a heaven, they wouldn't be going there, the only thing they do with their lives is judge and hate, kind of the anti-Jesus... >_>"
"“Not today Larry” 🤣😂🤣😂  I hope this sweet lady walking these women carries. I don’t agree with abortion, that’s my personal stance/choice. I would never be unkind to someone doing that lonely walk."
Abortion is murder
"Anyone who gives birth to an unwanted baby should give it to these people.
They might as well start taking care of these babies"
"So I'm wondering about those men out there who intentionally go around impregnating as many women as they possibly can? Are we going to start enforcing mandatory vasectomy's? I'm not trying to be funny or sound ridiculous. We thought not too long ago that it would be absolutely ridiculous to have any of our rights as women as human beings taken away from us. It seems that everything is our reality as women. Well what about men? How would they feel having there reproductive rights taken from and dictated to them.
But No, that would never happen.  That's TOTALLY different, isn't it?"
"I love the fact these protesters are men as if they can relate, they will never understand what these women are going through or what it's like to be pregnant. There's a lot more single mother's out there then single father's and that's a fact. They don't know what it's like and act like they don't play a part in getting women pregnant. Instead of protesting why don't they go help feed poor children or children that have been abandon in foster care. The foster care system is over loaded with children and these idiots want to stop abortions so more kids could suffer. Smart!"
"Im pro choice but third trimester abortions?, that's months 7-9. I hope these are the rare cases where the mother was at risk of death as that's pretty late in the game to terminate."
Men should not have any input in this issue. It does not concern them.
"""And their right to choose life,"" sounds more than a little backwards, lady... 
It's, ""the right to choose,"" period, now banned by cult politics so you should say, ""the legal obligation to choose life."""
"Help you do what??? Feed them,  cloth them, pay for daycare, educate them!!!! It’s a hell no! They just want you to destroy your life and abandon you and the kids!"
why are there no young protestors? hmm..
Why not have these protesters contribute to raising these unborn children? I believe that it would be beneficial if they could cater to all the needs(till the kids finish college).
"""At least 11 people were killed in anti-abortion..."" if you can kill people, people can have abortions. Because in your eyes, murdering ""living things"" are fine"
"What rights have those MEN have to say ANYTHING about a woman's choice? Women can say something about other women but definitely NO men...
Saw a reporter asking protesters about adoptions as their opinion.. 4 people holding banners.. not ONE are a adopting parent...
These people should mind their own business."
"Overturning Roe vs. Wade is not about giving states a choice, but about a small minority of people imposing their religion and their beliefs on the rest of us."
"Now that's the exact opposite. Six pro-life centers have been bombed. And 34 others pro-life centers have been vandalized. by left wing cults. 
Democrats!!! At least try to be parents.  let your kids know about safe sex. If your kids uses condoms. The only will they not get pregnant. But they won't catch a sexually transmitted disease. And it's easy as that. Be a real parent teach your kids the right things. Don't teach them to spread their legs. have sex with anybody without protection. We won't need these abortion centers if this happens. Quit being horrible parents teach your kids about sex!!"
These people just do not understand. Everybody is on team Life here. You are often asking a Mother of 2 to die with her fetus that will not make it to birth and will only Kill the mother of 2 leaving two children without a mother now all because you think you're saving a life but in reality you're killing 2 when it doesn't have to be. You need to get those images out of your head that women are just having fully developed living children killed off because they want to.
"When you meet your maker he will ask you ""who gave you the job of condemning women"" and ""why can't  you clean your own house before trying to clean anyone else's""!"
"This is just so sad.  The men out there have no idea what it is to be broke in a America and being ""guilted"" into having a child you cannot afford or maintain.  To judge someone for having an abortion is outside of the Christian faith.  This is not about ""saving lives"" it is about exerting control over a woman's body.  We cannot and should not stand for it.  Our country is going backwards and it is so disheartening.   You want to save a life, but are willing to kill to do so?  Makes absolutely no sense."
"I love this woman

I’m also very proud of the men in this country who have gotten vasectomies."
Lol so she thinks she is God around that baby killing building 🤦‍♀️
"I’m sick of these “pro life” people who clearly don’t care about life at all, if they did they would see the importance of abortion and the tie between abortion and saving lives. Not to mention the psychos who Claim to care about life who are killing doctors."
You're a monster you escort women into kill their children 👹👺
"""We will help you"" Suuuure you will. Liars all."
"All anti-abortion protestors should be willing financially to help all ‘mothers and babies in need’ programs (WIC, etc) if their so concerned about babies and life. But nope, 99% are pro-lifers who deny abortion, gun reform laws, mask mandates for covid, vaccinations. Up til birth will they care about the mother and baby. Then they kick em’ to the curb. Damn conservative hypocrites!"
She’s a rockstar
Your god won't let you into heaven by dictating what someone else does with their body
They are kind of like the US military. They go to foreign lands to teach that killing people is wrong by killing them.
"why do these republican anti Christs want women to die ..I dont understand , im so confused.."
I can hear Karen screeching from here.
"ABORTIONS ARE RACIST !!!
“We don't want the
word to go out that we

"This woman and all the other workers and doctors are all so brave and such bosses.  That 80 year old doctor, who's still working - I think out of a sense of duty is unbelievable in his dedication to the healthcare of women and their right to choose.  Also those demonstrators saying ""we'll help you"" - it's like, how?  Give me an abortion because I was raped?  Give me an abortion because your loving god allowed my father to rape me?  Give me an abortion to save my life?  Give me a couple million dollars for all it will cost to care for my extremely deformed / ill child?  What the heckin' heck?!  The US is now about a half step away from the Handmaids Tale."
"Not all hero’s wear capes, and not all angels have visible wings. This woman is a treasure 🤍"
"I'm really wondering 🤔...What's the percentage of ppl against abortion, that have ACTUALLY adopted at least 1 child.....and from this country?

ALSO...the stock price for the Plan B is going to soar!! If it hasn't already. Facts."
"""Nobody asked you"" should be the motto everyone follows. 

Before you say something, ask yourself, did anyone ask me? If not shut the fuck up."
"Imagine people willing to hurt or kill someone else and claiming to care about unborn lives!!
 Just sick!!! 😕😕"
Yes because this prayers are gonna pay for baby furniture and formula right ?
So a clump of cells with no brain formed get a choice but the woman it's sucking the life out of as it drains the life from her so it can survive while acting as parasite to her doesn't matter that she has a choice ?
Every family has an ancestor who squatted behind the woodpile with a sharpened stick.or a knitting needle and they are liars and fools to deny it. My great aunt did - a rape victim at 16 in 1949. Can you imagine throwing yourself down stairs? Drinking horrible things? A k  knitting needle. ? A butcher?
These clowns dont want abortion there are 400 000 kids wharehoused but the ones with the big mouths will not adopt any of these poor kids just all talk i am pro abortion and i have adopted 2 kids
"Men have rights, women have the right to abortion. Because slavery has been abolished in this country, we can not call this land the land of the free if we still own people's bodies. Women need to move to states where abortions are legal."
All Americans have the right of freedom of speech - pro or con.
No love like aggressive threatening Christian love. I believe in magic and want your rights taken away as a result.  That’s what this crap boils down to.
♥️🙏WE MUST ORGANIZE AND ATTACK THE RICH🙏♥️.  GET UP NOW PEOPLE!    THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE US FIGHT EACH OTHER !   ..WHEN WE HAVE TO FIGHT THE RICH
"Why is it mostly old, White men protesting? Also, it’s disturbing that they keep calling out, ‘mom.’"
"Abortion murders defenseless unborn babies.
There is nothing wrong with that right?
🤔"
This is ok but doing it to a Supreme Court judge doing their bidding isn’t? Horse rap!🤬
"There isn't a single anti-abortion ""birth center "" that offers a Denmark Box, much less factual information about $12,000 personal tax deduction per child, child care credit , head of household credit, & child support, eligibility for medicare, supports that these ""pro-life"" people vote against in every way while they slut-shame single parenthood."
Hang in there Shelley. And these stupid idiots must not know that it’s not only full grown women that want abortion to be allowed. It’s little girls that actually get raped or molested by older men that actually did the service. So keep doing what ur doing bc u know we need it.
What an evil woman! Everlasting hellfire with the satanic majesty shall be her only reward!
I wonder if the same people that protest outside of abortion clinics are also protesting after mass shootings...  I mean if it's about life then....
ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS!
"“We’ll help you” 🙄…😂 my rear end! Those crazy obstructers are most certainly not going to be helping anybody financially, they have no understanding of the dangers of what they are doing. And…😳 why is this old fogy Dan dude standing alone outside this clinic? How creepy gross is that? I’m thinking this old fart wants to coerce young girls to keep their babies under his care while he abuses them. Sick pervert 😝"
"They will help until that baby is born, then you are on your own…"
These people are disgusting. In the UK we have some legal exclusion zones around abortion clinics to prevent these people from attacking these women as they enter. They should all be arrested for harassment.
"WHY are some of the terrorist ""protesters"" allowed to hide their names? They are standing on public property, harassing and terrorizing women who are exercising their legal rights. WE deserve to know who they are - so that WE, the majority of American citizens, can go ""protest"" at their homes and businesses."
"Yelling out Mom is the most toxic, misogynistic garbage I can imagine."
The thing is all of these people are completely ignorant to the real ethics of abortion! Its pathetic and completely uncalled for! Read a effing book 📖 will ya's!
"Dan, instead of standing out there holding down the sidewalk for decades, why not do something useful like volunteer at an orphanage.  That is where these fetuses end up that you supposedly care about."
Don’t these protesters have jobs?
"I wonder how many women have said ""i will keep the baby if you protesters cover my medical costs?"" And how many protesters said yes? I these protesters wont give money or adopt the baby they aren't helping they are just doing it for their own religious purposes!"
"I wonder if the third trimester abortions are for medical reasons only,... I'm not anti abortion, but I used to work in a maternity hospital for a very long time, specifically on a NNU, and we treat babies from 24 weeks onwards, and attend deliveries from 22 weeks onwards just in case there may have been mistakes with the dates and the babies are older than thought,... I would find it hard being part of the medical team attending an abortion at that gestation unless it was on medical grounds, because I'm so used to resuscitating them and treating them at that age,... 
We don't do abortions in the UK over 24 weeks, unless it's on medical grounds,... I would however treat any mother with caring, gentleness, and understanding,... they are going through enough trauma in their decision, and don't need a load of moral crusaders shouting and screaming at them during such a difficult time,..."
I would permanently eliminate those evil protesters
"LMAO.  That one woman...""their right to choose life.""  YES, they get to CHOOSE....and it may be to continue the pregnancy, it may not."
It's kind of thought provoking that each of these protesters are a carbon copy.
"As a man, I don't get these men who only want to earn ""brownie points"" with God. As the one guy said, ""when I  meet my maker, I don't want to have any guilt"". He says this about a situation he has no business being involved with in the first place."
People with emotional problems trying to relieve their guilt and shame by projecting it onto others. Slinging their Christian mythology like a weapon against vulnerable women. It's preposterous.
All these protesters have way too much time on their hands...get a job and contribute to society...jeeze🤦‍♂️
She is making herself a target...she doesn't need to engage with the ppl who are out there. She surely doesn't need to be posting it on social media exposing herself to the dangers of the world. It's no surprise she was assaulted. Her job is to escort the women. Nothing else.
"July 4th means freedom for all.  This country is less ""Free"" than the rest of the industrialized world."
They should make a law where anti-abortionists are forced to give a $1 to orphanages. See how fast they change their tone when they have to take care of born kids.
"Women are 2nd class citizens in this country.  When a man talks about abortion it is in my opinion very boring.  Men have no idea as men will not get pregnant nor have an abortion.  July 4th apparently means freedom.  But freedom from what exactly.?  Tyranny.  Well tyranny is right here in the image of Greg Abbott & DeSantis, Clarence Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh.  All men.  Men talk about women's choices or lack of them."
"If you're not the doctor and you're not the pregnant woman, it's none of your goddamn business."
"Instead of protesting in front of the clinic, adopt an orphan child and raise him/her. You'll make his/her life better."
I can’t wait for those people to find out they get to go to hell and it’s the escorts who are doing what Jesus would do.
Follow these protestors home.  Stand on the street and scream at their houses about how their religion is such horseshit and watch them lose their minds.  Good times!
Ask all these protestors what they think of state's rights. Thent ell them these women are using the rights afforded to them by the state. Let them explain themselves
Those protesters should be allow to be there only if they give 90% of their income to orphans.
"I bet if the abortion escorts were 6ft 4in, wearing body armour and carried AR15s these morons wouldn't get in their face so much."
These people clearly think that aborting is killing . It’s not killing or murder . It’s a foetus . Most abortions happen in first trimester
The anti abortion protesters look like  cult members
I can see pro-choicers haven't dealt with their L very well.
Don’t these people have jobs? They stand outside abusing people for a living!!! Congratulations to Shelley.
Good for her.
"More bs in the name of a man made religion.

Tax religion to fund these clinics."
I like how men are against abortion 🤬🤬🤬🤬 gtfoh
Looking at the faces of anti-abortion is an argument for abortion. These people should have been aborted.
Really scary and creepy those screaming “protestors”!!
Sooooo happy to be european
A country where whackos are in the ascendant. Overall decline is obvious to all in the rest of the world.
The depressing irony of anti-abortion activists (who call themselves “pro-life”) sending death threats.
So doxxing people is the CNN way? Show videos of an abortion
🤮🤮🤮
"Anti abortion, pro guns 🙄🤬"
"To the old man in red, when you meet your maker, you will be judged. Let everyone else be judged when they meet their maker. Too many individuals trying to live their lives of others. Live your own life, mind your own business and stay out of the business of others."
These people only care about the unborn. Once they're born they're some one else's problem.
"A gift, really? Of course, you'd know that every girl wants the gift of a forced birth after being raped? You ""pro-life"" people  need a mental evaluation. ."
"I live about a half mile from this clinic and everytime I see these protestors my blood boils, they need to mind their own damn business and leave these women alone."
When you meet your maker the good lord will probably send you straight to hell for judging and sticking your nose in where it isn’t needed. Shame on them for being so cruel.
"This woman is amazing, and has an unfathomable amount of patience. These people are so creepy and make me so uncomfortable."
I don't give two shits if you put me on TikTok. So I don't know what that's supposed to do 🙄😆
Only in America land of crazies
So this is where the Proud baby killers are. If your pro choice. Go get sterilized. Then yall wont have an issue with someone trying to save a child from being flushed down a toilet. You are all evil people.
"""pro life"" people are ""pro birth"".  they don't care about the life of the mothers, or the life of the babies after they're born. they don't care about the lives of the millions of people living on this earth. they have one agenda, and that's to control women.  They do this to prove how VERY christian they are.  Look. we get it.  you're christian.  but... BUTT out off my bedroom, my doctor's appointments, my UTERUS! Women deserve to have control over their futures!"
We can’t see her placing them on TikTok in this vid.
Just wait till they see the Lord's face on judgement day.....
"Those creepy, horrible, completely wrong people hassling those poor women. Good on you Shelley, you are a hero."
"Killing babies is not cool, murderers, may she burn in hell"
What if her mom still wants to abort her?
"Remember that the littlest victims need an advocate. They have no voice. A mommy who doesn't love 💗 them to even bring them into this world. There's no 👶 babyshower for them waiting. There's a lonely 🙁 painful 💔 😢 😔 death in that clinic.
That guided walk 🚶‍♀️ is the walk to extinguish the RIGHT TO LIFE guarantee by the U.S. Constitution.
The advocates of life of precious babies 👶 💕 are there....in the hope of saving a few.
GOD BLESS THEM.
Q ❤️"
"I wonder how these Pro-life Christians can worship a God who ordered the stomachs of pregnant women to be ripped open, caused women to have miscarrying wombs, took joy in watching babies being dashed against the rocks, caused nursing mothers breasts to go dry: starving her infant to death, commanded that every man, woman, child and nursing infant in entire cities to be murdered, and killed Job's family just to win a bet."
"Notice it is mostly men against abortion. Men can,t have babies, and when one is coming by surprise, a lot of them get lost. Let the women decide how they want the rest of their life to look like."
defending killers yay scumbags
Maybe they should help foster kids with their time. That would be an act of love.
Why is always old white men protesting? It’s gross that they literally prey on young women! Yes prey.
These people protesting need to get a life and leave these patients alone.
You baby butchers are so insane‼️
He probably abandoned his kid. Someone look into that. He made a comment that seemed personal.
NOT TODAY LARRY
So theres abortion.  How about free health care and day care till 13 yrs old then.  How about free education to all levels then.  Fkn republicans.  SEPERATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.  THERES ONLY LIKE 13% OF U THAT ARE EVEN CATHOLIC.
Why are abortions performed in separate clinics? In my country abortions are performed at general hospitals.
"This sickness stem's all the way from the top,Reagan's trickle down theory at work, yes i'm talking about the way they are taking a crap on all of us , this shyt doesn't happen anywhere els, hell it diden't happen before Reagan, the 50's were an incredible time for the regular people, every one could obtain a bright future with a little hard work, Our government is broke, and i don't know if it can be repaired."
"Finally, the lowest of the lowest human beings can feel better than someone so ofcourse they won't shut up."
"Until they can prove that they have been helpful to  pregnant women by paying the bills, by adopting a baby or child, they really have no ground to moralize and judge others. Judge not lest ye be judged.  Wish the Supreme Court judges who overturned Roe v Wade had heeded that Biblical quote."
"Excuse me,  anyone with a penis, shut TF UP! There's no accountability for the sperm donor in this scenario, AT ALL. They can shoot their load  and walk away.;  Keep your religious BS  OUT of our vaginas, and our LIVES.  Thank you very much."
"It just kills these people to say pro life, because then they would have to admit they’re pro death. Ooh, what a brave move for this pro death women  to aim her phone and put someone on Tic Tic, because she disagrees with them. That’s true courage."
These people have nothing better to do than harass young women!
What’s her tiktok?
"I went to get an abortion in Dayton Ohio. I was 30 years old and in grad school. I didn't think I could even get pregnant.
Anyways,  people were really out there protesting. I didn't know this was a thing. I on my own decided to keep my baby after seeing him on the ultra sound (I was in my 2nd trimester- that was a surprise too). I instantly fell in love 😍. I don't know how to really explain it. I just fell in love. 
The screaming/ yelling and pleas from the protestors didn't make me want to keep him. 

My son is now 7 years old.  love him so much 😍.  I never got my $200 back but that's okay I knew it was  non refundable.

I truly understand both sides of the argument. 
It's a complex issue. I wish it was an easy right or wrong issue, but it's not because the woman does have to carry the baby in her body. Adoption isn't an easy option either. I would / could never ever do that!"
"""We'll help you!  We'll pray for you!""
Oh good. That'll do the woman a lot of good. Maybe spend less time on the sidewalk and more time backing up your promises"
Thank you❤🌹🙏
"Why are you weirdos pushing abortion on everybody? Stop it!!  Push prevention, there are multiple forms of birth control these days and a great Plan B at every drug store in every city. Pushing abortion is just a racket to get money for Planned Parenthood which is based in hatred for Black people and in killing as many black babies as possible.  Abortion should be safe rare and yes legal. But you guys had to push for abortion in the fourth month, the fifth month, the sixth month, the seventh month, the eighth month and the ninth month. And you want every American to pay for the abortions by funding Planned Parenthood and paying for any abortion requested.  That is F’ing ridiculous and unacceptable."
Do you fake religious freaks know what an ectopic pregnancy is? It's when the embryo develops in a fallopian tube instead of the uterus where it's supposed to be. After 8wks the embryo is now a fetus until birth. If the embryo grows it will explode in the fallopian tube causing the mother to bleed out and die. Get a grip not every abortion is their choice.
"I don't know how you define the word ""screaming"", but none of the people that you showed on here are ""screaming"" at them."
"Hold the phone:  he told the woman ""she's beautifully and wonderfully made"".  Oh no!  Not that!"
Another man imposing his belief onto a woman
Unemployed religious people harassing others.
"American Christians are brainwashed. Religion, all religions, just makes people DUMB."
"Oh yes and how are you going to help them? Give me a break, give people the privacy they deserve."
Dan needs to go to hell for his sins
Crack heads

Third trimester abortions that she calls rubber.  God is watching.
losers harassing people... nothing more. mind your own business.
"0:47 Their focus is on a woman's right to choose their view of ""life,"" not a woman's right to choose whatever her conscience decides, only to choose a pro-life stance. And they don't see the irony or duplicity of their statements?!?"
This woman and every woman's health clinic worker is a hero
"Third Trimester doctor... Scrambles the baby's brain and then gives birth to a killed infant. That's reality. Pro-choice, do you have any limits?"
Go Shelley!  My Motto....If you are against abortion...dont get one.  Keep up the good work!
She is amazing. Thank you for all you do!
Imagine getting up every day to slander people going to do what they think is right for them.
Do you plead for teenage orphans with no dad and a toxic mom on drugs? Do you plead for orphans constantly bullied at school for stuttering and having a lisp? Do you know what type of hell it can be to live like that? Do you plead when Ted Cruz cuts social funding and mental health funding for the very poor? Probably not you are probably to busy judging them.
Women have the right to choose!
Who are these old men who think it's their business to tell women what to do with their own bodies?
What about rape babies being adopted and molested by the rapist. Do you this God is disgusted? You people cherry pick the bible a lit. Do you protest against sexual harassment and sexual assault in the work place shelters ect. You probably are not bothered much if at all. The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Sexual immortality is the only sin against the body. God hates sexual sin more than abortion based on what I have read in the bible. Do you rail against female veterans getting raped at the VA. Do you.rsil against fully topless pictures of women bing in display at the welcome desk and make and female shared fake medical clinics. What do you think God says about lust fornication sexual explanation molestation oppression of the poor oppression of damsel????? Why do you just take on the one cause does doesn't require grave. A baby is easy to live but adult you can blame and judge and you still don't have to give them grave. When Jesus dies he dies because we are all guilty no one deserves heaven. You are supposed to pay grace forward. Why do you only plead for unborn babies and do you plead for any other part of their life their parents life?
What about female soldiers and veterans being sex trafficked
"Do they vote against food stamps, social assistance, female soldiers getting raped and retaliated against by chain of command, and female veterans getting for Ed to prostitute for housing education and medical benefits the EARNED with their service? Why is only the birth of a baby and that's it you are done?"
I hope Dan would suck his thumb and shut up. As if he should have any thought's on any individual woman's  personal choices about their health.
Help ? you ask him how many kids has he adopted how many kids have they fostered . How many social services programs he supports and contributes too because prolifers are the same Republicans who want cuts to welfare and social programs that help the youth they do full of crap it makes my blood boil
Okay so pay child support then $$$$$$ men
I just had an abortion today...I regret nothing..will do it again if I want to.
Abortion is murder ngl
"What is This?  Contraceptives for every occasion - No excuse for abortion at rate, Women are wholly irresponsible = killing babies in Mass is uncivilized, irreparable, an abomination.  Not in Mass, limited when and if necessary"
We need to start taxing churches in the USA 🇺🇸. They pay ZERO taxes but pay millions to get anti abortion legislators/judges elected.
The Catholic Churches ⛪️ could take care of all the orphans in the USA and still have enough money left to house all the homeless.
Men protesting abortions is like women protesting vasectomies.
Wow she is a HERO
"“That walk.. is the loneliest walk, if you are by yourself.”

That hit me hard."
"Shameful that this is still happening, I thought we stopped this years ago.  I would volunteer at a clinic. I'm not fertile anymore, but I remember being a young woman.  I have had all the children I wanted.  These women need the same support.   I don't think I could be quiet after dealing with these hate filled people every.single.day.   Okay, pro lifers, adopt them.  But you have to adopt ALL OF THEM.  Right?  All races, all disabilities, diseases and deformations.   If you agree to adopt every single one of them; we may have a possible negotiation.  We both know that isn't going to happen, so until we have a better idea, lay OFF!   Embryonic transplant (taking a fertilized egg and moving it to a new womb) is unfortunately still years away.  Perhaps we'll have the ability to adopt children BEFORE birth; but until we can, this is necessary."
I really wish God existed. Pretty sure he would tell his believers to stop being idiots and lend their efforts to people who actually need help.
but this is the same OLD WHITE MAN that votes against FEEDING/SCHOOLOING kids.
"Much praise for this brave woman and those who work along with her......Please, people understand that women who make this choice are doing it because they believe it is the right thing for them to do."
"All we want is the right to choose. You want to choose life? Great, you do that. But let others choose as they themselves deem fit."
Why can't people just mind their own business?
Abortion clinics think the focus should be on the women and the children?  Isn't that like Orkin saying their focus is on the customers and the termites?
Oh no not tik tok.
"Thank you for the work you’re doing, Shelley. Please stay safe. ❤️"
“She’s 10”
"I mean in Nebraska you were able to abort a baby at 22 weeks even if you don’t have a medical condition so, these people don’t know how far in you are and if ur aborting a 22 week pregnancy you probably should be heckled"
Imagine being so “prolife” you plant bombs that kill women and health care workers!
"This woman is a real hero!
And with a healthy sense of humor too.
Awful the kind of stuff she and others have to put up with, though."
Soooo abortion clinic attacks if that’s not the most hypocritical thing I’ve ever heard like 🤷🏻‍♂️ I thought whaa aren’t u here to save lives wth 🤦‍♂️
Bunch of f...ing hypocrites.  'Beautiful' gift of life is so 'beautiful' that these same phonies don't support programs after children are born.  Pro-life my A$$.  Pro-Birth only.
They call themselves pro-life when they won't put a mask on to save their own families.
"@2:29 I believe that. The ""here"" that he was referring to definitely wasn't the clinic though. Please don't try to make up for the regrets of your life by putting guilt onto anyone else. Do something meaningful with the remainder of your days Gramps... or just get drunk at home for the rest of your days.. it's better than bullying young women"
As a follower of the message of Yeshua (Jesus) I'm saddened by those that believe that message has become a club to beat others. The simple message is a tool for self examination and self empowerment. It is not a weapon for controlling others.
In most cases woman use abortion as a form of birth control.
"""Nope, nobody asked you"" 😄"
The crazies have nowhere left to go and the wealthy are loving the show
The same people that are using Christianity as an excuse in this video must forget Exodus 11:4-5. God literally killed babies. Just say you are an asshole.
I find it amazing how these protesters think they have any say over another person's life...
"How about “Stop the Sperm” movement! Or a mandate for condom use! Where are the men taking responsibility instead of protesting, violence and shirking their role. Women do not get pregnant on their own and many times not their choice!"
Focus on the Fetus cult members. Ridiculous hypocrites.
Choice 💜
GREAT JOB!!!!!
The reason fewer doctors are doing 3rd trimester abortions is because they know what they're doing is wrong
"yeah patients? euphamism for mother, choose life your mom did❤❤❤"
American the land of the free. Except people have lost the right to choose when to bring life into the world.  A baby is a great thing if you are able to support it. But if you can not sadly it can destroy your life and you will ultimately dispite your best intentions you can easily destroy the life of that  innocent child. Do t we already have enough seriously damaged and disturbed people in the world already
"What is disturbing or ironic about these protesters is that they ignore SO MUCH other horror going on to focus on this, but never realize that destroying our civil rights is a far greater horror and danger to our society than the reality of a few abortions. The 'forced birthers' won't adopt, vote for healthcare, support families at shelters, they do nothing for living children or families, it seems all they want is to punish women by forcing them to carry unwanted pregnancies."
The protesters are not the enemy
"Isnt it amazing that these ""right to life people""maime and kill people,threaten all kinds off the same"
It is the absolute height of hypocrisy that some of these protesters want to stay anonymous. Unbelievable.
🏥💉🦴👀
I'm sure these women are eternally grateful for everything you and your professionals are doing for them. You're sooooooooooo necessary!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
There are so many reasons people come to these clinics. I never thought I would feel intimidated crossing a line of protesters since I wasn't seeking an abortion. I was SO wrong. These protesters are an abomination.
"These anti abortionists are my heros, not getting into the rights and wrongs of abortion, they are sticking  up for what they think is right, very important in a democratic society. It's because people tolerated alternative viewpoints that society is what it is today. Yet when these same people, so grateful for free thinking in the past are now becoming the fascists themselves."
you people need to mind your own business!
So many commas missing on all those signs. One genius after the other...
They know that an embryo isn’t a baby. It’s about control. They don’t support funding to children in low income families. They celebrate the murder of minorities and immigrants at the hands of police. It’s about taking away personal liberties. The GOP only care about controlling people.
Every time a woman has sex she can get pregnant. Doesn’t mean she has to have that baby. It’s her decision and no one else’s. The Bible says life starts at the first breathe so it isn’t about religion it’s about control.
WOW these ladies are wonderful. How can ww support them?
"That clinic is decrepit and sad, just like what's going on inside! 😢🙏 The doctor is decrepit too!"
Leave people alone!!!!! Get a hobby!!!!! None of your business!!!!
Jesus would say mind your own f)cking business
"She’s doing the Lord’s work, which is why I fear for her life."
"This highlight the hypocrisy of the right assaults and murders justifiable as long as it is antiabortion activist doing it, a graffiti against the overturn of roe v wade, threat oh hate crime terrorism."
"Self righteous hypocrites pretending to care about children. 
Ask them what they have done to help single mothers or their children? …………..Crickets."
When the cops don't remove the anti abortion  predators/protestors they grow in stupidly & numbers
"Evil always mocks good. This is especially true when evil loses the battle.

Now that Roe v. Wade is dead, good had won a victory over evil, and evil women like this baby-killer are trying to protect their blood money.

I'm sure slave owners in the Antebellum South were no different."
She’s as funny as the plague
"Very good idea!

These sad people need to get their dose of attention! 

Let us all see how perverted they are!"
Anti-abortion? Really? But aborting the lives of doctors and nurses is not against their god's will...
Of course its the maga hat jesus freaks that are protesting..   they complained about having to wear a mask during covid but imagine being forced to having a baby..
"Wonderful!!! Anti abortion people are such hypocrites, refusing to vote for politicians who will help pregnant- new mothers with Healthcare, childcare, livable wages, better school funding, etc."
"I personally don't believe in abortion, maybe because I was never in a situation where I needed to choose, but that doesn't give me the right to choose for another person.  Every body have their own experience and need to make their own decisions.  Also, a lot of women that have abortions is because the father wants nothing to do with the babies and they can't support the child on their own. Is the law also going to make those fathers that don't want the babies to support the child when they are born?  or are the anti-abortion people going to take care of those babies when they are born? Do the anti-abortion care about a child that is not wanted and get abused, neglected? They only care about the now but what happens in the future after the child is born."
"But it's okay to form a mob outside the homes of Supreme Court justices and threaten their families, right? I don't see these anti-abortion protesters doing anything violent. If not for double standards, the left would have no standards at all. 🤨"
"its a health clinic, not an abortion clinic. Many services besides abortion are provided. CNN, do better"
Clinics need valet parking at the door & escorts in to the clinic.
I fucking hate them.
that's right. people killed in anti abortion attacks. the irony isn't lost on me. what a bunch of a holes.
"I hope these old man and delusional woman one day understand what they are doing! I don’t think they individually have adopted 5 or 6 children. Leave those woman alone they are having it difficult enough, because abortion in not a hobby.
Those loudmouth screamers should make themselves available for helping families who are poor and don’t know anymore how to feed the ones they got.
That’s in the Bible you know HELP it doesn’t say stupidly shout!!!!"
These creepy people are selfishly doing this for themselves because they think they are getting brownie points from their god. They are in fact quite evil.
God is dead Dan.
"""A developed country"""
Women in america have more rights over their bodies when they're dead then when they're alive. That's so fucked up.
Slime using their religion as a weapon
How tf do these people pay their bills and still have time to protest like this? Lolllll
Oh my goodness.  These idiots make Jesus Christ himself look bad.
Ummm why are they mostly men?
"This is a sadly divisive issue. Nonetheless, I cannot support either side of the controversy. Both sides have a point, but they also are way too dismissive of each other."
What a bunch of saddos who have no job or life and just hang out at clinics all day.
Something is very wrong with the DOJ.  I am really scared.  Why is Trump not in jail?  Has AG Garland been compromised as Bragg was in NYC?  Are we losing our nation to religious extremist ideologue’s?
YES! Watched her TIKTOKs from the beginning and she is brilliant respectful until they get nasty and then she puts them in their place! Love it!
Protect Shelly at all costs
2:50 imma call her Karen since she had her name withheld.
Bunch of old white people pushing Christianity.
"love how men, aka humans who cannot bear children, want to force women into doing their bidding..."
"People equating abortion with death is hysterical. People using violence and threats to stop women from getting an abortion aren't even disowned by their religious people to their left and right. And all these people playing like their religion is the reason they are against it is laughable since it's not in the Bible and Jesus never talked about it. At the same time these people talking about how when they go to heaven... 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂... they acknowledge the soul and yet know nothing about it or when it enters a human body. They don't care that the US actually killed over half a million kids in Afghanistan, they don't care about the very real starving and homeless children all over the US. They don't care about the countless babies killed by hospitals due to accidents and errors, and do nothing to create safe spaces with contraception for the youth so they may explore their sexuality without worry of being pregnant and yet they think that continuing to harass and berate other people about their choice is the way to go. Those people disgust me and are the worst form of blind, ego driven, soul denying, godly created idiots, that we have to endure. And when they die they will have a really big revelation."
Love how these cowards refuse to give their names. Spread their shame!!!
I escorted A friend who got raped into a planned Parenthood. Got a rock to the spine. Cops watching the pro lifers did nothing. Next time I'm going violent in return.
The fact that the government knows about this and does nothing tells you all you need to know.
"If only self-control were taught thoroughly at the home...
Then again, PP would go the way of the dodo."
If you understand the science you will have to accept that life begins at conception. Killing babies is always wrong. Do you really know what happens to a baby in her mother's womb during an abortion. Try speaking to adults who are grateful that they were adopted and had the opportunity to live their lives. Remember baby's right to continue to live. This woman is another crazed attention seeker.
Yeah but its us Atheists that are always so angry?
I swear to god I will be her California corespondent!
You do know 71% of americans disagree with abortion right??? Gtfoh libs
Let the unborn child have a chance to live.
It makes me sick to look at someone who rips fully formed babies out of mother's bodies heroicize himself.
So much for pro-life...so instead they kill doctors and advocates?? How does that make sense?
"Anti-abortion is specifically not Pro-life.  These kinds of protesters prove that fact every single day.  Standing around unwanted and unwelcomed day after day with annoying signs and shouting their thoughtless, scripted, shaming platitudes. at people they never met and will never know experiencing circumstances they will never care enough to try to understand."
"People like Dan is why abortions are needed, his mother should've exercised her right back then."
"These religious nutjobs are out early to harass people into submitting to their beliefs, they don't even know what's the reasons for a woman to visit an abortion clinic, she could be aborting to save her life from an Ectopic Pregnancy but they don't care about that."
May they all rot in hell but one’s killing babies
Isn't life precious no matter what age?
Don’t feel sorry for the doctor and nurses been killed that killing thousands of babies every year
"Daaang, I need new glasses!!
That thumbnail; I thought it was a picture of her - and a man with an axe behind her!! :O"
I’m still reeling from the striking down of Roe v Wade. I still can’t believe it.
I'm not in favor of abortion but the part that people mostly look over is the fact that now religion is strongly influencing government and not just in laws but also in the Supreme Court they're supposed to be a separation of church and state once you change that you change the government because whose religion will be over all others religious beliefs and when will it soon be that all other religious beliefs that don't make it to the top will soon be banned because the top religion doesn't believe in what the other religions are saying anyway this is where the line is now becoming blurry it's been crossed
Yeeeeeees...broadcasting people protesting the murder of unborn babies on “tiktok” will really tell them “what’s what” 😆🤡❄️😆🤡❄️😆🤡❄️😆🤡❄️
"To the protester: How about going and saving all those pregnant ladies who have to live where the war rages? They would love to give a safe birth and raise their child, but they don't know if they are going to live tomorrow."
Abort the protesters.
These protesters with all this time on their hands need to volunteer at a food kitchen or homeless shelter.  I would say they should foster kids...but they aren't compassionate enough to raise children.
If only they would be this vocal for the living.
imagine supporting abortion
"I would be a lot more sympathetic to the pro-lifers if they were willing to ensure that every child has the basic needs to function in our ""society"" met for them so that they have a chance to meet their potentials. Unfortunately it seems that pro-lifers stop being pro-life as soon as the kid is born.


F.Y.I. society was in quotes because of an inside joke, and we are all in it!"
"Hypocrites, don’t care about he kids after they’re born."
these women rip these babies apart with their body parts twitching on the table and gasping for air at 8 weeks
"Freedom of religion, should include freedom from religion…"
"I'm sorry..but when you start your entire point of your conversation off with claiming to fight for ""reproductive rights"" when fighting for abortion that is factually the right to not reproduce or ""non-reproductive rights"", not only do you try to use psychological manipulation and psychological warfare to give color of law rights to something that you know has no merit in the very fact that you call it something opposite of what it is to claim the rights of the opposite of what it is but you steal the rights of those whose rights you are trying to invoke as your own when they aren't such as the women in China who were forced to have abortions when they wanted ""reproductive rights"" and to not have abortions. When you have to make yourself sound like a victim of something you aren't, like a woman who may be sterile from a forced procedure or a woman who may have been otherwise injured from a lack of consent, you not only make yourself look like you have no ethics, but you actually don't have any moral precedents when you're the cause of injury to others from your reckless actions. To which, many of those women had forced abortions past any point under Roe v. Wade, that would constitute murder under American law, and being reckless enough to cause reckless homicide is a not just a civil wrong but a criminal offense. So justifying you are in the right when proven criminally wrong in both directions..you would think you would learn something by now and get a clue. There's no accidental after that point. No unknowing. Just plain intentional murder."
The irony!  They assassinate people working at these clinics while calling themselves pro-life!
"Our focus is the women n children & Their Rght to Choose Life..... Excuse Me BUT.... It's Their Rght to CHOOSE Whatever is Best for THEM because NOBODY KNOWS the Health or History of That Particular Women!!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 
MIND Y'ALL DAMNNN BUSINESS!!!!!! 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯"
"2:16 So these unborn children.... *WHAT?* the fetus is being terminated but in schools children are having their *lives* taken away from them by the inept gun laws and your inane belief in _ma rights_ to own and carry guns *everywhere.* Hey Dan, go protest outside a gun store because they are responsible for children's lives being stolen from them......nah, you won't do that will you pious hypocrite.

The clinic escorts are doing a great service and should be recognised for their stupendous work. Shelly and Ladies you are *CHAMPIONS* every single one of you! 👍👍👍👍"
"I don't believe in abortion, But I Also Don't Think I Have The Right To Tell A Woman what To Do with Her Body, But Those Damn Republicans Do 😡😡😡"
I praise this woman 💯!
Do you IDIOTS know what actually happens when you kill an unborn baby?
They shouldn’t make it such an black and white issue.Too many humans are made every day.There is enough of you.It’s nuanced.Some people should have the right to end their pregnancy.
"So why are these people not outside GUN shops ,shouting ""please don't buy guns that will kill people ."
The giant picture Dan has of a fetus is not an accurate depiction of an embryo  before 10 weeks.
"I love this woman! The propaganda surrounding this issue is unbelievable! I am so terrified for the lives of women seeking care in the future AND the lives of these unwanted children. 
I bet all these protestors go home and eat murdered animals even though their lives were taken against their will and with zero regard to their sentience. 
Interesting that the same people that are forcing women to give life are also forcefully taking it with for nothing more than a sandwich that takes less than 10 minutes to eat."
So she's an escort? Prolly no one buys her.
Love this woman!
Don’t want a baby don’t have sex or move to a state that allows this irresponsibility
"Thank you and all those who do what you do. Please know that it is NOT a thankless job. 
We all support you and send you love and strength. ✌🏻👊🏻"
Notice how they’re all old people who have absolutely nothing better to do with their lives 🙄
I think it's time that these abortion clinics start hiring security. Keep sending financial support to your local clinic to make this happen!
"Hmmm, yet there are 700K children in foster care. Most likely to ""age out."" These pro fetus zealots need to STFU."
"No Dan, you've been harassing women!! You're a bad person."
I love Shelly. Thank you!
"God bless the escorts, nurses and Doctors willing to help women."
Bitch don’t pray for me
Saw this 6months ago. How did it come out 6 days ago?
"HOW can you be assaulted by mutual consent ? ? ? ?  Suggest equpping escorts with tazers.  May be fun to print up some contracts for the protesters to sign.  They agree to pay X$, per month into a fund for the support of ""Mommies"", like those ""Save The Children"" programs, where they send you photos and progress reports on third world kids.  Hand out the break down of  expenses,; rent, utilities, food, clothing, medical care lost wages, etc.  Times that total by 18 ! !   Let's see how many protesters agree to make that commitment."
We are sliding back so far into the dark ages thanks to these horrible judges and politicians that soon enough we won't even recognize this as America anymore
Can anyone explain why the majority of abortion protesters seem to be old white men? A little creepy?
Hero. She is a hero.
Can I get a gate and a tall thick fence?
Most of those men protesting look like they shouldn’t be left alone with children. They look creep AF
MEN need to stay away......until they give birth....it is NOT their business
YES!
Ah women murdering babies in the womb what a story.
And where are you when they need real help
Their right to choose life? That's an odd way off putting pro-life
"Yeah, I'd be telling them; ""Uh, if you were REALLY serious about HELPING, you'd be out in the world HELPING WOMEN WHO WERE PRESSURED INTO HAVING BABIES AND THEN GOT STUCK WITHOUT THE MEANS NECESSARY FOR BRINGING UP THOSE CHILDREN. You REALLY want to make a difference? We're going to hook you up to volunteer your time ACTUALLY helping those that need help HERE ON THE PHYSICAL PLANE.""   ...

I worked very hard in film editing. His father died of ALS, Christmas Eve 2005. At hospice where Terry Shiavo was finally unplugged brain dead."
What's wrong with what they are saying? We don't have the right to reason with people??
Knock that scumbag off that stupid ladder for a start
"Anti abortion protestors need to keep a couple of things in mind.

Life is hard.
Life can be cruel.
What happens to most unwanted babies if they grow up unloved?
What do angry isolated antisocial people tend to do?
And what people are willing to do if the population outgrows their resources.

Just some doubts"
11 people killed by PRO LIFE demonstrators.
“I don’t want to just be a meme” You’re not Shelly. I promise. You’re a f* hero❤️
"Religion is, and always will be poison."
😍
She's a HERO!!
"Maybe Dan should read more of the bible to discover that his ""maker"" has no qualms with abortion whatsoever, and even allows for it to be carried out. Also said maker despises people like him who protest in such methods while talking about God (as Jesus reiterated regarding the log in one's own eye when people complain about the splinters in the eyes of others)."
Can you Imagine the health and beauti can make more Youthful skin makeup all over your Face ….🫵
"it's so easy to advocate for the un-born isn't it?   they don't wake you up in the night.   they don't cost you any money.  you don't have to feed and clothe them.  you can raise up your arms and proclaim your moral superiority.   and THE MINUTE the child is born,  it is no longer un-born and you can just discard it and the mother as sinners deserving of God's scorn because they don't share the same beliefs.   anti-abortion activists are the height of cowardly hypocrisy."
He carries a lot of guilt that he feels he has to heap on the women he verbally abuses....
"What a hero she is, and the dude who had a lot of guilt, and more time to yell at women seeking abortion after retiring, needs to forget about meeting his maker. He's going to hell."
What about the lives of the women who are denied the right to make their own choices?  What about their lives?  What about those who die because they were denied a necessary medical procedure?
"I wish we could redirect the passion these protesters have to foster care. If you truly want to protect children, that's the way to go. This is not protecting children, this is hurting desperate women. An ounce of self awareness would allow them to ask themselves ""why would I pursue an abortion?"" edited to add: Why isn't this protected by HIPAA?"
Are these people going to fund the children for a minimum of 18 years or adopt? If not then you have no business telling a woman what to do with her pregnancy
I'm glad there are people like Shelly and the number of volunteers at clinics keeps growing.  You have my support and respect 🙏🏾
"As a man, I'm going to see if it's possible to get a prescription for the plan B pill so I can pass them on for free."
"I get so pissed when clinics that provide women's services are called ""abortion clinics"".  I am sure that other services are provided."
People should not be allowed to protest out side of clinic.  And guys outside just pisses me off. Most women don't do this lightly.
"I love toothless 60-year-olds calling young women ""mom"""
"Imagine being so ""prolife"" you literally murder people🤣🤣"
Shelly Mann you are a godsend. ❤️
Pro life people committing murder. Religion is the worst virus on this planet
That’s just ironic on how pro lifers go to an abortion clinic and kill people
"Are these people going to help you take care of your child, no they will not!!!!! They need to keep their opinions to themselves, they don't know why that person is having an abortion it could be from rape or the woman has a health issue, either way people should keep their mouths shut."
Why don't you have patients get there really early in the morning?

There are so many cases of women that will die if they don’t get an abortion- or who wanted a baby and had a miscarriage and can’t expel on their own and need to go to an abortion clinic bc they can’t get it done at a hospital.
Why don't they build a drive up awning to keep the harassers out of sight? They should start a GoFundMe.
I don’t understand why these anti-abortion protestors aren’t in front of NRA headquarters
"most of the protesters are old,white men. very telling. they just want to control women, they don't care about babies."
"Ah, religion is so lovely..."
Pro life - smh. They are NOT pro life. They are pro theocratic fascist.
"Yes, I've seen her celebrated online before.  Wonderful woman!!"
If this is a womans issue why do almost 50% not have an issue with it???
"I remember when I escorted a friend to have an abortion and got a brick upside my head, and the cops tried to charge me for trespassing lol.
ACAB every time"
Here's a way those protestors that have all that time on their hands can help. Go adopt a child and raise them in a home instead of the states foster system.
Shame on Her!  The God of Abraham...Isaac and Jacob...Our Great Creator...awaits this womans death bed...as she WILL STAND BEFORE YESHUA for sentencing for her Crimes against Humanity and YAHWEH'S Littlest Ones....!  One can already hear The Wailing and Knashing of Teeth....of those Crying Out in Unison from The Hub of Hell...in Punishment for ALL ETERNITIES......!
"Interesting that the rainbow makes its appearance in umbrellas, jackets ect.."
"In my city there is always a line of people yell at the patients just like this. The really sick part of this is that no more than six walking distance blocks from this clinic is a place called Home of the Innocence. This place takes care of the children that people didn't want, couldn't afford and or horribly abused. It is a hold over spot until foster homes can be found for them. Unfortunately most of the kids have returned again and again. Many rarely find a foster parent because of behavior problems or handicap. It angers me that the protesters are wasting time doing something useless instead of at least being an advocate for these kids that are already breathing."
Way to go Joe! Abortion is wrong.  You baby killers deserve the death penalty
Choosing to end a life because they're to be a burden... why not just make responsible life choices so as to not have to make that choice ..
Absolutely creepy these old men
"Everyone should meet a Joel...bless his heart....Dr. recommend terminating 
..Catholic Christian church thought otherwise...
He as lived in a crib +33 years and counting...mumbles wears & diapers..he has never walked a step in his whole life.
And no support from the church or state or the repukes...Total Misery. Thanks Supreme Court. Now ya all get ready for your slavery....
At least the mother had a choice. She choose life. Thank you Jesus.
My wife had two miss carriages...then medical doctor recommended for her age not to try. 
Boom tubes tied. It wasn't meant to be. I can imagine now how big brother is now going to get in people's lives.  All because they never walked in other people's shoes. So send Joel some money. Help him...
But all you hear is the cricket chirp..."
People should fix themselves before they do stuff.  These people are lunatics.  Vanity is the real problem.
"Like they said these lunatics sometimes shoot up clinics to kill people. Yet they claim they are for life. Such hypocrisy. They stand there all day on their high moral horse yelling at people. Maybe if you want to actually save lives, you can help the homeless or if you love kids so much like you claim become a foster parent or adopt. But why do any of that when you can stand all day yelling at people going through an already difficult situation.  These insane weirdos are trying to take over this country just remember that when it comes time to vote. We can not be ruled by these religious creeps."
Mostly guys. Idiotic ones.
People need to get a life and stop bothering in other people's business.
This woman is awesome.  Much respect to her dealings with and exposing these religious weirdos. Please be safe.
These are the same people that complain about to have to pay taxes to take care of foster children feeding and clothing them but yet they don't tell men to go get a vasectomy
My SIL HAD to terminate her pregnancy because they found out the baby had no heartbeat. So in that case what is she supposed to do? Of course she and her husband was devastated but it was necessary. BTW...they named her Moana and she would've been my BIL's first daughter 😢😓 Kudos Shelley👌👍
"How is it not illegal to harass patients outside of a medical facility? Sure, you have the right to protest ... if you obtain the proper permits. If someone started screaming and yelling outside a local hospital, the cops would apprehend them in minutes!"
Jehovah God has given us free will. We all choose to obey Jehovah's rules on the sanctity of life or we choose to live by our own standards. We all answer for our life decisions.
Maybe this moron should devote as much time to the needy children of America. Another Republican who is opposed to abortion who won't tell government to support young families or give proper paid leave to mothers and parents. Only big business have lobbies to get them tax dollars.
Oh man! I would start asking for CASH ASAP! 😂😂😂😂
How can you be pro life and kill those who are pro choice? Seems contradicting to me. Smh 🤦‍♀️
"The constitution doesn't GIVE us rights. It only prohibits the government from violating them. These rights are natural rights that you have from being a human. No one can legally take them away since they aren't given by law. They are not a legal right, but certain unalienable Rights given by their Creator."
"These hypocrites are so disgusting. Once born, they couldn't care less if the baby starves to death or gets sexually molested. It's ALL about feeling self righteous. It's all about pure selfishness."
When the men show up that's it.  Having some man tell me what to do with my body (i.e. the supreme court) is just looking for a fight (and I mean a fight).
"God doesn't force us, what business do you have then to try and force your opinion. Yes, opinion!"
"All these pro lifers are only interested in their feelings of ego driven righteousness until the babies are born....then they can justify ignoring their existence because it’s the mothers problem then and they have zero responsibility after that point, so much for their caring of life, it stops once breath is drawn.  Men should have no voice in this, no uterus, no say."
"Wow, this is just insane."
"Old men doing the screaming!  I would bet just one labour pain would bring them to their knees but they want a raped pregnant 12 year old or younger to endure a pregnancy and  full labour, terrified and screaming in pain.  They could do their bit by promoting vasectomies or better yet castration of known rapists and pedophiles now that would be worth protesting and screaming about.  Abortion has been around since men figured out what was between their legs and women as always have to take care of the end results, wanted or unwanted, banning it will change nothing, as history has shown, just more women will die from unsafe methods to have control over their bodies."
"Although I don’t agree , I can see how females believe in  pro life , but the men who get involved is very creepy and disturbing ."
Killing babies...sick
How do they not see that “deadly violence” at abortion clinics doesn’t make you pro life? How can you be so blind?
“Is that enough of feeling really self righteous this morning?” Perfect!
Dan can go protest outside Congress and let them change gun laws that kills 5 and 6 year olds at school.

Thank you Donald Trump for appointing smart judges!!
The body of a woman and the unborn etc belongs to God not people. Just as premarital sex is a sin! Therefore abortion is usually a result because of premarital sex is most definitely a sin. 
Gay, Transgender lifestyles are also a sin against God. Those that practice such and not ""REPENT"" will not inherit eternal life. instead...God tells us in his word, that those that practice such, and not ""REPENT"" will be separated for all eternity. The warning is real and not some game as many play with God's word as a game and are faithless."

"The American Taliban... the people who want to tell you what you can learn in school, who you can love and what control women have over their own bodies.  There is, unquestionably, a large segment of the American population who WANT their nation to be governed based on their extremist and warped views of the Bible... just like in Iran... just like in Afghanistan... just like in any other backwards theocracy that exists in the world today.

They aren't loving.  They aren't caring.  They aren't interested in your well-being.  They are monsters and they want to control you."
"Love this Clinic Escort, Shelly.   Be safe & keep up the good work."
Love the hypocrisy behind all that choose life talk when they want ro take away the choice.
"Freaks. Lazy activism. They choose the easiest, lowest intellect fight on the planet, where there is no voice in the matter from the unwanted child. This cause and these people are cowardly. They can choose a million other causes to truly save already-born kids, and they choose this. Lazy, lazy, lazy and fearful. Too chicken to show up to a true fight. In their last days, this realization will come back to them. They are doing Christianity all wrong."
Pure Evil 😈
"TAKE AWAY CHOICE FROM EVERYONE, INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO GIVE LIFE TO CHILDREN BY DONATING THEIR BLOOD OR ORGANS OR MARROW. CHOICE KILLS!!!"
"She’s great! So many women and men like her have put their own lives in danger since the 80s to keep women safe from harassment by the anti-abortion zealots in front of clinics. The anti-abortion movement terrorized women, providers and clinic staff. I remember the clinic bombings in the 80s and ‘90s and the hit lists of Doctors w/targets over their photos and all private info published (or doxxed in today’s terms), the assassinations of doctors, nurses, people who ran clinics. The anti-abortion movement was terrorized women. They don’t give a shit about ‘life’ or anything but the fetus… George Carlin was 100% right in his bit about right-to-lifers… The lives of women, and children - once out of the woman - their lives are nothing these zealots."
I wish someone had aborted them 😑
I wonder how many of these protesters have adopted children that were given up for adoption by mothers who can not take care of their babies.
Do they realize women go to these clinics who have already lost their baby?  And what their yelling does to moms who’ve already lost their baby?
"If you masturbate, your preventing life!  The tricky part about abortion is the line of when it is a baby!  
I find it ironic that pro lifers will hump to no end and contribute to over populating the world, but complain about abortion! 

It’s terrible when someone is raped and there is a baby on the way! Abortion for those should be legal! 
If you happen to be one of those who has say more than 3 to 4 kids, you are killing lives just as much as those who have abortions! The difference is your doing it slower! You are contributing to over population, starvation, crime, and disease! 

Those who have abortions just because they don’t want to have a baby are just as responsible for deaths! Many people would love to adopt your baby! 

Rape, young minors, and risk of death to the mother all should qualify for abortions no exceptions!"
Love her! (Why are there men trying to tell women about pregnancy? They've never even had a period!)
"Where are all these prolifers when the foster kids are abused? Where is their money to help these children who are unable to eat a decent meal? Where is all of their protests to help the kids that are living on the streets? Oh they don't care about them babies after they have been pushed out! Especially to those kids who may not look like them. Which one of them is helping? Who set up their homes to accomodate someone in foster care? Neither one of those fake Christians, I bet."
Also you idiots out there protesting if God wants a child to be born it's going to be born I don't care whether she goes to a abortion clinic or not God has things planned out when you're circumventing or trying to circumvent what God does you're just as f***** up as they are you just you don't get it you're out there for religious purposes obviously well I grew up Pentecostal I know that my God my savior Christ everything's planned out already so you being there is not going to do a damn thing other than bring a child into the world that's not going to have a decent life so you should be taking care of that child
If you're out there protesting you should be willing to pay for the child. Because do you really want that person that wanted to abort that child to have that child? If you do you're f***** up in the brain yes I said f***** up in the brain because no that kid is either going to be abused or beaten it's not going to turn out good in any way shape or form I believe that the US supreme Court should pay for the children in other words the Congress should make each individual judge pay for each child out there that cannot be aborted by the mother before it's born. And anyone protesting they should have to pay for the ones they're protesting against if a woman is walking into that abortion or clinic that provides abortions those outside should be held responsible for that child 100%
"Imposing your beliefs (often) based on your personal religion onto another person. Land of the ""free"" my a*s..."

This makes me want to work at a abortion clinic LOL. I would love that job. I would make fun of those fucking protesters all day it would be amazing 🤩
"_Movement_ is the right word. Specifically, bowel movement."
Bravo to her 👏 🙌 👍 👌 ❤ 👏👏👏
Keep up the good work. God bless the anti abortion people out there protesting.
Shelley you are the very dearie! Thank you so much for your work!
"All actions have consequences. To be clear, people have the right to choose. However, if you choose to kill, you will suffer the consequences of that action. The question people need to consider: Is one moment of convenience worth that consequence? Furthermore, if you act on your right to choose to do something, others should have the right to act on their choice to prevent you from doing it or act on their right to choose to punish you for doing it. 

This is why we have laws and why those laws should reflect the highest moral standards of the society they serve. A law that simply protects a right to choose is not moral as morality is something that can be chosen. We can choose to follow the laws, we can choose to be moral, these choices can be arbitrary but like all choices, acting on them have consequences. An arbitrary law will not be just and by default becomes immoral. Law and morality need to be absolute to promote order and deliver justice, without absolute laws and morality, we will have chaos and injustice.

Abortion is not moral because it is both an action and a choice to commit that action. Abortion is in fact immoral because morality will determine that an unborn baby has the right to live just as you or I have the right to live. Therefore If a law protects that choice then the law becomes unjust and ultimately immoral.

This is a bit of logic wordplay and I hope it promotes some critical thought. Feel free to choose to listen to it, or not; but your choice will not change morality no matter how much you seek to justify your actions"
Notice the vocal ones are old white men!
"@CNN Why don’t you link to the TikTok 
Give the creator her credit!
I bet she would like the bump in views"
"Wow. A patient escort willing to put herself in harms way to protect women in crisis from cruel, terrible, vicious, ignorant bullies. Props to her. Really … respect."
"Notice how she said ""her right to CHOOSE life"""
As a rape baby myself I fully support a womans right to choose. My mother was raped when she was 14. I was born when she turned 15. This was in the south in 1972. So she was basically blamed for the rape. She she couldn't go to school. She was harassed. Disowned by half the family because they were all southern baptists. Had she had and abortion I wouldn't have given a shit because I was just a zygote at the time and it wouldn't matter. Her life would have turned out better with the abortion. Anti abortionists think that everyone should have to born into this madness we call the human race. They all seem to be ok with lies and murder and hate and war and on and on. You really want to bring children into this rat race? Anti abortionists are sadistic fuckers to say the least. Knowing then what I know now I would never have brought children into this world.
I bet not a one of them votes for policies that take care of the kids or their mothers. Liars. All liars.
"I wish these pro-lifers (but they really aren't) would just get out of other people's lives. The patient didn't just fall off the back of a truck, in front of an abortion clinic, and say, ""Well, while I'm here I think I'll have an abortion."" Ignorant, self-righteous morons is what these people are. Did the female protester act like she was a little too medicated? There's relaxed and then there's medically induced coma."
"Hmmmm what about black and babies?  Oh , yeah, those babies don't matter.  It's beyond insane white men pontificating on on women's healhcare which they know nothing they know about."
Anti abortion protesters… ONCE THIS CHILD IS BORN.. I NEED YOUR FINANCIAL AND EMOTIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.. is that being offered to these mothers and unborn children??
"These procedures should be done in hospitals, like in most places in the world, where the annonymouty of everyone involved is guaranteed. It's almost as if they've created these clinics so that people can be targeted."
"These people are literally disgusting. Not only is what people do with their bodies none of their business, they do not even try to understand the other side of the story. Instead, they just cover their ears, scream ""abortion bad,"" try to make it look like they care by saying something vague about the Bible, and make it everybody's problem. I'm not saying the First Amendment should be rolled back, but there is no excuse for there being this many people with views that are just factually inaccurate. America needs to try harder to educate its people on human biology, religion, and most importantly, the basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution. No more denying science. No more backing up nonexistent claims with ""faith."" No more picking and choosing when someone does or does not have rights. You cannot protest reality."
this ladys screen name is the deathscorts... thats disgusting
"I love how these so called pro life people like to talk about choice too like you can choose life not murder yet they are really just pro birth and don’t care about the kid after the fact they just want the woman to have the baby period with no other choice, we just want the body autonomy to be able to do whatever we want with our body, no one is saying to do one or the other, we just want the choice to be able to do what’s right for us

Those creepy people really referring to people they don’t know by mom and saying those things like that’s just really creepy and seems like they have mental problems"
everyone born of god overcomes the world. this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith.
Religion is a cancer on society.
"I want to know how many of these protesters are also involved in our foster care system, how many have adopted children, how many would be willing to give money or even do volunteer babysitting for these women??? If not then they can STFU and let these women make their own decisions. If she doesn’t/ can’t be a mom weather medical or by choice, she shouldn’t be made to, that’s why you have people who shouldn’t have children, have children, then when children have horrible upbringings no one wants to help the mother with her “blessings”."
The Lady coming up to them is actually the one who feels self righteous. She is a hypocrite. Just calling like I see it.
I have no answer for these ignorant BASTARdS
Abortion is murder. 1A.
I volunteered at a clinic while pregnant with my daughter and an anti-abortion protested threatened to follow me home and stab me to death. I was visibly pregnant. The Catholic priest beside him did not intervene.
"Yes women are dying 
Are they not people 
Think"
"People get killed by those who unjustly accuse others 
Not knowing what Äonen go through"
"If this clinic was in a ghetto, would those people be protesting there?"
I want to know what anti-abortion protestors thoughts are on rape and incestuos abuse? Oh and also fetus's that are already dead in the womb or mom who will die if they carry to term?
You have no idea what women go through
From one Shelley to another. Thank you!!
"Prolife, but they are ok with weapons that slaughter our children? It makes purrrrfect sense!"
"The woman yelling that ""we are here to help"" notice she doesn't offer to adopt the baby."
These women are real American hero's saving real Americans everyday.
Why is it you'll never see these protesters outside a urologists office that performs vasectomies?
"so, simple: the protestors are fearing God because of their own sins, and now they want to get points on other sinners expense.

the horror of religion."
These people need to mind their own business and stop brining God into their nonsense: God gave mankind the right to choose these nuts are trying to take that away. That behavior is not of God they need to look at their own sinful and flawed lives

they want help and they are going to place to seek it you don't need to yell at them and call them mom...  which is not their name... and yell we can help you!!    EVERYONE MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!!!!! my brother died at age 21 of heart difficulties that were totally preventable but he couldn't afford the operation and wasn't eligible for medicare........       tell me how you can help me???????????   TELL ME HOW YOU CAN HELP ME!!!!!
It is not anyone's responsibility to interfere themselves into others lives. I always flip these people off at the clinic in my town & yell fuck off out the window. They're unsufferable.
"The sanctimonious man at the beginning is most probably the type who would pay the monks to bury him in the monastery or the church floorboard to improve his chance of absolution.

"So much for ""pro-life"" eh? These religious nut jobs are violent and hateful. #mybodymychoice"
"""Their right to choose life"" - the key words there are ""right"" and ""choose"".
They fundamentally do not believe in women's rights, specifically, they do not believe in their rights to choose to continue or to terminate the pregnancy. 
This is not a war on abortion - its a war on women."
50 usd?! You're sh*tting me?!
The reason you can't claim an unborn child is because the Government says it's not a person. Read that again.

Let's go Brandon
I had an abortion at 19. I was 4 weeks and 2 days pregnant. I took that walk. I was screamed at and called horrible names. I love that this is in place for girls and women who are making sometimes the hardest decision of their life. This is what I consider God’s work ❤️
"They should be wanting forced vasectomies for men...oh, wait you say they wouldn't want that?"
"I just happened to walk by a Women's center that I didn't even realize was there and all of a sudden like 5 people were all talking to me at once and it took a minute to figure out wtf was happening... they were all like ""Do you need help?"" ""You don't have to do this!"" ""What's your name?"" ... and I was just walking down the street. I understand offering help, and even trying to share your perspective... but at a certain point it can feel like bullying. I've gone to get free birth control, regular std testing, and even a pregnancy test and ultrasound at a women's center and it's always assumed that you're there for an abortion and it's just a baby killing factory 🤦‍♀️"
Well that makes perfect sense claim prolife but murder someone ffs
What a SHAME AlL of these people's parents DIDN'T BELIEVE in ABORTION ..we would not be having this discussion ..there is still time if YOU ARE so SET on ABORTION GO  FOR IT ..  YOUR NOT TO OLD YOU CAN DO IT ..  NO AGE  ABORTION ..👍👍👍👍👍
These Maniacs will soon be  running our country. And the democrats are asleep at the wheel .
DiD you see the FBI Finally Found ASHLEY BIDEN Diary she was being MOLESTED BY JOE BIDEN was taking Shower with her .. look it up
IT was never a constitutional right TO KILL  A CHILD ..back in the day woman and children were sacred ..now shoot them EVERY day !! Sick society ..💩for BRAIN'S ..
Are those individuals that are protesting going to adopt the babies and supply money to those individuals that will need help?
Look up planned Parenthood selling baby body parts hidden camera video YouTube ..!! That's why they want you to wait till 15 weeks when the CHILD can live outside of the mother .! Or at birth !!  Use a condom WTF sick MF s
"""Only in America"""
Where DO you GET a PROTEST SIGN SAYS I'm a baby killer ..!?? I guess she is FOR SCHOOL Shootings TO .?? ABORTION AT BIRTH .. ugly BABY 👎 ..make me sick not HUMAN ..
If a women has problems during pregnancy does the doctor give her a Bible or medical attention in the anti abortion slave states?
"Just don’t have sex how hard is that?
Oh rape or incest? Abortion is legal for that in every state."
"God bless these people taking time out of their lives to try to save a child, and stop the psychological injury to the mother. The hateful pro-death side will only understand once it's too late for them."
"Anyone notice how it mostly men protesting? All of them, especially the men, need to mind their own business."
"At 0:47 the women said, “Right to choose...”. Does she even hear herself?"
Yet its the liberals that are attacking the pregnancy pro life centers after Roe v wade was overturned.
She's a wacko!
"Someone needs to stand out there with listing the names of real babies who died at their mothers or loved ones hands. Anti-Abortion don't want to admit what happens to unwanted babies, when our legal system is full of examples of them."
Hypocrite and fake
The compassion that the escorts show to the clients has me in tears right now. It's the same compassion that Jesus would show them. The entitlement and self righteousness of the protesters makes me feel ill.
What a magnificent woman you are Shelley!
They not protesting in front of police stations to stop killing people.
They don't care about people after they're born.
"Somehow I can’t imagine Jesus standing outside the clinic shouting at people.
As for the people shouting about abortions - why aren’t they expending that energy on protecting kids who are ALIVE already & being abused!?"
"We will help you, just don’t ask for any assistance, guidance, after your first breath you are on your own, we have prison space for you or send you to war when you turn 18!!!"
"As a Canadian, I can't understand that.  All that because people beliieve in an imaginary friend in the sky?"
"Those people don't care about life. Do they visit the nearby orphanages or group homes for families without food or money? No, they're too busy trying to take another person's rights away. 🖕😡"
🤔 I hope these people have mercy when some of the children their trying to save get abused the rest of their lives . Yes some people don't deserve children .I think suicide and child abuse statistics are going to go up if abortion is banned everywhere 😢
Asolutely right to choose LIFE?  How aout their right to choose a aortio?
Those protesters are demented religious freaks!!
"This lady is employing a tactic that I think works! These creeps hope you won't engage them one on one. 
Zebras use their STRIPES to confuse a predator. These morons that love to protest as ""part of a crowd"" can be taken down by a smart predator that focuses on ONE target at a time. 🤣"
Good for her. Put these people on blast. They're human garbage for trying to deny women their bodily autonomy.
"abortion is bad, why are people supporting baby killing...sounds wrong."
"What a sick individual Shelly is, this is insane."
"0:41 Keyword in that sentence being ""CHOOSE""!"
Do they ever protest in front of churches about the number of spontaneous abortions that are part of 'god's' big scheme ?
Guess how many kids this “activist” never had
"They'll regulate a uterus to stop babies from dying, but won't regulate guns, and they will happily send these children to their death in an overseas war for nonsense."
I dare her to have a debate with Lila Rose or Ben Shapiro I bet she would lose that debate quickly!
"A little disingenuous about the assault part. If you watch the actual full length video they're both pushing and shoving each other. He is charged because he escalates it. Hence why the charge was ""by mutual consent"" meaning he was able to prove both sides were combative. He essentially the got the equivalent of a bad traffic ticket. Its a violation level offense."
These crazy people are lonely and have no life or purpose of their own  so they find purpose encroaching on other people’s lives and decisions
They are terrorists. That’s not simple protest.   Spend your time volunteering in a daycare or something that is actually helpful.
WHY DON'T YOU HELP THE CHILDREN WE HAVE ALREADY!!!
if they care for children why not become Froster care parents do something nice not hatful and ugly
It’s always people no one would have sex with who advocate for abortion.
I saw that before here In Boston. They were standing outside with signs saying that they would give money to women if they went through their pregnancy and gave their babies to them. Very awkward.
"The vast majority of women going there are like, ""I just came here for a Pap smear, dumbass!!"""
Take the L Libs. Looool
Prove any god exists or stfu.
anti-abortion people killing in the name of life????? What a contradiction
"If you want to help children, you volunteer at a family shelter. If you want to harass women, you stand outside a clinic and yell at them. We know exactly what these creeps really care about."
Ya'll really acting like this is worse than the pro-choicers rioting?
"I Love that woman - Shelley.
I really appreciate the Gutless Selfish crap she has to put up, and I REALLY would like to join her.
I Wish this to be a HUGE WRITTEN HUG, and THANK YOU, for what she does.
I'm proud of her.
I'm Sorry THAT'S even a job.
I'm Disgusted with the selfish protesters, who make it one, 
And, To the WOMEN, who even Have to make to Make that choice, In really sorry You have to endure those WORTHLESS, SELFISH IDIOTS on the Street, who obviously DON'T CARE ABOUT PEOPLE, and, who REALLY should get A NEW hobby.
Thank you Shelley."
The SC overturning of Roe V Wade is a most cruel decision against women in America. After trumps' election this is the second dark day in current American history. America is finally becoming a Roman Catholic Jihadist State. Women are now controlled in their choices. The Roman Catholic Jihadist SC will next go after the LGBTQIA+ community!
These people are evil. These people are scum. Abortion is a big decision and people making that decision don't need the experience to be any more traumatic than it already is. It sickens me. It makes me so sad and angry.
The look on their face when I speed into the parking lot... Gets me everytime
"It was awful to walk through the doors of  the clinic, writhing in pain from an ectopic pregnancy (the hospital would not preform my abortion), and listen to those people yell at me about the embryo that was rupturing my insides, while having no idea I had a breastfeeding 6mo at home. These people have no idea what damage they are doing to the mental health of women that they do not know."
People have a right to protest
All this just to keep kill these unborn babies
"The 11 people killed can not be condoned. Here's a question.... how many women have died because of abortions, and how many babies have been killed because of abortions."
Well if God sends you the gift of a child through a rapist or incest who are you to question it. These religious types are truly mindless cult zombies. Gods quite the a-hole.
"that doctors nerves are shot, hope he can keep a steady hand while performing abortions"
"And yet.... their f Bible says its ok for Abortion, Living Being becomes at first breath, God ok with taking Fetuses etc.....
Like their literally Quotations.

This is called Religious Zealotry where they think they know everything about Bible and saying they obey it and still doing the opposite what the Bible says or Radicalsl Talibanism"
"""I always keep them in my prayers"" while yelling and telling them they're going to hell 🤦‍♀️"
"This first aired over the winter, didn't it? I seem to recall seeing this before, and it got harder to watch."
"ADOPT AND FOSTER UNWANTED KIDS, FINANCE THEM, SEND THEM TO COLLEGE"
"Protestors would bomb an abortion center and kill doctors bc they ""care about life."" Makes perfect sense. 🤔🤨
And they claim to be religiously ""pro-life,"" just not your life if you decide to have an abortion or support it. Hypocrites are the worst."
"God bless these pro-baby advocates trying to save babies. This woman is evil, ignorant and despicable."
The US are fucked up !
"Just the sight of those elderly white men and their dehydrated faces urging this thing on young women is enraging-- I wonder what those twerps have in their past as adolescent guys feeling their oats, and if they're so worried I wonder why they don't go to work on the young men of this country where they might have something useful to say.  But to women they've got nothing useful to say."
Nothing like pro-lifers taking a life for their cause.
She's the grim reaper..
"i swear i've seen this story b4, similar footage. must be a rebroadcast. plz do new reporting on the ground pls CNN"
"It's very sad what the Supreme Court has done. We must VOTE!!!! I know it sounds like a broken record but it's the ONLY THING WE CAN DO... We can protest, we can write letters, post on social media, even get mad, fight ect.... none of it will do any good!!! Remember in November"
"The conversation about abortion has became so basic that it frustrates me…pro life vs pro choose…the main conversation is how to deal with a consequence instead of discussing the cause or like debating what type of cast is best for a patient without knowing which bone in your body is broken or if there is actually an injury at all…
How about we talk more about prevention, about the equal responsibility that both members of a relationship have in terms of contraception, because even in 2022 there are many men who still believe that the woman is the sole responsible for preventing a pregnancy and there is still many women who agree with that or simply comply. 
We need to talk about how can we really help and support pregnant women who are going through financial difficulties, family problems; expectant mothers who don’t have a proper support system and need a hand and better opportunities for her and her baby.
We need to talk more about how an abortion is not a solution or a contraceptive; we need to talk about the physical, emotional and mental scars that an abortion leaves. The chances of infertility, the chances of having a miscarriage later on when you decide to have a kid, the guilt that sometimes last a lifetime, the pain you feel when you see your kids and realize that there was actually a person inside of you and how horrible you could feel for denying your baby the possibility to live. 
The regret that could overwhelm you.
We need to talk more about how to give a better care for the children who enter into the foster system.
But beside talking we need ACTION! Abortion is being sold as the perfect solution for an unexpected pregnancy, but is simply a distraction that is preventing us the possibility to really look for the root of the issues that many pregnant women are facing today."
To be a Christian is to wake up grumpy.
It's like all the crackheads who want to talk to you at the bus stop gathered in one place.
She's way too kind with these waste of oxygen and their demented ideas
I wish some of these protesters offering to “help” these women were throwing themselves into helping mothers and babies AFTER birth.
#RoeVsWade
‘Pro Life’ is an oxymoron nowadays.
The US looked at Taliban and decided that religion influencing lawmaking was awesome…
"Your book of ancient myths is Pro-Abortion, fundies.
Numbers 5:11-31. Look it up!"
The mother is the only one that can make the decision
How psihopats you need to be to be a lookout for a murdering entity! And you do it with a straite face!
I could tell that god give people free will with a reason and don’t discriminate as long the person didn’t commit sin. I don’t take anyone side but I will respect someone willing of having a child unless it a victim. I don’t get why people protesting to congress instead of blaming someone in the Mississippi who started this situation to begin with
Shelley Mann in the clips is so condescending and passive aggressive she really seems like women which is annoying to be around she should seems like a jerk. And Dan the protester seems just like a good person with regrets and trying to do what's right in contrast to her and in general the protesters seem like nice people that she is trying to provoke to do things that look bad on TikTok for her own self image.
And some Americans often wonder why they aren't able to keep up with the science and technology of the rest of the world.
"I Am So So Grateful that Abortion laws were over turned, Let's save as many babies as we can, God Is Good and smiling down, on all the lives that will be saved, and not torn apart and thrown away like trash."
The leaf blower is a great idea. Drown out their rhetoric with loud lawn care equipment.
I take paint ball guns twice a year a blast away it's not much but it's what I do
AR done these clowns
A bomb? Pro-life 🤣 kill real humans and the parasite inside. Awesome
Kick the ladder under him. It be hilarious. These people need to get a job and mind their own business. You know these people have skeletons in the closet that shouldn’t see the light of day.
"Also, I have to add that some of the pro “choice” people are arguing that abortion should be kept legal for mothers who might be hurt by complications. This is the 21st century. The % of people that will be hurt is so small. Also they argue about rape. Easy solution. Carry the baby for nine months then drop it off at a fire station. And for all the other people who have an unwanted pregnancy. You’ll have to listen close. Are you ready for the amazing secret. DON’T HAVE SEX!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Okay. I’ll give them this. If they want to be  able to murder innocent babies in privacy, they have a right to do so. But then that means that I can murder someone in privacy and get away with it…😬"
I don't regret my abortion at all
People are so weird man. Why would they sit out there like this. They have no life!!! I’m sure an abortion is scary as is. I wonder how many children Dan has adopted
She's a hero.
"So pro-life that they murder doctors and nurses??!? What sick fucks. Sorry dude but I’m sure you’re going straight to hell with those choices you have “guilt” over. Oh yea take away woman rights and judge her choices, Im sure god will let that slide buddy! These prolife people are pathetic"
"Looks like women have lost a lot of independence on the eve of their ""Independence"" July 4th Day"
"If I fell pregnant and couldn’t get access to an abortion, I’m going to harm myself. If I fail to miscarry I’m jumping in front of a train. I refuse to give birth. I’m NOT a parent."
"Christo-Fascists. 
Followers of the Apostle Paul, and the Old Testament, not Jesus. 

This inspires me to go to the local Planned Parenthood and get in some faces."
Ask them if they are willing to pay for this child's upbringing.
Imagine a world in which people would mind their own business. Wouldn't it be great?
"Praying for someone doesn’t provide housing, daycare ,groceries…"
So when they r born who's gonna take care of them..there should be better family planning laws for both men n women..strict rules for father's and mothers..this could prevent unwanted pregnancies n sometimes a cheating husband wants the side woman to abort n if she doesn't abort he murder her..so much to say about this topic
They should have a Sprinter van to pick up the patient somewhere nearby prep them for an anonymous arrival without  abuse and harassment - basically get them into a little covered wheelchair type thing with a VR headset and noise cancelling headphones then you can just roll them right by all those awful! people
These male protesters are a special kind of delusional
How to become a patient scort like you !! That's a way to help!!
"Pro lifer - ""Save the children and stop abortion. Life is sacred!""

Also Pro lifer - *attempts to kill the pregnant women by bombing abortion clinics or shooting them*"
Thank you for helping women through a very difficult time in their lives .
"Meanwhile in New Zealand, we passed a bill (voted in by the majority of liberals, conservatives and libertarians) that states an abortion clinic can set up a safe zone of up to 150 meters. Protestors that violate the safe zone can be fined up $1000."
The 73 year old man is my hero. I wanna be brave like him. 🙌🏾
Your maker murdered all but 8 people...including pregnant women and babies...
"Our security team was tasked to do this once. It was myself, a big Jamaican dude and this small Italian guy. The Italian guy was the voice of the group, he loved yelling at people. We had multiple police calls against us for bouncing people off the property. Eventually the cops got involved and told people to stay from the clinic otherwise they'd be arrested."
cleaning up the trash lol
I LOVE her!
why dont they build a wall .
🙏🙏
"So sick of women with their selfish idea that somehow they have the right to murder babies, the degenerate 1960's really screwed up the minds of many, it should have never been permitted...!!!"
These people need to stay in their OWN LANE FFS 🤦‍♀️ EVIL PEOPLE BUTT OF THE PRIVATE AND HARD TIME OF A STRANGER LIFE THAT HAS NO CONCERN OF YOURS YOU INTERFERING OVERBEARING UNINFORMED STRANGERS
I'm confused. They are trying to save the unborn child but they have no problem killing the caregivers or blowing up the building. Somehow that doesn't compute to me!
US is a really weird place... they seem to be pro life... but in reality their guns kill more people... and instead of regulating guns they put anti-abortion laws. If you want proof that some people don't understand logic... well... there you have it.
And they are punk men.
These morons need to do something useful like getting guns off the street...
Over a million children in foster and people are against abortion. Go adopt children if you want to help.
"Mind your own business, keep your religion off of my civil liberties...."
"Prayers.. Nice gesture but you're seriously gonna try offering me B when i explicitly need A and then say I'm the problem for refusing your ""help"". Children can't eat prayers, they can't wear prayers, or sleep on prayers. Tangible assistance people."
I. Love.Her 💪🏾
"Overturned Roe vs Wade. Politicians beware. Married or not Politician’s can no longer force your Mistress’s into having a abortion. Yes. I encourage all Mistress’s to run straight to Fox 6 news name your unborn child’s father. You will need to do this to ensure your child will have financial support that most children are not afforded today. That’s the only choice the Mistress will have. The wife better not be mad accept her husband’s untrustworthy ways with pride. Did I say Pride? LGBTQ will be next, so all the closet politicians can stay in the closet, and that’s not fair. Americans can’t wait to see if the closet politicians will be yanked out of the closet and that’s not fair either. Politician’s voted to take away a person’s choice to choose. What’s next?"
Shelley your a symbol of freedom 🇺🇸
"Hahahaha they want to help! Great! Take the baby home with you and give that woman no responsibilities! OH YOU DONT WANT TOO! Then GTFO there. Christians, stop judging people you go to hell for that too!"
"That's a real stand-up Christian right there, assaulting a woman at her place of business. These anti-choice protesters are the worst kind of human beings. They want to be self-righteous while telling other people when they should or shouldn't have a baby. That's none of their damn business.

How many of those protesters have adopted children already? How many will vote for Representatives that will provide for health care for all Americans? How many support Medicaid, WIC, maternal and paternal paid time off work after the baby's born, or financial assistance to those who need it during pregnancy and immediately after delivery? My best guess is none of them."
"Anti abortionists should show they can take care of a child first before they have one, governmentally speaking. Where are the support services for children in this country? at the bottom of the pile globally"
"Those protesters are the same people that vote for Republicans who support access to military grade weapons that murder school children. 
They care more about their supposed gun rights then they do about human lives. None of them are part of a well-regulated militia; so, the Constitution does not protect their rights to have AR-15s. 
I am not against having guns for hunting or for home protection, but nobody should have in military grade weapon of murder that scares police from actually responding to a school shooting."
Hes NOT A BABY KILLER LIKE U ARE LRAVE HIM ALONE. HES YELLING AT BABY KILLERS
Why are all the protesters old asf!?
"Lol its so funny she has treat them like children, because they are 🤣"
Another baby killer. No difference between abortion and shooting school children.
"Well I think that's harassment, making that decision is hard enough, that man in the video really needs to think about what will HE tell his maker about HIS behavior"
Feeble minded people pray to their invisible God every day. Enlightened people realize we are God grown outta the universe. We are the universe observing itself. An embryo is nothing more than a seed it doesn't know life or death. We practice population control in all species right down to bugs and viruses. Go to any farm u quickly realize life is very messy and involves death. We are no different. Feeble minded need a crutch cause they feel hostile toward the environment around them. They are filled with guilt and shame cause they can't live up to Jesus. They are also filled with pride and judgement of others not like them. They assume their view of the universe is correct wen in reality no1 knows. The realy bad zealots tend to speak their God's will and use actions against others in an attempt to feel better about themselves while reaffirming their beliefs. It's the USA tho freedom of religion hence choice is the American way
"Bless this woman, she is amazing!!! Thank you so much to this fabulous woman"
"Well, when these pro-lifers/God impersonators show up to their Maker, I think they will be surprised. And not in a good way."
Let us help you? How? Prolifers are contemptuous of the mother and the unborn
Wow so these pro-lifers actually don’t like people and decide it’s best to kill them.
I think women are being violated and having their lives taken away from them by the prolife movement.
It sounds like old men yelling at their mom....LOL the leaf blower. That would be me out there with a leaf blower.
Thanks for doing this critical work to support our freedom.
"Dan: When I meet my maker, I hope he has a lot of mercy.
GOD: Are you aware that the bible that I provided you does not mention abortion? My son also does not speak of such."
"No, you don't need to walk out there and protest, you are not helping anyone, you are not pro-life because you are not protecting that life for the entirety. You are just trying to force your own conscience onto someone else without having ANY idea why they are there, what they are doing, what they are facing. In short, stay home and stop making something that is already difficult enough even harder. 

Also, do you idiots not see the hypocrisy of carrying pro-life signs while threatening people with murder and violence. Even your own faith tells you not to judge and yet here you are, playing god and laying down judgements. Even your imaginary sky daddy is ashamed of you."
"Abortion is illegal in many European countries, and they seem to do just fine!!"
How many children have they adopted? Realize u won’t get a baby. States keep kids in the agency. A kid spent life in foster care..17 foster homes. They r kicked out once they age out.
"You Americans Confuse rights with responsibilities A LOT. And the world LEARNS its views from YOU..
 Wake up and see that Sex is not a right. It's a responsibility. If you dont want a baby, think of that before you do it. If we all started realising this not only would we have less abortions all over this world... We'd have less rape and abuse too.."
"The truth is,it's not a single one of these people's buisiness what decisions people make"
Reproductive healthcare? These people aren't going to Planned Parenthood for healthcare of their reproductive organs. They're killing babies. But it sounds much nicer to say it the way leftist do.
"Since 1977, an average of half a million babies lost their lives every single year. The 11 who were killed as tragic as it is, pales in comparison. Oh the irony."
"Uhhg, God and monster nutbags."
We used to sing songs to drown out the protesters.
"It’s a woman’s choice , with hopefully a man’s support and consent as well"
"Look, when people stood up and took their party back by electing an outsider, you all endlessly criticized and attacked him and them.  When people tried to stand up  to the government through protest, you all cheered when the government deployed armed troops against them, and when a cop shot and killed an unarmed protestor you did not demand justice for her, but rather cheered your Dear Leaders.    So why act so hurt now that it's your turn?"
"It looks like these people just don’t have a life. 
They should be with their grandchildren or wife. 
Shame on those people for being weak for stalking a women at her hardest time in her life."
"It looks like these people just don’t have a life. 
They should be with their grandchildren or wife. 
Shame on those people for being weak for stalking a women at her hardest time in her life."
Where does harassment end and protesting begin ?
She a freakin' hero.
"🤡These clowns are so pro life that they’re using their time to foolishly shout at people rather than hell with the lives they say they want to protect. They should adopt, foster, coach, teach children if they love and appreciate them butttttt nooooo they shout at people that may just be picking up birth control or getting a Pap smear."
Do they have money to give to people? Are they going to adopt or foster this child?
A running generator would drown out a lot.  I wish a billionaire would take interest and throw some money at this issue.
Dan is an idiot what has he done in his life that gives him the right to chose for a women.... He's an old man with to much time on his hands ....
"Reasons Why Abortion Should Be Legal:
-Abuse
-Incest 
-Poverty
-Rape
Whether you agree or disagree with me as long as you are tolerant. For those who are against abortion rights for females. What if a female girl or woman was raped by some random violent teenage boy or man, what if she has no way to support her children because of poverty, what if she did not want to have children but her abusive boyfriend or her abusive husband forced her to give birth to a baby even if she is not ready to be a mother and what if she was raped by one of her male family members because it would be extremely disgraceful & disgusting to keep the baby of a rapist & a male relative which will traumatize the mother & especially the children. That is why I am pro-choice not pro-abortion and not anti-abortion but pro-choice period.
(Abort babies when they are a zygote)"
Stop histrionic forced birthers!
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe."
So only pro choicers who support abortion have the right to protest and destroy property at will.
They're actually trying to help guys
"How about supporting child tax credit, child care, medicare for all, universal healthcare. . . you know things that actually help children after they are born?"
Thank you for what you do!  You can’t imagine what you are providing!
"They are not PRO LIFE, they are PRO BIRTH.  It is between you & whoever you believe in.  NOBODY, NOBODY had a right to tell me what to do with MY body."
So we’re Singing her praises for killing babies?
The only reason to stop abortions was the Republicans are so afraid they will be replaced by black people  dont have a dam thing to do with life but the cowards
"They should embrace the GOP's support of BS ""Stand your ground"" laws and say they feared for their life whenever one of the crazies whacks them with a sign."
Bro chill those women need to do what they need to do none of our business that’s giving them some of a choice. There not even asking to help just to leave them alone
Where’s the help for the tens of millions of children going hungry right here in the USA !
The Christian Taliban
Provide headphones with music as they get out of the car.           Very brave young woman. Thank you for all that you do!
Those men should step up and have a voluntary vecectamy. Nip it at the bud
"Men control women's body is wrong, are men having them No! What if a decision to cut off your b.. is that right?"
Bless her
This abortion issue has never been and never will be about the actual health of the baby or mother or whatever this is about religious people trying to control others as they have done for centuries
"Yeah pro-life people killing isn't that a contradiction, why can't people just mind their own freaking business. :-) :-)"
Damn it’s already hard enough…and how does Damn know? Only p—-y he’s seen is mama’s.
"The women who are forced to give birth should give the baby to these anti-abortion people. If the anti-abortion folks are so self-righteous, they should help take care of these babies."
fat and ugly women disagrees with pro life who would of thought
That doctor is a stand up guy
My wife and I had to go through this. She was having an ectopic pregnancy terminated. We were told there was no chance the fetus could survive and continuing the pregnancy was not an option for her safety. At the time we had four children and she ran a daycare center. We certainly had room for one more.
Creeps
Baby killers are disgusting
"Not today, Larry 🖤"
"Pro lifers are hypocrites. Why are red states the worst out of 50 states for infant mortality or child hunger? By the way they yammer you’d think red states would be baby utopia’s but they’re not. They’re absolutely terrible in every metric. If they really cared they’d show it opposed to leaving terrible messages and protesting clinics. Laughable most are pro firearm and pro protecting property with deadly force. Also capital punishment. Yeah, really pro life right there. They’re hypocrites plain and simple."
Evil churches fund these demonstrators to cause trouble
"CNN: ""this woman is standing up to anti-abortion protestors by posting them on Tiktok""
Also CNN: ""LibsOfTikTok is dangerously doxxing liberals by sharing videos of them on Tiktok"""
They won't help anyone
"WOW, it was incredibly dumb to post video of that woman saying that anything that looks like a bomb gets the clinic shut down for the day. Now there will be boxes on the doorstep daily.  Sometimes you shouldn't tell the WHOLE story."
This is why religious freaks are the most dangerous. They are like cult. They believe they are above everything/ everyone. I can not name any other religion that tries this hard to dictate How everyone else’s life. Actually dangerous to modern state governing.
How ironic to try to kill or harm someone for doing a job which is protecting and supporting a woman’s difficult decision from harsh judgment shame or harm. There’s something really wrong with these protesters fr they could be helping at a homeless shelter or fostering children but instead they choose to shame and judge other humans the very thing the bible says not to do
"Abortion is murder, get over it.
There are dozen of contraception methods, so you simply have no excuse for being irresponsible."
"If you don't want a baby, abstain from intercourse, use 2 kinds of birth control or get sterilized.  Only 1.5% of ALL abortions are because of rape or incest!  That means 98.5% are because of IRRESPONSIBILITY!!!  Grow up and be responsible for your actions!
Yes, I got pregnant at 19, in 1974 and could have had an abortion, but DIDN'T!"
"Anyone who works in a clinic will tell you: the meanest, harshest thing you can do to an anti-abortion pain-in-the-ass protester, the thing which bugs them more than anything, which makes them have to work hard to avoid displaying their frustration, is to ignore them.  There is nothing you can say, nothing which you can do, which will frustrate them as much as if you ignore them."
You are so brave!!! Thank you for helping all women
How can you cite the being who commanded the murder of the first born of all Egypt as being anti abortion?
Wow ! what a job - escorting baby killers to the execution chamber. How brave & noble.
"Shouting we will help you?
How? Taking care of medical bills? Adopting children?
They are so self righteous that its disgusting to watch. They are so prolife that they are willing to KILL.🤬
Thanks to all escorts and workers that risk their lives every day in order to help those poor women."
"How brave the staff are against the deranged religious cultists. I remember working as a midwife in the US 30 years ago. One, wonderful, back up physician had to have 24 hour security as he was the only obgyn who would, humanely, terminate a pregnancy when it was needed, saving many women's lives, and putting his own in jeopardy. My colleagues birth centre was 'bombed' by a christian psychiatric case, ( thankfully no one was in the building or in labour at the time). The reason he destroyed her birth centre? Her back up obgyn was the brilliant Dutch Dr who supported a woman's right to choose, whether to have a child, whether to give birth in a hospital (with most US doctors sabotaging labour to make as much money as possible) or a natural birth centre, with trained midwives. I lasted 2 years before returning to the UK. The horrors I saw there made me realise the dangers facing normal, intelligent, compassionate people against dangerous religious fanatics. My colleagues birth centre had volunteers help rebuild it but the expectant moms had to either have their babies at home or at another birthing centre in the interim. The attack affected her livelihood as many women felt too frightened to then have their babies at her beautiful birth centre after that. Yet abortions never take place at a birthing centres. Pregnancies end because a baby is born!!! So this crazy man could easily have killed a new mother and her baby as well as the professionals and other staff. It was an eye opening experience to say the least. Returning to Europe was like returning to heaven after 2 years in American fundamentalist hell."
Men!!!
She is a very brave women.   We need more like her. Those people  would make a way bigger difference if they put down their signs and volunteered  their time to children and families who are already here and need their help.
Shelley Mann looks hideous. She doesn't have to worry about needing an abortion. Lol.
Brave lady.
"That escort is great!  Love when she says, ""Nobody asked you.""  LOL"
how about having an underground parking lot? lol
Thank you Shelly for your strength!
"Ask these same religious self righteous hypocrites about the lives of children coming across the border, about wars killing dozens of children everyday, or even underage, mentally disabled people on death row. They care only for the fetus and once born they are worthless to them"
These types of religious people just never stop infiltrating not only people's house doors but the most vulnerable and private body parts.
Go Shelly
Can ppl pls start bombing the pro lifers? Why is it always the other way around?
"Who the fuck are these old men? FOH. America is a shit hole.
 And I LOVE this girl!! This is what we need!!"
"I love this escort so much.  With all my soul.  She is a strong warrior who care so much for my sisters, mothers, aunts, and friends.  I thank her from the bottom of my heart.  And those protesters?  Why aren't they adopting one of the 150,000 children who have been up for adoption in the USA?  If they care so much about those children - why aren't they adopting 5 or 6 of them and why aren't they with them right now?"
Lunatics
You are a brave young women and don't know how many women you've helped by simply being there. Thank you on behalf of my grand daughters and great grand daughters.
"My dad used to walk up to anti abortion protesters and ask their name. Then he pulled out a $5 and said I’m going to donate this to the clinic IN YOUR NAME!
He was a warrior spirit"
The problem with the protesters are is that they believe they have a maker and that maker does not approve of a woman's' health. How sad and stupid is that.
3:12 she just called it a tiny rubber fetus?
Religion sucks.  What a bunch of horrible people.
"They don't care about the life that's already here
Once the baby,that they beg for, IS born they do nothing to help the mothers in any way,shape or form
Doubt they would care if a ten year old girl was pregnant"
"Simple, criminalize fornication. Castrate any man who violates that law!"
And not one of these protesters ever adopted a baby.
"Isn’t it wonderful that these old MEN are there harassing women. And really, it’s a boy or a girl” well crap, I thought it was a puppy."
Why don’t they just spend their time in foster care taking care of those beautiful children instead? Do they know how many homeless children are there in America?!! !
She’s amazing
Don't understand how certain people can so passionately support the murder of unborn babies. Thousands of lives saved by the Supreme Court's decision.
Make no mistake - you are a hero.  Women need to be in control of their bodies PERIOD.

"Years ago I worked in law enforcement, and I remember getting a call, that a group had barged into a clinic. When I arrived, there were several protesters with signs sitting on the steps of the clinic and a few on the edge of the property as well. I tried to ask what was going on but was ignored, until a staff member from the clinic stuck her head out the door and said ""they're in the clinic"". By this time I was backed up by several other officers and we made our way past the ones on the step and into the clinic. The protesters had entered an examination room where a young lady was still on the exam table. They were sitting in a circle around the table singing.  About 3 months later the clinic moved to a more secure location."
"Can you imagine if the pilgrims didn’t bring all that religious crap with them.
Go on, just imagine that."
Wow so brave of her. Get a real job
I don't feel sorry for these demons!!! Stop killing babies!
"If you kill a baby, you should also die!"
Why are we killing babies?! Just why??!! Why should a precious baby 👶 get a death sentence?!!
But pedophile priests are okay with your imaginary friend in the sky?
America is NOT YOUR CHURCH
"The two most dangerous times for women in abusive relationships is when they are leaving or are pregnant.  But these are the same people who would deny her an abortion but wont vote for gun control or the ""boyfriend"" claus which could possibly save her and her unborn life.  I am so tired of these meddling white old fanatics."
"Funny how women are doing what they need to do to stop unwanted suffering, yet some men and women ignore all the real issue, like the fentanyl epidemic, to berate women who choose not to add to it."
"Funny it's always the people who don't have to deal with the consequences of their opinions that are protesting. The mothers are going to have to take care of the babies that they can't financially support, the foster care programs are going to have to find these children a better quality of life, and women are going to forcefully die giving birth to babies that wouldn't have had a conscious understanding of their existence otherwise. No one should be allowed to decide for these women, it's their choice."
"Well, that whale will never need an abortion."
"So funny how these loving caring ppl bravely usher these women past the protestors, up the stairs to a dingy room where they lovingly kill babies. It’s beautiful"
"Anti-abortion protesters make spectacles out of a desperate need to feel important. Otherwise, they feel they lead insignificant meaningless lives ."
I would love to see those people standing and praying in front of a coming tornado or hurricane to go away.  Let's see how god helps them there.
"How about handing each of them earplugs as they get out of the car, or maybe earphones and music (We - Will - We - Will - Rock You!)"
"Pro-Lifers' message is incongruent and irrational.  They want (supposedly) to save the life of a fetus, but in the same breathe they're willing to kill another human being?  I think they have mental health issues, OCD being one of them.  I wonder if they would be happy to have Muslims, Jews, and Buddhists next to them  praying to their respective gods? Remember, the Constitution says we have freedom of religion and there aren't only radical christians and evangelicals in this country."
It's none of your business why they are at the clinic. Just mind your own business.
A fetus from r*pe is NOT a blessing from God
"What they forget is even God gives us the right to choose. God says ""CHOOSE death and cursing or CHOOSE life and blessing"" Each person's version of cursing and blessing maybe different than the next person's."
If men were the ones having babies they'd want the right to choose
Maybe Dan should find time to adopt a few children.
USA educations and religion are making people STUPID/IGNORANT and selfish
You  retired my dude you'll be gone in a few weeks  🤣🤣🤣you should worry more about your life
"If Jesus were alive today, his DM's would be full of death threats for supporting a woman's right to choose."
Love Shelley!!! Keep it up!
Those people will be gone in a few weeks 🤣
Crazy....They don't want abortion to happen but will kill someone...how is that ok???
"This is about people who have a small minded bias about a subject they can't understand.  Instead of minding their own business, they push their magic man in the sky who according to the bible supports aborting unborn fetuses.  But they interpret their entitled nature according to what they want to believe and support autocratic invasive theocracy and suppress the privacy and freedom of others.  They are too stupid to realize their wrongs don't do anything but cause harm to others they don't have any business of knowing about or what they are doing.  They are extremists and hide behind their rights to violate others rights.  If there is a god, I don't believe they are going to be happy if they get judgement."
I  have one thing to say to the guy who said he believed abortion was wrong... well don't have one and get your nose out of other peoples business.
"Honestly, I think abortions should be done in either a hospital or outpatient surgery clinic that does other procedures. That way the woman who have abortions and all those involved in the procedure will be safe from violent protesters and judgmental people."
"Did someone that doesn't want you to have a choice really say, ""their right to CHOOSE life"" ?!?!"
Good for you!   A brilliant idea
"All these capable ""good"" hearted people could be fostering or providing care for actual children. That's their hypocrisy. They only care about women paying for ""sin"" even if it's a Man's sin.  I had a crisis in pregnancy and chose a therapeutic abortion,  rather than wait for the baby to die on his own. He was 22 weeks, kicked until the last minute and I got to hold him, have pictures and say goodbye. My alternative was to wait for nature to take it course and have an unpredictable situation which was not going to change the outcome. I'm assuming women in that situation will now have to wait for fetal demise and hope they can get through that without an emergency or having the dead baby removed surgically.. or maybe you start to hemorrhage in the grocery store. That's the problem. You don't know people's stories, or the why. And things can go very wrong, babies can be ""alive"" with non survivable defects, we are now capable of knowing that and asking a women to walk around visibly pregnant waiting for the baby to die is cruel, and barbaric. We arent forcing anyone in any situation to terminate. If you want to carry and give birth to an anecephalic (brainless baby) you can. So don't have an abortion.  But if your weeping over non viable fetuses but not engaging in feeding, housing and caring for the unwanted, abused, neglected and homeless kids we have..you're an asshole telling strangers what's best for them.

"Ask these protesters, how many unwanted babies have you adopted or fostered? I'm sure none. They want to convince you to keep this unwanted baby but are they stepping up to do there part financially, physically and emotionally for the mother or the unwanted baby?"
"My Grandmother would have aborted my father, he went to the children's home at birth!
My mother tried to get rid of me, she tried everything to get rid of me, when I was born, she said she wanted me....... it never felt like she did!
I would still rather be alive!"
"Vote Blue for woman rights to choose, cause Red want them dead."
"Most women have very good reasons for abortions and do not do or take it lightly. Whatever their reasons, it is no one’s business but theirs. I knew when I was younger, I didn’t think I could do it, but I never had to - I never had desperate, medical, or traumatic event around being pregnant. I DO believe woman have to decide for themselves. 

The second part: men, birth control or vasectomy? Accept NO MEANS NO including from your own wife. We had hard days, too. Take responsibility and be accountable for your part in this. I know this may be preaching to the choir. Emotionally Mature men of conscious do not rape, or commit incest, they do not bully women, or demean them. They support and love and care. Emotionally Mature men."

Private security paid for by unrestricted donations would be useful at these clinics.
"I once biked to Planned Parenthood to be present for my friend.  As I was locking up my bike, a man came and kneeled beside me, shoving his rosary at my face.  He was violating my space, and his presence was unwanted.  He started lecturing me about life, and I said, ""I bet you ate meat this morning.""  He looked confused.  I think I broke his brain."

11 killed by anti-abortionists!? These pro-lifers continuously contradict themselves. Idiots.

Much love to Shelley!!!  Such an inspiration.  I didn't know you could volunteer to escort women.  Maybe I will do this one day.
We should now change our name to the divided states of fascism...we now have a supreme court who is rendering rulings based on partisanship and their religious views...4 of them lied to get onto the court and it is now apparent in this country that as long as you have power and money then laws do not apply to you..you can be sure that the rich will have all of the medical access to abortion care they need and once again the women who will suffer the most have the least amount of resources and the least amount of influence..I never thought I would see the day that this country would undertake an experiment that was so detrimental to what we claim we are as a nation..this court will continue to strip rights from people based on their own held beliefs and interpretation of the bible and if the court is not expanded and the filibuster removed..we will be back to 1940 by next year..
"These people don't care about health care or the quality of life for babies after they're born.  Nor do they care about the women.  They probably ate a big breakfast full of animals, to boot.  *They don't care about life; they care about sanctimony.*"
"Life begins at the egg and at the sperm. All male anti-Choice protesters produce sperm and all female anti-Choice protesters produce eggs, but all protesting women and men abort those innocent lives so they will burn in the fires of Hell forever, no respite, no relief, in pain forever."
Isn't it odd that the only people who want abortions legal are the people who *weren't* aborted themselves?
This woman is so courageous and amazing.
"Too bad Christo-fascist ""god"" doesn't care about the animals he created who are suffering in factory farms, zoos, and slaughterhouses."
Shelley is great. What a hero for women’s rights.
Why don't they visit a factory farm or slaughterhouse if they're so pro-life.
The fact abortion clinics even HAVE escorts is bullshit. This would mean that some people are so insane about this that it's been decided it could be dangerous for the ex-mother which is retarded
"Could they just blast heavy metal , rap, or something to drown these jerks out"
So “pro life” but so strongly pro gun. Is life really sacred? Apparently not 😂
"I don't understand how it's allowable for these protests outside of clinics. Protest the decisions of your elected officials directly, but harassing people who are exercising their right to get health care should not be permitted. It would be like people who oppose income tax interfering with people entering the IRS buildings or state tax & revenue offices."
I remember these people. I was going into Planned Parenthood for cervical cancer screening. They yell at you without knowing much about your situation.
"KJV Mathew 2:16  Herod had all the Children under 2 Years of age killed, But GOD only warned to save Jesus!!! God is in Control of Life and death!!!! WE all Pass at a Young age or at an Old age!! Sad women have to make this choice!!!"

Why is it more people are encouraged to rescue a dog from a shelter instead of a breeder.

WHY NOT GO HELP ACTUAL KIDS THAT ARE ALIVE AND PRESENT ON THIS EARTH. The spend all this time harassing people and wasting their time if they actually cared about kids they would spend this time with all the kids in foster care.

"The idea that you can’t decide for yourself whether to keep or abort a pregnancy ( not an actual human being ) is just mind boggling 🤦🏻‍♂️
Also that it is not your own business !"
what type of f****** ghoul kills an innocent human life because they had irresponsible sex. what kind of f****** ghoul even believes they have the right to do this. there is still hope for you. we have a loving and forgiving God turn away from this lifestyle. it is a lifestyle of mental illness and suicide.

And someone who is raising the Christian church I don't understand Christians they don't practice any of the s*** in the Bible like I already stated it's just a sad situation all around these women need a safe place to have this done if they're going to do it cuz it's their choice well I would never be okay with my wife doing it unless it would kill her to have the baby or the baby would die it needs to be done in the Safeway so that like this doctor said women don't lose the ability to reproduce you should be able to have a baby on your own terms at your own time and unfortunately as a man I have experience with failed contraceptive my wife was on contraceptives when she got pregnant with our fourth child"
let me get this straight. These so called  anti abortion terrorist are willing to kill 11 human beings all in the name of protecting a fetus that has nothing to do with them??? Stupidity has no definition.
Be that compassionate about the Word of God.
Why is it always people who are claiming they have a religious authority in a religious right to be there the most rude aggressive and violent of the bunch why don't you practice the f****** preachings that you'll try to preach cuz I know being forced into church as a child the Bible is all about forgiveness turning other cheek being peaceful and loving people like you love yourself so what the f*** is wrong with you Christians
"I was at planned parenthood to help me with excessive bleeding. Newport Beach, Ca anti abortionist threw bibles at me hit friend n nose made her nose bleed, cops did nothing?"
I just do not understand how there are so many independently wealthy people to literally make harassing people their unpaid job while so many of us are struggling to feed ourselves everyday.  These people must have loads of cash.
Creepy af!!!
It's almost as if Condom don't exist
And adoption doesn't work most adopted kids go in and they are either sexually abused and then they have children that they have to deal with that came from an abusive parent that fuck them and had sexual intercourse with them trust me I've seen several of my friends that have been put in the Foster system get raped by their own foster parents disgusting you guys are and you know who I'm talking about too
Abortion should be accessible to women I am a God loving man / woman and if something is inside our bodies that is toxifying US does it matter if it's a living being it should be removed immediately if it's causing harm to the body and if it's causing harm to the mind is well God has said that in the Bible that we hand the choice to do so and you Christians calling yourself Christians now what a shameful act of disrespect to God's creation God will punish the masses that follow the masses which you God following followers that follow churches are the masses which you will be punished for your own self pride shall be judged and if you're wondering if I'm 8 non-Christian now I went to a Baptist you guys have no idea how hard it is I'm also integrated with more than 100 different types of religions so I know what God wants and I know what God doesn't want you guys that stop the abortion process causes us harm to our bodies I hope you know that if you guys continue this and down the road especially you Republicans that are following q you guys will learn your lesson soon enough and Donald Trump you need to get out because your lawyers right we're coming for you don't forget about what they said in the Bible about the Meeks we will return just because we've been watching you fools and you sadist calling us sadist which is nasty and itself because I will give my life freely to God unlike you guys won't lay your lives down for the real God you will lay your lives down for the petty the silverishly foolishness of a governmental party like the Republicans this is a Democratic Republic it is both a Republican and a democratic system it is both for the people by the people with the help of industry
And they should worry about the babies after they are born🙄

"I had an abortion procedure at 17 years old. I choose to terminate because my ex was abusive to me, and the abuse only escalated when I was pregnant. It was a very difficult decision, especially for me who LOVED children and babies, but I felt that was my only way to survive that abusive relationship and also a potential child. My ex became addicted to drugs, and he was physically and emotionally abusive. Whenever I tried to leave him, he stalked me. I was literally stuck with him, until I broke free and terminated. I wasn’t old enough to have an abortion without my parents consent, so I tried to poison myself first hoping I’d have a miscarriage, which only caused me to become very sick. I would’ve killed myself trying to terminate the baby from my abusive ex."
"So sick of these fairy tale worshipping little children getting to rule others lives….
These are terrorists and they should treated as such. Stand your ground and fear for your life…end these anti choice terrorists threats."
They’re literally called The Deathscorts.
These people need to get a life.
The doctor who still does third trimester abortion said he prays? to whom? maybe the devil.  Second trimester is clearly unimaginable horror not to mention third. The whole thing is clearly evil.
"If you want to understand something about creation, never listen to religions !!!!"
Yea it’s crazy to think people feel this passionately about abortions but not about addressing the issues that would lead someone to make this decision. Like people literally cannot afford to have a child and the foster care system is an absolute mess
"I can kind of see the point of view of the anti abortion people. 

They truly believe that the fetus is a precious baby (and they're right). Their heart seems to be in the right place. 


Problem is it's too much to ask to force a mother to carry a baby."
"help reinstate roe v wade
impregnate a christian republican today"
"Lets get real here, there is no justification for ending a baby's life. All I hear people saying to justify abortion is, ""The foster care homes are horrible"" or "" the babies should be aborted because they'll grow up in poverty"". The truth is, it is usually young women having abortions because they think a baby will interfere with their dreams of going to college or becoming an actress and model. Young girls live in a fantasy at that age, and have almost a zero chance of ever becoming famous. As for the foster care thing, being in foster care is alot better than being murdered. Growing up in poverty is also better than being murdered. How would you feel if someone killed you because they said they wanted to prevent you from living in poverty?  My grandmother grew up dirt poor in Oklahoma during the great depression and dust bowl, and said those were the happiest days of her life. Money is not everything and this is not Ethiopia where babies will starve to death with flies swarming their mouths."
"Most of the protesters cannot get pregnant, they need to leave these women alone."
"0:48 ""I'm gone get me a ladder, climb to the top and shout at people until they see the world exactly how I do"""
"When a fetus has a heart 💓 , it becomes a child. Nobody has the right to kill a child. Listen to the science. Listen to the law."
Pro choice works both ways.  They need to remember that.  It means you can have a child or not.
She is a hero......I ve never thought or imagined that in the United States the situation of abortion clinics are those and that women doctors and people working in the clinics risk their lives everyday......it is crazy ....I m shocked
"Republicans just want total government control over all our lives.  And when that same government comes for their guns, the right wingers will give them up without a fight, because they trust anything Big Government tells them."
Being OBSESSED with what is INSIDE a woman's PRIVATE BODY is SICK. They're NEVER going to STOP women from WANTING an abortion. Do these people take care of CHILDREN? Or just waste time being a PEST?

Go Shelley!!!! 🙏🙏 legend
When Dan meets his maker He's going to  ask him why he harassed so many people when He let's so many 'conceptions' 'go' in in menstrual tissue.
The anti abortion people are nazis
A brave lady.  Bless her for the work she does.
Laws in Australia ban these types from harrassing women  outside clinics
"These loons are pro-birth, not pro-life. Just think if they took all this time and energy to help all the kids in foster care,etc."
Both sides have mentally deranged individuals. Look at the Jan 6 committee if you don’t believe me. Cheers!
They've been groomed for decades to act this way. They're useful idiots.
All this can be avoided by using a rubber
"when you have women dying from unhealthy fetuses it's a f****** problem okay ... when the woman's life is at risk and the fetus probably will not grow properly, or live to be discharged from the hospital after Labor and delivery, an abortion is very much necessary... people don't think of these things, all they know is  irresponsible women get pregnant, and want to terminate the pregnancy, but that is not the case all the time!! this is a very sad world we live in no consideration at all!! I'm with abortion if it's going to risk a  life!!!"
"Take them up on their ""help"".  Get them to pay for all the expenses of the pregnancies, and then they can adopts the babies, and do all the work of being the parent.  They'll each have 28 kids in a month, and they'll be way too busy to protest anywhere."
Bless you brave volunteers
you go shelly! keep doing it sister!
More proof that this issue is far from over
I wish I could thank that doctor for saving women’s lives.
Religious nutters
Democrats and Liberals never disappoint.....here are your true insurrectionists!!!
"Anyone who doesn't know the pain and hardship of being an unwanted child should really not wish that on anyone. The people who are crowing over this ""win"" are getting a hard-on for human suffering. If they really cared there wouldn't be children languishing in foster care, who will never be able to call someone mom or dad. There wouldn't be street kids with no place to lay their heads. We can look around and see how much they ""care."" Hippocrits!"
"WHAT IS IT? AMEROCA IS A FREE COUNTRY. IS THE SAME THAT PROCHOICE PEOPLE DO EVERY WHERE. HEY CNN... PLEASE, BE A TRUE JOURNALISTS... NOT FANATICS!!!"
“All I really care about is the women and the children and their right to choose life” 😂 😂 😂 😂
Jesus went to modern churches and preached hell fire to CHURCH LEADERS like false prophets. Not this
That doctor looks good for 80. It's too bad he can't retire cuz his job is so risky
Save a life then murder 10 all in the name of god
God killed lots of 👶 look it up
Ever notice it's almost mostly men who are outside. What the fck do they know about women's reproductive organs . They those creepy men tend to look like pervs.
"I saw one protester, covered in tattoos, with a sign mentioning God calling out to save the lives of babies. I wondered whether he'd ever read the bible, especially the parts that says that one should not decorate their bodies or the part that states that life begins with the first breath."
creepy ass old white men🤢.
"""We'll help you"" they say as they continue to vote for the same GOP politicians that refuse to pass bills for assistances including food stamps, day care , minimum wage increases, affordable health care, affordable housing, etc!!! Yes, they want women to stay pregnant, have the baby and bring it up in utter poverty. G D hypocrites. It makes my blood boil!"
"She's actually interfering with those people's right to protest. 

People always claim they believe in freedom of speech........until someone says something they don't agree with. Left or Right, Conservative or Liberal, it's always the same."
Since 1977 11 people have been killed in anti abortion attacks...how is that pro life?
"""An invisible man in the sky told me to come harrass women"". Okaaaay crazypants."
I find it cruel that these pro lifers say they want life but when the mother is endanger of dying from carrying or giving birth there is no sympathy. How is that pro life?
Third trimester...that's 29 to 40 weeks. Did anyone hear what he said
Shelly Mann is a true hero. She is ensuring that women's rights aren't stomped on by those protesters; Funny how their rights seem to outweigh the rights of everybody else.  *Those protesters who claim it is their right to stand out and yell at women trying to access healthcare are doing nothing but trying to suppress the rights of others.  A $50 fine and unsupervised probation is a RIDICULOUS punishment for someone who is trying to take away or suppress the rights of another individual.*
Why are old men putting themselves in other peoples business?
"Funny how all these people who act like they care so much for fetuses actually care so little for the rights or feelings of anyone else. These guys defend ""their right to stand out and yell at people"" but they have not one peep about the right of those women to access healthcare. It is awful to have to walk through a bunch of yelling people to get into a clinic; I had to do it to get my birth control pills (the people yelling didn't know or care why I was there) they yelled ugly things at me and shoved gory pictures in front of my face as I walked into the clinic. They literally tried to terrorize me into not going into the clinic, all it did was make me mad and more determined to go in and get my pills (they were $10 at the clinic pharmacy, $28 at a retail pharmacy). Those people yelling could care less that I was there to try to save $18 on a month of pills, they were there to yell at and upset women; Somehow that is their ""right"". Sick puppies one and all!"
Dan needs to go back to work and then return to pass out his paychecks - MONEY 💵 COLD HARD CASH to the women he’s yelling at. Dan you did it backwards dude! Go back to work!!!
There not one state that prohibits abortion if   mother in danger of death/injury  rape or incest or miscarry killing a innocent makes no logical sense I don't get it and if we're going to practice that ideology then we need to have a serious discussion of getting rid of child support 50/50 marriage and paying alimony because cutting ties with a baby momma and children will save and improve male lives physically and emotionally?
"When you meet your maker, Joe, God better have mercy on what you did with YOUR life, YOUR dick, Your Mouth, ect. Mind the speck in your own eye!"
"I love it, notice most protestors are men 🙄🤦‍♀️ once they become pregnant, handle the 9 months, give birth and then they can say something… I still will never understand why these people are violent.. but pro-life protesters rarely become violent.. actually I can’t remember when one has happened"
BABY KILLERS!!!
What the hell is he talking about nobody is telling him what to do with his body
"again, they are not pro-life. they are pro birth and also pro death but they tend to be to stupid to see that."
"Why are these idiots not arrested. It is illegal to protest a medical facility.. arrest these idiots, a fetus is not a living being"
Freedom of religion means freedom from religion.  If you don't like abortion  don't get one. Such moronic people 🤦🏾‍♂️
The amount of demon possessed people who love killing babies in these comments is staggering
Want to help? Take the little bastard.
"Why are the protestors trying to force women to carry to term are so old that they wouldn’t be able to take care of a child? What’s is this, Grandparent fever?
Also stop pushing your religion on others."
It  amazing when you see the size of their protesters compared to the size of the pro-choice protesters.......... But yet somehow the few get to run this country on the many do not.
"why protesters have to be so rude? Yelling at women like that, shame on them, freedom of religion should be re-inforce, but we have to remember that country is not the land of the free."
Go back to your f'ing church and leave people out of your crazy. No floating man in the sky decided that your here to harass people in a bad place. Nuts.
"These so called pro life protesters are ignorant, misguided, judgemental, who have no right to try and impose their will on others. Individuals who for whatever reason, but especially the victims of rape, incest or child abuse have the inalienable right to reproductive healthcare. It’s especially egregious in my mind when individuals and groups think their religious beliefs take precedence over another person’s life. I feel that’s the definition of religious extremism, bigotry and hypocrisy especially when they put their own narrow interpretations on scriptures that seldom if at all make references to birth control."
These old fart men n women have no right telling any women what to do with their body.
"This woman is a hero. These sanctimonious ""pro-lifers"" are nauseating."
I'm starting my own cult. It's so easy to con the galactically ignorant among us.
Religion is the scourge on this earth.
All of you people protesting should be asking why the democrat party hasn’t turned Row into law for over 50+ years? Answer: They don’t care😂😂😂
"2:33 Your ""Good Lord"" has no mercy. Have you not read the Bible?"
Why is it everybody who is against abortion is somebody who should of been aborted? I dare any anti abortionist to prove me wrong.
They aren’t there to help. They just want to spew religious nonsense.
We need to start counterprotesting these protesters. Escorts have to stay professional. The rest of us don't.
"""I hope he has a lot of mercy."" Yeah, you're gonna need it, bro."
Thank you for your work
So abortion is killing but the anti-abortionist’s shoot up the place and kill people and take lives . Ironic?
The most unfuckable women are protesting from both sides.
A pro lifer commits murder. If that’s not hypocritical I don’t know what is. These people are so small minded and arrogant to their own personal views.
Not all heros wear capes
Not all heros wear capes
Those protestors need to get a life.  Go mind your own business.
They keep preaching god but god also stated it is a sin to Judge but they don’t comprehend that !!!!
"Hey, idiots. You don't have to be a crazy Christian to disagree with you. Abortion isn't ""ok"", at best it's the only option that makes sense, and that ain't how it is usually"
"Pro-life side also seems pro-shooting and pro-fire bombing when they don’t get their way.

Wish the media would stop portraying this issue as if both sides had equally valid rationale."
Not one of those antis own a uterus!
"Bless you,Shelly.
Brave American hero."
The scariest thing is that those imbeciles  so truly believe that they have the right to tell others how to live their lives. I wonder how they’d feel if we followed them to their doctors and and “objected” and screamed abuse at them for whatever procedure they were having. Believing in the invisible magical guy who lives in the sky is more important than living humans is being just bizarre. Ignorant Taliban America.
The street protesters are no different then the SCOTUS on the bench with their twisted ideologies.
"Horrible people who care nothing and know nothing about these women.  They are not ""pro life"", they are Pro Foetus at the cost of the life and well being of women.  These pests have no right to torment medical people or the people having a procedure."
"America is totally messed up. 
The ones who want gun control, wants to kill babies. The ones who say life is sacred, are also saying guns are good. 
No wonder Russia is not afraid of America and China will soon lead the world."
These pro lifers are sick.
"America is totally messed up.

"It's easy for men to sit there and say what's wrong or right they don't have to go through any of the sickness, pain or they don't care for any of those kids. Where are they when these kids by that mother that shouldn't had kids from the start,where where they when a 3 yr old was found dead in the freezer didn't see them speaking out . My body and f#ck your thoughts, opinions and I'm gonna do what I want for me and my body period 😌"
Literally old white men and Karen's.
"I have a very difficult time with anti-abortionists faulty logic!!! What makes ANYONE think they have a RIGHT to tell ANYONE what they can and can’t do with their bodies…. Yet the same individuals that  protest against abortion also  
protest against public assistance!!!
When someone doesn’t want to have a baby that’s their choice whether you like it or not or anyone else likes it or not!! I have five kids I wouldn’t have an abortion myself but at the same time I’m not comfortable telling another woman that she can’t! Do you know why? Because it’s none of my fucking business!! Too many people make other peoples business their own and that’s the problem with morality!!"
Those people are the Taliban in America. It  was created by the GOP and extremist religious and it has the support ofThe Supreme Court.
"“The right to choose life”. Woman, that is what they are doing, they are choosing their life. No one goes to an abortion clinic just because."
"We know they're all hypocrites because they're not protesting outside of gun manufacturers and NRA offices, especially now that guns are the number one killer of children from birth to 18 in America.  Not to mention the fact that nearly all of the States that are the most anti-choice are also ranked at the bottom for healthy outcomes for children and families.  It's not about abortion, it's about control.  It's not about children, it's about limiting agency for women.  It's not about children, it's about imposing their religion on others."
Infant mortality rate is a joke in the USA. Maybe fix that is they are so pro life!
"Great job Shelly dealing with these right wing religious nut cases. These people are right wing Hippocrates who whine about a woman's choice for her own body but they won't support childcare, healthcare, funding for schools, time off for parents, or gun control which kills living children every day. They are disgusting brainwashed bullies"
"May Baphomet protect those seeking passage, for Satan is responsible for the responsible."
Why this men name “Dan” or all those protesters against abortion that are so worry about live of kids go feed and provide for kids without parents if they are so worried about .
Someone needs to take sign up vouchers to these places and see how many of the pro choicers are willing to help financially with the upbringing of the children they say they are saving.
They got nothing better to do but go out and harass people.  They don't care about babies.  They're just trying to make their own miserable pathetic existence mean something.  But all jokes aside these people may seem harmless but they demonstrate the underlying threat organized religion presents to liberty.  These people think they have a right to dictate how other people live and historically this belief system is what led to religious institutions literally murdering people in the most horrific ways imaginable.  That is precisely why the founders of the US drafted the US constitution with a separation of church and state.
You get messages but your broadcasting yourself to the masses
"It’s crazy how she’s taking her 15 bucks a hour job, she’s literally trying make money off tik Tok off all this."
"U lost me at the “3rd trimester abortion”
I will NEVER agree with that"
Kudos to Shelley.
Great work Shelly!
The irony runs deep here
"There majority of people against abortion are good people and good critical thinkers, but there are some pro-lifers that take it to far. The world is not a perfect place and it will never will be. That does not mean we should sit with our arms crossed and not try to help these women, every life is important"
Someone should ask Dan and the rest of the protesters how many children they have taken in or adopted. Also ask him if he has taken in any single moms and supported them and their children.
Why don’t these protesters protest outside of prison for against the death penalty?
Thank you for your work.  Please stay safe.
"those crazy people needs a job,  glad i am living in the Netherlands"
When he meet his maker He is going to ask him why did he waisted his life protesting instead of actually helping others.
How about telling all the women and girls to stop opening their hairy legs and having sex without protection? There are consequences of your actions.
Pro life people : let me save that fetus or I threaten your life with violence and death. Very pro life. You can really feel they care for every living being on this earth. Very deep Christian values
To be proliferated and threaten people with violence and death is nonsensical
"Women need real sex education again. We can only get pregnant during ovulation and that's when we in intense sexual heat also.. We ovulate only a few days per month or prior to menses. Women need to get their reproductive system examined/tested to know if they have healthy functioning uteruses/overies thats functioning properly. White women does it when they WANT to have kids. It's more to it than a PAP SMEAR. When u know your OVULATION CYCLE u know when u can get pregnant and when u don't want to get pregnant and teach our men partners of how we operate in NATURE beyond their ego needs.  ♥️ Time to go back to  NATURE NATURAL ORDER AND LAW for righteousness... not government abortion programs LAWLESS DISORDER for wicked agendas. It's time for women to say ""NO IM NOT HAVING SEX NOW BECUS IM OVULATING"" instead of saying ""IM GETTING AN ABORTION"" and accept responsibility and be a grown woman about their decision when they change their mind too late.♥️now rape and incest is indifferent and a personal spiritual choice bcus great things also birth through chaos. Point is...STOP DEPENDING ON GOVERNMENT to enforce your divine right and KNOW THYSELF! to be your own government in NATURAL ORDER IN YOU. POWER IS WITHIN LIKE OVULATION MONITORING!"
"How many of the pro-life people have adopted a child from foster care, or even been a foster parent?  How many have fought for M4A?  How many have tried to educate others on contraceptive and abstinence. Now how many just go out and push their own ideas and beliefs on others when in reality it does not affect their lives any which way if a woman unknown to them has an abortion.  Its about power and control anynway you slice it.  I am an atheist and never have i had the desire to protest at a church or temple, it does not affect my life when someone i do not know goes to a church to pray or have service.  You say its murder?  Well what about the wars waged in the name of a god, both sides usually think god is on their side.   Words and empathy will get you farther than violence in most cases."
Thank God for the people who escort those women. Those protesters are violent criminals.
The good lord is ashamed of the way you treat women.
"This is a baby trafficking money making scheme for the Christian Right. Amy Comey Barrett says she wants a supply chain of babies for *religious organizations.*
Betsy Devos charges 50K per immigrant baby. I wonder how much a white baby will fetch? Christian church makes money and fills declining churches."
We are going to turn into a 3rd world country fast!! Look at red states. They take the highest amount from the government and give the least.
Libs of TikTok is so much better...lol
Such holy people 😳 as if they care for  somebody else baby...
"White neighborhood = fertility clinic
Black neighborhood = abortion clinic"
"The majority of people that get abortions are rich white women, they even have their own office hours.

Idc about the abortion thing, that's clearly about the fact white people are going extinct. 

White women's pathology makes them do this, it stems from having so many rights and having being a protected class for so long, now they want to pretend they are upset about being oppressed when in reality it's the fact they are learning about their actual minority status globally/ a resentment of their cut for their participation in white supremacy."
"I have issue with 3rd trimester abortion. 
These are babies who can survive  outside the mother.
If you're getting a 3rd trimester abortion you've waited way too long."
These people have escaped from a mental institution called church!
So he's protesting for his own future salvation? Wow...these people are nuts.
"These are the same people that tell colored children at the border ""America is full we can't help you"""
"Guilt!! The guy is right.....you have to feel guilty for...well, just about everything.....that's what give them the control over you. The world is crap?....It's YOUR fault, so get down on your knees and do whatever we want you to do......it's God's will and only we know what that is."
"It is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live as you wish.

-Saint Mother Theresa"
All these cultists with their imaginary friend as an excuse. 🖕Christian Taliban
I guess this is way most people need to have a job...just so they don't harass others.
The is a difference between peaceful protest and verbal  harassment .
"Dan, you’re a hero. Keep it up!"
How ironic that Dan mentioned God’s mercy?
https://youtu.be/VAvFfrYA2LM
I thought it was just RICH White men that wanted they’re hands in americas wombs.
"Isn't it funny how it's so easy to threaten an adult's life like they weren't children at one point, too🤦🏾‍♀️"
"Protesting is one thing, but this is just harassment."
"There should be an exclusion zone of 500ft for voicing or holding protest and laws to criminalise serial harassment by individuals or groups against people seeking medical care, whatever it is. Personal medical care is private, personal and confidential. Unwanted, unsolicited intervention by third parties is not a right, it’s an assault and should be treated as such, pure and simple."
Has anyone changed their minds because of these people?
"Religionists make me sick.  Republicans/conservatives (and the like) MUST be voted OUT of all levels of government and society immediately!  Every state, everywhere.  The Garbage-Obsolete-Party policy positions are irrelevant and useless to humanity in the 21st century.  There will be no R’s checked off on my ballot!  You do the same.  There is no right on the right; it is anti-science, anti-education, anti-reality and on the wrong side of history.  In evident-reality, religion is psychologically/culturally toxic fiction that needs to go away immediately - particularly the tribal wargod of abraham.  Religion is bs.  No more tail wagging the dog!
Lastly, if you don’t menstruate 🩸YOU don’t get to oppose a woman’s right to an abortion. YOU get to shut-piehole and get out of the way.  Keep your misogynistic/religious hatefulness to yourselves.  Life begins when a female decides to allow the fetus to proceed; if at ANY time during the process she decides she no longer wants it (for any reason) ‘it’ doesn’t begin!  Period.  A woman will NOT be forced to host an organism against her will.  
*Religion is NO solution for the requirements of humanity in the 21st century."
Repeats ?
"America, I just don’t get it. Why do you care so much about things that doesn’t involve you and isn’t any of your business?"
"I was one of these women accosted in 1998 in Madison, WI while walking into Meriter Hospital on West Washington Ave.  (See story link below) I was 17, nearly 18 and I won't get into specifics of my circumstance as it is a very private matter, and now that I am nearly 41 now, the way I was treated by these ""pro-life"" jerks still haunts me to this day.

I am furthermore re-traumatized now with ROE V WADE being overturned, and is now ILLEGAL to obtain an abortion, for any reason, including RAPE & incest because the POS SCOTUS chose for me and all women, based on a law from 1849.  YES, 1849.  I want to throw up! 

 I  am now a  mother of 3, I first became mother in 2003, because I CHOSE to be a mother, and the act of her, and her siblings conception was CONSENTUAL!!!  It sickens me that my girls, if they become impregnated, whether by force or not, or simply because they are not ready to have a baby for whatever reason CANNOT LEGALLY have an abortion, they in turn will have to travel to MN, OR IL to obtain one.

Mind your own fucking business, because you don't know what these women's stories are, and believe you me, it is an excruciating decision to make, it is heart breaking, and for these assholes to try and make women feel guilty is abhorrent!
 
This woman, a crusader, and a protector of women seeking abortion is a super hero!

What a screwed up country
"why the pilgrims came to America in the first place. the church was telling them what to do. the only way to be a republican is to not understand history. also the church loved abortion and referred to it a lot in America in around the birth of our nation, they loved them to fight against, no joke, demonic spawns, and their trained midwives did them all the time. it wasn't until a man named Horatio Storer convinced the nation after noticing white protestant birth rates were committing race suicide, in the 1850s, so he fought to make abortion illegal on the grounds of Eugenics, and saving the white race. Then you had the life long racist democrats from the south who voted dem because they thought they fought for the little guy, Ronald Regan saw that, and noticed the relation of abortion issues and the south wanting to preserve white nationalism, he pushed the GOP to appeal to that, the moral majority at the same time was making a lot of noise so he thought it appropriate to grab their votes with the abortion stance. not the constitution, not the founding fathers who loved abortions, not doctors. The GOP and white supremacist."
"In the now immortal words of the late George Carlin, rights aren't rights if someone can take them away they're temporary privileges."
Thank you Shelly!🙏
Why is it the asshole that want abortion rights is always that typical idiot? Or some bearded trans. smh
"As ""creepy"" as these anti-abortion people appear to be it's even more creepy for people to support murdering babies."
"Now that guns are legal and abortions are illegal, right wingers have to find new causes to continue their grifting."
There should be no abortion unless it’s due to rape or health reasons.
"People who invoke the name of Jesus or Allah or whatever, far more often than not, are up to doing some pretty disgusting things."
"I CAN NOT understand these anti abortion protesters who have so much time and money to travel all over. Why aren't they home taking care of the unwanted children they've adopted? Their time could be better spent protesting the horrible foster care systems or doing SOMETHING for all of the homeless children, better Healthcare for the children that are already here instead of wasting their time on wanting more kids. I just don't get it 🤯🤯🤯"
Some people have 2 much time on their hands.
"These people are sick, let women make decisions for themselves"
"They are beter than GOD,now the think they are GOD on earth !!!!!!"
"Joe, let's babysit! All these others, let babysit for the children you SAVE! LET'S DO THIS!"
I wish I lived there I would counter protest and support the woman walking in
This woman is doing god's work.
"People, stop trying to convince these anti-abortion folks that they’re wrong. You are wasting your breath, energy, time, and sanity. I doubt even .001% change their minds no matter how many well-articulated logical arguments are presented to them. 

Do you know why? The guy in this video tells you clearly: fear of god. These people believe if they don’t advocate for “right to life” and to “end the murder” then they will literally burn in hell for eternity. I mean think about this. If you genuinely held those beliefs - and they DO - wouldn’t you do anything and everything to stop that from happening? Do you see how pointless it is to continue arguing with these people? 

Save your energy and breath for a very real path towards legalizing abortion. And no, that’s not to try to change SCOTUS. Those judges are exactly what I just described but on steroids, because they will be praised every day for the rest of their lives for “saving the babies” and those narcissistic sycophants are eating this up! 

So where is your energy most likely to yield actual results? The November 2020 elections coming up! Remember the push in November 2020? Well, we need that but tenfold! We MUST take over every state, every house, every office that we can! And by a wide margin, because you know, Manchin and Sinema. 🙄 

Let’s do this! When we win, we can just ignore the far right for a little while and heal from the madness. But only for a little while, because you know, Trump. 🙄"
I love her so much. They should give these women headphones.
"Shelley Mann is alive...does she know that she is alive and doing this because her mother allowed her to live?
And CNN is helping her vileness!!!
I pray no doctor is found as replacement and the clinic closes."
"""Judge not, that ye be not judged"" is way beyond these psychos. I wish I could be there when they meet their maker."
Bless you Shelly! And everyone who does the work like you. These protesters have absolutely no compassion or empathy. You have no idea what situation is women are in when they are going into this clinic. Many of them have babies who are not viable and they need to have the procedure in order to save their life and protect their health. It’s beyond shameful watching people who claim to do the work of God behaving this way
Something tells me that most pro choice activists will never have the opportunity to have an abortion
It’s NEVER BEEN ANTI ABORTION. Always known as pro life.
"I am finding it very interesting that all these protesters are so passionate about saving a fetus, then they go home and literally eat another females' children and drink milk intended for baby calves.  Dairy cows are repeatedly forcibly impregnated and their babies taken away from them almost immediately.  I have seen videos of mother cows who are still cleaning their baby - that they carried for 9 months - get their baby taken from them and thrown into a truck or other vehicle.  The cows, with udders heavy and dripping milk for their baby, will run after their baby but will never see them again, because humans want their milk for themselves, for cheese and ice cream.  Male calves are useless to the dairy industry, so they are either shot or bludgeoned to death, or raised for 4 months and sold as veal.  Female calves will end up enduring the same fate as their moms.  It is truly heartbreaking.
  So these protesters are absolute hypocrites unless they are vegan."
Religious nuts encouraging and enraging maniacs surely should be against the law?
"Yeah Dan, lets increase the consanguinity of the gene pool. After all, Deuteronomy 25:11 and 25:12 right ? Or was it Deuteronomy 25:5 I cant recall. Please, do enlighten me."
Religious nut jobs! Zygotes are NOT unborn children! These people have no idea what the sanctity of life ACTUALLY mean. I wonder what percentage of them have had the courage to adopt a child!
"They could open up a low-cost daycare centre, if they love children so much.
They could run a free breakfast program, if they love children so much.
They could offer low-cost housing to families, if they love children so much.
They could fundraise to provide regular nutritious food baskets, if they love children so much.
But they don't do ANYthing that would actually help children, because they don't give a single shit about anyone but themselves."
Bless this woman! Great work!
Those protesters are such awful humans. These escorts are heroes.
It should be legal to punch these cowards in the face until they forever sleep

and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. 

You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, 
or privilege, without reimagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone.

They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim to love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. 
Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn."" 

Methodist Pastor David Barnhart"
As a Democratic Indian🇮🇳 we support women rights and right to abortion laws.
IMO these religious nuts should be trespassed and pepper sprayed and arrested if they refuse to leave.  I'm not a legal expert but I'm sure that harassing people who need a medical procedure done violates some law and shouldn't be tolerated like this.
all of those Christian evangelists are as extreme religious fanatics as Isis or Alqueda... their Pastors have contaminated their soul...they create violence and even kill in the name of GOD... God must be ashamed of all of them
What’s really crazy is those who feel they have a right to tell you how to live your life according to their belief system…that’s a true sickness but is the world of religious fanaticism…🧐
I thought third trimester abortions were illegal
Women have the right to choose believe me they can do it.
"Well, you won't have to creep out on front of these centers anymore...... cause now THEY CLOSED!!! 🤣🤣🤣"
Using their logic.......if they believe life starts at conception.........God is the biggest mass murderer in history..... 10-15 % of pregnancies end up in miscarriage
"""Since 1977 at least ELEVEN people have been killed in anti abortion attacks.""

Let's do some math, 60-70 million people killed by abortion since 1973 minus 11 equals about 60-70 million more killings by abortion supporters.

Lol, abortion supporters are so stupid, do they even listen to themselves?"
She’s an Angel.
usa is crazy
These anti-abortion people are just frustrated with themselves and want to get rid of their guilt by passing out their self-righteousness to others.
People should never judge women I mean I had three and these people are sick asf I mean get a fucking life
"NIKKALYN.....nope. no one NEEDS  an abortion!! Overwhelming  majority are selfish, lazy, irresponsible,  immoral, childish, entitled  twisted deadbeats!!

If you are ready to have sex. And proceed with it....then handle the possible  outcomes of it.
ALternatives to murdering innocent babies...
-Abstinence 
-Condoms and /or MANY contraceptives.
-Morning After Pill.
-Adoption 
????????????????????"
"I asked a man that was yelling terrible things outside of an abortion clinic why he thought that would help. He said ""how would you feel if I killed your child."" My child was 4 years old."
Okay I'm just going to say it let's just address the elephant in the room the only reason why pro-life is such a big thing it's because the white population is dwindling that's why these anti-abortions are mainly happening in predominantly white States this is a last-ditch attempt to up the white population in the United States
"11 staff and 63,000.000 precious little babies were murdered. This is hellish..."
Why don’t these old white guys get outraged at weapons manufacturers?  They clearly don’t care what their products do.
How many babies have been killed since 1977….. Millions. Compared to 11.
This physician is a rare breed that kills babies in the third trimester. Truly a sicko. Yet CNN portrays him as a hero in this video. Absolutely disgusting.
"God endorses abortion and gives instructions on how to preform it in Numbers. The Bible also states that life begins after the fist breath is taken and that happens after birth. And the Bible also gives less worth to a fetus than a person. No where does the Bible prohibit, denounce or condemn abortion. Read your Bible and stop adding things that don’t exist."
"How do ppl go from ""mom, keep your baby...we'll help you (really with nothing more than prayers because let's be honest those ppl ain't out here helping these women with longterm resources) - to ""let's just kill the women, the physicians, and possibly someone near the building that was just wrong place/wrong time""?"
So sickening!!!! People have serious mental issues! STOP KILLING BABIES🗣
"To quote former Catholic George Carlin"" They are not PRO-LIFE ,they are ANT- WOMEN""!"
"""If men could become pregnant, abortion would be a Sacrament""!"
"I’d love to see these People give up their time to support abandoned unwanted children. Honestly,its so easy to object to something you have no idea what these women are going through. Dan the clinic protester. Go and adopt children left behind. Howard stern said “If men could give birth you’d find abortion clinics on every street” women will suffer big time and thats b4 we even mention the children feeling unwanted ,because of this dumb stupid law"
"Odd that people who worship God can't handle victims of incest and rape getting an abortion of they want. Didn't God kill all the first born sons of Egypt, send a big flood, issue the Mediterranean Apolocypse? They be cray in the hypocrisy 🙄 Mind your own business is right beautiful, refreshing that people like you are out there! Thank you! ❤️ 🕉"
"The man that said he hopes when he gets to the pearly gates...what... God will what say we'll done my good and faithful servant?  Noooo my Bible says judge not it also says he who is without sin cast the first stone and love thy neighbor It also says we're all sinners filthy Rags. So where these people get the idea that there doing God's will from is beyond me.  My Jesus already died on the cross for my sins and I belive that.  He also  gave us 10 commandments to follow and between the  old and new testaments he only asked one (1) thing from all of us and that was to....
*Remember the Sabbath day and keep it Holy*  that's it everything is our choice bc he gave us  *Free Will*   He didn't tell us there was a *sliding scale on sin*  he said we were all *born into sin* And I believe *My God is all knowing*  the alpha and Omega. These self righteous hypocrites gone bust *Hell wide Open*   Jesus didn't have a problem with Mary Magdelon and he was the son of God. Jesus died on the cross for all our sins. So when the man in this video gets to the *pearly gates*  he might hear him say I said it on the cross *they know what they do*  This guy will be beyond the forgive them father  part.
Sad 😔 smgdh these self righteous folks are something else."
shelly needs something else to do someone help her
"Those nuts are always smiling, but boy, do they turn on a dime, and they get very belligerent very quickly."
"Here’s an idea!  Have a family law attorney draw up a template form “Pre-Natal Adoption Contract” that women who want an abortion can download and print out before the go to the clinic.  The Contract should specify that the protestor who offers to adopt the woman’s baby if she will carry it to term MUST adopt and care for the child and pay for ALL future and unknown medical expenses of the child, pay for ALL the woman’s pre-natal care, including any and all extraordinary and/or life-saving interventions should the mother experience complications at any time during pregnancy, childbirth, or in the ninety days postpartum, guarantee the woman’s income if she is unable to work (or chooses not to work or is put on bed rest by her doctor) during pregnancy, pay for all care, maintenance, and education of the child including college, and legally adopt the child with no possibility of “return” of the child should the burden of raising a child with severe health conditions or disabilities prove too “overwhelming” for the adoptive parents, that they will never interfere with the woman after they take custody of the baby, or make financial demands upon her, or publish the fact that she is the mother of their legally adopted child, and that if the child should die for any reason after the contract is signed, including at any time during the pregnancy, they will bear the total cost of last illness, funereal, and burial costs.  The pro-life protesters who are so eager to adopt the babies of these women seeking abortions can just sign on the dotted line right then and there, et voila!!  They get what they want.  The woman will not have the abortion, and the protesters will bear the entire personal and financial and social cost of raising said child.  The mother will have all of her prenatal care taken care of and be compensated if she needs to quit her job in order to sustain the pregnancy.  She will be given any necessary life-saving medical interventions required if she experiences complications, and the adoptive parents will bear the entire financial, social, and personal cost of the pregnancy and the cost that the woman would ordinarily endure as a result of NOT having an abortion.  Then, if said pro-life protesters suddenly get “cold feet” when confronted with the very real opportunity of adopting a baby about to be aborted, and when confronted with the reality of just how much it will cost them financially, and back away from their offer to adopt said baby, well, the woman can simply say, in a very matter-of-fact manner, “Then shut the f—- up.”  And march, head held high, into the clinic and do what she needs to do to protect her own life, health, and financial future.  Also of these la di dah pro-life protesters have a very fluffy, romanticized, Donna Reed vision of what having a child means.  For a woman who already knows that the child she is carrying has anomalies incompatible with life, or who cannot take care of the children she already has, and whose husband is too much of an oaf to use a condom or have a vasectomy, she is the one who knows exactly how much that child will cost her, and whether or not she can absorb that cost."
Thank you Shelley!
You don't have children or are a pedophile probably look them up cause it's nobodies busniness
You have a right to your choice and I have a right to mine
Jesus F. Christ!  Those asswipes need to get off welfare & get themselves a job.

"This is classic CNN tactics. Use all the eccentric, small town people  to push your agenda by painting a vulgar picture of pro-life people."
theses guys should protest against guns like M15 killing real alive people instead of wasting their time bothering people who needs help for abortion.
Pregnancy is 100% preventable
Christianity has killed more people than all of the abortions ever performed. We should go protest church services.
"""Let us help you!"" So aggressive, violent, and heartless."
Yeah how does he explain necessary medical abortions 🤔
"Dan needs to go save some on the living children ones on the street starving, ones abuse homeless."
"They said this doctor performs abortions during the third trimester!? How despicable. I understand there are times, when a baby dies, to save a woman's life, but this isn't considered abortion. The baby is already dead.
 Killing a baby that is that developed because you ""change your mind"", murder.
That is why when you kill a pregnant mother, you are charged with double murder. It is a life, and they have a right to live! You don't want a baby...close your legs!!! You have that choice."
Yet not justifying taking a life but then for what are you saving if there’s a person who has a baby and give it up to a foster home
Not sure it was such a good idea to interview this doctor and put his face in this video
You can at least attempt to loose weight 🙄🙄🙄
They talk about God.. But if you believe in God then you should know that he can do his job and don't need you people doing it.. HE IS GOD YOU ARE A HUMAN.. LEAVE PEOPLE ALONE!!!
The old man who hopes his Maker will be there for him will have a rude awakening; live your own life and let others live their's as they see fit.
Hope Dan's maker holds him responsible for every woman who is murdered by anti abortion bans
Can’t stand listening to men talk about having abortions. They have no business even talking about it. I can’t stop them from thinking about it but I can say they shouldn’t be talking about it. No uterus means no valid opinion.
I hope they are all certified foster parents who prove how much they love kids that need care. Oh wait- nope! huge crisis there. These people care about cell sacks. Not children
Run over the protesters like they run over us when we protest easy peasy
Of course most of it is men but all are crazy
"Now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned, it should become illegal for men to leave pregnant women.  If women can't back out of becoming a parent, men shouldn't be able to either"

It's none of these people business. Women have the right to make their own decisions about their bodies
Only $50 bucks for an assault wow I paid more for a parking ticket what a system we have
Idiots is nobody’s business if you so against it are willing support them financially?
"Protesters take abortion is a violation, yet they have no problem violating other peoples rights."
"His Penis   no longer works  why is he there, and did he take care of his kids? Does he have kids?"
When my kids were little they were horrified by those signs that f ass men and pud stew kneelers. Sickening and disgusting. Hope you're all sent to hell
I wonder when we will stop letting rural Americans ruin everything?  I say NOW.
Ask these people how many unwanted children they have adopted.
"Lol, tell me what I'll remember? I remember the love, safety and appreciation I felt for my dad when he took me to get an abortion as a teen. He saved my future, and I wouldn't have ever been able to have my beautiful daughter that I chose as an adult to have. So I don't remember the abortion very well, never met any fetus, I remember the relief."
God freaks
I saw this video many years ago. She is Great! God bless her strength!
How are you gonna be pro life and go out and kill others
judgemental power tripping white men.
i Love this Queen!!!! Power to her and the Women of Our Country.   down with power tripping entitled creeps >>>
What is happening in the Supreme Court is really scary why do they think it’s okay to take away the rights of women over their life and body and I personally don’t like adoration but I have no rights over another humans life choices period and to protest this with violence is utterly stupid
What’s going on in the states is really scary they are going backwards the Supreme Court is a joke now reverse a lot more then just abortion
do these same people protest the NRA;  to save actual live kids
"How long will the protests help? For 18 years? Will they support them financially? Will they babysit or pay for their child support? Will they provide medical assistance? Etc. Etc. Etc.

Getting them to keep the baby is the easy step, the next many, many, years are the toughest steps."
These protesters violate a person's right to privacy. Gross.
"They claim to want to protect life, but she had to look for bombs or anything that might kill or hurt the patients or the staff. WTF"
This doesn't make me side with abortionist.. If anything it make me see how many people feel the way I do. These people are not evil.
So
Was that doctor really murdered though??? Or was it just considered a late term abortion?😂🤣

This makes me wanna have an abortion immediately.
"The Catholic woman doesn't realize it. But said it best She wants the women to have the right to choose life. Well, that means that they have a choice to choose the other path as well. The path of righteousness is not righteous if forced. Without the consequence of choice, there's only bitterness in obligation. Religious people are absolutely backwards."
"Standing outside of an abortion clinic ? 
Dude, you are weeks too late !

- guys treat every woman with respect,
- take responsibility for each and every action,
- get a vasectomy
- there is no honour in creating a ‘fatherless’ child.
- do want the title of “that bastard’s daddy” ???

If you have testicles, please try to grow some ‘balls’ !"
Nothing says PRO LIFE like harassing living people and threatening them 😂
"They need to post a guard at all 4 corners armed with AK 47's and a fence. Let them drive in the gate and close it and leave those entitled busybodies on the outside of it. The nerve of these people to think they have the right to  interject themselves into a stranger's family planning decisions. These are the same people who then turn around and talk about and penalize mothers who can't take care of the children and have to go on welfare. They don't want their tax dollars to go to them. When the pro life crowd clear out all the orphanages and unwanted, neglected kids in foster care, then come talk to me until then, they need to STFU and mind their business."
"Prayer doesn't work, ask them if you can adopt the babies."
If these portestors cared about children why aren't they adopting them from foster care? The system is full of them. Why not donate half of their check to the poor to help children? Those hypocrites would never do that. I commend Shelly for helping poor women.
"Men need to STFU, women beyond bearing age, that’s another issue, but men have no skin in the game and it’s just ridiculous"
"The we will by you a bag of diapers and a can of formal crowd is no better than the we want your unborn baby but not the ones currently waiting for adoption bunch. A few meager hand out then you're on your own,  medical bills,  food, clothing,  daycare well you dregs of society need to pull yourself up by your boot straps."
All these we'll adopt your baby folk are shallow we don't want used kids hypocrites. There are tens of thousands of kids waiting for adoption in America alone not to mention hundreds of thousands to millions worldwide but they want the new puppy not those at the pound.
You need sports moms out there yelling over the protester azzholes
"The issue is that these anti-abortion people believe with all their hearts they are in the right and they are defending babies.  With that in mind you can see how it can escalate to violence, especially if they already have some other stresses or mental imbalance.
I honestly wish they had something better to do with their lives than harassing strangers and offering prayers."
"CNN, ladies and gentlemen! What great example of framing."
And might I add how brave those women are especially in today's hate driven climate. They are literally risking their lives to protect their fellow woman. I applaud you all. Truly
People with nothing better to do harassing people. That is terrible 😢
You need protection.
The part where they have to escort the women to the stairs made me cry. The fear and shame they must feel that never should be. Republicans are one step closer to getting the theocracy they've always longed for. If we don't get off our butts and put these traitors in their place like this woman then we can kiss our democracy goodbye.
"Jesus would be ashamed of these folks. Blessed are the meek, they hall inherit the earth."

It's pro-birth not pro-life. Once the fetus takes it's first breath their concern for it's health and welfare  disappears almost immediately.
"People do know why woman abort! They’ve been fed with the lie that their babies are not human. They are just an inconvenience to 78% of woman who abort. If you’re going to support abortion, do it bravery, don’t lie and tell it like it is for these women: and inconvenience. If you’re willing to have unprotected sex, be responsible enough to face the consequences and don’t run like the coward who kill a child that can’t defend himself"
"Hipocracy is amazing: complaints about killing of 11 people since 1977, when during the same time about 50 million babies has also been killed (NO! They’re NOT rubbery fetus.

Trolling used to perfection. Well done.
We need more people like her
When my girlfriend decided to get an abortion I remember coming out of the clinic with her afterwards and some A hole was holding a sign up of a baby in pieces . She didn’t need to see that. These people are voicing their opinions according to what they believe. Doesn’t seem on the same level at all. Pro choice protesters can be pretty brutal as well . Just saying to be fair and not hypocritical.🤷🏽‍♂️ Why would CNN even air this ?
"YOU are AMAZING! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for being there, in the hardest moments in a pregnant woman's life. Thank you for standing in the line of fire, making those distractions and being that strength of reassurance so she can make it inside safely- giving some honor to her after she's made the hardest decision of her life. Thank you isn't even close to the praise you deserve for ALL you do for these women already in such incredible pain."
What a beautiful person she is. Very very well done
Someone get that lady a bullhorn
"We're not animals nor your slaves, you can not control us woman"
Thank you for what you do!
Bless you
What about the children that's already born being killed in a place of learning. They don't give a damn  about that. I believe a person should have a  right to do what they want with their bodies. I don't see these them a protest at the NRA headquarters about the mass gun violence in America. One born they are just an image and is not protected. There are a lot of children in the United States  that are hungry and malnourished. They have did everything to cut funds to help with  that part. Land of the free for who??? That is my question.

I would like to know how many of those anti abortion protestors are adopting children.
What a great woman. You are my hero
"The guy that said he's been ""in this movement since 73"" is almost absolutely an outright liar.  The pro-life movement wasn't formed until the late 70's / early 80's, with Frank Schaeffer's propaganda films."
They help till the fetus develops into a baby then is born. Then they’re no where to be found.
Dont think shes gonna have to worry about having an abortion any time soon lol
Abortion needs to be between a woman and her doctor safely and needs to be protected by HIPAA laws. It's sucks we have  these clinics where these women get harassed instead of going to their own doctor's office.
"Lol bombs planted by ""prolife"" people lmao"
Is this a repost?
I wish someone would’ve been more vocal to me to change my mind so many years ago
Somebody please tell these men this issue doesn't concern them. I can not believe a man would go to a women's health clinic and yell at the patients. Can women have one area where men don't get to yell at us. I don't care what these guys do with their penises.
Third trimester abortion unbelievable!
"Telling someone else that she is beautiful and will miss her baby is wrong?  The only person who is derogatory is her.  The only one being aggressive is her.

It's really gross that she is that arrogant and indifferent and acting like she's above it all.  No, bombings, attacks, and murder should not happen to anyone protesting or working there but the people being shown are innocently trying to sway someone in to making a different decision.  They have every right to do so.  She could potentially bring negative reactions upon herself by trying to provoke people like she has in these videos.  She is on the offensive not defensive in this video."
"I hate the contrast that it’s either-or, like black and white and pretending that there are no better solutions to these issues. 
How about better care for our children, how about explaining to them, not just about condoms but about the consequences of unprotected sex? 
How about providing free contraceptives specifically IUDs and vasectomies? 
How about advocating against hook-up one-night stand culture? 
There is a lot we can do to reduce abortions if society would care collectively not some biblical nonsense and not some feminist “my body my choice” crackhead. Both of you are wrong on how you approach this subject."
They say they are prolife but you have to check for bombs?
"3rd trimester abortion is disgusting, what made her wait that long to do abortion in third trimester? Can abortion clinics provide free IUDs? Especially to repeated clients?"
Looks like she's out of a job now. Probably didn't see that coming.
🤔
"Shelly is FANTASTIC. As are the others who are there to help these women. 
The world needs more of them."
"Notice these zeolites are all from  Trump based ""Poorly educated""  Red states."
Joe tripping...
Isn’t this a vice story? Lol cnn just copy and pasted the video and slapped their logo on it
"Interesting how ya'll don't give this much attention and sensationalism to all the pro-life clinics and government buildings that are under attack by pro-choice mobs. It's almost like yall are trying to push a certain narrative, while suppressing literal terrorism (in the name of tolerance, of course) .. 🤔"
Radical evangelical Christian nut jobs.
What about the half million kids in shitty Residential Treatment Centers how are u helping them
I don't believe that 90 percent of abortions performed are due to rape and incest. It's done because the women don't want to be inconvenienced with having to raise a kid.
"This woman is really disgusting... And just a little FYI, millions of babies have been murdered because of abortion."
What's even better being broadcasted on tik tok are all the videos I see of liberals trashing capitol buildings all over country spraying spray paint attacking civilians u are such sweet innocent ppl aren't you lmao
Time to Tax all churches!!
Why are the PENIS' put there?? Its NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS!!
I'm just curious and I may be wrong but how many children has Dan adopted and raised and supported by himself without any state or government assistance has anybody asked Dan this question yet if not someone needs to tell Danny he ain't got a dog in the fight he needs to take some of them babies home and take care of them that he loves so much and that are so beautiful and it are so wanted by everybody tell Dan to take him home take care of them
Whats with the rainbow umbrella
Big fucking deal….these people need to be dealt with better than that
"""11 people have murder......"" what about the 63 million preborn people that have been murder in these places? What doesn't CNN do a special on that?!"
I just don't recall seeing this when trump was messing up our country but all of a sudden they care now but didn't care enough to wear a mask to protect children gtfoh trump supporters u are clown's
Putting their faces on tik tok without their consent is illegal. But you are actually advertising them so this is a benefit for them.
TIC TOC STEALS YOUR INFO FOR CHINA THEY OWN IT..
Creepy ignorant busy bodies that feel that need to push their uneducated beliefs on the rest of the world.
God will send him straight to hell
lol 'nobody asked you' .
My favorite part about tik tok is how cool it is.
You are so shameful Shelly. Advocating for murder. May GOD have mercy on you one day you will have to answer for it. We all will be judged
Supreme Court - we own your hoohoos
Much respect to her. Those christo-fascists need to piss off.
One brave and just woman.  Proud of you!
Enough peace and patience already. It's been done and look where we are. We need the goons with the blammers. We gotta exercise our 2nd amendment. (Bird call) 🕊️ 🐔
Where are these protesters when the children need food on their table?  When the mothers can't afford child care?  A B S E N T
these Women who can do this Job to help kill unborn babies are Evil and its worst than Vet-techs putting 100-200 animals down each Day . In Michigan 7-8 % African American Women Population are responsible for over 50% of the Abortions made yearly . Nation wide over 1 Million Babies being killed each year and having My Tax money go to this evil dead is Wrong. If Women want to abort a Pregnancy there are herbs and such things that they would use 2K years ago . Why have a Doctor rip it out  of you piece by piece and use your Fetal tissue cells to make vaccines.
A true angel. Keep up the great work.
"SUCH A VAST CONTRAST BETWEEN the ANTI-ABORTION protestors DEMEANOR and the PRO-ABORTION. 

Anti-war so much NICER, CALMER,  NONTHREATENING, REASONABLE...hoping to give someone a bit of realization and see their true value.  And the PRO- WOW, SCREAMING, HATEFUL, THREATENING, CUSSING, ATTACKING PEOPLE. 

And the clinic attacks that occurred DECADES AGO are not the norm and do not occur like the PRO ARE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY"
"I want to know the psychological reasons these people are so against someone else who is making choices for themselves and their bodies? It's a fascist ideology to want to control over others, their bodies, and thier life decisions."
I can’t imagine how creepy it must be to hear some random middle-aged dude calling you “Mom” or “Mommy”. My heart goes out to those patients and their escorts.
The young lady who escorts patients  is very brave.
"Seem to be a lot of weird people with nothing better to do.
Wonder if they'd be so excited about black or Mexican women. My guess is no."
Classic poster of a Democrat loser. Overweight and a human being killer
"""We're here to help you""... but won't disclose her name."
"I find it funny that all of these pro-forced-birth people automatically assume that the fetus wants to be born, regardless of any circumstances.  The fetus could be deaf, blind, and limbless, and these idiots would say it wants to be born.  I honestly question why ANYONE would want to be born right now.  We have hyper-polarization of politics (worst in the U.S., but to a lesser extent worldwide) that is getting worse, not better; steady removal of rights in the U.S., wealth disparity in the U.S. resulting in increased homelessness and inability to afford food; not-infrequent school shootings in the U.S., Russia's war against Ukraine which is impacting the entire world, Russia's threats of nuclear war against the entire world, climate change that is literally making the world unlivable, and this little thing called SARS-CoV-2 that people pretend has gone away, but hasn't.  Only a masochist or a sadist would actually want to be born into this wold right now."
Woe is them. What will they do with their time now that roe V wade is overturned.
Religion cannot dictate human rights
The only people being rude are the abortion clinic workers lol
It doesn’t seem like the people are being mean or even rude…. They’re telling them that there’s another option. What’s wrong with choosing life?
I went there for birth control once and was swarmed by crazy women who wanted to adopt my baby I didn’t have yet they wouldnt listen to me or let me leave just kept ranting on and on about how much they love babies was is creepy
"Many more babies are going to die without this ruling,isn't that the point? Isn't it ironic that the very topic of death as it relates to the life bearer when life receiver are intertwined and at one point the life bearer was the life receiver. You see the Communist Democratic part of the U.S. can't see the santity of human life so they desensitize and segregate the life that is inside. This is all part of secular humanism which is Satanism."
"The Pro-Life movement is not really a Pro-Life movement, the are just Pro-Birth, because once the baby is born, they could not give a shit about the child. They are not pro expanding Welfare benefits for poor people or single moms, they are not pro public education and free college education, they are not pro universal healthcare. Once the baby is born, ""you're own your own and don't be a moocher"". They are even for raped little girls, the product of incest, having the baby. They are disgusting, really."
she is great; but what's with those creepy old men telling women what to do?
Christian Facist
Shelly needs to be careful there is crazy people out there
What a evil woman
Love this woman.
"Abortion facilitators were one children; it's wrong to commit violence against them. Vid: ""Since 1977, 11 people were killed in abortion attacks.""   Also, since 1977, over  *59,603,131*  Babies have been Aborted in the U.S.  [according to Guttmacher Institute]"
"So ending the lives of babies is more important than, let's say correcting the wrongs of the past. like REPARATIONS"
"Funny. Not one of the “protesters” were berating or violent or broke windows or spray painted threats. There was no profanity or shaming going on. Yet the clinic workers acted like they were threatened by a 70 year old man who never raised his voice. 

Moral of this story is that if you support abortion you are free to destroy private property, threaten Supreme Court justices and even attempt to end their lives but if you don’t support abortion you can’t calmly stand outside a clinic and say anything without being treated as a threat. 

For liberals you can only have “free” speech if you agree with the liberal opinion. All others must be silenced in the name of “free” speech. FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS FREEDOM TO SPEAK.

For liberals you can only have democracy when every votes liberal. If you don’t your vote shouldn’t count or you should be silenced. This is liberal democracy. It’s like racism for politics. People that aren’t like you aren’t real people. They’re more like 3/5 of a person. Sound familiar? 

Read your history books! The Democratic Party supported slavery. The Republican Party was created to fight slavery. Republicans voted a black man to congress decades before democrats did. It’s right there for you to read. Now they’re calling republicans the racists? 

Oh and did you get the part where this doctor performed THIRD TRIMESTER ABORTIONS? That’s when the baby kicks and moves around. Thats when they can be born and still survive outside the womb. 

Does that mean that all of these late term abortions were life threatening to the mother? If that were the case shouldn’t we find out why that’s happening? How many of these late term abortions are because of a “change of heart”? 

So murder is when you take a “clump of cells” that made its way out of the womb (“born”) and cut it into pieces.  Even if it were just out of the womb a few seconds. 

Cut up that same “clump of cells “  a few minutes  prior and you are praised for performing an abortion. This is the position of the liberals."
Maybe just stop killing babies
What is this? Escort acting like a victim as she victimized women and babies!
People complain about why kill a beautiful life if it can become the next world changer or life is god’s gift but they are in denial of the bigger picture. The fetus is aborted for a reason if it is horned into the world without decent care wouldn’t they actually hurting the world and the baby more? Like it he irony of it. Pro-life but support weapons that easily kill life? Like?
"Nobody asked any of these busybodies their opinion.  The woman yelling, ""We will help you!""  Name the list of the children this woman has raised and helped.  How many is she up to?"
"I am pro choice. 4 choices specifically.
1. Abstinence
2. Contraception
3. Motherhood
4. Adoption
I just can’t support the 5th… murder"
"She shouldn't have a problem, I'm mean who would want to shag that anyway."
Just hire a sniper to kneecap each protester. Enough BS. That one guy said he was doing this since 1973 ! Since when is it even legal to harass people for 50 years ???
"So an anti abortionist who ""believes"" in human life, is willing to take life?"
"Just watch, the day I'm Republicans will do nothing to create programs to support these poor women going through hell. I can't stand liars and hypocrites more than any other kind of people in this world. So no I don't like very many politicians, if any.  I don't agree with the policies of someone like Liz Cheney, but I would vote for her over many others just because of her integrity. 
The pendulum always swings to the extremes, the backlash that will happen from all this alt right-wing bullshit will completely change the country, thank God.
Imagine, if Lincoln had lived. It's highly likely we would not be facing, civil war part 2. What I don't understand is I thought everybody watched Star Wars and Star Trek; if they did, they would have recognized the orange headed orangutan is emperor Palpatine."
when you're a judgemental bigot who delusionalally believes you are doing god's will you don't have to try and put yourself in the other person's shoes - it's literally one o' the easiest things for the inhumane to do...
Abortion is murder...by definition. It is killing an infant human being inside the womb.
"It’s truly a sad day in our country. I’m a disabled dude. I’m here because of women. Women were the trailblazers. From the women right to vote,civil rights act,Womens reproductive rights,disabilities rights act & LBGQTI+ rights. 
I’m hoping to wake up and say: oh thank goodness it was just a horrible nightmare. 

From human rights & corporations attacking movies we love.👈🏻This is a sad day. Hopin it’s all one horrible nightmare."
"Not to mention the consequences (like mental illness)that can imply having a child you don’t want bcuz of whatever reason. The child can be given to the grandparents, or pass on to whoever the mother thinks is “suitable” to take care of the child except for her. The child will grow with so much anger, resentment, or grow up to be successful who knows. Is all correlated."
"Also, these protesters have been brainwashed by a Bible that is not accurate! They are reading scriptures and twisting them to fit their narrative  and interpreting what they want. It's so sad because they don't even know they are and therefore are not interested in learning. If you do not listen, you will never learn. A lot of these people think they know everything about it."
These anti abortion lunatics are incredibly hypocritical. They claim to care so much about life that they get up early every morning to harass women for their choices instead of getting up every morning to actually help people in need like the homeless women and children all over America. Why don’t they expend their energy helping humans who actually need help instead of attempting to force their fake religious beliefs down the throats of women who don’t believe in their ideologies.
"So why don't clinics have a pickup/drop off spot near the clinic, maybe a block or two away (change the pickup/drop-off spot regularly)  have a vehicle waiting, offer the ladies ear plugs, drive each lady right up to the front door of the clinic, then do the same afterwards? Why are these women forced to walk in front of the protesters?"
Children without healthcare or good schools or food are more of a concern than abortion.
Ha ha... abortion clinic escort hasn't an abortion clinic to escort anyone to anymore. 🤣🤣🤣
"Prayers do not cover rent. Prayers dont buy food. Prayers dont provide transportation for a child. Prayers do not raise a child. The choice should always be up to a woman to decide what's best, and that may include prayers. However, the prayer cult harassment needs to stop."
"If you are performing abortions in the third trimester you aren't a champion for women's rights you are a killer of a viable baby.  You want an abortion, get it in the first trimester."
CNN reposting old contact 😂
Thank you Shelly!
I have one question for all of them are you willing to become a foster parent to take care of these children when the parent don’t want them the answer is NOOOOO  this is something that is between them in the man above or who ever you believe in not your business
By day carrying a anti abortion sign.....now is is giggling with anticipation as he tries to be a rapist by night
"So all these people think they are better than the God they claim to worship...God is pro abortion, He told His priests how to perform abortions on the wives of jealous husbands."
"Abortion is a big deal these days as the world turns, but what I cannot yet figure out is why the women don't just practice birth-control, with medical pills and procedures, instead of using Abortion's as the only way? One is wisely preventative and the other is foolishly applied cruelty to the babies and the baby lovers, who have to hear, see and know of the horrors. Not to forget that the God-believing, loving people are horrified at this unnecessary, belated solution of an unwanted human Pregnancy. Some of the Animal Rights people are more humane then these Abortion-thumpers. There are many parents that are begging for the opportunity to adopt a baby, all the while they are being flushed down the proverbial toilet and what a shame to lose them to the Abortion-Cults. How many times have we hoped for beneficial help for the planet, only to have that talent Aborted before it came to exist, mature and do its planned repair/aid? Maybe Einstein, Nicola Tesla or George Washington should have been Aborted?"
Love how the anti abortion people are old or people who Aren't having sex anyway
Well if they care so much won’t they offer to adopt??
And it’s so funny to me !!! That all those men protesting!!!
"Whats the big deal about abortion who wants to have sex with this man haters ,look fat and look like a guy. My question is what guy wants this females?"
This is the reason that Christians suck. They get $1 trillion worth of tax breaks every 12 years. That’s fucked up. It’s time to end tax exempt status for fake Christian churches. Separation of church and state my ass. Christians are authoritarian fascists. They are complicit in violence against women.
Anti  choicers
"Are the same people who fought tireless to ban abortions going to fight tirelessly for food stamps, school breakfast programs,  after school activities, and stricter child support laws?

Or are they going to say,  move on to banning birth control, then gay rights, and revert back to the 50's where black people cant vote,  woman have little say, and maybe kids can work in sweat shops for pennies?"
Walking you to the clinic is not help if you’re gonna end up killing children. It’s funny how the  same rainbow colors that can’t make babies due to choice wanna kill our children! Truly misery loves company! Just terrible
"Yeah, because killing babies is a great thing to do!  You people are sick!  I use to be Pro-Choice until they went to far.  NO ONE should be able to get an abortion after 12 weeks.  Keep it sane people!"
We shouldn’t be pandering to those that believe in the supernatural.
"Looking at America from the outside, i don't understand two things:
Why are some constitutional rights OK to overturn (such as the 14th,  regarding abortions)
While others will get your death threats if you even casually mention it ( 2nd,  guns )

the next question is:  when will the United States stop pretending it doesn't mix church with state, when there are very clear undeniable examples of it,  such as the overturning of Roe v Wade?"
Story as told by women who were not aborted.
I usually just flip them off
Let's be real you have a lot of nasty people out there that have unprotected sex everyday and basically gets abortions every 2 weeks those are the ones that are upset 😄😄😄😄
"All you bible thumpers out there demanding people live your way.. Remember this.. God made humans with the ability to choose.. God wants humans to choose to live his/her way.. Not force people to live that way.. If that is what he/she wanted.. to force humans to live his/her way God would have made it that way.. And it would have been written in the bible.. You are supposed to SHARE the word of God.. Not forcibly make people listen and follow the word of God.. You can CHOOSE to live God's way or CHOOSE to live the way as God put it, of the world.. 🐧"
"I have never seen these people standing outside of the WIC office or Medicaid for all this HELP they claim they provide, such BS."

what a hero!!! she escorts women to a place where babies are killed !! yes!!
And how much money have all of these people given to the health n care of the born children n Moms. ??   Put your money we’re your mouth is. This is a heart breaking act for any woman!!!  I’m

I'm with her.
"Stupid churchies, how many adopt, or assist raising the unwanted embryos"
"She can only do her ""work"" because she  was not killed by abortion.  How about some self-realization,  sweetheart.  Do you escort the dead babies out the door after the abortions."
These pro-lifers AKA Nazis are out of there Effin minds …
"“Since 1977, at least 11 people have been killed”. 
How about the millions of children that has been murdered?"
"I'm Pro Choice but I respect the protesters ...God Bless them for fighting for what they believe in ...it is powerful to hear them call out ""Hey Mom"" ....Good and honorable work by the escorts too ....Zulu"
Do it!! You're awesome!
These are sad depressing times.   😢
Thank you for protecting women making their OWN decisions.
I would ask how many children these ppl have adopted. How much child support they pay to the women they have kept away from clinics.   Funny how they use god and the Bible.   The Bible advocates to abort a pregnancy just for the suspicion of adultery.
"Where they are known, don't withhold names!  Video of the self-righteous is not enough: name names!"
"old white guy telling women what to do, great..."
"So, women of compromised pregnancies: 
Here's another angle: women, if you
are compromised, think of all the DNA
lawsuits to claim support payments
and, more so, claims to property
inheritances, etc. perhaps this
invasion of your property and rights
can be turned into lemonade? More
so, hold those forceful lords
accountable and expose them! This could go so far"
"White Old men who couldn't even purchase a sandwich let alone foster one of these ""babies"""
"This is all religion's fault.... these people are so blinded by it, they feel they have ""the obligation"" fuck that... will they finance the newborn? will they care after afterward? doubt it!!"
Hand them adoption applications or ask them to donate to help women who can't afford to take care of their children. Put your money where your mouth is people. If you don't want abortion as a choice then you need to provide an appropriate alternative that solves the issues that may lead to that choice rather than deny a woman's basic human right to sovereignty over her own body.
They should open a mental health clinic next to every abortion clinic so they can help anti-abortionists with their neuroses.
"First of all it baffling how we allowed the anti-choice movement to seemingly create the abortion narrative.  The vast majority of these people are pro-birth not pro-life. Additionally they have proven time and time that they couldn't get less about the women who are pregnant. They only care about the fetus, the majority of those who are pro-birth aren't that concerned with what happens to the child after it has been  delivered."
"Instead men  who don't have any part in the carrying of babies to go through that ordeal n most of the times its their male partner insist to dem having the abortion. Women are secondary citizens to men, they are our life companion, the side of the coin. Anti-abortionist don't really care about children if they did they would supporting the childrens at orphanage that really need their love n support."
"Until people start confronting these right-wing bullies in mass, this move to the ultra-right will continue. They don't want a functioning democracy."
"For those people using their BIBLES as an excuse for this monstrous decision to take away women's 14th amendment rights, how about you actually READ THE DAMN THINGS??""

""Life begins at birth with the first breath"" = Genisis 2:7

""Fetuses are not persons"" = Exodus 21: 22-25

""Fetuses should be aborted as proof of adultery""  Numbers = 5 : 11 - 31

""Life is not sacred, the soul is.""  Deuteronomy 28: 18 - 24"
Lol these old men that can't have children tell other people what to do. I just can't. Lmfao.
"So dis man thinks he has the right to tell women wat they can with their bodies, wat kind of misogyny crap is dis, no 1 stops a from getting vasectomy but here they telling women not to, we men of no place in women issues period, y don't they invest their time n money  at orphanage if they care so much about children. Show women dat if they ave d babies dat they will have a support system."
"If I was a Dr, I'd take that target off his back..."
"Unless you're going to adopt every child in foster care, shut up. My family does foster care and they system is overburdened and flawed... it's necessary, but not optimal. None of these potential children are alive if you consider that it's not considered a live birth until the air sacs in the lungs expand. How long until I'm sentenced for discarding tampons?"
"Even worse than what happens outside the abortion clinics is what happens inside! All you woman need to watch an abortion. It's absolutely disgusting!!!  CNN loves to Race bait but they won't tell you When Eugenicist William Gates Sr Bill Gate's Pops financed and helped start Planned Parenthood he located 90 % of them within walking distance of a minority community mostly Black neighborhoods and this was done strategically! Out of every 1000 black babies are born  450 are aborted!!! Blacks make up 13% of the population and account for 40% of the abortions!!! CNN always has an agenda.  Propaganda all day, every day!! Divide and Conquer, and Order out of Chaos are there motos."
Some of those anti abortion people really make a case for abortion
"If you don't like abortion, don't have one"
Their focus is self righteousness and telling other people what to do according to their beliefs.  Dan is a twerp.  And how many of these people contribute financially every month for years to these unborn children?  This is basically an attempt to punish women for having sex. Particularly if Thomas has his way and eliminates birth control.
"In the same time the court rule in two cases 
First case you do not have control over my Gun
Second case I have control over your body (you do not have control over your body)
This is why the Christian democrats don't want Christian hypocrite to rule this country, so we do not go to the Stone Age like Iran, Afghanistan….etc.

"The Dominionist Court imposing Dominionist Christianity upon US all against our will. The Great Raping of America. 

Because to the right wing authoritarians, dead women are ALWAYS acceptable collateral damage to their theocratic ends."
"""Their right to choose""  Right out of the anti abortion protestors mouth.  You prefer they choose life...great, but it's their choice.  The theocratic SCOTUS is making that much more difficult.  Enforcing church rule in the US will lead to violence.  The US is suppose to be a country where you're free to choose.  Removing that freedom is removing the soul of this country.  You can hate it, but it's not your choice what others do.  You choose to stand outside and harrass people...great.  Leave the rest of the world alone."
Keep it up girl! It’s our right!!!!!!!!!
These people could give a damn for live children.
what about protesting against fire arms To protect children
"The lady actually said their focus ""is for the women and the children and right to choose life"" I want an abortion so they will do everything they can to prevent me from getting an abortion. Got it, thanks."
Cristofascist are making our Democracy disappear.
"Republicans are true hypocrites of the century! Pro-life while as well anti-guns control. They are more eager to protect unborn so that they can kill them with guns when they go to school or shopping mall! So, the foetus are more worth to die when they are grown instead or what are their conscience in all this nonsense?! Can they be so uproaring against guns as they are about abortion rights? They're really blood thirsty to see more adults' death than foetus! Bloodsuckers Republicans calling themselves Christians!"
"good for this brave young woman. These people have no right to impose  their limited belief system. They are not even aware they are pawns in the struggle of greed and control by the extremist, facist, fake Christian Taliban."
How many babies have these old men who feel they have to guilt trip women who they don't know or care about.
No man had a right to question a woman's right to her body... Men need to just shut up and leave the female issues to a female.

"Talk about a life with meaning and meaningful work. I would walk with you if I could and if I lived there I would do everything I could to be hired so that I could work alongside you. Bless you. Because we all know that these people couldn't care less about these zygotes, referring to first trimester procedures. The arrogance of these old white men shown here thinking that they should have any say whatsoever in what happens to the bodies of women they don't even know and don't care about and would rather see die. They don't know if they were raped, the women they address who are walking in, they don't know if they have some health condition which would result in pregnancy making their life a risk. Look I was on the pill at 19, took it 100% perfectly and still got pregnant. Yes I'm one of those whom my doctor calls The Superfertile and I I just been dumped by the baby's father because I was pregnant and he wasn't done having fun, we were both in college full time, living in the dorms and I was also working 30 hours a week in addition to maintaining a 4.0 average. I did a lot of thinking, after getting over my initial shock wondering how this happened when I was absolutely on point with my daily pill taking. If I hadn't been able to get an abortion~which still took me several years to emotionally heal from because I've always wanted to be a mother, and of course I'm a mother now but back then I was just not in a position to be able to be a full-time mom and there's no other kind of mom I would ever want to be. Wh atI'm trying to say is if a woman chooses abortion~and I'm even disgusted that I have to defend this in the first place there should be no ""discussion""about this in the first place, this is a medical and health decision that can be made by one person and one person only because only one person would have to carry a pregnancy and give birth and go through all of that and only one person is going to be caring for and raising that child forever, don't even for a minute think it's just 18 years cuz that's a laugh and anybody who's the parent of a child older than that knows it

I would tell those old white guys if they would be 100% on board with me deciding`~a woman they Don't know and will never know~if they should have a vasectomy or not. Or whether if they've had one it should be reversed. Or not. 

SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS...ON  A SCALE OF 10, lol, how would they like ME making those decisions for THEM????"
Hey anti abortion protesters: GOD HATES HAGS. have fun in hell.
Are they not protesting without a permit...why are they not arrested
"They're just trolls who get off on their self righteousness. 🙄
Hey, religious people... your religion is like a penis. You can be proud of having one, but unless someone asks about it, keep it to yourself."
"I bet you’re not reporting on the pro-abortionist rioters who attacked state capitols in VT and AZ. The pregnancy centers fire bombed, vandalized, and burned. Crickets."
These morons are disturbing customers ..lock their asses up... Fi e them charge them.... Throw them off the property they are nuts
"I LOVE HER! ""Is that enough? Have you had enough of feeling righteous today?"" 😂❤"
"Let’s assume for the sake of this conversation that God and Jesus is real. A lot of these conservatives, and pro life people, are going to be mighty damn surprised to find that they’re not getting into heaven, because none of these people actually follow the teachings of Jesus."
Thank god  for the Supreme Court !  What could be more violent than abortion ?
These jerks are publicly harassing people ..why are the cops not doing their jobs.. it is a crime to threaten harass or in anyway. To imped the rights of another .... If I walked up to people going in or coming out of a church and said ... You people are crazy you people are totally insane morons to believe that nonsense.. Does anyone really believe I would nit be arrested..in minutes ..what's the difference?
"Jesus started a ministry that caters to the free will of the unbelievers, 
Read the 10th chapter of Matthew, christians were commanded to shake off the dust off of their feet when they were not welcomed, but never to interfere in the rights of others, read it yourselves.
No where in the bible does it say, we must interfere with what others are doing, that comes from satan."
"It’s fine with me for anyone to have their religious beliefs but confronting anyone that does not share that conviction is just wrong. If you do not know that person and their situation you cannot judge, leave them alone. This conduct is exactly why people are leaving churches in droves, there is no human connection, you are just condemned if you do not fall in line with the brainwashing program, do not dare to question or your left wing trash!"
"Christians were comanded to mind their own business and these are fake christians and busibobies in others affairs.
The bible condenms both of these actions.
Christians are suposed to obey God's commandments.
Revelation 22:11"
Yes I’m pro choice.. As a man I have no right telling a woman what she can do with her body. I just wanna ask the anti choice people what have you done for unfortunate children? You only seem to care while the the woman goes thru the pregnancy process.. Once that child is out the womb you give no fucks what happens.. This is also another reason I Do Not follow NO RELIGION… The Best and Worst people in World history have followed the same Book or Books and came to separate conclusions.. I don’t have time for some ancient writing that when people saw Thunder and Lightning believed some God was raining hell on them.. I simply treat people how I would like to be treated
"You know these anti abortion people could better spend their time volunteering helping poor children by reading to them, playing with them, telling them stories. This way their own lives will be remembered instead of being remembered for screaming at another person. Which is better?"
"Need some girl going in with a few very overly protective Italian brothers, I'm sure they would ""escort"" those protesters off the lot."
"I just have to wonder what women are thinking that need an abortion. Do they not know they had unprotected sex and that's how babies are made?
 With the morning after pill why is there even a need for abortions.
Get caught up in the moment? Stop in at the pharmacy and don't wait and see....just seems to not be very responsible to wait and have to go through this terrible procedure."
Love that Clinic escort lady. Bet none of those Pro life people donate a dime to fund those unwanted babies. Pro life hypocrites
"I wish these protesters would put all their energy and time into things that would lower the demand for abortion instead of harassing people who already need one.  They could work to promote sex education that includes education about contraception and consent.  They could work to make contraception more available.  They could lobby for better health care, child-care, and an increase in welfare and disability to make it easier for women who want to have children to do so.  If these people sincerely believe abortion is murder, why wouldn't they work on lowering the demand for abortions so that less women need them in the first place?  This seriously lowers their credibility."
Jesus would absolutely HATE Dan
Just don’t call them “pro-lifers”
"Dear Shelley, i admire you so much and have your back. i live in Amsterdam so cannot help you in person but i send love and want you to be safe, take care🌷🌷🌷"
It seems ironic that those folks that don't bat an eye at an unborn child being killed is OK but don't want to face the same fate .....if you chose death for someone helpless should you not be treated like a slug also .....
They don’t have to actually do anything or spend anything. They just judge and feel self righteous! They are what’s wrong with our country!
"This is so dumb. If abortion is that important to them, why don’t the Democrats propose an amendment to add to the Constitution protecting abortion rights? They have had 50 years to do it if it matters so much. But they didn’t. Make it constitutional if you want the supreme court to deem it constitutional. All this wahala you guys are giving the wrong people. Why aren’t you giving this hell to the Democrats for not coming up with legislation to defend this so-called right? SCOTUS did their job: simple. So ask your Democratic representatives to finish the job they have been stalling on for 50 years."
Praying for this woman. These people who are out spreading god’s truth and love are needed. More of us need to speak out against the truth of abortion. We are all image bearers of God and life in the womb is exactly that-life.
"How many of these protesters adopt kids, take in foster kids, be a big brother/ sister, take in kids who age out of the system? I bet none."
"If all the women who are/will be pregnant carry to term and put that child up for adoption, will all these protestors adopt all these extra children? Currently there are estimated 117,000 children waiting to be adopted. Those children are ALREADY HERE. We've all heard/read the horror stories of foster care. Let's take care of the kids who need us before adding to the population of abandoned children."
Ironic the the death count is higher from the pro-life side
"They are shells of human beings, useful idiots being used as political pawns in the lust for power."
"Privileged POS, the protesters that is."
Suprise suprise they are all religious fanatics trying to push the christian  version of sharia law ... these people should be locked up
"I REQUEST ZELENSKY 💙 OR PRESIDENT  PUTIN💚 or any christian in the world ❤️ TO ALWAYS THINK  THESE ,,,A,B,C,D,E AND Fs in your life , for a great future 👍
God bless you
Logic of  joy or peace in Life is very lies in a very moral knowledge of  life style.
That's as below
Everytime or every moment  or always when you do not love  ( careful that someone watches you ) the world ( eyes flesh lusts and pride )
You have lot of 
Peace 
Courage
A) God’s Children have no fear of death 💀 
But we will not die unless it is God’s will👍👍(great peace  in times of diseases or fearful journnies in life battle ,)
B) We shouldn’t be worrying about anything a lot because everything works together for good for those who love GOD ( marriage or death  or any good or humiliation or a great permanent honour,)
C) we must sacrifice our life at least for our children
The world is not  life  to us 
Imagine will a father be happy if he gets some privileges but not his children 👶 
Never 
So something if you don’t get 
Or something dangerous happens to you deliberately is for good 
Because we live for a fellow Christians or a christian family and children and overall for the  kingdom of God in earth ( government)
D) we must know that
Our heart ❤️ is filled with fear and guilty conscience for many reasons
1) for not following according to 1 john 2:-16
2) our unbelief ( jesus could not do Many miracles because of their harden heart and unbelief)
3) Our blind eye ( we don't avoid or cut our relationship with a bad CHRISTIAN,,) towards a bad companionship,
E) IF FOD DOESN'T COMFORT TOU WITH A BIBLE VERSE ,,,WE CAN NOT KEEP IT AS OUR POSSESSION,,
Invite shames to you  Before( you ) expecting a miracle we forget brotherhood and PRAYERS ( God will be glorified amongst brothers and church ,)
So tell your problems to the congregations MEDIAS ,people or governments,( but miracle is God's 😁😉😁)( In any situation what we can do we must should do it  never expect God to do what you should do)( Honour God respect God )
But life is God 
For example 
Lazarus death 
The news reached Jesus ( this means to prayer  and brotherhood )
Rolling down of the stone Take away the stone ( take off the grave clothes) John Gospel chapter 11;39 and 45 
Untie the bandages,,
For example
We got some shops in the middle of a city here ,
But managing to keep it with respect as a owner is very difficult,
But God comforted me with a verse 1 corinthians 1:-31
This shops to us are from our hindu ancestors so though God is helping us to keep it but we get lot of insults ,
Every time when I get a problem I pray God and go according to his counsel,,,
29 so that no one may boast before him.(BG) 30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus,(BH) who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness,(BI) holiness(BJ) and redemption.(BK) 31 Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”[d](BL)
So what 1 john 2:-16 
Says about not to love 
Lusts of the eyes ( because people or enemies watch it make it a issue as sin ,this we must be careful everytime at home and outside holy ,it means do not love sights ,do not turn back and see ,do not listen to what they speak even,)
Lusts of flesh 
Pride of life ( insults)
You must know that there are TEMPTATIONS common to all men ( PAUL TO CORINTHIANS ABOUT SINS OF ISRAELITES IN WILDERNESS,)
F) 
NEVER FORGET ALK ARE SINNERS
ECCLESIASTES 7
G) ALWAYS KNOW BA FACE OUR LIFE IS ETERNAL
NOT IN THIS EARTH,,
BUT HERE TOO GOD CAN RAISE HONOUR YOUR HEAD ,
Philippines 4:-8
Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
Amazing that adults have nothing better to do with their time than work towards enslavement of women.
"You are a blessing,  Shelly.  Thank you for what you do."
"US Americans see abortion like Abraham in the Bible killing his child.
In reality it is a tough and emotional decision by a woman to terminate a pregnancy, which, at this stage, is just a tiny lump of cells.
They forget that nature, what they call god, is the #1 pregnancy terminator."
That doctor is one sick puppy anyone who does this is one evil bastard 3rd trimester abortions are straight up murder why can't you acknowledge this this is what really gets people upset unbelievable
That doctor seems like he is having difficulty focusing at age 80. It should be illegal for doctors at age 80 to do life threatening procedures.
"Nice of her to show how out of touch these people are and how to confront them without being aggressive, especially when its old white men telling others what to do."
Please tell me how it is a good thing to kill your offspring? Twisted.
Why is it ok for pro abortion people to say what they want but not pro life?
Biden and his administration do nothing to fix this.  Remember that when voting.  We have been bamboozled.
"Jesus , I'm watching from Australia . . . .
 I admire this Lady's work so much she is amazing  . . . . 
but those Crazed Religious Meth Zombies hanging around need to be repelled . . . 

Civil War in USA is closer than ever"
Prayer doesn't pay for childraising! Do these holy rollers walk the walk or do they just talk the talk? I wonder how many of these protesters have adopted any children?
Now more unwanted children will be placed in the foster care system.
"Psalm 139:13-17
13 You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother’s womb.
14 Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex!
Your workmanship is marvelous—how well I know it.
15 You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion, as I was woven together in the dark of the womb.
16 You saw me before I was born.
Every day of my life was recorded in your book. Every moment was laid out
before a single day had passed.
17 How precious are your thoughts about me, O God."
"Seriously, Jackoffs for Jesus"
"You ever notice the people against abortion, should have been aborted."
You know those hospitals and fire stations where you can drop off unwanted babies? They are going to be swamped. I hope they can handle it.
imagine being forced to have a child you didnt want and that child end up being owned by the government and raised in  a foster prison
It cost what I read at minimum 10k to just deliver a baby in the US?  Correct me if I'm wrong. I mean if you want to deliver here a baby in the hospital without medical urgently you pay 350 euro. So maybe there it should already start. There is no reason why a normal delivery without any issues have to cost 10k
How far the moral compass have shifted when aidding murder is celebrated and discouraging one is jeered and mocked!!🤔🤔🤔
Much love and support for this brave woman!!!
Heroes come in all shapes & colors. God is the ONLY judge of us and even He is forgiving & compassionate. Leave that final word to the Almighty. Free will is for each & all of us! These women that help other women & men facilitate such a very hard & painful decision are HEROES!
"Shelley and Dr. Carhart are treasures. They must be protected, from these nutjobs, at all costs!"
Religion is a mental disorder.
"Is like a cult. I have never seen anything like this, is so backwards and uncivilized. Seriously, how many developed countries in the western world still bans abortion? You wonder why the US got completely slammed by even their allies such as UK, Spain, Canada and so forth. This is Year 2022, not the 1950's and certainly not the 1850's. And do you know what countries does the US sit right along side with now when it comes to abortion? Let's see, Abkhazia, Afghanistan, Andorra, Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, just to name a few. A pretty esteemed list huh? It would be a complete joke only if it was funny, but it isn't. People have no idea how far this has set the United States back. Wait until those 5 far-right extremist justices ban same-sex marriage and contraceptive. Then, they are really going all the way back to the Dark Ages."
Religion poisons EVERYTHING!
Someone should start a website exposing republicans who pay for their girlfriends and mistresses to get abortions.
"Religion, the great con of man"
"I did not see any ""beautiful"" gifts amongst any of those people she captured on video."
"lol, are they all old crusty white dudes?"
I actually die laughing when I happen to drive by that stuff

"Is CNN still broadcasting?  They must be trying to keep thier 500 viewers. Great work CNN. By the way have you heard about Hunter Biden and his money connections to the pathetic president?   Thats not news to you , but you  could tell us what color shirt Trump is wearing today.  Like most Americans we cant understand why you are even still on cable.  You suck"
Por lifers who want you dead... That almost as hypocritical as the Catholic Church itself!!!
Antiquated thinking. USA one of the most dangerous places to live.

a profile of mental illness in merica
Why cant people respect that GOD gave us all Free Will?
Abortion is wrong. Killing babies is wrong. Women celebrating abortions are crazy
"Elections have consequences,  and #DropBoxes have consequences...."
Abortion is the only medical surgery that insurers at least one patient will DIE
Y'all ought to ask Dan how many kids he's adopted. Just emotionally abusing women trying to do the toughest thing they'll ever do is performance art. God sees their horseshit.
That's makes sense.  ANTI ABORTION PROTESTORS use violence and guns and bonds to kill others.  These people are two faced.
"Yep I'd rather listen to a doctor that went through these procedures and how it actually is killing babies and went to Congress explaining what they do why he  quit and how horrendous it is, then hearing some typical fat sjw give a opinion."
Must be nice to not have to work and pay bills
People think they own God’s word. They do not know what God would do if on earth. Buy using their own interpretation is wrong for all. Judgement day is each individual day of facing our savior not protesters.
No one has a right to choose life except for god. NOBODY!!!
"Human cant protect their children in their worm..so the govt help them🤣🤣.
Why dont we abort these people who support abortion🤣"
How about you go and stop the bombing of crisis pregnancy centers? No you don’t care about that you only care about the ones who interfere with your belief who are actually just being friendly and speaking instead of bombing
"God bless these people who are trying their best to save the lives of babies! I obviously don’t agree with the violence against the the baby-killing clinics but changing giving the act of baby-killing the name of reproductive health-care is extremely deceptive and evil. The innocent person who is being killed isn’t given the choice to live. Also, I’m not religious in the least bit. I actually kinda despise religion… I just believe in God and I hate the murdering of babies. I wish abortions were completely overturned and made illegal nationwide."
Yet they see no problem with 19 Uvalde kids having no freedoms anymore.
Those disgusting orange clown cult members are terrorizing all those woman!!!
Get in my way protesters   and its you who won't be a le to bear kids.
"Vote blue if you stand …
For Woman rights 
To Save Our kids from getting kill by gunshots 
To Save our constitution 
To Save our democracy 
To save Unions 
To save Social Security 
To save Medicare 
AGAINST greedy corporations(the need to pay TAXES!!!)
Again racists Republican billionaires(they need to pay TAXES!!!)
VOTE BLUE MILLENNIALS!!!"
"I love how people who are ""pro-life"" are planting bombs, shooting these workers, and assaulting these women. Shows how this has nothing to do with life and everything to do with controlling women. I commend the abortion workers for standing up to these zealots."
Why does this protesters not think about all the children who will not be born becouse of lack of unplanned babys. No mother will let their doughters out of the house without having the pill. and older women will also make sure not to get pregnant if they dont really  want a child.
"Life does not begin with conception nor does it end with dearh by abortion or death after living life to age 70 years or more. I feel empathy for ignorant christians who are thoroughly confused between life/soul and lifeless body which is nothing more than dust to dust and ahses to ashes. All you have to do is read Bhagvad Gita a so called Hindu religion text but really is a Vedic religion/Eternal religion text titled as The song of God. Would I support abortion? No, but I would definitely not judge (Ye shall not judge others as their/christians book says) others who are compelled to make tha choice for whatever reason. I would rather spend life time workiong on issues like poverty, rape and incest etc. so that nobody have to make the choice of aborting a baby from the womb. Pl. join in liberating women."
"Maybe get a nice, tall fence.. ?"
Mind your own effing business old man.
"If I had the money, I would provide tall walls around the clinics. 
And provide large opaque shields.
Ans sink money into research on artificial wombs. That would take so much pressure off women who can't take care of a child. 
I know it wouldn't do much for those whose fetus had passed 😔."
The Word says that God has mercy on those of us who have mercy for others.
"Unfortunately, every child is not wanted. Are these anti-abortion Republicans willing to adopt all the babies (some with severe deformities or pay for the funerals of women whose pregnancy killed them) that women are forced to carry now that the Supreme Court thinks they can rule womens bodies with their overturn of Roe vs. Wade? Yeah, didn't think so. If Republicans were so concerned with children...why were they ripping children from their parents at the border when incompetent Trump was president? I look forward to your answer, Republican Bible thumpers. Thank you.
p.s. Not everyone believes in your religion. I thought we were supposed to have the right to our own beliefs...religious or non-religious. Quit trying to shove your beliefs down people's throats!"
"Margaret Sanger was the founder of plan parenthood. 
Margaret Sanger and I quote said 
“We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.”
Personally I don't support eugenics of certain ethnic groups let alone someone who had ties with the KKK.
Do your research and learn there true colors and agendas."
At last a peaceful protest
"I’m in Boston, where we had the shootings at two clinics in 1994 that left two people dead and so many traumatized. I worked at Planned Parenthood years later, where the protesters included a man dressed like a priest who’d throw himself on the ground and scream “momeeeeeeeeee!!!!” all day long. We could hear him clearly through the thick, bulletproof glass, and his screaming was joined by many others who’d be outside all day as well. The escorts were tireless and endured terrible insults and face to face confrontations. My job was public health research-related and I didn’t work in the clinic level, but experienced the same harassment whenever I left the building. It always left me jarred and worried that maybe one day someone would show up armed and dangerous. I can’t imagine what it was like for clinic patients to come in on those days. They included people terminating pregnancies, but also those getting medical care. And sometimes those patients getting abortions were protesters who happened to have unplanned pregnancies. The hypocrisy of pro-forced pregnancy supporters is revolting. Are they really going to save babies? Are they truly going to take care of them their entire lives? Do they support social services for women who are too poor to raise a child or who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest? Fuck that shit. Overturning Roe has darkened this already damaged country and is leading the way for other human rights to be taken away. For those who are pro-choice, keep fighting the good fight. And for those who aren’t, please consider the complexities of unplanned pregnancies with their rippling effects as well as the rights that are now very much at risk."
What is going to be the consequence of an unwanted pregnancy on the man's part it does take a man to make a woman pregnant so he should be paying the same price to walk away from the woman and not want the baby or the responsibility and she's forced to keep it
cant these women give up their baby for adoption?
Touche!  Thank you for being there.  ☂️☂️☂️
Trump cult are pro birth for a vote but are not pro life after kids get killed in school them and the NRA go out and celebrate how much money they made up the bullets and the gun
Abort her job
Abortion is wrong. Because it has no happy ending.
She doing
"The anti abortionists are not pro life.  They are pro violence and hatefulness.  Forcing every fetus to term is just mean spirited cruelty to women, their families, and society in general.  They will have to answer to God for their unwarranted malice."
My mom had an abortion- it saved her life and five years later she was able to have me. If that abortion hadn’t happened- if she hadn’t been able to get professional help- neither she or I would be here.
"I agree that abortion is wrong, but why doesn’t people protest against guns."
"If their is a chosen one up their in space somewhere? I doubt think he or she cares a hoot about all u religious nutcases, plus I don't think he or she or whatever that so called God of yours would approve of all u idiots thinking you should control a womens decision on her own body, so you people need to mind your own damn business and basically PISS OFF!!!!!!@"
"""We'll help you""

Really? Will you help financially? Will you help pay for their hospital bills? Will you help them raise their child? 

Why is it so easy for Christians to demonize women. Is that what your bible tells you to do?"
America is no to abortion. 👍
"True American heroes, both the doctor and the the young woman escort.🫶🏻"
"It's a 50/50 scernio 
50% of women want abortions and 50% don't believe in it and otherwise u wouldn't be here today on cnn's YouTube channel 🤪"
Try using a ball bat next time.
This woman needs to get a life
How many unwanted children have Dan or any of those clowns adopted? Anti-abortion protesters clearly get off on live trolling vulnerable women.
This lady is awesome.
"Absolutely stupid people, saying they are protecting life when they go in and shoot them! OMG, how effing ridiculous!"
"Does this woman need any money and where do I send it and how does she recruit.
If your religion needs a police force laws and a prison system then maybe there's something wrong with your ignorant and disgusting religion."
"Between you too, the one mocking is at lost."
How many children did Dan adopt? If none than he can shut up
"My 80 year old mother, who voted for Biden and absolutely hates Trump, cried when I told her that Roe was overturned. She said she thought she’d never see the day. She said she thought that Roe was the biggest mistake ever made."
These whacko protesters should mind their own business.
"Abortion opponents, you really have a special mentality - over there"
seeing that guy break out the ladder cracked me up a little bit
"Pro Life, Doesn’t means anti-abortion,it means we All have the Right to live."
All those old men should be followed home
The consequences are a joke
"I mean, why do these people only think about themselves, their ""rights and freedoms"" and stop caring about life AFTER a baby is born? What happened to the mass hysteria around wearing a simple mask on their face to protect others, or getting vaccinated OR OR OR....... REASONABLE GUN CONTROL?"
This escort  is a degenerate  🐃 BUFFALO!
"Infanticide insurrectionists are attacking our democracy. They're bombing pregnancy centers, rioting at the Vermont statehouse and threatening Supreme court justices. One was arrested trying to murder Justice Bret Kavanaugh. Will you hold these violent insurrectionist thugs  to the same standard as the January 6th protesters? If not you're hypocritical anti democracy domestic terrorists."
both sides are losers
She needs federal protection!  A true humanist...working against the threat of death every day!!  She is so much stronger than any Uvalde police officer!
11 physicians and escorts killed and what happens outside these clinics. How diabolical. There have been literally millions of babies murdered in those butcheries. Hardly a comparison.
"Somehow CNN missed the violent pro abortion riots going on in major cities. 
Almost like they have an agenda to keep you childless and earning money for thier corporate overlords."
Abortion is not something to be used as birth control!! Keep your legs closed or get fixed if you don't want to have children!!! Wonder how these people who are for abortions would feel if they were asked  if their mothers had a late term abortion with them  and they were survivors of that abortion  ended up having mental or physical repercussions of that decision their mothers made would feel!!! Don't think they'd like it too much if they did have the mental or physical abnormalities to live with for the rest of their lives!!!
Abortion is Murder!!!Wonder how these people who are for abortions would feel if they were asked  if their mothers had a late term abortion with them  and they were survivors of that abortion  ended up having mental or physical repercussions of that decision their mothers made would feel!!! Don't think they'd like it too much if they did have the mental or physical abnormalities to live with for the rest of their lives!!!
Wow they're going to be protesting about this for a while🤔
"They had 50 years to KILL innocent BABIES because of irresponsibly opening their legs. Now, it’s time to save future presidents, doctors, engineers, etc."
Okay these Republican protesters are starting to give violent and crazy that's why they want the gun laws to be the way they are so they can just go out there and choose who they want to kill based on who they like or who they agree with and that's crazy so I'm ready for you I'm going to Stand My Ground it's like you do but you walk up on me you come in my property I'm going to blow your f****** head off you guys got to understand you need to turn it down go see a doctor because you're mentally ill all of you stop protesting like this it's not doing any good because you're basically you say you care about life but you want to kill somebody and punish somebody for based on what they do with their lives that makes no sense you're just as guilty as them and honestly they're not guilty what they do with their body is they're right you need to go home and do what you need to do stop inflicting pain on the world because you wake up with an epiphany and want to change the world how you see fit based on some Republicans protest like I give the f*** about what you feel about how you think religion should be it has nothing to do with me and killing people because they don't agree with you is called psycho that's what you are
"Had she been aborted as a baby, she wouldn’t have been an escort of baby murderers."
They will insist that religion is harmless. Millions of scramble brained morons who do whatever they are told and attack in any direction they are pointed. THAT is the point of religion.
"It's funny ,
Why are there men protesting abortion.
I have never heard of any man giving birth to a child.
America is strange."
"So we’re not going to talk about all these white women calling the black Supreme Court justice a monkey and all type of names. Now white women know how it feels to be oppressed. I’m the words of Dave Chappell “come on white woman, you were in on the heist, you just don’t want to get burnt”.

"Dan told us the truth, his truth anyways.. These people think they're scoring brownie points with their god. Really sick, they think harassing woman who are already making hard choices regarding their lives and their futures is going to impress their imaginary friend."
"“I’m 80, I DON’T NEED TO DO ABORTIONS ANYMORE…” that’s right, your days of profiting from killing innocent babies is almost over. Then, when you draw your last breath, time to pay the piper. You people call it Karma, Christians call it sowing and reaping, and deal you will."
All I hear is a message of love from the protesters
"If you support abortion, you will have a special escort when you reach the other side. Maybe the soul of a baby you helped to kill…"
"Anti-women nutcases are some of the most distasteful people in America. They're not Christian, they're hate mongers."
Women who support women in this way are heroes. Thank you to all the countless clinic escorts.
Why didn't she broadcast the nuts who scream at prolifers
"Woah, she's really nice to the women going in to end the life (or potential) of their unborn baby but super passive aggressive against the protesters..

Also, why is she checking for bombs? It's the opposite side that's usually using destruction and violence against women's health clinics.."
"THE MAGA SUPREMACIST COURT IS OUT TO GET YOU! We have been threatened by the rabid black-and-white supremacist, Clarence aka Ginni, who gloatingly informed us that abortion rights were just its first target. The MAGA Supreme Court shall strip away other civil rights asap by abusing the Constitution, possibly inciting a civil war!"
"if abortion is so great why would they need ""support"" walking to have it done. So it's horrible if the woman dies but not horrible if her baby dies"
"Planned Parenthood is SO MUCH more than just abortions.  They help with regular preventative care—they caught my cancer thanks to a routine Pap smear. They also do hormones for pre and menapausal women.   Too bad SO many people are IGNORANT about their services. Radical violent people need MENTAL HEALTH care.
Let us hope the rest of the world continues to value women’s healthcare and rights and does NOT listen to what is happening in the USA.  All my European and Aussie friends think the USA has LOST it.  Thank God their countries are NOT going back to the 1950s like the USA!"
Abortion is murder but don't harass these poor delusional women
Abortion are painful to babies during the process it is a mercy less feeling for the victim they really feel the pain before they die like some discarded trash but they can try again but not with the person who aborted them any members of that person's family ether
When you see a demon in the flesh. You never know it's a demon. This white woman is demon who comes in the name of rights.

"And the brains of the Americans after smoking marijuana apparently did not remain at all. The ban on abortions will lead to an increase in the death rate of women and to the birth of disabled children with Down syndrome, аligaphrenics, and simply children with physical disabilities. And this is the degeneration of the nation. The Down syndrome test: One blood test is done at 10-13 weeks. The analysis reveals over 80% of fetuses with Down syndrome. The name of the test is based on three proteins that are tested in the mother's blood: free estriol, alpha-fetoprotein, and b-hCG. It is advisable to do such an analysis at the end of the 16th week of pregnancy."
"The deciding Justices have ignored fundamental civil rights guaranteed by our Constitution and years of judicial precedent to advance a politically partisan agenda. There is no denying the fact that this is a direct attack on all women, and Black women stand to be disproportionately impacted by the court's egregious assault on basic human rights. We must all stand up to have our voices heard in order to protect our nation from the further degradation of civil rights protections we have worked so hard to secure. We the People who cares about Abortion and Gay Rights need to register and mobilize voters in what will be the most critical midterm election America has ever faced. If you're not registered to vote or know someone who isn't, now is the moment. This is no time for anyone to sit on the sidelines."" Now is the time for all current and former Dems Politicians, Celebrity Allies, Business Owners and organizations to hold RALLIES and TOWNHALL MEETINGS every weekends in Poor White, Latino, Black and Asians Rural Counties to educate voters on how Dems Policies are improving their livelihood. This will help get Dems Voters Motivate to vote in 2022. So Dems can keep control of the US House and WIN a SUPER MAJORITY in the US Senate with 61 Dems Senators. This is the only way for Dems to pass meaningful Police and Criminal Justice Reforms, Voting Rights, Comprehensive Immigration, Economy, Abortion, Gay Rights and Gun Control."
"Why is it that the women in the pro life group are way more attractive than the unhappy, toxic screeching sjws who don't need to worry about pregnancy anyway?"

Why do people care soo much about people killing their unborn babies . No one is going to loss anything. The only person who's is going to face the results of the abortion is the one who choose to do it  . People should do whatever they want .
"I don't think men should have a say in any of this. Unless, so the woman won't have to get an abortion they should claim the baby as their own.  Raise the baby, clothes the baby, feed the baby, send the baby to school!  You men just shut up.  You have no say in any of this!"

Yet she needs to watch the liberal abortion lovers attack the Arizona capital building. She had one small group that she met and they were very peaceful to the ugliness put out by those in Arizona.

Feeling immense gratitude for these dedicated people willing to risk their own lives for their patients. This brought me to tears. You are brave beyond words. Thank you for telling your story.
What a joke it's the pro choice that are clueless nut jobs. Nice propaganda CNN keep to what your good at I guess.
"Pro-""lifers"" bomb and kill already living people. The irony is beyond belief."
"Is it really that hard to use a condom, take a birth control pill, or tell the guy your spreading your legs for to just pull out. There are a plethora of ways to prevent pregnancy's. If you are to stupid to take basic precautions then you should deal with the consequences of slutting it up. Instead you want to murder unborn children because you wont take any personal responsibility."
I’m confused.  If pro-choice protestors can scream and harass people and threaten their lives these people also are able to peacefully protest.  I wouldn’t do it but they have the right.  And they are not threatening to kill people like others are currently who don’t agree with them.
I can care less if woman die from trying to kill their baby. If your willing to go that far to Murder your own little person you created by CHOICE then you deserve the consequences. Keep drinking that koolaid. It's clearly a satanic ritual and satan loves nothing more then to prevent life.
"You don’t know their stories either. You just know they came, and you hope they’ll appreciate your agreement that their babies should die. Pure feels."
Have fun women now you know what it's like to be a man in court powerless

The Constitution does not protect abortion..
Why doesn't this so-called report mention the more-than-60 million American babies lost to abortion since 1973?
She is so strong
How is abortion essential when taking responsibility for your sexual behavior would take it unnecessary...and if not then live with the consequences of your *_choices_* like millions of men have to do every day.
We Just want the right to rip our babies out of our wombs at 9 months what is wrong with you people.
Men have every right to ensure that women behave responsibly. Men have every right to control female behavior. I feel like this point is completely lost on the pro-choice crowd. It's weird
Imagine being a baby murderer. Always using the straw man of women’s health. Saying this when over 92% of abortions are because of inconvenience.
I love her!!
A bomb? Why would an anti abortionist want to bomb a client full of people about to kill there babies if that's what they are protesting PRO LIFE. Means LOVE FOR LIFE.
Repost. Imagine trying to defend the murder of an unborn child... disgusting
This woman is assisting in torture and murder of innocent babies and passing it off as helping. God sees everything and he will have justice.
"Why doesn't somebody explain to these God-spouting anti-abortionists that, actually, and logically, God himself obviously approves of abortion! Doesn't he himself bring about the death of one in every four fetuses in the womb in what's called a miscarriage and/or stillbirth!"
"0:39 ""I think abortion is so terribly wrong. I have a responsibility to be here.""
Apparently, his responsibility ends after birth. Then the responsibility is on someone else. Anyone else but him.
Seems to me that a lot of these anti-abortion protesters are doing it to make themselves feel good & in the hopes of getting into 'God's' good graces."
"We're SO PRO-LIFE, we're willing to KILL people! We're so PRO-LIFE, we don't care if the mom dies, as long as she carries her (shame) baby. There, is that sanity?"
"If these protesters really want to help all these pregnant woman, then perhaps they should be contacting their representatives in government to reduce the cost of reproductive health care. Because it's doing most pregnant women no help by forcing them to give birth, and then having to spend $10,000 plus, just to give birth. If childbirth was free, or much more affordable, then so many pregnant women wouldn't get an abortion."
Wow crazy God loving evil people killing doctors and nurses became a woman decides what to do with her own body...
"American need to stop protesting for abortion rights  .The United States needs more unwanted, desperate people being born and joining their military.Stopping abortions is the best recruiting tool."

Are these protesters going to take care of the babies that cannot be financially or emotionally supported? Maybe they should be trying to protect women from rape and incest by strengthening the laws and holding men responsible and also making sure that women receive adequate child support for the children that are already born.
Hopefully someone hits that target on his back
She is a special person for sure
“Nobody asked you.” I LOVE IT!!!! Go home guy and manage your own life!
"The only place she could be an ""escort""! Lol. No chance of her getting pregnant. Show how abortions are done! Large needle stuck into the brain, baby turned around and yanked out by it's feet. Might make you think twice. It's painful and barbaric"
"Thanks for your help. You are appreciated.
I’m glad you are unable to remain silent. We are being pushed around by a vocal minority who have no respect for anyone’s rights, instead trying to shove their ideas down the throats of the majority. 
Religious organizations indoctrinate their members to believe they are right and everyone should believe as they do without question. Personally, I believe all churches are cults and should be banned or at the very least, lose their tax exempt status . Throughout history, more people have been killed in the name of god than in all of the wars put together."
"A zygote isn't a child, it's a single celled organism. A fertilized egg isn't an ""unborn baby"" and terminating a pregnancy isn't murder. Why are we being subjected to the whims and imagined moral authority of religious zealots?"
"1.Who cares if she is fed  up they are trying to stop an unborn baby from being brutishly killed
2. They are presenting women with an alternate choice.
3. The anti-abortion protesters are not a danger to anyone.
4. Since 1977 millions of unborn babies have been killed. Why does she think adding a bit of humor to killing an unborn baby is appropriate."
You won't know that baby's heart nor will you ever hear THEIR story!
"I have never had an abortion, and I probably never would, although I’m too old to have children anymore. I was raised Catholic in a conservative family. That said, it is not my choice with another woman does with her body. I don’t like abortion but I 100% support another woman’s right to access one for her own body without judgement."
"Go do something about all the unwanted children already born and living in this country. All the kids with mental and physical disabilities born alcohol and drug addicted.  Use your energy and time to adopt or foster an unwanted child who has been mentally, physically or sexually abused. There are hundreds of thousands of them in this country and will be thousands more when abortion is banned and womens body's and choices are dictated by others beliefs and religion.  If you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem.  Step up or shut up your self-righteous rants and quit trying to dictate what I do with my body.  MY BODY! MY CHOICE NOT YOURS."
"Let's start protesting outside their churches, harassing the people as they go in. Not everyone agrees with their religious choice. If they don't respect the rights of others, to choose for themselves, they should expect no respect for their choice."
Why don’t these people get upset about all the fertilized embryos that are frozen

"As you can see, these people are mentally challenged!  The RepubliCON party is full of mentally ill mass shooters, but what about these right-wing nut jobs protesting abortion clinics!   Seriously, get a life!  The mentally ill are a serious problem in the CONservative movement - bigly!"
Rape babies are an abomination!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm sure Dan always used protection when he had sex so their would be no  unwanted fetuses.
"All mental cases, huge ignorance mixed with religious fanatism, since they don't have a life they have spare time to meddle in other people's lives, the problem is that stupid people is very dangerous. She is very courageous for doing what she does."
"Yes, abortion is awful. But so is mandating the course of another person's life. (That is playing God, dearie.) So, being morally lazy, I leave it to the pregnant woman to decide."
"I bet you those antiabortion men are wife beaters
and during the beating,  they don't care where the blows end up and/or the woman receiving the blows"
"People that are anti-abortionists are completely selfish. They have no right to force their decisions onto other women/girls. They don't know the circumstances why someone would seek an abortion nor are they entitled to. The people in this video absolutely disgusts me. ""We'll help you."" ""The lord will help you."" If they cared so much about the well being of all children, we wouldn't have starving kids. We wouldn't have a shortage on diapers and formula for our infants. We wouldn't have so many kids in the system."
Ha ha ha you leftist are a joke and cnn is you daddy

Thank you Shelly and Dr. C. We will not give up! And we WILL not back down! I plan to do my part and help women in need still as well!
Any man who doesn't believe in abortion should believe in s vesectomy and go get one.
"Wow, 11 people killed! How many babies killed during the same time? Babies are people too. Their not puppies. You don’t have a constitutional right to an abortion. You don’t have a right to kill anyone. No one does. Now that you have watched this video, I challenge you to watch 3 abortion videos. One of each trimester. Won’t be hard. You should be able to find them here. Take a look."
"What most of these people don't realise is that some form of abortion has existed in almost all societies for many centuries - whether they worked or not.  Women have always sought to not have children they don't feel they can look after, or from rape, or incest.  Our body, our choice."
"What gives those people the right over a women's body, the Supreme Court f**ked up, the republicans are gonna lose the mid-terms, nothing like a woman scorned, people vote for democracy, republican dick-tators deserve to lose."
"Religious fanaticism &  a lack of education -.- #murrica at its ""best"" 🙄

IF you have a schlong & bag between your legs, you should have *NO SAY WHATSOEVER* in what a women does with *HER* body!"
Great work Shelly. I love the protesters comments “we’re here to help you”. Like they’re offering to pay the $275k it takes to raise a child. Or erase the potential horrible situation the woman might be in.
"No egg must go unfertilized, otherwise it is murder."
"Ahhhh, I like this tactic. Yes my minons! Our lord will get his sacrifices one way or another!"
I stopped by the local planed parenthood and asked the men if they had ever cracked open an egg and found blood… when they answer affirmatively I asked if they understand that it was because the egg had been fertilized… they said they understood… so I asked if they were speaking to young men about not exploring their sexuality where they had no intention of staying??? They wanted to explain what they were doing there and refused to answer my question… they all appeared to be pedophiles to me.

"My mom wanted me aborted, and I wish I had been.  My ""pro-life"" dad wouldn't allow my mom to get an abortion.  I was born into a family who didn't want me.  I was abandoned by my mom, then beaten and raped by my dad.  I was already suicidal by the age of 8.  I spent a childhood being abused, neglected and without love.  Abortion would have been more merciful."

"Why do people think it's any of their business! 🤔 NOYB, NOMB."

"Abortion is not healthcare because it is not caring for the health of human life that is not a part of the woman’s body (and has their own DNA). I’m an unplanned mom, I know how scary it is, but killing is killing. Murdering a pro-abortion person is hypocrisy; but saying you do not harm while engaging in abortion is hypocrisy as well. Both unplanned mom and child matter ♥️ 
Anger and jealousy can create sinful motives like wishing death upon people and I am sorry that pro-abortion and anti-abortion people have faced that. Abortion is violence."
I love how it's always old men.  Why don't they go volunteer in foster care.  Hypocrites!
It's hilarious that liberals all of the sudden know what a woman is.  What a bunch of bozos.  Truly amazing.

"If you think abortion is a “Constitutionally protected right”, give me the citation.  (Abortion was Federally protected, but never Constitutionally.)

Pro-abortionists talk about the woman’s body and the woman’s life.

The fact is, there are TWO LIVES involved, but pro-abortionists rarely say anything about the baby’s life. 

I am not a lawyer.  As a layman, my reading of the Constitution’s Article 1, Section 8 and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments leads me to believe THE ISSUE BELONGS AT THE STATE LEVEL, NOT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

“OVERTURNING ROE DOES NOT STOP ABORTIONS.”  IT RETURNS ABORTION TO THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS.

SOME HAVE SAID, “ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE.”  Sometimes IT CAN BE, BUT MOST TIMES IT’S NOT.

The State of Florida requires women getting abortions to complete a questionnaire disclosing why they are getting one.  

1.4% were for Incest, Rape, Fetal Abnormality or for the Mother’s Life or Health.
6.3% were for “Social or Economic”.
92.3% was “No Reason (elective).

The following is from “U.S. Abortion Statistics”, https://abort73.com/abortion_facts/us_abortion_statistics/ 

Percentage of 2019 Reported Abortions by Weeks of Gestation* (CDC):
≤6 wks	7-9 wks	10-13 wks	14-15 wks	16-17 wks	18-20 wks	≥21 wks
42.90%	36.40%	13.40%	2.90%	1.70%	1.60%	1.00%

So my points are these:
•	92.7% of abortions occur within the first 13 weeks.
•	98.6% of abortions are for Social, Economic and Elective reasons.
•	Life begins at conception. Conception occurs when the sperm enters the egg. The zygote is the only cell in a woman’s body that has different DNA.
•	WOMEN GOT ILLEGAL, DANGEROUS ABORTIONS BEFORE ROE.  THE REASON FOR LEGALIZING ABORTION IS SO THEY CAN GET ONE LEGALLY AND SAFELY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME."
America the laughing stock of the world.
"I just witnessed the birth of fascism in the U.S. I remember when the States criticized Iran for combining fundamentalist religion and politics. Full circle. But it’s always different when you guys do it, isn’t it?"

Shes brave.
Nothing says how pro life you are like murder and hate.
nuts!!! Why don’t these people fight gun laws? Then they would really be saving lives.

Now we are living the modern world and this is America the land of free, let’s she do whatever she want it’s her blood not yours stop using your own religious beliefs to judge people please I need you to read more books not listening to those churches pastor too much"
"Did you ask the protesters if they are willing to financially support the babies? Are they prepared to buy food and diapers, and are they willing to pay for the children's healthcare? Are they willing to pay for their education? Asking for a friend..."
"Hire this woman as a abortion PR specialist immediately. We need fighters and trash talkers.

You can not reason or compromise with those politics and the person who holds them. You must beat them to a political pulp. Call them out as the fascist monsters they are and make it stick.

"Start protesting at CHURCHES... It's those extremists who started this.  These people are spiritually challenged.

.                                          This is EXACTLY WHY the separation of CHURCH and STATE is written into our laws.    THIS IS what it's meant to prevent."

 Americans excel under great leaders- this ""impossible"" task is proving that this country is soon to have great leaders again, and with a motivated people ready to drive onward to moral high-ground where we belong. I'm so glad that the liberals don’t get it! The Democrats piloted the ship directly into the iceberg and are now lecturing passengers on the health benefits of ice baths."
"The anti-abortion people aren't a bunch of rioters showing their faces doesn't matter to them.
   They truly believe they're saving baby's   he wants to show anything she should be doing Tic tok videos on how not to get pregnant.
    That could cut into her pay."
this has sent us back decades 😔
"Im so dumb when they started saying “mom” I’m like damn they already hot as hell, their mom is still alive?"
I see you like to post things about abortion clinics but you won't post a video on the attacks on pregnancy centres. Why haven't you covered the insurrection in Arizona?

Do you see gun shops in your region? On your daily commute? Their very presence; the sight of it is cruel and threatening. The truth is out. Poorly-regulated militias are the opposite of a last guarantor of liberty and democracy; they are tools of ambitious nazis.
"Actually,your Maker is going to ask those whom youve treated unkind in your life to testify on(or not) your behalf.He doesnt ask you,that would be dumb.Never mistake what God said when he said to pray silently and alone,to keep your faith to yourself.

No wonder no one watches CNN any more lol.
A nurse confided in me that at the women's health clinic where she worked - there was a male protester there every day in front - that he had 5 children at home - and that he had not worked in all the years that she had seen him in front of her office - and that his wife did not work either - and that these two parents and their children lived in poverty.
CNN is dirty baby killers .
people should show the baby killers on tiktok.
"Do u work for the GOP I’m asking since America is in total collapse & u guys r covering the idiots on the right rather than getting into the TRUTH - America is ranked #44 on freedom of press no wonder our society is so mentally ill we have e NOBODY telling the truth 

U r a failing news outlet & ur helping the bullies on the right steal the country good job"
why are people protesting is there a lot of bebys needed to be killed.?
"As a Brit, America really blows my mind sometimes - and no, pro-birthers, not in a good way! Much solidarity and love for these escorts, from here in the UK🇬🇧✊🇺🇸"
AS THE GREAT G CARLIN SAID MOST WHO OPPOSE ABORTION  COULD  GET SEX IN THE FIRST PLACE ( PARAPHRASED OF COURSE)
Dude's got more issues than the National Geographic
why do men protest do they have a baby to kill ? and abortions isnt health care or birth control its for women raped and incest and going to die if they have a child thats it. if women want abortions as a birth control keep there legs closed.

State Run propaganda at the CNN.
"We know they are good at making viruses to manipulate elections, but are they any good at making viruses that attack unborn babies."
Abortionist are the insane ones.....
insanity beyond insanity
YouTube is nothing more than a State Run Entity that antagonizes the people to see which ones will stand to be persecuted or prosecuted for what they say. King OBiden wants his opposition in small cages.
Well bad things happen when plutocrats manipulate presidential elections with weaponized viruses.

Look at her speak in slow motion. She is a devil in human form.
The devil dresses very nicely when given a platform to speak at CNN.
Thank you Shelley. We're grateful to have people like you in this country.
These abusers need to get a life. A friend of mine is still pissed after 38 years for a “6 week” procedure. Her escort took his own life.
That lady that said we will help ..will be the same person complaining about her tax dollars is paying for welfare.
Thanks CNN for showing us how crazy the baby killers are.
I'm going to work at the clinics as an escort asap.
She is baffled as to why so many people want to save the unborn. Hell on earth we are in.
"She is cuckoo for cocoa puffs, and dead fetuses."
Somebody get this woman a life she can take before she goes postal on the anti-abortionists.
It’s obamas fault he didn’t codify Roe. He had the majority and said it wasn’t a priority
This good and brave woman gives me such hope in these dark times
She hates anti-abortionists because nobody would ever get her pregnant. She would have aborted it anyway.
"Are these the “thoughts and prayers” people protesting outside these clinics???  Hummmm, where else have I encountered that and observed how utterly, absurdly ineffective that approach is….."
“Help”?  Bullshit
Crazy how the world has become ok with these acts against the unborn… these acts will go down in history as being barbaric and inhumane.
go home and clean your filthy homes….pay your bills….balance your check books…MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS‼️
Loved that old man. So much wisdom

"Dan should Feel Guilty for judge others and not doing the actual Help to them but instead of passing his own judgement. When they Pro-life starts actually Financially Help from the before birth to the actual adulthood of age 21. They have no say on the women who makes this difficulty choice. And Ironically they are the one that is more Violent. How interesting??? and all history of men kind have proven when a Men start doing things in the name of God, is nothing but an excuse to start a war."
An anti abortion shooting is the biggest oxymoron there is. “We preserve life. If you don’t like that we will kill you!” 🤔🤔🤔
"Irony:
Democratic cities will be burned down by democrats in Democrat states where abortion will still be legal."
I know all those people protesting against abortion clinics are singles with cats and dogs with no adopted kids at home
THANK YOU SHELLY!  You are the most wonderful beautiful person EVER!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!
I don't see how everyone think we free when in reality we slaves on our government we not diferen from Cuba with Fidel Castro the government has control of our bodies and the government is going to have control what to eat and how much just like Cuba
And I say hey (HEY) what a wonderful kind of day. They've ABOLISHED ROE V WADE. So you all better deal with it 🙂
"Jordan Klepper said it best when he said ""How many have you adopted ?"" to the anti-abortion protesters."
Whatever happened to not judging? Religion is the biggest cult in the world! They don’t even understand the Bible! Don’t reply unless you want to hear about your mama!
"11 people have been killed in anti abortion attacks?  Strange,  in abortion 100% are killed!"
Killer a  baby no one Bat on eyebrow no one gives a shit no thoughts and prayers  you kill a six-year-old everybody shits their pants they’re prayers and thoughts all over. There are no difference they are both are children  they both had names.
"We know what happens INSIDE the clinics, babies being murdered"
Bunch of Bible thumpers. Organized religion has been the scourge of humanity.
"Didn't Kentucky pass a law mandating ultrasounds before abortions? And from what I read, ultrasound techs put notes like ""hi, mom"" and ""please don't kill me"" on the screen.

But yeah, let's talk about how ""both sides are the same."" Congrats, white women. You voted for this. Own it."
"“They ain’t seen nothing yet, women are going to control their bodies no matter how they try to stop them""

It's ironic that women who seek to ""control their bodies"" manage to have unwanted pregnancies."
So sad so many women don't even feel that life inside them is real. My daughter thinks it's not even real until it's a fetus. These are unborn children.
She has more balls than texas police. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Standing up to these anti-woman loons, is a very dangerous job."
I hope this guy isn't depending on this getting him into Heaven!
Notice it is men mostly. What do they know?
"The hypocrisy of the anti-abortionists is clearly evident in that women who said about ""the right to choose life"". Exactly - a CHOICE, not an imposition by others as to what happens to your body. If you don't like the idea of abortins, fine - don;t have one, that's your choice. But if you want to have an abortion, far better to have one at a legally licensed clinic than to go to  back street abortionists. 

Also, all the death-threats against clinic staff - how do the anti-abortionists not see how hyprocritical they are, are they really all THAT stupid?!"
"Clearly the US Government does not acknowledge the fetus as a person, or it would be a tax deduction."
This makes me cry
"I've NEVER SEEN ANTI ABORTIONSIST IN A Black or Brown Community. Hmm, we know why; they don't care about infants of color."
Is it better than liberals of Tik Tok?
TikTok is poison. And China is stealing your information off that app.
"Also, assault by mutual consent means that “two people are voluntarily fighting each other,” so she was likely just as guilty in that matter"
"If these ""ANTI ABORTION PROTESTERS really want to make a difference in the lives of women that don't want to have an abortion, TAKE THE FEMALE IN AND SUPPORT HER 100% AND THEN ADOPT HER CHILD. IF THEY/YOU CAN'T DO THAT, STFU! AND STAY AWAY! 
OR
MANDATORY VASECTOMY FOR ALL MALES AT AGE 15. THAT WONT HAPPEN BECAUSE ITS ALL ABOUT D..K WHEN IT COMES TO MEN. THEY, THESE OLD AZZ MEN WOULD RATHER HARASS   WOMEN OUTSIDE OF A ABORTION CENTER. 
UNTIL THESE ANTI ABORTION PROTESTORS ARE ADOPTING CHILDREN THEY HAVE NO SAY SO!
ITS TOO EASY TO STAND OUTSIDE A CLINIC AND HARRASS
MAN UP! WOMAN UP AND  FINANCIALLY  SUPPORT THE WOMEN YOU ARE HARRASSING AND GIVE THEM ANOTHER OPTION! 
If not
Back the f..k off!"

why not just put a 12 foot fence around the property

Nonsensical News!!
"Mad respect for this woman! Yes, Shelly! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻"
I can guarantee none of those anti-choice idiots is a foster or adoption parent. Useless creeps.
It's  so easy to sit in an ivory tower and pass judgement on others.   It should be mandatory that politicians contemplating withdrawing funding or passing laws go and live in the trenches with the very people their decisions are about to impact.  You can pass all the laws you want but it won't stop abortion.  It just puts it back into the alleyways.   Laws should be based on the way the world is not on an ideology of what we would like the world to be.
It should be the police that protects the patients from that kind of harassment !
"This is the best day in American history. 
I was hoping they ban abortion in California and all states as well.
Babies are precious. Let's save the babies and our future generations.
BTW, these women are not ""patients"". They are just shameless and promiscuous baby-killers."
those pro lifers killing people again???  I guess that is ok because they believe in the bible  WTF
God gave us free will he gave us free will to choose abortion or to naught choose abortion…. About to have a government to rule that you cannot have an abortion even if it’s all right baby goes beyond the pale United States says it’s the land of the free but is it really?
CNN already posted this Abortion Karen video.
"It's unusual to be this obsessed with any topic, but all of these protestors aren't Christians. I'm not a psychologist, but there has to be something else going on here.

If abortion was supposed to be one of the biggest evils in the world since the liberation of the concentration camps, they should be happy that _Roe_ was overturned.

Now that it's outlawed and the clinics are shut down, will they have to go protest nightclubs, hook-up apps, condoms, and pharmacies that dispense contraceptives?"
"So, these people hear otherworldly voices telling them to attack women seeking health care services and that's not a reason to have them committed and medicated until their hallucinations and delusions stop?
  (Even if they think her choices are ""sinful"" can they not by definition be forgiven by the same prayer we are all supposed to be forgiven by? Why is this one area so unforgivable in these people's opinions?)"
Safe to say she wont be having an abortion
"A dreadful example of how America's obsession with 'free speech' results in harassment, and worse, of vulnerable women and staff at the clinics.  

In London, where I live, there is a Marie Stopes clinic near to where I live.  The idea that women using the service would attract any unwanted attention from members of the public is absolutely unthinkable.

Those people who are picketing the  clinic in Mississippi represent the worst of religiously motivated meddling in other people's lives.  They never change the choices that individual women make, and they spend all of that time virtue-signalling to their God when the could be doing something useful  to contribute towards their communities.  Pious narcissists - yeuch!"
"These anti-abortionists want nothing to do with universal healthcare, which would provide protections for children.  These are the people that are ""fry em"" when any black man is convicted of murder.  The straight-line pedigree of these people go back to holding black people as ""property"".  The hypocrisy of these cretins is astounding."
"Republicans protest against abortion but they don't protest against the guns killing all these children. And they don't protest against the abusers, rapist and killers of the now living unwanted children. Republicans walk away from these children,they don't care about them once these children need help. ""Christians"" pretend they care when they don't."
This woman is a hero.
All sad little people with no lives and head full of evangelical show-biz preacher psychobabble.  All of them should be dragged off and put in a mental institution.
They killed a doctor in the name of life. Makes total sense. I guess as much as being “pro life” and defending the use of AR-15 and the death penalty 🤪
Shelly is a super hero!❤️❤️❤️
"I don't think I'd last a day out there. Joe would trip and fall, Tom would notice his tires mysteriously slashed , ya know? The paperwork alone would make it a pain!"
"Let’s talk about hypocritical. What about The Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 also known as the Laci and Conner ACT: is a United States law that recognizes an embryo or fetus in utero as a legal victim, if they are injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed federal crimes of violence.

So a mother can terminate her pregnancy but if a man murders a pregnant women he’s charged with double murder. Let’s start holding these doctors & mothers that go forward with abortions. 

USA is heading in the right direction. You don’t like it. Leave please"
The fat gate keeper will get what she protected.
I do not feel bad these killers were killed.  They got what they give.  Seams about right
"🎉 Perhaps ... Start a ""Mother and Baby Life"" program  (MABL) create a sign up list offer it to folks that care standing outside clinics or at protests. This will offer a more positive outlet that can really help 🤗 That way we can sign up to personally help with all medical costs, therapy, travel, diapers, foods, education etc until the baby can find a job around 18 yrs old. This list would agree to help with all costs including if the baby grew up as an invalid, then their pledge would automatically extend to cover further than 18 yrs of age.  This would give an opportunity in truth for folks to prove how much one really cares ... and or ... give folks a chance to think a little deeper before commiting their whole Spirit.              *Remember as humans being the best humans we can be ...  we must deserve the right to change our minds in a moments notice upon new and valid information"". Add this  to the top of the MaBL financial sign up list.😊 Must also consider in the future we will lose much land mass as oceans rise. And Environmentle changes  will be Forcing all these then adult  babies to crowd together in smaller useable lands, also creating less food and drinkable water. 😳🥺 Remembering the horrific results of having too many rats in a cage social experiment. 🤔 😱         So this may be one of those questions that has no real answers and perhaps designed to create separation and chaos.
A  Divide and conquer type question. 🤔 Build the list. And as folks, politicians and judges sign up to this Baby and Mother Life Financial Help program  others may follow ... Or not. 
But either way it will give folks a chance to ponder a little further. 🙏💙🙏💙"
She needs to be expired.  Wait.. that would be murder.  Same thing they are doing.
"Mrs. Shelley, you are HERO!!"
"I thought God gave people free will??  
Yep, the sinful internet says he did!

How hypocritical are those sickos who killed those people at those clinics.... 

She should find out where they go to church, and protest there with a ton of people every Sunday, with signs and banners saying things like; God does not exist! -  Do you still believe in fairy tales? 
See how they like that kind of harassment on their door step..."
Ignorance is what religion is about. Keep people ignorant to control them and take their money.
Anti abortion protestors: the epitome of why we need abortion.
Group idiots
"UNWANTED PREGNANCIES are going to cause TRILLION of DOLLARS in FOOD STAMPS, MEDICAID each year, STARVATION, NEGLECT, HATRED, ABUSE and DEATH. UNWANTED BABIES will be ABANDONED in hospitals.

Let face reality. The woman who murdered her 4 children in Georgia by stabbing and injured one, then set house on fire."

"Get yourself an open carry, protect yourself so, you can continue to help these other women who NEED YOU!!! $50.00 fine for assaulting you is a slap in the face and I'd be dam good and sure to protect myself!"
That man spewing the love of God' is probably one of the most Godly people you will know. He loves everyone. But! he is also very specific about who and what he hates.
Okay an abortion before the 12 weeks ok but the third trimester? Now I understand why yall got some serious problems...your killing full blown babies yall..and you pray this wakes people up? Are you fucking mad?!
"The minute an unwanted child is born, these ""people"" want NOTHING to do with paying for the support of the child SO, I think they ALL need to STFU and MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS! GO HOME, you hypocrites!"
Are you going to support this children that for some reason or another have to be aborted. It's not your business stay out of it. Unless you're going to raise it. And if you hurt anyone working there or going there for help your committing a worse crime. You should go to jail.
"Why do we focus on the symptoms rather than the root of the problem? The constitution lacks the power to motivate citizens to collaborate rather than be antagonistic towards each other. Issues of abortion, civil rights & question of guns & mass shootings are symptoms of the disease of disunity."
How come daddy in the sky just doesn't come down and stop it??
"Omg these people are ridiculous, had no idea women had to put up with these freaks, abortion is a woman’s right, a women decision, make Dan go down and look after some street kids, junkies kids, alcoholic,s, foster care kids, now adults and on the streets, ho look after them, pay all thrre costs, feed them, look after there medical needs schooling jobs cloths etc, then see how you feel about taking a woman’s right away, a families right husband and wife right, and the rights of raped children, some as young as 9yr old,"
Holy shit these people are out of there collective minds!!! religion has fucked up more people than any war!!
Do these people ever ask themselves what is it about our society that makes abortion necessary?   Why not invest their time giving support within their communities to lower the need for abortion?
I think that we should be able to make our own choices.  If women can’t make a choice then man should lose a right too.  That’s life.  If you kill someone who is pro choice that makes you a killer too.
"Something that baffles me is this: if the constitution didn't give me the right to an abortion, how can it take it away? P.S. I am way past reproductive age but I am not way past caring for the health of young women."
"CNN posting old sht zombies will eat up. This “woman” or “bleeding person” is harassing protesters for exercising their 1ST Amendment RIGHTS. There’s protesting and then there’s reactionary harassment and infringing on people’s right to protest. If she wants to counter protest no one objects, unless she’s harassing and intimidation by getting in people’s faces, personal space and trying to dox or threaten with recording them for political intimidation."
Thank you for caring!
They should be trespassed and not be aloud in a certain mile radius. Where are these protesters when men rape children or woman???
abortion is only keeps woman promiscuous
"LGBTQ don't get pregnant
why they protesting?
it's like a vegan protesting McDonald's is not serving hamburger"
Men need to shut up.  They know nothing of what it's  like.
Good job Shelly. We need more genocidal activists protesting against people who value life! You must feel so proud. Keep getting in ppls personal space. Remember the best way to express your view is to antagonize and promote violent confrontation
"Sooo many OLD MEN!?!?! And what's wrong with that picture... Two things! Firstly, MEN don't have wombs and won't get pregnant hence they will never have to decide on having an abortion or not! Secondly, they're OLD and had they indeed had wombs, they'd be barren at their over-ripe old age!

Guys! Give! It! Up! 'K?

Women gets pregnant, have to bear the fetus to term, deliver it and take the lion share in nursing and raising the kid! Yes, men are part of the process: 100 percent in conception and of varying degree thereafter.

Sooo... It's basically just the woman who can make a decision here! If she chooses to consult with the man whose genes contributed the other fifty percent of the fetus, it is HER choice!

No man has a right to decide in this matter! Men don't even have the right to demand a right!"
I think these people should lawfully be responsible for adopting every baby they “save”. Bet they would sit down re-evaluate.
Shelly wants to make the choices for her own body. Looks like she could use some help with that.
Why are these abortion escorts wearing rainbow vests??? This is a cult
Why do all these women advocates look the same?!?
WTF! Assault with mutual consent??? I don't think anyone consents to assault normally. Crazy report!
Old white man looking like fools screaming at women
Old white guys protesting abortion...interesting. 🤔
How do you sleep at night? You escort a woman to murder her own child! You have no idea the pain women suffer life long with guilt and regret from abortion. It ruins their life also. Stop playing God. You say it’s the longest walk into the clinic. Maybe the woman needs to rethink what she is doing. Abortion or escort we all stand before God in HIS judgement. You can explain to Him why you escorted a mom to how many deaths of babies? He will judge you. Hell is for eternity.
"Remember who voted to take away your individual rights women of America and vote those people out of office,  America needs progress not regress you outnumber pro life loud mouth holy rollers now prove it on voting day"
"Abortion is a woman right, your body your CHOICE period!!!"
"Their REAL focus is on demanding other people have the same belief they do. That goes against everything our Constitution stands for. ""Pro-Life"" is just Republican rhetoric BS. If they actually cared about ""life"", they'd make major changes in our gun laws. They'd make sure ARs are not available to the public. They'd have a minimum age of 21 for buying a gun. They'd have instruction, licensing, and safety standards for gun owners. But no, they just want to control women and tell them how they can live their lives."
Religious zealots are the most dangerous people on earth! History proves that over and over! Ask any psychiatrist or experience cop and they'll tell you the same thing like my lieutenant told me. They can justify anything in the name of their God murder suicide giving up their kids for sex letting their children die anything. A religious nut stabbed a psychiatrist I worked with in the neck
Little do they know they are setting a great example of why abortion should be legal.
People are bold these days.
"Why no teporting on what left groups have recently been doing at different facilities? I get it, can't drop the agenda. In reality BOTH things should be reported, but won't be on CNN or Fox, because they each have their audience. Local news is more likely to have both types of stories"
"Well, look at it this way: if these clowns believe that embryos have a soul, then an abortion is helping them get back into Heaven as fast as possible. Isn't Heaven better than Earth?"
Religious Christian nuts. Just like those Islamic Crazies. Get a real job and go fix your family. Feed the poor and hungry who are already out there if you want to help. Your Jesus wont forgive you for your sins in life if you impose yourself on others. You make it worse for yourself.
"Take baby clothes 
Abortion is not a type of birth control

Three people died but millions of baby were killed but who cares"
I can't imagine this morbidly obese and terribly homely women ever needing an abortion. So why does she want to kill other people's babies? Jealousy?
"A fetus is not viable outside of the mothers body.
Most fetuses become viable between 24 to 28 weeks. 
To think that a lump of cells can live on it own in an incubator is DELUSIONAL.

These people are the minority of the American society. They live on the fringes of society.
They do not have the right to  SHAME and BLAME women seeking an abortion. 
Especially MEN who don't know what it's like to be pregnant or go through the pain associated with giving birth. 
Nor do they have a clue about the huge hormonal changes a woman goes through during a pregnancy and after giving birth.
Hormones that can cause postnatal depression and worse postnatal psychosis were either the mother kills the baby, kills herself, or both. It never ends well. 
After giving birth it takes  time normally it may take 6 months to a year, or even longer depending on your health and whether there were any complications during delivery.
During this time a woman's libido is usually very low.
Not all husband's or boyfriends are thoughtful enough to wait before demanding sexual intercourse something that is the last thing on a woman's mind. 
You can take progesterone only birth control although it can affect your milk production and  needs time to start working. 
Men can use a condom, but most men don't like using them.
It should be at least 6 weeks before you resume sexual intercourse."
"OMFG. Just let people be! 

If you don't agree with their decision that suits you."
Vote Democrats into extinction in the midterm elections period!!
And yet these men and women who protest do nothing for the born! Ignorance is not an excuse for hate and violence!
These anti abortion fanatics don’t appear to be to clever…
Stay strong.
“And their right to choose life.” That’s not a choice! The right to choose is choosing not to carry the fetus to term.
And they claim is the other way around… I have no doubts the attacks to the pro-life clinics were made by themselves to look like victims.
Baby lives matter
"I'm not an expert on the topic, but it should be the womens choice plain and simple."
Why don’t these pro life people petition their politicians to increase food stamps for families with children if they care about kids so much. So many children in this country go to bed hungry because their parents wages are low and food stamps are too low to feed kids enough and nutritious foods.
"They will murder people someone's family member in the name of pro life.
I  am  pro life but women should have that right to choose their body there choice.  That was also the chant of the same folk who did not want to wear masks to save lives or get vacancies again to save lives."
They have the right to protest. Be safe. Arrest those who violate the law. Lets Go Brandon
the religious are the worst.
"Even God gave us a choice.  Personally, I do not believe in abortion.  but my beliefs have nothing to d with another woman's right to make this personal decision for herself."
Mercy...you're being judgemental
What a God sent protector. Blessing to you always😇😇
IDC how much they say they're are passionate about religion or thier skewed beliefs. I truly believe imo these anti abortion protesters enjoy being antagonist. Pathetic
"These people confuse me. What do they think happens to these so called babies?  Do they just disappear? Since they believe it is a child from fertilization that means if the child has been aborted it returns to the arms of Jesus. The child’s soul returns to God, in heaven the home and place  we are all wanting to be.   They make no sense. Life begins and ends with breath"
Gun shops need to be protested with as much vigor.  The irony is off the charts
"Good for this lady! 
Of course these women have already made their decision, it is ridiculous that these pro fetus people yell at them."
"Dear ❤️ President Putin,
Adultery is a sin 
But fornications are deadly sins .
Adultery is sin with a person whose husband is not informed about his wife’s wilful sin .
Fornications are very common in relationships.
Fornications brings diseases in body .
Sometimes fornication is also dangerous says Hebrew ,
Adultery may create bitterness and lead to murder .
So relationships are safe .
Your war with Zelensky is not a great 👍 sin according to the Bible.
Because Ukraine 🇺🇦 people are our Christians.( relationships)
But I request you to stop the war with Zelensky with a condition stop joining Zelensky in NATO.
1 John tells a safer life style .
1 John tells  us to live in this world according to 1 John 2;-16
Lusts of eyes 
Lusts of flesh 
Pride of life 
Because there is fear ,death and loss of father’s (God’s ) love .
So not only we shouldn’t love 💖 it but we mustn’t  even pray for those Christians who do these mistakes in their life.
But how to make our relationship while in body?
It is only with Christian families.
Take example Jude Boaz and king David 
The great sinner ( from our point of view) David the great king 🤴 sin was only with a Jewish woman but her husband was a gentile.
As a king 🤴 and Jewish leader he might be pitied for her because her husband failed to love his wife .
But Christian family is safe .
God bless you 
🙏🙏🙏
Note ;-King David managed the situation because he was a king 🤴 
But we would be killed or facing troubles in such a deadly sins .
Kings of David times grabbed any woman they wanted .
Amongst all gentile kings David was a gentleman,.
But God didn’t spare him too ,,
My question did god kill those gentile kings ,?
Yea all of them died in the battle.
🙏🙏👋
I request Putin to take a fruitful discion very quickly because as antony blinken says already lot of companies left Russia ,it might affect russian future ,,
So President Putin must stop his invasion of UKRAIN and I assure everything becomes normal to Russia and Russian business,( this I assure President Putin on behalf of usa and President Joe BIDEN,)
God bless you sir 
Thank you Jesus 🙏
Amen 🙏 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
"I wonder how many of these people realize that babies are killed in the Bible, often mandated by God himself!"
"they don't need prayers, they need better wages for a start..."
I believe women with ectopic pregnancies should be monitored closely if there is a obvious and VALID danger it may be able to occur except it is wrong for women without health issues to be given the option of abortion at all!!! It's murder!!  These people are doctors to heal the suck  not your hitman!!!!
Doctors and nurses who perform Abortions are our hero and heroines. Love you all for saving women's lives!. Thank you to this beautiful women for protecting women's rights!. ❤️ 🙏
What gets me is why does God not stop abortion if it is wrong. Why do people have to? Why do they think they are God and have to play being so for God. God is about freedom of choice. You are taking God's given right away from people. You are forcing your beliefs on someone and that is wrong. That is against God.
Why do all anti-choice crazies look like in the privacy of their own homes they molest kids?
"I am pro choice BUT unless the woman's life is in danger  I can't support late term abortion.   As with everything,  there must have limitations or else we become the monsters the right  wingers say we are.  
We can't claim the high road and do what they accuse of doing which in most late term abortions is actually killing a baby. 
I support your right to choose,  just do it before the fetus becomes a baby."
The shootings are just post birth abortions. Other than that the clinic and the shooting kill people at many stages of life. It's mostly just irony.
These people demonstrate how uninformed they are.  Or nuts depending on how violent they act.
They want those white women going for an abortion to carry those babies to term for the sake of the white race
Are these protesters going to adopt these “children”?
Sure wish there had been an insurrection at this point. Papaw is the absolute worst. Get him the hell out of there while there’s still anything to salvage. The next president is screwed  I don’t know why anyone would want to follow obiden.
Fake news as always.
"That makes perfect sense! How can they kill people when they are against killing people???  They are so delusional. 

Men in general, like DAN should have no say in the matter whatsoever!"
"""When i meet my maker I hope the lord has mercy."" Instead of having mercy on the woman that has to bear an unwanted child and Care for them until their 18? Really sir?"
"These religous fanatic's have no right to try and force their beliefs on me, my life my body. I dont want these extremist trump thumpers telling me what to do or how to live my life. They are all so stupid they cant think for themselves so they look to their god trump to tell them what  to think. They are the bottom of our society and I thought snakes were the lowest form of life, not so anymore. These are so sub human. No abortions but allow our children be killed by guns in their classroom. So two faced everyone of them."
This is so much bigger than abortion. It’s about minority rule! this is just the beginning if we do not go out and vote in November. 🙏🏾
How many children has DAN delivered. He has guilt but it is not about abortion. Maybe he has never done anything good in life but he has NO UTERUS NO OPINION. Men should be forced to have vasectomies at 12yrs of age so he know what it is like to have their reproductive rights taken away. That would finally be real justice.
"This is all about a bunch of religious nonsense!  Merchants of myth forcing their views on everyone.  Once these yahoos take total control of our government they will be a dangerous cancer, difficult to remove and deadly like the Dark Ages of their beginnings."
The funny thing is when we die we are shown and experience all the hurt we caused other souls. So that man thinks God is going to show him mercy for doing what he's doing when in reality he's causing those women anguish and that's what God will show him
"you are obviously an introspective thinker. People say it’s a complicated issue often if they’re pro choice, but too often they only see the complications which support their belief. I personally believe that rape, incest, and circumstances in which the life of the mother is in danger are valid reasons for an abortion. I am definitely repulsed by the fact that in the state of New York babies are killed after they’ve been delivered and therefore a US citizens under the constitution. In other words, babies are actually being murdered in New York."
Old people are screwed up in america
It’s terrible to kill babies
"ANYONE who kills an already living breathing people is NOT A PRO LIFE ADVOCATE!!!!!  If you can't figure that out for yourself,  nothing I write will help."
"If churches are going to get involved with making laws, they can pay their taxes as an admittance fee just like everybody else."
No you definitely do NOT have a responsibility to harass patients at the clinic. Your function is to mind your own F'n business. Not your business. These women's bodies are their own.
"Absolute madness, delusions ""we are here to protest the right for the woman to choose life""... is she listening to herself 🤣🤣"
"The irony of violent, corrupt, racist, sexist, hatefilled and criminal activities by people espousing religion is not lost. The only real of religion is the opportunity to control others through misinformation and continuum of ignorance. I know it sounds like we are talking about trump and his radicalised followers…same same.

These yelling crazies look to be the same neighbour’s that yells “get off my lawn” to little kids walking by."
Is it too late to abort these protesters???
Abortion clinic escorts are AMERICAN HEROES!!
OK I''LL HAVE THE BABY BUT.... YOU RAISE IT !!!! THAT WILL SHUT THESE IDIOTS UP
Eleven murders of clinic workers. How pro-life is that?
"America is seriously in very bad shape, everything is sooooo messed up. Nothing make sense anymore"
A key phrase “I think….”  So they are trying to impose their on feelings about abortion. No one has the right to make decisions for someone else. If you don’t like something then don’t participate.
This woman sounds so pretentious.
Anti abortion people who bomb and kill people at clinics are pro life??? Really??? Think about how fucking stupid that is for a minute
"The old guy is funny.  He thinks when he dies he's going to meet his maker.    Like of all the millions that die everyday, the ""maker"" has time for him."
"No no you don't best way is if you abortion girls put a ribbon  on so we no it's my freedom to no who kills the seed 
Cause the best way to avoid this problem  is not to stick it in give you the seed  best abortion  plane find the pro life girls only .
Not saying there not free they are but understand  the price involved 
Taking life away is man take responsibility  of that action  of creation  of life 
And women you chose the path that says life.
So if you don't get the seed you can't kill life 
I respect  all mothers 
Who take responsibility  and still get it done 
Men should take responsibility  of who you released  
Adultery is adultery 
Fight temptation  
But what pro life has they took responsibility  
Not greed that says I deserve  it no I want freedom you have it when you ignore the temptation  of adultery 
Until you become 1 in flesh 
Which passes DNA information  from he and you making a hole new DNA information  creation  life"
"Facts First:
Even the Pope agrees, if you’re “pro-life”, then you should also….
1.  Ask for more gun control laws
2.  Provide more support (financial, emotional, and physical) to mother’s
3.  Support the under-privileged"
"She literally uses “death” in her channel name… This woman is straight out of a horror movie. (And did you catch that this clinic does late-term, abortions, which is basically straight-up infanticide)"
"If these lost souls who feel guilty about their own lives or are 100% cultists actually ""believed"" in the sanctity of 'life', they wouldn't be protesting outside of the Clinic...they would be demanding children be provided education about reproduction, sexual diseases, cancer, women's health, mental health, and demanding universal healthcare for all Americans."
"Why isn’t the private property much larger, with a long driveway?????"
"These are off course sick, sick people."
"The pro-lifers ""think"" they are so just ..
But pressuring people into your way of thinking is being a nazi..
And we live in a free country"
Hero! CNN HERO! I dare ya. 🫵🏻
"These are like minded people who Clinically, walk talk and think exactly like Donnie tRump. They are all mentally Deranged and unstable. Donnie your clones were let loose from the asylum. TRE45ON"
"Have Dan and Joe do a though experiment. As an abortion protester, you are now eligible to be randomly selected to raise an adopted child. They can think of it as unwanted pregnancy. They wouldn't refuse or ""abort"" this child, right?"
Shelly big thank you.  Women's rights
I love how these people think that posting anti-abortion makes them bad people when all they’re doing is ensuring that you don’t kill your baby. What monsters
"I could care less how you feel about it, but if you use abortion as birth control I dont feel sorry for you. for the ones that need one i feel bad for you that selfish sluts ruined it for you. i hate when people abuse good things and get them taken away."
"hope they have put plenty of money aside to pay for all the orphans, children with disabilities, children with severe disabilities. then you have all the problems with many many children with no parents to guide them, therefore creating plenty of new recruits for the gangs. should be OK though coz usa doesn't really have a gangs and guns problem"
"Trying to stop abortion by murdering people..it's all about control...what did this man do to help mothers and babies...nothing,  other than terrorize!!!"
This lady is going straight to hell
Gods number one rule is not to judge and what are they doing protesting?! JUDGING !! MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
"Those killers of abortion workers are no different than the abortion doctors... murder is murder, be it a fetus, or a grown adult ! 💯🤔"
Those protesters are great people
The guy worrying God might be angry he didn't harass and cause enough distress to women and girls. If his god exists he I'd going straight to Hell for his cruelty.
"What is anyone business what I do with my body, no one has told this people to have abortion so don’t tell me don’t ! These are people sit by the window and watch neighbors house!"
"In the past 50 years that has NEVER been a valid case made against abortion. All the anti freedom crowd has done is lie, appeal to emotion, intimidate, extort, commit violence, acts of vandalism, terrorism and even murder. What they really want is to feel self righteous over other people so they can feel good about themselves while ruining other people's lives."
Are they aware Abortions was performed in the Holy Bible?🙄
"So that lady works at an abortion clinic? I guess I’m not clear on how abortions are performed, does she eat them?"
These old men shouldn't have a f***ing thing to say about abortion.
"Jesus comments on True Life and True Death:
« ...You are indeed the children waiting to be born to the Life of Heaven. This is not Life, this one which you live on earth during the mortal day. This is only the formation of your future being as one living eternally. Human existence is the gestation which shapes you to give you to the Light. To the true Light, and not to the poor, murky light of this earth.

I bear you in Me like a mother forming her child; I surround you and shelter you with Myself; I nourish you with My food to have you be born immortal in the hour of what you call “death,” and it is nothing but a “passage.” A passage from an incomplete phase to completeness, from imprisonment in limited space to boundless freedom, from darkness to Light, from obstructed caresses to the absolute embrace of the soul with its Parent.

This is what you call “dying”. You that, with your proud knowledge, still are not able to give the right name to things, and like children a few years old you call things by mistaken names. I want to teach you what “death” is and who the “dead” are.

Death is to be separated from God, like an unborn child that before the proper time is separated from the maternal organ and putrefies in the alveus, which expels him painfully. The dead are those who, because they are expelled in this way, do not differ from the remains of an animal disintegrating in the sun and rain along an earthly cart road, causing repugnance in those seeing them. This is what it is to be “dead.” Sin is the cause which separates you from God and makes you decaying, corrupted flesh, food for Satan, who has poisoned you to devour you, a prey to his hunger as a devourer of souls and an enemy of God, the Creator of souls.» [...]
(— dictation from Ma. Valtorta's notebooks, dated 10-Oct-1943.)

Do not abort if you do not want to become an abortion."
Religious Lunatics 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"McConnell and Thomas should worry that, next, the Court will 'revisit' the right to interracial marriage. Legal since only 1967. Remember the Domino Theory? America is killing itself. Corporations are going to pay travel expenses for women who need to leave the state for an abortion. If corporations are people, will SONY go to jail?"
"So , they don’t mind taking care of born children? Free healthcare, education, and food!"
"Well with the shit that went down with scouts, these people are now gonna feel more justified"
"SO much unnecessary pain, bloodshed, fear-mongering, and interference of (at least SOME) medically necessary abortions… just makes one wonder whose god is going to forgive whom for what wrongs☯️🙏🏼🕉☮"
"What I see is a lot of people who most probably have mental issues. 
This is sad but also often a result of abuses and neglects of children that were born when they shouldn't have because the all women can't be good mothers and many don't have resources in your country like in Canada where everything is made towards helping young mothers...free healthcare for everyone, free dental care, a year off of job paid by our government after the birth of a child and we recuperate our job, that's the law...we also have very little fees for school (mostly their materials)...a monthly payment by child also given by our government until he reach 18 years old...yes we pay big taxes for this but our system is made not to forget any people of our country, and for the well being of mother and kids in priority.....here our children is a priority..and even with this we are not going to force a woman to keep her baby!
We will encourage the ones that would want to keep them and will talk to her about all the perspectives of their choices first but her decision is between herself and God, no judgements...only God can judge and forgive, not us humans. We often think that we have all the answers for others...and clearly take ourselves as God in our world...look at all the dictators that do impose their ideas to their populations..
Also abortion are free in Canada and we assure women to recieve all medical and psychological help necessary...she won't have to go get an abortion on a kitchen table with risks for her health, like many women will probably do now....and if I were you I would start to look at the statistics that will come over women suicidal and child abuses. Your country is pressuring women a lot when they are having their hormones up the roof,  and no consideration of her age, she will have to face maternity and parenthood without any help most of the time, or promises from friends and family that will end up abandoning her with her kid often left alone with her kid.
This decision is never an easy one but remains a woman's decision because she is the one who will live with the consequences of it."
"Wait..these escorts are helping violently and cruelly kill a life. In some states now after this week, they would be an accomplice to a homicide or even serial killing (depending on numbers). That's not heroic, that's serious and extreme mental illness. They should seek professional help asap. Get them to a hotline fast."
Anti-abortion extremest’s are the biggest hypocrites! They don’t want abortions but will not pass legislation to provide healthcare and or financial aid for the less fortunate. Or pass legislation to go after their rapists.
"Abortion is bad
Word atheist  and abortion say

GOD BLESS the people of the clinic. Stay we the people are behind you.. Thank you...
"I am all for ""freedom *of* religion"" for anyone to choose whatever floats their boat, but please for the love of the allmighty spaghetti monster, could we maybe also get ""freedom *from* religion"" so people can not pester and penetrate others constantly with their deranged relgious bullshit views and opinions? Maybe even throw in a s bit of secularism so the USA wont become a califate or a Republic of Gilead."
"Cant we ban rasing children if you dont want to??? Do the Constitutions tell women they have to raise their children if they dont want to??
Can women deny doctors and other healthcare workers to assist them giving birth???.
We have to find a loophole in this mess. 
Can we force the father to take over after birth. The father is just as much mother as the father of the child. Women can provide as fathers can care for the child."
Ask these protesters how many children they've adopted.
"It's the Left that is violent and unhinged. It's not even close. Years ago there were a few wackos on the right, but it's not close now. Just look at all the places of worship or Womens health care facilities that are under attack. There have been over 40 places vandalized and trashed with all kinds of stuff, graffiti and threatening messages, and human excrement. People have been assaulted and sent to the hospital. It's not close, the radical Left becomes unhinged and violent if they don't get their way."
She doesn't need to worry about getting pregnant
Good for her.
"His maker is going to ask him how many unwanted babies he adopted, or supported through college."
"What I find interesting, some of them are willing to kill people over this, bomb clinics, etc. How is that pro-life? And what if they bomb a place & there happens to be a child or baby in there?"
Nightmare!These people are in a cult.They are the Taliban.They are happy now that we have Sharia Law
Time for a gulabi gang
"These people want our country over flowing with poor babies, suffering in poverty & slums.   & Of course they dgaf about life once it's been.
That's why they don't care about rape victims or women who die because they cannot bear having their rapists, or dad's, or uncles baby."
She ?
Hypocrites
How can you be anti-abortion…and pro murder?! There are some insane people out there y’all 😨
God bless Donald trump.
She's a hero . Comment by Bailey Bell
"As a European, I am utterly shocked.  What shocks me the most is anti abortion men.  First, they have no idea what it means to be pregnant.  Second, I would love to see them pregnant and delivering a baby of which they know they can’t take care.   We as women know what is best for us and for a baby because sometimes a baby will have a miserable life for different reasons.   I myself have had two abortions when I was young.  I simply couldn’t have coped, the two men would absolutely not want to take care of me and a baby.  And I would have had to give up my job which I loved.  Anyway, this whole issue is is our, women., not men’s problem.   With all the issues like abortion, racism, extreme right movements You have in the States I consider myself very lucky to be European, Swiss exactly."
Thank these women for helping these ladies!!!!
It should be illegal to harrass anyone seeking medical treatment from healthcare professionals. Throw these lunatics in prison.
Our country is going backward because of the minority.  I feel sad that they're attacking women's rights currently but we should fear what they'll come after next.
Why are all these crotchety old men protesting? I guess they take their cue from all the crotchety old men in Congress who get to decide what's best for women.
Instead of protesting how about “pro-lifers” adopt the kids already here and needing a family?! Even as an adoptee I’m still STRONGLY pro-choice and these hypocrites disgust me to no end.
"One very courageous woman. Thank you for protecting these women. God bless you. I can not understand the types of people who insist the country & everyone in it live under THEIR rules. Americans have a right to choose how they want to live and those protesters have no right to harass women. If the protesters believe so strongly that  their god doesn’t want abortion, then they should live their lives under their God’s rules and have faith that these women will be punished. It is no one’s right to make others live a life that they have not chosen. This is why I detest all these man- made religions, claiming to know what god wants & doesn’t want! And I especially detest the evangelicals. What hypocrites. They send in their money so that their pastors can live a life of luxury, while screwing around outside their own marriages. Bloody hypocrites! Go home and pray to your god and let others do as they please. 😡😡😡😡"
"They are escorting women in there to kill their children,and they don't even realize how evil they are.they are so evil! There is no gray area to: thou shalt not kill. Who gave them the right to decide who lives and who dies?I guess it makes them feel powerful!"
Man it must be nice to have nothing better to do with your time…I’ve other shit to do 🤷🏽‍♂️
Shelley needs arrested.
"When he meets his Maker, he will be asked ""Who told YOU you have a RIGHT to OVERTHROW MY WORD!?!"" And they are yelling, ""You have a son or daughter!!"" when they could very well be carrying someone Intrasex. THREE SEXES, PEOPLE! Don't EVER forget how THOSE babies had their genitalia butchered to satisfy someone else's Beliefs there are ONLY TWO."
I respect you so much Shelley!!!
"I just want to smack the anti-abortion protesters. Guess I shouldn’t work as an escort, then. 😂"
Thank you Shelly.
Until abortion starts killing these women as well maybe then they will understand
"I am a Christian but I irks me to no limit that these so-called Christians are in direct contradiction of the words from the Bible they are shouting at those women.  That Bible says to follow peace with ALL men and not just those who agree with them.   The Bible is not written for those that don’t believe and follow it teachings  it’s for those who say they are believers and gives them instructions that governs their conduct toward others.   They are suppose to be lights in a dark world but they are poor examples  and if I wasn’t a Christian there is nothing they are doing and saying to those people that would make me in anyway curious of accepting their God.  Shame on them for their hypothetical ways.  I pray for the safety of all those escorts who have compassion for those woman. Remember, it wasn’t the so called sinners the cried for Jesus’ crucification, it was the church people."
Some retired  vets would like to protect the clinics ask them Lord will and he send help
Gosh what a surprise... a bunch of old white men and a couple of white women trying to force their religious ideals on ALL women in America. Yeah that hasn't happened about a billion times since the 1500s
How is having a right to choose life when you vote to restrict someone's basic human right to choose?!?!! These anti abortions numskulls need to be in a cave locked away from society
"Fact, you that aid the killing of unborn will suffer consequences because there is an afterlife and there will be consequences."
But yet they believe in the death penalty.
"The anti abortionist should teach ""fucking with responsibility"" so as not to create a life.
Keep condoms on penises and crossed legs for the ladies.
YES! Very basic!"
"Crazy people outside abortion clinics need to get a life, live their own life with a little purpose, cause don't make a difference.  They just litter the sidewalk."
#republicunt #cultmembers #STFU
"Why does the Christian taliban feel the need to push their ""magical sky god"" beliefs on everyone else???

Didn't they ever hear of FREE WILL???"
"I love babies, who are born one of the twelve months Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter."
"If a man thinks abortion is wrong then all of those ,en should be fixed immediately."
You are an amazing woman please don't stop what your doing. Sending love from 🇨🇦
Great job america.
"God is not going to reward you for harassing these Women. If you don't know that, you do not know The Lord."
So much for the land of the free… Republicans are such ridiculous hypocrites.
"Religtards, Amerikkkan Taliban"
boy. all this to make sure some unborn people die.
"Anti abortion protesters killing people is as nonsensical as it gets...
Pro life alright...."
Burn it down
Wonder what they are going to move on to next?
This might cause human extinction if abortion is completely banned in some states.
As far as I'm concerned a baby is only a baby when it pops out crying.  A Kleenex is not a multiple homicide scene and abortion is just a more complicated way of pulling out
"Get ready for all the unwanted crack babies, the ones born with severe mental and physical disabilities, the ones born with no limbs, the ones born destined forever to a wheelchair, and finally in 16 or 18 years, you now gotta deal with those that were raised in the foster care system... What Pro life group has the money and facilities to take in millions of unwanted kids??"
"How many of them have adopted children or offered support, financial, mental, physical, etc support to women if they have the baby? My guess, 0."
"These people saying they will “help” what does that “help” look like? Are they going to fund the low income women? Are they going to adopt unwanted children? Are they going to help pay for child care, food, health care, college?"
"What an unfortunate job title!  Can you imagine applying for a job later in life with ""escort"" on your resume?"
"Its like they are only ""pro-life"" when it's a fetus in the womb. These ""pro-life"" politicians and citizens,do nothing to help and seem to stop caring,once the child is born. Children in America are starving, children and woman are being raped, and here these people want to force them to birth the child from that. Like it's their fault or something. Its disgusting,and honestly people should be ashamed of themselves. #mybodymychoice!!. And its just creepy that men put so much time and effort into telling us woman, what we can and cannot do with our bodies."
"TWISTING THE NARRATIVE JUST LIKE THEY DID ""THE DON'T SAY GAY BILL""."
"Pro-life, however they murder and execute the healthcare professionals. How does it make sense??!"
"Protest wont help much in USA. Your not in Europe, where politician takes citizen opinion serious and they will resign in the favor of the citizen. USA, you run and lie in front of the voter faces. In Europe, if you do that. You can be fire and resign in a year. A laying corrupt judge is immune to being fired. I guess, they can change the whole country."
I wonder if they get their animals spayed or neutered?!?!?
"Notice how more than half of the anti abortion people are men, people that never have to make the decision."
Noos
"So, Governor Asa is bragging about all the wonderful services his state will provide to women enslaved by his state to produce children for his future workers. These women did not desire his services, they were not looking forward to his services and they may hate that their state-enforced slavery against her has forced her to receive these services. He loves making women his slaves. He worries about the ""life"" of an unformed human, but he does not give a damn about the real life of the woman who is pregnant. In reality, Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark) is a murderer of grown women. (And he loves that about himself.)"
"Any monster who could serial kill their own children, has serious and extreme mental issues."
I bet a lot actually had or paid for abortions and are hypocrites VOTE BLUE EVERYONE AND STOP THE RADICAL REPUBLIECAN AGENDA
This woman is a phenomenal woman!!!
"Gotta love the woman saying every woman has the ""choice of life"".
But no other choice is available."
"I'm a conservative, and pro choice. I'm against abortion, but telling a woman what she can and can't do, over rules my feelings on abortion. These people that stand outside of clinics, and yell at these women, need to get a life. They should thank God she's there and not me!!!!!!"
"Why aren't these people supporting Universal Healthcare and education, why aren't they fighting for guaranteed maternity leave and childcare assistance for working Moms
Why??? Because this is NOT about life, this is about CONTROL...PATRIARCHY"
"God Bless you Shelly and the doctors at this clinic and all their staff for your assistance to these women in their most difficult times.  These protestors are nuts, and none of them will adopt a child so how can they tell someone to choose life when they won’t choose to adopt."
"LAME🙌let these people live their path. You’re not their savior, you’re not GOD. Let them be free in a free state. Don’t be a LAME TRUMP SUPPORTER, that guy is a rapist.👍"
I grew up 6 blocks from there. Dr Carhart has a very interesting story. Women owe him a LOT. I’m very grateful for what he’s given up so we can be safe.
😂🤣 4 of the 3 protesters were very old white men. What is that about?
The music really sets the mood...
"I don't agree with an abortion just because ""it's my body,"" although I feel they should still have that right (hey, freedoms a bitch). I fully understand that banning abortion only bans _legal_ abortions, that a woman who has committed herself to not having a child is going to do *whatever* she has to, by whatever means she can find, which includes some dangerous and deadly stuff, to not have that baby

I've always felt like the decision from a standpoint of, ""Well I just don't want this baby, because I'm careless, and never been big on learning a lesson or keeping condoms,"" was a selfish motivation, especially in a world we're there are good couples who really want a kid yet can't make one themselves.... I mean, there should be options in that case...

But incest, rape, or a medical diagnosis that fully confirms the baby is just lining up for a miserable existence or going to endanger both lives coming to term.... That's just necessary, and I hate to think a woman would need that and not be able to get it.

People who protest abortion don't seem to realize that, to prevent the one selfish case, they endanger two lives, in every other instance, to protect one life that they _never_ really cared about in the first place (or, as Carlin put it, are just outraged that they're never going to get the chance to stop caring for this baby after they're born)"
"Nice, TickTok Shame lol. The chinese are laughing at you while doing the xi xi ping shuffle, sometimes, youtube is a wonderful place. Notice its people with northern accents, most southerners are actually cool with having the right to choose.. except for the religious and maga hat minority.. yeah i'm glad we addressed the issues we were having here with nonsense."
That guy calling her mom was as creapy as ive ever seen.
"Can they feed them? Can they those kids they call life? Why don't they start feeding homeless kids first and get them education ! Them maybe , maybe 🤔 i will think if they really care."
Their bodies their rights 🤷🏾‍♂️
"No,  one has the right to tell a woman what she can and can't do with her own body.   Not even a law past by the corruption of the Supreme Court judges."
"""She was sick of the mentally ill, so she posted them on tiktok"" should be the title here."
"SCOTUS, by its dishonest tricks sided with those terrorists anti-abortion. The people must ask Kavanaugh, Gorsuch and Barrett to resign or at least to recuse themselves, given that they lied to us, and the debate must be resumed with the remaining judges. A liar with a conscience is a liar who resign when caught on the fact. To let liars (caught on the fact) not being fired, is like keeping a broke engine in a plane, except that here the plane is the country. The court above Scotus is the people, and the people have to ask Kavanaugh, Gorshuch and Barrett to resign, or at the least to recuse themselves, in the debate which has to be resumed. If not, the US looks like being already a theocracy à-la Saudi Arabia or Iran.
BTW, in my religion it is a sin to impose to people doing something with their body that they do not want. That rules infringes my religion which shows that such a ruling is also completely anti-constitutional. It has 0 merits. The trigger laws should not be applied."
"Why those prolife people don't go to protest in Harlem or in the south bronx to gang members and tell them not to kill childrens and grownups. There are real criminal out there that kills and torture other people for no reason. 
I think those protesters will do better job with real criminals."
Make em famous

"Thanks for covering this woman, SHE is out here doing ""God's"" work. If you see any of these comments, Ma'am, just know you are appreciated by many people, and deserve to be recognized by many more."
It's our bodies we can have as many abortions as we choose to. Jesus gave us the opportunity and privilege to choose. If we choose to have abortions It's our choice to do so. I wish one of these people who is against abortions would approach me. I would kill them
"Why does't anybody realize and bring it up that all these conservatives want to do it CONTROL you.  PERIOD.  They want to control you what you do with your body... what you do inside of your homes, etc.   The ""saving of lives"" of the unborn is just a scam, lies and a sham--- like everything else they say and do.  THEY CARE A HOOT ABOUT SAVING LIVES--and I mean any lives (except their own).  IF they really cared about lives, they would do something about guns and ban them.  So why doesn't anyone bring this,  the real truth to their hypocritical faces and to them.  The proof is right there for everybody to see it.  All else is whitewash and hogwash."
Bravo! To Shelley!!! These mostly are men that are anti women's rights!
America is 🤒
"These are the real heroes,God bless them,and we all need to vote in November to stop this madness, because this is just the beginning of all this shiit."
it's always the people who don't have wombs or no longer can use their dried up wombs that are so concerned about another people's bodies and it's beyond disgusting
"The worst thing we can do to another human is to assume we know their lived experience. If you want to affect change in the world, stop harassing people, and go look in the mirror and start with yourself"
Why is it anti abortion terrorists are almost always men?
Bless her!!!!!!!
"Either be pro-life or you'll be killed? Yeah, that logic checks out...SMH"
What kind of help? They're going to help raise it feed it clothe it educate it or they just going to give her a pep talk you can do it?
Guard  DOGS?
"The Atlanta Olympics bomber was part of the Christian Identity movement, and also bombed at least two abortion clinics, killing a cop in the process. Right-wing extremism is by far the greatest terrorist threat to the US today. It's also sanctioned by a growing subset of the GOP."
"this is a repeat from months ago , not news."
"I love how people think it's OK to kill an actual living and breathing female over a fetus that can't breath on their own. I was brought up believing in God. I still do but these religious extremists are actually insane. Stay home. It's not your bodu so it's none of your business. These are the first people to not ""have their tax dollars"" go to welfare. They are the first people to judge a single mother because their husband/boyfriend has abandoned them because they actually had the baby. The first ones who abandon these children when in foster care. Those children are abandoned by the church and state. The ant-abortion people are ignorant. If they believe one second that their freedom of prayer in public is not in jeopardy now they are severely mistaken. I hope they have to go pray underground or in an alley  some day. They don't realize this is more than abortion. It's a FREEDOM and civil right being taken away. It leave us as Americans venerable to have ALL our freedoms stripped. By the way, Justice Thomas is a sexual devient!! He is the devil incarnate. Below is verse for you false prophets and religious nut jobs since you like to quote the bible.

Matthew 7:15 ""Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves."""
"These protesters are going to meet their maker, Satan, they are literally doing the devils work and they are acting as if God would be proud. The Bible directly says not to do this type of tomfoolery, that he is the only one to judge. It encourages the slaughter of women and children who do not agree with you because they aren’t Christian? How is that worshipped? Or when Lot throws his daughters out to the town to get r***ed then they both impregnate themselves by their father!?! This is what prolifers want? Disgusting. If people actually sat down and read through the Bible they would find a majority of it makes no sense and is absolutely amoral."
So much mental illness. Why normalize it instead of helping them? Maybe Margaret Sanger was right
The audacity of a man taking this stance 🙃
These Bible pounders deserve some lead
Dismantle the churches. Topple them. They are sources of anti-logic and abuse. Dismantle them.
Lmao. Shouldn't you at least be capable of getting laid before you have an opinion on abortion? No way someone is throwing it in that
"Post-natal abortionists, I hate them all."
"It's funny (not) that I've never heard one of these forced birthers advocate for services for families and children. It feels pretty hateful to women when you won't support kids and families but impose your will on them.

Freedom is weird in America. You have the right to a gun and to shooting kids, but women and families can't make decisions about their families. You guys are messed up. Freedumb. That's what that is."
All these pro life idiots are so pro child abuse. It’s disgusting 🤮 how they want more unwanted and starving children. They don’t want healthcare for babies !!! No food for babies !!! Sick
"Romans 1:22-25
King James Version
22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen."
Total biased coverage.  Another slow day for CNN.
"Abortion =  killing unborn babies

Call it what it is !"
This is what Social Security is allowing
The ban on abortion does not go far enough. An ban on male masturbation is needed! Sperm is life and these men are look suspiciously guilty.
I believe in abortion but I have limits. I knew a girl a few years ago she had 2 weeks Before her baby was to be born her and her boyfriend broke up she went and got an abortion I don't agree with that she was only a couple weeks from giving birth the baby she said they cut the baby head off before they pulled it out I haven't talked to her since I could never let some chop my baby head off and pull their limbs off if that's what really happened that's disgusting I can't agree with it
"If a woman does not want to get pregnant, just don't spread legs. Or take contraceptive pill to not get pregnant. OMGOSH, 😢 😢 killing babies is just another crime."
"When your State seizes control of a person's body and forces that person to make a product for the benefit of the State, that is SLAVERY. Throughout history, the most despised form of slavery is when your State enslaves women and forces them to make babies. That form of Slavery is called BABY BREEDING SLAVERY. It has been reviled for thousands of years. And now Baby Breeding Slavery has been forced on our United States."
They are harassing not protesting there should be laws against that call the police
"Where's LE? Harassment is legal distress. Lord of the Flies, sub 😫
How much treasure + resources do these ""anti-abortion protestors"" give to children + their parents?"
For once. I would advocate for holding guns to protect the clinic
"Thank you Shelley. You are the actual source of love to those women, not those very ignorant people outside."
Shelly is a very brave woman!  We could use more like her.
"Women in America think that they have it  better than women from other countries, sorry,  even other countries realize  women  deserve a choice.  
These protesters don't care about  the abandoned children, sexually abused children, and children in foster care."
"Please don,t stop we all need more people like you. Love and respect coming your way."
Very courageous. Thanks for what you are doing.
Abortion may be wrong to some people but the thing is it's that persons life n choice what they want to do. Worry about your own life n let people do what they think needs to be done with thier own body!
Once your born your on your own!!
Those anti abortion activists are so ridiculous.  MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
"Respecto,  respect and love for all of you ❤️"
These people protesting the abortions but none of them are willing to take these potential children and give them a home and raise them. After children are born they have nothing to do with them.
"50% of all fertilized eggs do not implant on the uterine lining.  If God is the reason for everything, why does God abort 50% of all babies?"
Think about this at the next election.   Especially with all the rolling back of rights in the US.
"They are PRAYing, but are they PAYing for the children's needs for the next 18-20 years? As Dr Phil has said many times: the child-protection services are broken in the USA. 
Every child should be wished for, and none the result of their father's neglect and irresponsibility. Give women the protection and services they need. And stop male privilege - let women decide over their bodies! And make USA a modern and developed country with some freedom and essential rights at last!"
I’m sorry but on one asked to be brought into the world I surely didn’t and if I had been aborted I would not have lived the hell on this earth.
"Let me throw out a bizarre thought. Recognizing this is not even reality but let me throw out a thought. What if the government said men no longer could have vasectomies? What if the government told you that you had to father children and being those children's Life daily have complete support of medical food clothing schooling and should you not provide that you go to prison for the life that the child is on Earth? The responsibility always falls on the mother even when the courts get involved many many sperm donors managed to avoid taking their responsibilities. It is time to make it an equal playing field. Rapist lovers one nighters have to take legal responsibilities or pay with prison time for the 18 years. The mother is not the only one that created the child. These men in courts and on the streets are so damn righteous. I don't necessarily believe in abortion but men have to remember the government is controlling women's bodies, it is time they realize that the government could take over theirs as well.. oh yeah men rule sarcasm noted."
Isn't this an old rerun I swear I've seen this same episode like 4 other times on cnn
based and abortion pilled
CNN inciting as always.
This man has it right too many people wanting to k*ll babies instead of helping babies they want to k*ll them..no help with s*xual abuse and rape is swept under the rug but can make such a up roar to K*ll our babies..girls/ woman  please STOP listening to these people tricking you God help them all..I know someone who has had this done and she's crys and regrets it everyday she says and wishes the truth would come out there using baby parts to their gain..it's a life threatening job meaning they take the babies lives
"Put the White Fascist in Prisons for they love walls, make sure they have entertainment of recorded babies screaming, kids nagging and screaming on intercoms all day long, so they can be fulfilled.  we know they won't need medical care as they did not want America to have it. No hot food , homeless people can't get hot food., they made sure of that. So that should be the Heaven that they wanted."
All men saying this shit but don't bare no responsibility
There is no constitutional right to kill babies.  That is fake news.
"These women will meet these children, the children will stay in heaven !"
wow those people are weard. how can they think they have the right to decide  other peoples destani.. Is that the free country ?
"She is doing a great job.
Keep these nutjobs away from the patients. Each patient has good reasons for getting their pregnancy ended and should be respected for their decision."
"Dan, I am the result of date rape and the subsequent abuse I endured by those who claimed to love me should never be the result of an unwanted birth. You are short-sighted in your extremism."
These pro- lifers really love to resort to murder to get their point across
The U S. is going down the tubes.
What a bunch of hypocrites...I wish they would use the same effort to ban AR 15 and make it harder to get guns that kill born again born little kids in schools...the constitution says freedom of religion yet Republicans and most Christians want to force Christianity beliefs on ppl...again what a bunch of hypocrites but won't fight for stricter gun laws and the ban of AR 15 which have been used to killed alot of born children in schools

"Why is it that all the men protesting and harassing women only care about the fetuses and abandon them the minute they are actually babies? There is more than a bit of hypocrisy and cruelty displayed here. Men will never have to make this decision, so they should be busy supporting charities that help real babies. It appears to be against their principles, which are missing in someone who will never find themselves in that situation."
These effing idiots should be held crimininally responsible for all the resulting deaths of pregnant women and financially responsible for the unchosen born.
"Religious or not, if you want to be a help, help but don’t be anymore of a Burden to people you want to help. Just saying."
"The men who are against abortion must stop f*cking women and start f*cking themselves
Edit: oh, and praying is not helping. Just so you know"
"I had an abortion 35 yrs ago it was the same shit show with especially men outside the clinic. It's not used as birth control and I don't believe in your hateful religious beliefs, your hateful god or your Bible thumping bullshit. It is way past time to tax the churches since they don't understand the separation of church and state. They have no idea what the fn Constitution says except of course the 2ndA and miss the well regulated militia part."
Religion is the practice of using nonsense in order to explain ignorance
When are these anti-abortion protesters going to line up to protest against lack of health services for babies?? Infant mortality is a thing. As well as various serious health issues and social outcomes. They don’t seem to care as soon as the baby is born.
"It's so funny.

Libs Of TikTok is single-handedly dismantling the intersectionalist progressives.  This woman is doing nothing."
... and they're mostly males
Hypocrites   They don't care just follow their evangelicals desires
I couldn’t be a clinic escort. Because I’d just haul off and start throwing hands with some of these anti abortion people. Then IM suddenly the bad guy for being brought to a violent rage by stupidity and ignorance brought on my a self righteous need to force the rule of their own religion on others
"Educate people on ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies, stop having unprotected sex. Make contraceptives readily available."
Santa clause kills babies all the way up to delivery date.... wow
Shelley and all others protecting pregnant women are so awesome!  Those forced birthers who hassle these women are pathetic and disgusting.
The same nutjobs who didn't want to be told to wear a mask for their and other's health wanna impose a pregnancy on women. That's rich...
"These people are Pro life. Until the baby is born.  They couldn’t care less about the poor, the disenfranchised."
"Abortion should absolutely be legal, but third trimester abortions?? I assume those are only done whenever the child is severely ill (not viable) or when the woman's life is in danger? Here in Sweden, abortion is not a controversial topic - it is absolutely the woman's decision. No questions asked. However, after 18 weeks you need a special permission from the National Board of Health. Abortions are NOT allowed if the fetus is viable and are generally never done after 22 weeks."
"You could start guarding these places with Assault Weapons.
That'd not just drive off Protestors, but it would win the Gun Debate with Republicans outright.
Once a couple of Republicans got Aborted too, they'd try and ban assault weapons so gd fast."
"0:40....Why does this woman not say that she has never had an abortion?   Probably because she has had at least three of them, as a teenager, at this same abortion clinic.  These abortions, according to her, are not her fault because if abortion were illegal, she could have forced the fathers to marry her    If the clinic released her records, would she sue?   And would she be insulted if I said that having babies for the purpose of asking people for money is prostitution and should be so prosecuted?"
"They are allowed to protest just like pro choice is allowed to protest but a right winger took it too far by running his truck into peaceful protesters protesting the overturning of Roe. I’m pro choice but I’m against abortion in late pregnancies. There are GOP that also want to ban contraceptives which means that women will be forced to have the child no matter what even if it’s a result of rape or incest. As a medic I responded to a 12 year old who was having post partum depression. A 12 year old! These states that are making abortion illegal want to prevent women from crossing state lines to get an abortion as well. Charge the woman with homicide. There are a lot of men who don’t want to have children and with abortions being illegal then what? Do what others have done and beat the living day light out of the woman to force an abortion? Kill her to avoid her from having a child? Men have done that several times. And if she needs to have an abortion because her life is in danger then who gets to decide if she is allowed to have it? Call a judge to decide if she is sick enough to have an abortion especially when it’s early stage or deny her and use her as an incubator and let her die after they take the child? Do we have to call Marjorie Taylor Green and ask permission from her because the mother will die if she carries to term? We all know she is so pro life right? Oh wait. She is pro life for the fetus but once the child is born she doesn’t care about the born child and that’s evident with all of the bills she vetoed such as bills to help families receive formula, mental health services, gun restrictions, and so on. Those she vetoed because we can’t allow Biden to get any bills to pass because we have to get Trump back in office right even if it hurts Americans. Trump is number one and the American people are wayyyyyy down on the list."
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼👍🏼
"""Their right to choose life.""

As oppose to a woman's right to choose anything else. You know, if you take away all their other options, they're not really giving them a choice at all.

I want to kick these idiots in the head."
Preborn okay preschool your fucked  George Carlin
People really need to mind their own business and let people make their own important decisions about their life ! They are the ones that have to live with it .
What about the sins they are commenting openly or secretly? Is this what their religion tells them? Is that their gateway to heaven?
Oh the outrage for the 11 killed..🤦 what about the millions killed by abortion 😡
"ALL of those anti abortion protestors are middle aged, probably middle class, white people."
"So it's okay for ""Pro-Life"" advocates to gun down and murder doctors and staff at abortion clinics?!! I call BULLSHI*!. These so called Christian do gooders are a bunch of homicidal hypocrites!! Stay safe Shelly and to everyone else PLEASE vote these corrupt Sycophant MAGA Republicans OUT of government and VOTE BLUE in November before they take ALL of our freedoms away!!
VOTE BLUE! 💙"
"Hey, the vast majority of Americans WANT legalized access to abortion, and many of whom normally voted Republican. But not any more!! I cannot think of a better way to get couch potatoes off the couch, and into the polling stations, this November!"
WE WILL DEFY THEM
"So... If blue states can't keep up with the influx of abortions coming in from red states, should blue states turn away people from red states and give those appointments to people in Thier own state first? I think so. They made their bed...not us. And when that time comes...they should be the ones forced to lay in it...and have a baby they don't want"
Why don't all these complaining people go help poor already born babies!
We are coming for you Democrats!!! We are going to take your rights away...one way or another. Bwahaha!!!!
Vasectomies should be mandatory as it take two to tango
Everyone for abortion has already been born
"You call yourselves the land of the free but will not give women their own right to make a free choice, but are happy to sell guns to any tom, dick or Harry so they can go round shooting your children at schools 🤔"
SCOTUS is stacked with Liars.....Republicans Leaders don’t care about people after birth....crazy stuff
"Wow only in America do you get threats outsideof a medical institution and patients who need escort for. 

You're gonna help you right now? A prayer? How about a truck of money to help support poor moms? I bet they run away if they are charged a ton of money every time they shout outside of an abortion clinic."
This woman is a human hero the likes of which Republicans will never have
"“Mom, let us help you!” How? Adopt the baby? Cover the healthcare? Or pray? How about they put all of this free time into some real good and feed kids at a youth shelter? Then again I forget, after the baby’s born, their mission is done. These escorts are amazing!"
Typical Bible bangers......

My gf at the time had a red paint ballon thrown at her for going to the clinic so I figured fuck it imma terrorize these assholes right back"
"Anti seems non violent -however the pro's are destroying property, I see a left wing democratic pattern here..."
Bro she doesn’t even have a counter argument
Won't these protesters be surprised when they close their eyes for the very last time and then there is.... nothing... nobody... a complete void - forever.
"It's not 'my body' once the human being is alive inside. It's 'OUR bodies' and America will protect that unheard voice.

Be responsible and abort before and stop thotting."
Abortion's are violent. Just watch how one is done if you can stomach it.
"Amazing, perhaps hypocritical, how anti-abortion protesters use violence in their so-called efforts to stop the ""murder"" of innocent children. I say y'all get your heads out of women's uteruses and mind your own damn business!"
Fuck cnn

Made me cry."
Herr escorting job is horrible i hate her!!
"All these anti-abortion people should pay a 35% tax that would then be used for rearing an unwanted child, a "" sick"" child or a child of rape and or incest. I  can imagine how quickly they change their mind."
"Seems like a lot of women dont want to be accountable.

The responsible women are not afraid of the hearbeat bill."
I'm not a woman ( as you can see by my name ) but I understand that having an abortion is not an easy CHOICE for a woman.
GOod!
Thanks Shelley. You're doing the right thing.
"Where are the women?
The guys look so ignorant."
Can she be arrested now ? 🤔🤔
Good for u… these people should not be allowed to do that. Leave our bodies alone
No surprise by democrat media no word about left wing mob vandalism and attacks
Shelley is risking her life big time. I wish her all the best.
No surprise by democrat media no word about left wing mob vandalism and attacks
"Educate yourself a little bit and you'll become anti-abortion after the heartbeat. 
Special cases are always excluded. 

CNN found the least useful argument for anti-abortion and perfectly planted it here.

Well its CNN."
"You aren’t “offering help” ma’am. You are making a painful decision infinitely worse. It’s not your body, butt out. Roe v Wade balanced the rights of women to own their own bodies and lives with that of a fetus. An embryo is not a fetus."
religious nut jobs have taken control of our country
"The thing is the anti-abortion movement would receive a lot more sympathy if you heard kinder words from many of them with a softer tone and if you saw action behind those words. The one thing we know for sure is while we have a lot of people who want to be anti-abortion when it comes time to offer the mother of a child health care things change, when it comes time to offer a child healthcare after being born things change when it comes time to feed the mother and the child or to help pay bills for the mother and the child or to do anything for the mother and the child after the birth of the child things change. The same anti-abortion pro-life individuals you don’t see them after the birth of the child. For instance you see lots of protesters outside the clinics why are the same protesters outside of adoption facilities saying give those children more they need more. Why are those same protesters outside of Medicaid facilities protesting for access for single parents. You don’t see those protesters pushing for more food benefits or better housing stipend for single moms but they push for the pregnancy to reach full term. After that they disappear."
"Don's picture of the as yet unborn full term infant is from the final scene of Stanley Kubrick's movie, 2001."
The men protesting...wow...
If you don't have a uterus you shouldn't have a say on what a woman does with her body.
These people are ignorant god got nothing to do with abortion they there is god so far god has not shown up
The greatest trick the Devil played was hiding in plain sight .  She is escorting them into the shower in away. 😯😯
Well first of all there is no God .....
"They are not anti-abortion, they are pro-birth and that is all.  They could be volunteering their time helping children that have been born and are under resourced due to poverty.  But instead they harass women with their religion.  They can't mind their own business....."
Mostly old white men. Fascist kooks.

I think she is awesome for what she's doing. Please be careful and stay safe.
Abortion was never the answers for me but I was thankful to have the option. I’m pro choice and I’m for taking care of the kids already here. All those people screaming about abortion being murder  are the same people who complain about low income families getting food stamps and healthcare from the government. They only care for the unborn and when the baby is born it’s fuck them kids. It’s not about unborn kids… this is about controlling a woman and her body.  We need to clip a their nuez and band the blue pill. Make men start supporting the unborn baby as soon as she test positive. If they abuse a woman or a child we start wacking that off too.  Matter of fact jacking off should be considered an abortion and murder of unborn kids.
"Women should have the choice to decide for themselves.
As a Christian I know for sure that our choices and actions in life have consequences but it's the individual that must answer at the end of the day."

"Nebraska abortion clinic, I’m guessing closed today, ha ha"
But what's an Abortion?
"Put them blast with their intimidation!
I want to see the opposite happen in this country... There are well known organizations sending out vans to trick women into these vans to tell them all kinds of nonsense and not given all the options available to them. I want pro choice activists to go and find these vans and stand outside with pro choice posters and pamphlets with accurate pro choice information."
"Abortion is not healthcare. Killing a baby to save your career is not healthcare. Killing a baby because you hate the daddy is not healthcare. Killing a baby because you had a one-night stand is not healthcare Killing a baby so you can have fun & travel is not healthcare Reminder: 

What’s more democratic, giving 9 unelected and lifetime-appointed judges (not lawmakers) unilateral federal authority on such a controversial issue for which the Constitution is silent, or deferring to each state whose state legislators are voted in by the people?

Who cares how long something has been the “Law of the Land” if it was the result of a faulty interpretation.

The vast majority of these “my body, my choice” activists were totally fine with you being forced to take an experimental “vaccine” or lose your job, your livelihood, and your ability to put food on the table. They’re phonies at their core."

Gosh they are ugly.

"For being supposedly Christian, these anti-abortion protesters have a lot of hate and a lot of time to waste."
"Bah ha...they got some actors because the lefties are making complete fools of themselves...showing that public school taught them nothing about America and that they literally WANT to kill babies.  Good riddance to wierdo lefties and thier bizarre propaganda machines, CNN & MSNBC."
"I hate this lying hyhpocrisy!!! They are protesting but they are not offering the women help and support after the birth of a baby that the woman and the baby will hve a good life. They are not interested in the situation of these women, they don't try to understand. Why are so many men protesting?? Men are the ones who are impregnating women, deny the contraception with condoms and many of them run away when they get to know that their girlfriends or wives are pregnant. They don't help and support them, especially when the child is born. Men you have no right to dictate women what they have to do!!! I am impressed and greatful that still so many people protect these women who come to the clinic be safe and protected. To the protesters: don't think that what you has anything to do with christianity!!!"
All the unwanted children in foster homes that have been ignored by the anti-abortionists are waiting to be adopted. What will happen when millions more unwanted pissed off 18 year olds hit the streets with the guns they bought on their birthday? We live in interesting times.
These pro lifers never show up at schools after mass shootings. Wonder why . . . .

I wonder how many people in all that time have been killed in surrounding intersections perhaps they should start helping with other crosswalks also
"No matter how you look at it, 3rd trimester abortions are killing a viable, living human being. 6, 7 & 8 month old babies are born and live long lives every day, guess what I'm saying is I feel after 5-6 months that's a little person and should enjoy the same rights a brand new baby does, I'm not anti abortion, just feel after a certain point it should be off the table barring other medical considerations."

"Now, if Republicans don't support increased parental leave, subsidized childcare, increased WIC and Medicaid funding and availability, greater access to programs for people with abusive partners, minimum wage rates — just off the top of my head — that shows you what they really think of those lives they fought so fiercely to save. If their mass-killing enabling gun degregulation laws weren't enough.

The Role v. Wade fight was devised and engineered years after the court decision as a way to turn evangelical Christians into a unified voting block for Republicans.

Women just lost rights in exchange for increasing the Republican base. And there's nothing preventing Justice Alito's willfully myopic justification from being applied to contraception, gay marriage, interracial marriage, and whatever other culture war issues that so-called Conservatives dream up."

"To say it the short way, those anti-abortion activists give more rights to a foetus (not yet a child) inside of the body of a full-grown woman, that has in their eyes no right to choose. They impose their ideas not granting any option of consent to the women having to go through this not wanting to know the story behind this act. They impede on the human rights of those women. I wish they had at least the decency to try to understand the human aspect of it, seems hard though..."

"The pro-life people getting violent and murdering folks over personal beliefs in the 'freest country in the world'??? I'm shocked 🙄. No, the Christofascist POS's don't want ANYONE else daring to tell THEM what to do (since their twisted and wrong interpretation of the Bible is all that matters... and the second coming of Christ, Trump), but they'll demand you to do and live as they say or you'll end up getting assaulted or murdered. Man, woman, child... It doesn't matter. They WILL kill you AND in their God's name, which is the sickest part. They're like Wonder bread, plain mayo, suburban al-Qaeda. And like usual, the bad guys think they're the heroes in this story because their POV and main character syndrome is the one that matters. We all have a long road ahead of fighting off these unstable, selfish, greedy white Christians who are demanding our rights in one hand and lives in another. Because of them, guns will soon have more protection and rights than our daughters."

"In downtown Louisville, Kentucky there used to be, used to be, one of the only clinics in the state that would perform abortions. I would travel through downtown quite often going back and forth from work and I always knew when it was a clinic day. Not because of crazies out with signs but because both sides of the street in front of the clinic and across the street from the clinic would be bumper to bumper with Mercedes, BMWs and Cadillacs. No, they were not there for a procedure they were there to tell the women (who had to park blocks over) coming in for a procedure that they were worthless human beings. Then they would get in their Cadillacs and Mercedes and go out to lunch I suppose."
Lead poisoning is a bitch
"I never forget a pastor that went to see the protesters of his congregation they were doing in front of the clinic. He was standing and listening to the anti-abortion group approach to the people going to the clinic. After he heard them he went and talked to an older woman with a sign on the other side God loves you! She wasn’t aggressive or yelling things to the people driving into the clinic. He decided to wait and listen to her if anyone approached her. When he heard talking with such a loving, merciful , compassion and not condemning them and encouraged the couple to have faith the Lord will provide and you don’t have to this. Told them have a blessed day as they drove into the clinic and on the way out they stopped and thanked her for her advice and told her they changed their mind. Without yelling or condemning this lady kept doing it everyday and he kept going to listen.  He noticed and confirmed how she was able to get people to change their mind; except cases of rape, incest and high risk pregnancies and even some raped victims decided to give the child for abortion and she gave them the information where to contact. The people approached by the other side had no effect on the people driving into the clinic because of their rhetoric and attitude. They didn’t achieve what the Lord expected to happen. In his sermon at the service; he shared his experience outside the clinic and he ask the congregation. Are you showing love, compassion and mercy to these people when you go to those clinic? He say what are we doing to help this people, do we shelter or feed and support these women making a hard decision. Are we providing them support or have plans on how to help them because by condemning them we are pushing them away. Who wants to listen to you if you’re yelling at these people or women. He said the group started changing the way they were approaching them and not showing condemning signs. Think and pray how to do it if you’re in this mission evangelizing and spreading the gospel. Are you prepared for it ; because we’re sending or expressing the wrong message."

"Abortion was made for horror. In abortion, a mother is pitted against her child, the Madonna becomes Medea; and the child, usually a symbol of innocence, is experienced as an invading enemy. The distortions of the pregnant woman’s body are mirrored in the dismemberment of the fetus, and the helplessness and terror felt by many women facing unwanted pregnancy are mirrored in the unfeeling, unthinking total powerlessness of the embryo. The present is turned against the future, the doctor works to end a life, and the womb becomes a battleground. Regardless of your political or moral beliefs, there’s enough material there to give anyone nightmares.

Perhaps this is why abortion and unwanted or monstrous pregnancy have been explored countless times in horror movies, comics, and prose. And horror has treated these topics much less reductively than one might expect, approaching them primarily in emotional or visceral terms, and secondarily in moral terms, rather than primarily in political terms.

There are at least three obvious approaches creators could take to abortion-horror. The two I’ve run across most frequently are grotesquerie and grief: horror focusing on a monstrous baby, and horror focusing on a haunted post-abortive parent. I won’t attempt a complete survey of abortion-related imagery in horror; these are merely observations about how horror has managed to address our intense and conflicting fears around unwanted pregnancy and the unborn.

In The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror, David J. Skal argues that the 1960s and 1970s brought a wave of monstrous-baby movies, which he links to the terrible birth defects caused by Thalidomide and the growing movement for legalized abortion: Rosemary’s Baby , of course, and the body-horror flicks Eraserhead (David Lynch) and The Brood (David Cronenberg), plus a score of much lesser flicks like Humanoids from the Deep and It’s Alive and its sequels. He focuses on the hit movie Alien : “The poster art for Alien was deceptively simple and evocative: a cracked egg in a dark void, and the tag line In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream . Whether the space was internal or external was not made clear.”

These images reflect and perhaps strengthen the real revulsion many women experience at the thought of an unwanted pregnancy. It’s impossible to spend five minutes reading an online discussion of abortion without coming across a description of the unborn child as a “parasite” or a “tumor,” a “mass of cells,” an intruder, invader, alien¯almost a rapist.

As anyone who’s watched Rosemary’s Baby can see, the images of monstrous children recur in horror not because the filmmakers want to get us to donate to Planned Parenthood, but because they tap into preexisting fears in the audience.

But there is another large sub-genre of abortion horror. For reasons not entirely clear to me, I’ve run across this other kind of horror almost exclusively in short stories and independent comics.

These are stories about ghosts: The return of the child who was never allowed to be born. As with the monster-child films, not all of these works are very good. F. Paul Wilson’s 1989 novella Buckets , for example, is an uninspired rendition of an obvious central idea¯the children an abortionist killed returning to wreak their revenge. Tanith Lee’s short story The Abortionist’s Horse (A Nightmare) , reprinted in 2001’s Year’s Best Fantasy and Horror , features her characteristic over-ripe prose, redeemed by eerie imagery. Lee describes a pregnant woman alone in a country house who can’t stop hearing the clip-clop of a ghostly horse, which once carried a rural woman who performed illegal abortions. The inescapable hoof beats (a horrific echo of the heartbeat in her womb) both reflect and heighten her own fears about her pregnancy, leading up to a bloody, tragic ending.

For genuinely artistic representations of abortion-as-horror, however, the best examples are comics. Alan Moore ( Watchmen , V for Vendetta ) suffuses his return-of-repressed-conscience horror comic A Small Killing with imagery of abortion symbolically portrayed as the destruction of youthful innocence.

This symbolism seems to have escaped most readers¯despite its ubiquity in the comic¯perhaps because of the comic’s equally-blatant left-wing political slant. Once again, the force of the abortion imagery is best understood by reading emotionally and morally, not politically.

A similar collision of the politics of abortion and the emotional aftermath of the act occurs in Jaime Hernandez’s “Flies on the Ceiling: The True Story of Isabel in Mexico,” one of the darkest installments in the extraordinary comic series Love and Rockets . “Flies” may depict a woman’s psychological breakdown, or her encounters with the devil; or both. Her abortion is depicted by showing a scene of generic creepy protesters outside a clinic. The politics of this depiction might even be called anti-pro-life.

And yet the story of Isabel’s grief and partial healing follows a more complex emotional and symbolic logic. Her healing begins when she becomes the housekeeper for a lonely single father, becoming part of their family. Although her maternal idyll doesn’t last, it effectively shows that both her abortion and her divorce are experiences from which she’s still recovering. The comic doesn’t take a final stand on whether the satanic figures who stalk Isabel are projections of her own Catholic guilt and shame or if, by her actions, she has opened herself to visionary and terrifying experiences of the supernatural.

I had expected to find one other sub-genre of horror: the horror of repression, in which the focus is not on the monstrous baby or the haunted adult, but on the social pressures controlling women’s choices and circumstances. John Carpenter did a “Masters of Horror” installment called “Pro-Life,” in which a woman carrying a demonic fetus is prevented from aborting by her pro-life relatives; I leave it to the viewer to determine whether this explicitly politicized treatment of abortion-horror succeeds as art. An understandably obscure French movie, House of Voices , at first seems like it will be repression-horror, since it centers on a woman hiding her unwanted pregnancy in a 1950s orphanage, and is suffused with images of binding, covering, and cleansing. However, by its confusing, hallucinatory end, it’s embedded firmly in the second, “haunting” sub-genre.

Even David Skal, who often over-politicizes his reading of horror movies, acknowledges, “the demonization of fetal images does not lend itself to a simplistic ideological interpretation¯monster children are not exactly pro-life or pro-choice, but, like the sick joke, articulate unspoken aspects on both sides.” Abortion horror, whatever its creators’ political sympathies, explores the fears and griefs and blood so often ignored or repressed by both sides of the political battle."
I love this woman!
I wish this heroic brave woman so much love xx
"It pisses me off to see these self righteous people terrorize innocent women ! Especially since these same people don’t give a damn about the babies after they’re born, they vote for people who reduce assistance for poor people in regards to healthcare, financial aid and the pregnant women don’t get prenatal care for free but these terrorist protestors don’t care! EQUALITY NOW FOR WOMEN! OUR BODIES OUR CHOICES!# WE WONT BACK DOWN # WE WONT FO BACK!!!"

"There was no Jesus Christ and there’s no God. Just look at the people, who say otherwise."
"Ok, so you Americans have totally gotten this all wrong. It is really simple to get rid of abortion forever. Simply because every, EVERY abortion is ALWAYS and ONLY the fault of us MEN. So, if you American women want to feel safe, then fight for a rule where every ""accidental"" pregnancy is to be regulated, fined, and penalized by those who in fact are to blame, males! 
See, no woman in the world can be accidentally impregnated by herself. There needs to be a male sperm-hosing villain in the picture. and most reasons as to why you women get pregnant is either because the man impregnates you out of his egoistically acted upon the instinct of consuming the act all the way inside of you, or because men rapes. So, the MEN should have to answer to every time he ejaculates inside of a female without her consent. That is it. if the men have to go to jail or let's say, after one proven act of such ""accidental ejaculation"" he would need to be forced to undergo a vasectomy or even better, after three times of accidental ejaculation such a man was forced to undergo a medical castration, I can promise you that the American abortion problem would cease to exist besides criminally executed acts whether by rape or incestuous rape committed against any women. And those would be much easier to legalize since it would not be from a one-night stand gone wrong (seen from the female's perception.)

So to all you American women, there you have the way to go at this, get into the true source of this male egoistical issue,
and to you American men. now that the women have gotten a new angle to look at these things, be ready to show much more sympathy and restrain, the outcome will not be as rosy once your females starts to take action against your long-lived idiocies and old ways of doing things."
What's goes on in other people's bedrooms is none of their business! These anti-abortion protesters aren't paying these patients insurance or medical bills! They need to stay in their own lanes! Mind your own business!
I love her I’ve followed her for a while on TikTok ❤️
"Exodus 21:22-26 states, in no uncertain terms, that the life of the fetus is of lesser value than the life of the mother. In the scenario in Exodus, if 2 men are fighting and a pregnant woman is injured, such that she miscarries, the offender pays a fine. If, on the other hand, ""someone is injured"", then it's an eye for an eye. Clearly the fetus is a not ""someone"", according to Exodus."
I love her! Thank you Shelly and everyone who works in this clinic
Shelley is doing Gods work!! The personal decision that someone has to make to have an abortion is their own personal decision Shelley is walking them in and keeping them safe.

However, taking part in something to murder innocent babies i cant go along with. the problem with abortion movement is they've dehumanized a baby to the point where its a ""thing"" and not a human being. that's the only way they can justify what they are doing. but if they really think about it logically there is no way they can be for it. It has nothing to do with a religious belief its murder pure and simple there is no religious aspect about it."

"My first job out of college was working at a prosecutor's office.   The first week I was there, a little 12-year-old girl was brought in by her mother.   They were old-order Amish, the horse and buggy type.  The child was pregnant and she would not tell her mother who the father was and the mother wanted it investigated.   To make a long story short, after weeks of investigation, blood tests, etc., it was scientifically proven the baby's father was his grandfather.   The little girl was raped by her own father.   Of course, then the mother wanted the case dropped.   The baby was born; he was a little boy; he was born with complications of incest such as severe mental and physical disorders and disabilities.   Up until then, I had not believed in abortion.   When you see it in person, you have a different view."
Why are the vast majority of abortion protestors social misfits or just simply weird?
Abortion shouldn't even be an agrument
And American trying to tell Afghanistan and the taleban to respect women's rights crazy world we live in
Hail Satan!! Praise be the dark lord on this beautiful day of days. May he guide and support his people in ways that God refuses to. Satan is the answer!!!
"republicans HATE women and children
If republicans are going to FORCE WOMEN to have a child
Then republicans should pay for that child - from birth through college
VOTE DEMOCRATS"
Old white men telling women what to do with their bodies. What's new
I believe in free rights as a believer in god. As long as no one treats these young women with malace oe employees with disrespect. A life is a life. We pray for the mothers and babies who are killed. And will help if anyone asks for. But no one should attack anyone. Not in the good book. God bless everyone working in these places . Going to these places. May they see what happens to fetus as it defends itself runs away from the objects being used to kill it. A being has a fight or flight reaction to danger. Maybe when going in for  Consultation the parent should be informed and shown what actually happens before going with the final step. If a women is raped yes abort. If a pregancy occours from lack of a condom. No abortion. When a baby has less rights then a unborn puppy or animal. There is a loss of human kindness.
"In the beginning of the 3rd trimester, a fetus is just starting to develop its cerebral cortex. All the time prior, every movement, every action is done from reflexive behavior. Meaning, it cannot think, learn, do Any voluntary actions. Not even swallow at will. It is in a vegetative state because it's brain hasn't developed yet.
That guys message on his van, ""I'm 9 weeks old and started sucking my thumb"" that's reflexive, not voluntary. At 9 weeks a fetus' brain is making neuro connections to be able to do these reflexive actions. Like, sucking it's thumb, regulating it's heartbeat, blood pressure, swallow. These are not from voluntary thought. It's a survival reflexes development. 
Doesn't it make sense that a brain would first develop survival reflexes then the ability to think? Well, it does. Our thought process to do Anything voluntarily comes from our cerebral cortex. And that isn't even developing until late 2nd to early 3rd trimester."
Thank you Shelley!!!!!
Gross 🤢
Violence against women will sky rocket...because they are pregnant.....unlawful termination of a pregnancy.... the wackos don't need abortion clinics; they don't use them already; abuse works well enough thru a man made-up miscarriage to terminate a pregnancy ; and they get away with it
I commend her on not running the protesters over. So tempting. They have no right to mindf*** these girls and women coming in for a very difficult and painful decision/procedure. Nobody makes that choice lightly and I don't think that's gonna get the protesters in the pearly gates.
"Thanks to those who fight for women's rights. Positive vibes from New Hampshire, remember to be kind to each other and yourself during these trying times"
"Why these protesting people think they can force their beliefs on others and can't mind their own business, is beyond me. They are protesting against private citizens not government."
These religious types are completely out of their minds. Which is fine. But they want to make everybody else mad as well. That's what makes me want to puke.
Looks like we'll have another fat libs of tick tock to laugh at pretty soon.
"What you need to do is have good guys with guns to help escort these women in to get the help they need. I'm tired of these trumpsters and their Bible thumping snake handling ideas. It's time to put them in their place, and make them feel intense fear for once. Time for the tables to be turned on the trumpster Taliban. They may need to experience a real Red Wave themselves"
"They only seem to care about them BEFORE they r born. Most of these extremists r republicans. It's republicans that r constantly trying to reduce public programs or cancel them altogether. 
Where's the help DURING & AFTER? Will they pay the prenatal doctor visits? The $40,000 bill to give birth in a hospital? What about support for raising the child? Family support programs? Food, diapers, clothes, schooling, childcare, medical bills for the child?
They only care before they r born. Then again at 18 when they can sign up in the army to die for a political reason that's usually just to benefit rich capitalists that just want to control another country to make more money. 
Then IF they return & have medical needs or counseling, the support for veterans is yet again something the republicans r trying to defund or or even cancel. 
Before birth, service ""to their country"" is the ONLY time these people care. The rest of the time, the mothers r on their own. 
Support equal funding for public programs & military. Maybe then there won't be so many women feeling they have no other choice. 
Even then, her body, HER choice."
God bless these men for doing the Lord’s work. Here is a thought…. Take responsibility for your actions! Killing your baby won’t just POOF make your problems go away
"These folks crack me up. So worried about an unborn fetus yet won't do anything to help that mom or kid when it's born. Yet they scream their religion yet do again do nothing to help. Who cares if the constitution doesn't cover abortion, neither does your Bible. Love how they scream my body my choice and this is America I have a rights yet are fast to deny women theirs. All these pro lifers should spend a day in an abortion clinic cause they have no idea how hard that decision is. It's not where's using it as contraception."
She looks like she eats the babies once they are terminated.  What a disgusting excuse for a human. She is a Baby Killer
Similar nut jobs are out there screaming whenever I go for a pap smear it's ridiculous
What the hell is 'assault with mutual consent'? Lol
America is broken. Full of absolute freaks.
"""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" The first half protects the second half."
"Anti-abortion protesters don't realize they're poster children as to why some babies shouldn't grow up.

No, I do not care."
There’s nothing moral with the Bible. It’s not even debatable. It’s pure crap.
"The self righteous mindless anti-abortion protesters think murder is okay? How does this paradox fit their faith, Jung explains what happens to their feeble minds when they can't see the truth of existence."
"This woman is a hero, the forced birther protesters are a bunch of delusional perverts and need to be exposed."
Libs of tik tok >
"To all those states banning everything, DON'T FORGET TO BAN VASECTOMY!"
"This is why I'm an athiest this is why it shouldn't be a religous or a political agenda for abortion, this is a medical right for a woman to choose, it's hard enough carrying a child to term, what if the baby had ill effects or even the mother? would you think a 12-year-old is raped by a family member or a teach then is forced to have the child herself? think of the pain she'd go through telling it to stop?. It's like the anti-vaxxers who was against having a vaccination and/or a mask then it's ok to force a woman to have that baby, you know not all sex is consensual right?"
They’re against abortion. They prefer filicide. Babies must be born! We need more to stuff our churches and orphanages with a variety of choices of children to rape. Plus we need more fresh slaves. Finally we need the rest for target practice.
What’s crazy is you bomb an Abortion clinic killing those STILL unborn fetus you’re crying about how ironic
It's usually old white men who oppose abortion rights. Wonder why 🤔
"Mostly Bible thumping self proclaimed Christians. Twisted mess of human hypocrites. I believe in pro choice. Don't like it, don't care!"
These people are weirdo's!
It's better to be alive and poor and then to not exist how many great people rose from poverty.
Those anti-abortion demonstrators are some sick people ! I wouldn't  trust them with my kid !
Pro-life murderers 🙄way too much inbreeding
"Wow. What will those self righteous jerks do with their time now that Roe is overturned? Hopefully gather aid for unwed or poor mothers and children,  but I have a feeling they will find other powerless people to oppress like LGBTQ people."
"I had an abortion. It was the best decision for myself and my family. I’ve never regretted it a day in my life. I was able to finish college, meet my husband and start a family when we were ready both financially and mentally. I went on to have two beautiful children that I love dearly. My kids have never known poverty or instability because I was ready to start our family. They have a wonderful life because of the decisions I made. Only I know what’s best for my family. I will fight for this right for all women. We MUST have autonomy over our own bodies. It’s a basic human right that ensures we have a say in our future."
Throw away your stupid signs and save a REAL child from our foster care system. Advocating for a mindless blob of cells while actual kids are being abused.🤦🏽‍♂️
"Have I got this right - people were murdered by PRO-LIFERS? Well, that sounds absurdly  hypocritical."
The first guy looks like the goon that the Scooby-Doo doo mystery squad catches and takes the mask off ….”if it wasn’t for them meddling kids”
"i wonder how many boxes of pampers, cans of formula, pairs of shoes or groceries do any of the protesters buy for any of the mothers they help."
She's great and Dan needs to stay home to have his movements!
"I’m sick of these self righteous people who think they know what’s best for everyone else.  If you don’t like abortion, don’t have one.."
Mind your own business. Nobody forces you to abortion!! Would a man like to be forced castrated? Women's body women's choice.
0:11 ain’t that the pot calling the kettle black
"What's wrong with people trying to deter parents from killing their child??? I'm truly sad and confused that so many are fighting to kill children, the irony is if our parents aborted us we wouldn't be here"
USA=New Saudi Arabia
"""So they have the right to choose life"". Bs. They are forcing their religious beliefs on others. Scotus has taken away the right to choose.  It is being forced on women. May karma come back on Scotus, in full force."
"The anti-abortion thugs should focus all of their energy on getting kids, who are in foster care, adopted to families. What they are doing is pure harassment.  Nothing more, nothing less."
I think its time for people like her to use guns as a protection.
"Why are these men protesting when they'll never have to be pregnant, give birth or face having an abortion?!"
I think everyone has the right to their opinion.
We as a people now have a choice we are slowly gaining back our power for BOTH man and women. We must get out and vote more. Hopefully this will not get any worse #prochoice
such a brave amazing lady! all my love to her❤️
In my country it is illegal to protest outside of abortion clinics. I feel so badly for the women who go for medical treatment and get harassment and worse. The church has no business in healthcare.
"The realistic picture is that abortion was not enough for Liberals.  They kept pushing laws Laws more and more and more.  Many countries have abortion laws that ban after 12 weeks.  Liberals kept pushing and in some places it was up til due date that you can kill the child and yet it still was not enough.  So many people on the ropes about abortion jumped sides and LIBERALS did this to themselves.  Really a fat white chick with a black beanie and glasses is such a cliche'  Stop trying to hard sister...Make no mistake that these Liberals are THE SYSTEM and are what some refer to as THE MAN.  They are the ones with the top 1% backing them so make no mistake of them playing oppressed.  Planned Parenthood made billions of dollars aborting babies and selling their body parts at 100% profit.  As to my fellow black Americans, Stop letting Liberals from rich families and ivy league degrees control you.  These rich whites are using your skin to empower themselves while your skin tone blocks for them.  STOP WORKING FOR THE MAN"
"Next time we should  hand them a baby and ask them to adopt right there and  they will run away so fast, even a 80 year old man there who has arthritis will not stop running."
"I personally do not like the idea of abortion past 15 weeks, but its still a personal decision that is nobody's business except for the woman having one. If the u s govt were to put more money towards reproductive education in the schools and make birth control more accessible and affordable. These idiots that protest outside of these clinics do not have te patients best interests at heart , most of them have been brainwashed by their religious institutions and misogynists"
Maby they should go helo the homeless feed people a lot more good could be done than waisting time protesting. Adpot a  anorted foster kid rase them instead of harassing women. Help not harm..
"Thank you Shelley , you are a heroine to these women and you DO make a difference in their lives! Keep abortion safe and legal!!!!"
These Republican states are forcing women to have babies just for the state to make money off the babies. That's all it is. Think about it if that person didn't want to baby and was forced to have it and still doesn't want it who takes care of it the state and then their orphans to their 18
"ALL those people, both the protesters and the lady recording them, are extremists. BOTH, I say? Yes. Most people are not ""pro abortion"", meaning that we don't see it as a good, moral choice for  contraception. Most people would be fine if it got banned as a ""do over"" for people who decided to have sex, and ignore the MOUNTAINS of contraception methods out there. However, most people also believe that, in cases of incest, rape, or medical necessity, abortion should be a viable medical option. Again, I said MOST. There are plenty of extremists who would be fine with abortions up to the 6th month or later, for no reason at all, and others who would see rape victims bear their rapist's children against their will. If you live in a state run by extremists, LEAVE AS SOON AS YOU CAN. drain them of population and resources."
Love her energy.
BOYCOTT TIKTOK
Ban abortion all over!
The US Taliban. What a bunch of sickos.
Use Luke 6:30 against the protestors. It is Jesus talking to his apostles telling them how to behave when they are out in the world representing the faith. He tells them give to anyone that asks something from them and do not demand back anything someone takes from them. Get them to read the passage (they have a bible). And then start asking for their things. Usually they will refuse. But then they lose the illusion of the moral high ground as they turn their back on Jesus. It creates a delightful amount of cognitive dissonance for them.
This lady contributes to Death every day for money and dress in rainbow colors leading women to Murder they’re babies🤦‍♂️
To much violence in this world.I pray for peace.nothing ever constructive gets done by violence.

Mostly from drugs like heroin , cocaine , meth , and the ever so popular fentanyal !  Try getting back to being Americas news source , instead of pushing radical divide ! And for God sakes get off the Jan 6 circus !"
They dont care about life. They care about imposing their own opinion on everyone else.
Do these realize if women could easily care for a baby they wouldn't be here.
Where the hell do these worn out old fools get off yelling at young women. They need to be herded into an asylum.
Yet none of them can answer the question of what to do with a 12-year-old that’s been impregnated by her father. These people do not live in reality and they don’t have to deal with the child once it’s here.
Those people are lucky they have no drive by Shootings.
"but why is it only in America the issue is intense and the procedure is very prevalent so to speak??? Should not this overall thing would be rare case?? I am confused here...really...I am pro-choice I guess, but why is it such a frequent phenomenon like some flue or some common cold?? there is fundamental problem in education of reproductive health and focus on preventive/contraceptive is glaringly and evidently lacking!!"
"""Adding a bit of humor"" what is funny about cutting a baby into pieces to throw in the trash or sell for extra cash?"
"Dan, what are you going to do with yourself now that you've lost the one thing that gave your life meaning? Time to kick it?"
"This is an older video. These people are celebrating today I’m sure. But it’s funny how a lot of them are MEN. People who are ALWAYS TELLING WOMEN WHAT TO DO. Now their is no choice. No women who have ectopic pregnancies, or non viable pregnancies, who medically need an abortion, or it will KILL THE WOMAN are now not even an OPTION in 25 states. HOW DARE THE EXTREMIST SUPREME COURT TAKE AWAY RIGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE FIVE POLITICIAN GOP JUSTICES WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL, was stripped. Taken. Done. Doctors being jailed in America and women being second class citizens again in 2022 is sick. The GOP claims it’s to save lives and that’s why they did it. Then tell me why justice Thomas just stated that he is going to review same sex marriage. Same sex marriage isn’t killing people? So if it was about saving lives, they wouldn’t be coming for these other rights. The United States is no longer free. The GOP are taking away your rights to learn about critical race theory, they are banning conversations about lgbtq topics, they have no issues taking away first amendment rights and the rights of 150 million women, and for birth upon them, and scream about protecting these unborn babies, yet the moment you suggest sensible gun control measures, to save these babies being born from being murdered in their classrooms, your infringing on THEIR rights. Funny how that works. Guns have more rights in America than women do. The gop wants to protect lives? And children? But they VOTE AGAINST UNIVERSAL
CHILDCARE AND UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE? They vote AGAINST MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING yet they scream
That it’s not a gun problem it’s a mental health issue! THEN FUND IT. Stop voting against every bill written up by Dems just because you don’t wanna piss off daddy insurrectionist trump. We all know none of the house or senate GOP have a back bone. Their concern is losing their donations if they go against trump, and then losing their political careers which in turn they lose their power. 

Remember that when your wife, daughter, sister, etc comes to you and says, I was raped and I’m pregnant but the baby won’t survive and neither will I if I give birth because it’s an ectopic pregnancy, you better tell them goodbye. Because that’s the new reality if you live in a GOP ran state. Welcome to the 1700s folks. That’s the time frame of the book quoted by the Supreme Court as to why abortion should be over turned. They want to go back to the bare bones of the constitution where the word “she” isn’t in there one time. Where women were property of their husbands and couldn’t vote and when anyone of color or any minority could own property or didn’t have the same rights as “white men.” That’s what the Supreme Court thinks the way America should be. Don’t believe me? Read their opinion piece, and then look at America today and what they’ve done. They’ve pushed their PERSON AND RELIGIOUS beliefs on 350 million Americans, in a country founded on religious freedom. Funny how that doesn’t matter anymore to them but the constitution does. They pick and choose to make minorities suffer. The white men must prosper in the new America. And America I want no part in at all."
Is it allowed to have a tall ladder on public land without permission?
Maybe they should be on Capitol Hill fighting for expanded medical and paid family leave  and daycare
Do these protesters have anything better to do with their lives? Likely not.

Pro- lifers who murder doctors and commit violence?? Such lovely people.
Abortion= antiLife
The same SJW'S who claim men can get pregnant are now claiming that overturning Roe is an assault on women's rights. Were these SJW'S confused when they claim a man can get pregnant or are they confused now when they claim overturning Roe is an attack on women's rights? These people are uninformed stooges.
It's my right to kill my baby!!!😅😂🤣
They are a pack of religious nuts should on medication they been at abortion clinics for years it a disgrace that the supreme Court is allowed to stop abortions my body my choice
"These ""Christians"" are incredibly cruel. A slogan I'm going to begin using ""mind your own business"", which is what conservatives have been howling for decades."
"How tf can American law makers make decisions on the human body/health without studying above high school biology?? Makes no sense. If you even took a course above high school bio or listened to medical professionals, they will understand how important abortion is to the safety of wowan. Absolute fools."
Hope Dan understands the lord has killed babies

"The anti abortionists withheld their names for the press and the cameras today.  They can act like mentally ill narcissists, and damage other people with their words, but, they wont share their names for the world to see."
"Dan the man should mind his own business. Can he get pregnant? No, So he should move on and enjoy his life doesn't look like it's going to be very long.."
The US has become a Country of Dumb Ass Misguided
Antiabortion movement is nothing but the disguise to take woman’s right away. Muslims mainly take woman’s right away or women are considered not having equal rights as men.
CNN...full of Godless lefties.
"Choice comes BEFORE you get pregnant. USE BIRTHCONTROL! Abortion is NOT birth control!!
    All the pro-choice screamers need to shut up and practice thinking instead."
These people are selfish deep down. They want God to praise them when they die Lol
"Guess those protesters believe that when a body dies the soul dies with it. They must be terrified themselves at the thought of us along with our bodies simply vanishing forever.
They claim to be there in God's name too. Shame on them. And why aren't they offering to adopt and raise these fetuses themselves. They want to force pregnancy but won't take the baby! What's up with that?!
I say they start working on taking care of their own issues and quit putting their stupid beliefs on everyone around them! 
Shameful"

Imagine being upset that you can’t murder a little baby growing in a mothers womb. What a sick sick thing.
"Pro-choice americans should push for legislation that requires states to identify thru dna or whatever who the father is asap and pro-rate support for the child from the date of conception thru age of 18. If the father cant pay, the state will. Now everybody has skin in the game."
"I'm sick of ""BULL~DAGGERS""!!"

Abortion is one of those things where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

How brave. Nothing but a pole smoker.
"anti-abortion protesters are self-righteous and full of themselves. they can shout at others and feel superior. If they really cared about children, they would be doing something about gun control. they would be feeding the homeless. they would follow Jesus example.

"These people are hypocrites….. if you want to do what’s right BAN teens from having sex without being married ! The Bible says no fornication so why isn’t Supreme Court banning sex and condoms? 
They are hypocrites yes we should not kill but we should not lie, fornicate, commit adultery, no stealing from others, no bad words, no violence, no pray to false images and idols , no blood eating yet blood transfusion are okay for them …really… when ur hospitalized tgey feed you through an IV in your arm so you’re eating right there same thing w blood transfusions you are eating blood, no corruption , no gossiping ect…..yet Supreme Court allows all that. That’s why I said hypocrites! If they’re gonna base on the Bible than do it 100% to tge fullest .  Conservatives tell their kids that that’s it’s okay to have sex just to be wise and use condoms ….? Really? Hypocrites. If you tell your kids to keep their snakes in their cage and girls to keep their doors closed then their wouldn’t have to br abortions! Hipócritas!! 
Just as Jesus said: To fake leaders you Hypocrites! You say you love God but with your actions you repute God."

"The good lord will give you mercy? If god is all omniscient, he’s the one that is killing these “babies” (even though most abortions are performed on a clump of cells) so you should probably ask why god is so violent."

"Right-to-life protesters murder doctors and nursers and patients.  Yeah, the pro life party think murder is acceptable as long as they do the killing."
"Jesus never mentioned abortion. They don't even interpret their own bible correctly. And then they harrass people based on their incorrect interpretation, at one of the already most difficult moments of their life."
when baby killers thing the pro lifers are evil the world is upside down.
That woman is a hero and has inspired me to volunteer to pro life individuals are the same people who try to force they beliefs and religion onto those who don't want or need it pro life is the same as being pro suicide to me before abortions women took there own lives drunk bleach or purposely fell on there stomachs how about we not go back to those dark times this is America not Gilead
"Always amazes me how men feel they have right to protest  , have never encountered a pregnant man,"
"The pursuit of the destruction of democracy in favor of autocracy in America has ALWAYS been part of the ""Conservative"" mindset. But because Conservatives polluted both Partys it was difficult to isolate. When most of them gathered under the GOP banner during the Goldwater-Nixon era the quest began in earnest as they realized their marginalization or extinction was inevitable because of their retrograde thinking & philosophies. The main reason they survived was because of their support (mainly to reap large campaign donations) of the ultra-wealthy & powerful while brainwashing their hoards.
From the 1960s onward the undermining, sabotaging, subversion, distortions, and distractions began to fracture the nation based on Republicans removing their dupes from reality, truth & logic. They've continued to erode Federal government competency at every turn via obstruction & violation of sworn oaths. 
""Conservatives"" can celebrate most recently that they got what they wanted via hypocrisy, stealing, cheating, lying, perjury - there was a complete abdication of ethics & morals in obtaining this (temporary) ""victory"". Minority rule is the road to fascism & should not be tolerated."

"Let's Review Abortions .
A woman makes the choice to either provide a new life with all the equalities of life which are limited in every country based on economy they may of may not have an living wage in.
Whole governments are against Abortions, yet not Carpet bombing or Nuking a neighbor In time of war . 
Does anyone besides me see the Irony in that ? 
So my personal Opinion it should be a women's choice .
Final Statement on this issue by me .
Mr Stormy C. Natero."
The so-called pro life religious tyranny killing people deserve to be sent to Guentanamo...
Maybe the anti-abortion protestors should be confronted with images of children who were victims of gun violence and asked why they support the murder of innocent babies.
"USA is now a theocracy, a country with religious laws controlled by religious people just like you Afghanistan a superstitious third world country and that’s the new norm for USA! No healthcare no childcare, hard to organize and now this. WTF people, you are moving in the opposite direction of every modern nation on the planet. being unique isn’t always such a good thing."
Ma'am please stay safe yourself.
What a woman with so much hate in their heart so much evil she's attacking an elderly gentleman who has the right to speak his mind what kind of monster attacks pull old people what kind of horrible person can have this kind of hard to attack and spread her poison to all people who are protesting their rights of freedom and liberty what kind of evil lies in the heart of a woman like this who's so aggressively in humanely is attacking the elderly
"Why special abortion clinics? Why not just go to a regular clinic? An abortion clinic, of course will bring out the ignorant. Wonder if those protesters are going to pay to raise these unwanted children, education, health care, food, and any other needs they may have? Or I suppose they think the government and the tax payers will take care of those unlucky children born.  Get the protesters names and drop those anti abortion kids off on there door step! People need to mind there own business!!"
Men really should not have a voice or a say in a woman’s decision regarding her body.
"So she thought that the anti-abortion protestors, who are pro-life…as in preserve life…would place a bomb at an abortion clinic.. you have to be kidding me 😂"
Humans have achieved so much for the past 2000 years but yet we still believe in religion...
People that think God is OK with abortion are Biblically illiterate.
Reupload...
"The Catholic Church will not baptize a ""baby"" until it's born even though it doesn't believe an unbaptized baby will go to heaven.  I know because I'm Catholic and I've had this conversation with priests in the past and they agree that it's ""difficult"". The most dangerous time in a person's life is in the womb, as miscarriage is so common, and yet, even though the church believes life begins at conception it's willing to play Russian Roulette with a baby's soul until it's born. The Catholic faith is a convenient scapegoat for these people and their agendas. Most Catholics believe in abortion these days.These corrupt justices are the outliers who got a plum lifetime high-paying job by doing the GOP dirty work."
Hate is so ugly!!!
She should've kicked that Ladder.
Guss CNN can't  show the criminals trying to break into to capital of Arizona why not show real news
Id tell the anti-choice people if you are willing to sign a contract that I get paid $5000 a month for 30 years to not get an abortion then I will not. Would love to hear all the excuses why not.
Leaving puppies and kittens in a box on the side of the road is worse than an abortion.
They should be called anti choice protesters
I'm concerned about these clinics they better have tight security because there's a lot of crazy people out there who are just looking for trouble.
That girl should prolly be fired tbh ain’t the whole point your trying to deescalate and keep patients safe?
Are these jokers in the Supreme Court..... laughing this morning 😠???
"Oh, Dr. Tiller got aborted and no one like that huh?!"
Imagine referring to Aliens and talking about UFOs like they do! These guys have mental defects  and need healthcare but I am sure they can’t and never could afford it so they live a life of illness. People that refer to fantasy figures in the sky that they will meet when dead scare me! 🤯
People spouting God's views are indoctrinated…..leave folks aline…white males seeking to preserve the product of their sperm…
"Allah, who the Christians worship, has no love for a theocracy formed in violent force 😵 Relent, oh you violent oppressors, and save thine soul. For you are the devil's aide and the friend of tyrants"

"No man, no state, no religion has the right to tell a woman what to think, what to say, what to do."
"Those protesters should be protesting in front of their state buildings for support for these women. They may not be wanting to have the abortion, but there is no viable option. There need to be better laws and education, to help make abortions less of a necessity."
Threatening Supreme Court Justices with violence is all on the pro abortion crowd. That's perfectly fine with them
"This woman is amazing, interestingly, they could care less for the child once born"
"Hey Dan, how many children have you adopted out of the terrible government system. Well Dan, how many children have you taken care of cause none of us will survive when we get past ten billion people on earth."
"It is insane!!
Religious people should just keep their religion to themselves, WE do not want to be in your CULT (rebranded as Religion).
We do not push our beliefs or lack of beliefs onto you so WHY do you think it is ok  to DICTATE what that we should follow your cult's religious teachings?"
"God will look on those who oppressed women as he did the Nazis, as lost lambs who chose evil in the face of compassion. They will fall below the sinners-by-nature (the homosexuals, the nephalim, and the heathens) and will likely be saved by God's grace alone."
Anti abortion protesters don’t cause trouble.
"You had me at ""she was fed...""."
A biblical concordance is beyond the alleged christians. Abortion is found less than 10 times in a Bible.
"Thank you Shelley and Dr. Cathart, may you the other escorts and those who come to the clinic be safe and protected."

"I love her. She can't keep silent. These self righteous, devout morons can't argue. They can only shout. They need to be shouted down."
Aborting a child is no light decision. NOBODY has the right to dictate such a personal decision. I don’t agree with crazy whack jobs harassing clinics and ppl for their decisions it’s absolutely insane. They all need to mind their own business. I’m so happy I’m not American living in such a messed up controlling racist country
What a woman does with her body is between her and God. You gotta be pretty self righteous to make it your business to tell someone you know best for them.
What the hell is this garbage this is not news this is clickbait
"Why do we have an exception for democrats when it comes to protests?  What happened to equal rights?  Dems think they are gonna run all over us, I have news for you, Republicans are powerful people who also have opinions.  Don't tread on us....you will only stir the whirlwinds!!!"
"What makes sense is that the federal government no longer dictates that states have to allow abortion, finally each state can decide the will of their people, period"
#vice
Ask these people how many kids they have adopted.
Seriously I would tell them to give money to these mom if they want the moms to keep fetus
It’s NONE of my business or these anti abortion folks business what a woman does with her body!!! These people are theocratic Nazis!
"3:55 CNN why don't you tell it as it is rather than half truths? BOTH sides have been known to have extremist tendencies not just the pro life camp. Pro choice have also gone as far as being violent and staging physical att@cks at Church premises too. It's only fair to be objective in your journalism, except you decide to exercise your choice to report otherwise but then, you don't get to give the world an impression that you are being fair, when in reality you seem to be the opposite. We see through the facade of both you and Fox News."
This is not about god so please stop putting god in this. In the bible not one time did god force anything on anyone. You always had a choice. This is about a person putting their beliefs on another person.
"If we plot morality on a graph it indicates imposition of will is immoral also moral progress and intuition suggest this , making abortion immoral but justified , pushing your child out of the way from an oncoming car is imposing on ther will making it immoral but again its justified to stop a more severe imposition of will likely being death , this is not my hypothesis but one iv heard changing my view of moral being wellbeing"
"Notice the left wants to convince you the anti abortion protesters are the crazy people. They're literaly saying ""don't kill babies."" How radical...."

"An image-bearer of God, you say? I seem to recall something in the Bible about graven images, what was that? 
I consider myself an agnostic with leanings towards atheism and a lot of my decisions and CHOICES come from having grown up in a Catholic church-going family that actually read the Bible and I would absolutely LOVE to debate this ignorant, hypocritical douche stain on the Bible because he obviously didn't even know the 10 commandments."
"They always shout ""We'll help you!"" But they never actually do. They look down on single mothers, talk behind their backs, and ignore them when they really need help. All they say is the ""The Lord will help you!"" The lord won't pay child support though"
She’s got guts.
Abortion is murder.
"Wonder how many of these anti-abortion protesters have ever shown up to protest a State-sponsored execution, written letters, or lobbied to abolish the institution of Death Row. Or are even troubled in the slightest to know that there exist people awaiting execution for whom exonerating evidence has not been deemed admissable, after-the-fact, in instances when they have been egregiously underserved by counsel, and in specific instances in which they have been framed or scapegoated. Not a single member of the five-strong Roe-breaking Supreme Court majority has ever ruled to give certioriari to a death row appeal. Amy Comey Bryant may be fervent in her faith, but the phrase she has heard thoisands upon thousands of times, ‘protecting life from concepton to natural death,’ means no more to her than to those cheering in the crowd at the Crucifixion."
"Im pro choice, Iv had an abortion myself but i would draw the line at 3rd trimester abortions. Unless it's a life or death situation for the mother, that's WAY too far along imo."
"Imagine if abortion was banned even of both have high probability of death?

Is it worth it for not to have it if one or both dead?

Dont say ""God wills it"" because why can't he made women lay eggs instead?"
She has to check for bombs from pro lifers…what
I am from Europe and have never seen in any country anyone protesting outside abortion clinics ever. Could it be the protesters are paid by the churches to behave in such a way? If not then social reform in the USA is the only way forward. The present situation has similarities to middle age Europe.
I bet not one of those people will commit to help these mom’s raise these babies for at least 18 years!

Religion kills more people every day than any clinic.
Ya that makes sense advocate life yet rake away lives?? These ppl are unhinged crazy mofos
"Let's not mince words, this woman is the modern version of Nightingale, any place with religious extremists like that who shoot a van or commit assault, and then get abetted by a judge, is no different than a warzone or a lawless zone. This woman is a hero."
So sick of these old white men and their stepford wives. May they have others work against their rights. Awful douches
America is a christo fascist state
"If society as a whole truly understood the supreme science of transmigration of the eternal soul, our troubles surrounding this issue would end. Supreme knowledge is the cure for ignorance."
All these pro life people should be REQUIRED to sign up to be a prospective adopter. Then they could REALLY HELP THE CHILDREN!!!!
I hope his uterus doesn't explode
The protester says we will help you. What does that mean? Prayer? How about financial support until the child is 18? That might work. Pretty easy to say we can help but without specifics it’s hollow.
She is impeding their first amendment rights.
Kmft  abortion kills
Good on anyone who doesn't support murder of innocent life 👍
It is a shame the church has weaponized their mentally ill members to push their evil onto others.
"Praise God for this man who has the guts to spend his time on the front lines of hell, turning these people away from murdering God's innocent creation that are made in his image."
"I remember how it felt when they were yelling at me when I went for my abortion. It made a horrible time worse for me.  However my escorts, were so amazing that I felt safe love and supported when I entered the clinic. I got my abortion and went home knowing that there were good people in the world and it wasn’t the anti-abortion people.  Those people will be judged by their maker and I do not think it will be good for them.  Shelly and the pro-choice people will be just fine and get their angel wings faster."

"Sooo...who's gonna take care of the unwanted babies... I'm pro choice... I mind my business but to the anti abortionists, pro lifers you guys are forgetting the life part... life expectancy is pretty high and you're a mom forever..."
A bomb? They are pro life. How is this logical.
All these protesters but not one will help with adoption. They don’t want ppl to tell them to wear a mask but they want to dictate a woman’s right.
They need to mind their own business!  Stop worrying about what everyone else is doing & worry about yourself.  The guys retired & the best thing he does with his life is hound women?!
My bet is not one of those religious bigots don't have any adopted children...
"The time has come to remove tax exempt status from all churches, Federally.  If religious groups want to play politics, put them on defense fighting to remain financially viable."
The protestor said women should have the right to choose life. Women had that right already.
"wow, never seen anything like this in new york. you can just peacefully go get an abortion without any protesters."
Cowards who want to stop abortions but wont give up their names shouldnt be out protesting

"""Whatever help you need, we have!"" ""Choose life!"" 
Really?... Do you have guaranteed universal healthcare for the child up to becoming a teenager? No? Then you don't care about the child's life, you just want to feel better for acting all righteous. However, even if abortion was legal, there should be universal healthcare for all children. And mandatory maternity leave. And so much more... America is a 3rd world country when it comes to things like this!!!"
I truly don't understand why a person would wait until their 3rd trimester to have an abortion. I REALLY don't understand. 😪
i hope they are also going to support these kids financial and in every other way once they plop out
The Republican Party: Keeping women barefoot and pregnant since 1854.
"One guy says that the unborn children are being ""violated"" and ""having their lives taken away from them"".  Here's a guy who could be at a school mentoring, and he decides to stand around outside an abortion clinic and harrass women as they enter.  Does he ever stop to think how traumatic it is for the woman to even come to the decision to have an abortion?  My guess is probably not. He's so arrogant that he thinks the effect is more traumatic for him!"
The Republicans have now started adopting Taliban Laws.  Woman should have NO rights. Religion has killed how many for having the “wrong” or misguided beliefs?
Hard to believe that people are  still willing to hurt others or interfere with their personal lives because they think there is an imaginary all powerful being telling them to do it. Isn't this a symptom of schizophrenia? The old guy afraid to die thinking he didn't try to stop abortions sooner seems to have a hateful God that he's trying to brown nose. What stage of evolution do you call this? 21st Century Dark Age? Let's Make America Medieval Again?
"So much hypocrisy... 
Let me force you to bring forward a child you don't want.

Notice how it's all mostly men who are protesting against a women's right to choose what she does with her body.
"They yell ""You have a choice to give life"".  That means that women have a choice, right?"
These escorters deserve medals.
This is what mental illness looks like .. going out to protest what another person chooses to do with their body.
Your killing the most innocent and defenseless amongst us... Realize they *RIP APART*  the baby limb by limb..

"Jeremiah 1:5

 Before I set you apart I consecrated you"". ❤️🙏

Angry young people demanding the right to kill a child they carelessly created during a night of recklessness.
If they only knew the years of tears, pain & regrets a person goes through later in life when they realize the beautiful light of life they killed because they were too selfish to open their lives to another human being."
If we are a pro-life country why do we have so many wars?
"Well it's funny that everybody who advocates for abortion has already been born, they now regard good as  evil and view evil as good."

"I hope this apparent female isn't breeding.  So, that is a plus for abortion."
Killing unbornchildren is indefensible. Protesting abortion is the right thing to do.
I am so sick and tired of these fake 'christians'. Remember even with this ruling rich white women will still have access to safe abortions.

Why can't men just STFU 🤬.....if you don't have a uterus just stop
I think you should be allowed to abort a child up until the age of 25 👍
We'll just end up seeing more babies left in dumpsters and trash. Don't forget the women who will try to abort on their own.
Susan Collins is one of the most horrible politicians in the Senate because she pretends to be something she is not! Her votes will lead to horrible situations for many Americans!
My  mother in law came from a family of 11. Last one killed her mother. Read the book orphan train.
"Let us just acknowledge the reality in this debate.
Essentially, men have a deep seated hatred of women, and seek to constrain their autonomy and life choices.
The fewer women who align with the anti-abortion movement, have no sense of feminism and choose to accept the male construct of human relationships.
They collaborate with patriarchal ideology, in order to gain the approval of male ideology, and protection from its worst aspects.
Think the trustees, in outlying prisons, the collaborators with the Nazis in WW 2.
That is what they are.
Colonised women, who choose subjugation over principle and loyalty to the sisterhood of women.
I rarely quote Germaine Greer, because I feel she has become irrational in recent years, but, she warned us in the 1970s, that women are actually unaware how much men despise women, and seek to contain them.
She warned us.
Now it had come to pass."

"Unborn children makes as much sense as a married bachelor, a joyful depression or a wet drought."
"you anti abortion activist would have mire converts if you also fought for Healthcare for mothers and their children and fought for gun reform, so our children and family would not be killed"
"A young woman had a late term abortion in Cleveland. The abortionist didn't remove all the parts of the baby that he murdered, and the child's parts were left in the womb. She got infected, and later died from her infection. Don't let these people fool you, abortion is sick, and it stops a beating heart. The health department has shut down so many abortion clinics because they are so unclean. Abortion is murder, and most women regret having their child killed."
"I am 100% pro-choice all the way but I don't like the idea of third trimester abortions (unless it's unviable or unsafe for the mother). Unlike these people, I understand it's not my choice and not my business, especially as a man."
Pro choice is pro life! Second amendment is killing more than women having the right to choose
"Gotta love the self righteous telling the righteous there being self Righteous! Just then she says ""I don't think most people have a realistic picture of what happens outside of abortion clinics""
Perhaps thats partially true but they do know what happens inside of abortion clinics!  You gotta love the irony of a person who isn't dead speaking out for the ""Right"" to kill the innocent....
The Hypocrisy is mind numbing."
So sad. Stop making this choice so hard on the woman. Woman don't do this every day.  These people won't help these babys when they are born.
Fundamentalists going rampant in the u.s. - how far can you fall?
"......""?......""?"
These idiots ain't just against abortion. My mum works as a councilor who specialises in helping people who are LGBT. She's had to hire security escorts for her patients as nasty religious people have set up in front of her practise to yell homophobic slurs. It's so bad now she's had go create a banner saying please ignore the angry old people out front. Everyone needs to keep their opinions to themselves.
Thank you republicans for saving fetuses and killing children
She deserves so much more credit than she is getting! Thank you for helping our women
"both sides are nuts! I am sick of these people fighting each other. Killing a child is a terrible thing but at the same time there are cases that it is necessary for this procedure. However, women should be allowed to make this decision with their doctors, not by crazy people wearing black robes. There has to be a responsible way to reach an acceptable path forward. Single mother's need more assistance if they are poor because the same states that want to be the saviors of children have the worse policies to support poor families. And let's just say it, having abortions because people cannot be responsible is not a good way forward. Children's lives should be precious to all of us. Therefore, both sides are nuts and I hate them both!"
What is the difference between far right and isis? ........
The 2016 election was one of the most consequential in history.  James Comey announcing an investigation days before the election was a big deal.  You can thank Anthony Weiner for this being overturned.

This decision made me remember watching If These Walls could Talk with Demi Moore. Scary.

Why would someone jeopardise the patients by seeding bombs if they're trying to save the lives of unborn children?
"https://youtu.be/KRb3HDA2DyE Kendrick Lamar  - "" God Speed for woman's rights, They Judge YOU, They Judged Jesus Christ"""
I understand and do appreciate the people there peacefully outside giving their time to stand up for something they believe but doing it in a way that is not harming the patient coming in. It's nice to see prayers but at the same time people are going to do what they're going to do and they have their own reasons to live in a country where we should be able to make those choices ourselves

"If a pregnant woman is killed and the fetus or baby was viable at the time, the killer is charged with double murder.  Why is it that a pregnant woman can have a viable fetus or baby sucked out of them, limb by limb, at any trimester?  I understand that SOME pregnancies' should be terminated but those rare pregnancies such as from rape or incest should be terminated as soon as the ""mother"" discoverers that she is pregnant and is carrying an embryo.  Not months later when she changes her mind and is now carrying a child."
These women who work here are amazing!  💙💙💙
"Look how peacefully and non-disruptive those protestors are and then compare that with the climate change cultists and the BLM and Antifa crowd causing actual physical harm and property damage.
I know who I would prefer protesting in my neighbourhood."
So the pro-lifers are okay with killing people but they are against abortion?
They are pro life but they'll be the first ones to bomb an abortion clinic.
The protestors remind me of zombies!
"all these people who protest abortion seem to have no problem eating the meat of animals that are slaughtered young.  over 30 BILLION young animals are slaughtered for food every year.  God said "" thou shall not kill""- and that means ANYTHING- but they eat all the meat they want to eat.  hypocrites."
"Keep religion out of this.  Religion is what got us into this mess.  
If you look at this argument objectively, without your “god” goggles, you will see abortion should up to the woman. 
That is if you are for freedom and liberty."
I will not even acknowledge pro choice people or conversations until the atone for the hundreds and/or thousands of First Nation children killed at “Christian based boarding schools”.
"These religous nutjobs do look and behave just like religious nutjobs! Ignorant bliss among them. Love the wondeful way they are dealt with. Impossible not to laugh at them,though dangerous as they are. This shows how religion does a number on your sanity!!"
"They must really admire Schwarzenegger who was adamant to give birth to Junior.

When it is men's time to go through pregnancy, it is men's time to decide whether it should be legal."
'Nobody asked you'  nobody is asking these men and wacko 'christian' wannabes for their opinion.
"Dude, God loves you in spite of your works. You don’t have to do anything to earn or receive God’s love."
"I think everyone who protests against these women, need to sign up for adopting an unwanted baby, rather than being detached and judgmental against other humans. 

Their judgements against others where they don’t know anything about their situation, will actually be what is “judged” when they “meet their maker”."
I love you so very much. ♥️
These nutjobs need to stay out of other peoples business. The  women seeking services are already traumatized. Leave them alone.
"Polygamous Marriage MUST be made legal.
If you do not support this, 
YOU ARE A BIGOT AND DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION."
I wonder why these champions of human life don't hang around gun stores with posters of slaughtered school kids from mass shootings?
"People who were given the bless of life by their mothers, now they are against giving life to others innocents babies, because for them it represents a big business. Those are the supporters of  the modern Auschwitz holocaust of babies. 60 millions of innocents have been killed in this terrible holocaust..Killing have been defined as “choice” or “rights” to support that business. It happens when a society reaches a deeper bottom of sin and evilness.. And this society will be judged by God🥲.."
"These anti-abortion people are the American version of the Taliban.  Same thing.

Edit: 3rd trimester abortions are messed up though."

"Have you ever seen pictures or videos of an abortion and the results on the innocent child ???? They ripp off arms, legs, crush the little skull , and suck the rest of the body parts out of the uterus either to be sold or just discarded like trash..."
"I love the Libs of Tik Tok,funny as hell."
Why do liberals hate babies so much?
So funny how they can sit and be like my body my choice when it came to freaking masks what a bunch of morons these people are 🙄
Not a peep form these people when a school shooting happens
"Lol, leftist is tired of protestors, how ironic."
For all those against abortion I believe we sign you up for the adoption of the unwanted child. I bet you don't care after the birth how about putting your nose in your own business.
"When I lived in Portland Oregon there was one guy that rode a bike around town yelling, with as many signs hung on it as possible. He had lots to say. 
I didn’t care then and I don't care now. These people have forgotten that others points of view are EXACTLY as important as their own.  In a free country I dont have to be a christian. If you are, good for you. Stay TF away from me"
"To the woman with the Rosary , pray for God's forgiveness for being so mean !! People don't all believe what you do and they are not required to believe what you do !! YOU ARE NOT GOD !!! These protersters have killed people because of what they believe and that is wrong ! Not one anti abortion protester has been killed by a pro choice person !!!!!"
Is Joe going to pay to support the baby? STFU and go home.  Mind your business.
We need more of this reporting.
Hay men stop raping women and forcing your daughters into your incestuous beds and we won't need clinics like this.
"All those stupid women holding signs, saying they would aid and abbed in abortion are admitting to future murder. I say, if they want to go to an illegal Child Butcher, and risk their own lives committing this illegal act. MORE POWER TO THEM!!!"
This woman is a hero!
"Shelley ,You are a good person Dont get deterred.You DO CARE and we LOVE you for what you are doing ."
Abortion is murder for profit.
Anti-abortion protesters being posted on Tiktok is some of the least disturbing shit on that app.
"Church and state do not mix.  I respect everyone's beliefs, but noone has the right to push their beliefs on me or anyone else.  I do not believe in Christianity, which is my right, but I do not push my beliefs on anyone."
Two wrongs do not make it right
"""Life risking work"" says as she walks and encourage mothers to kill their offspring."
intelegant idias
These violent monsters are the vilest form of hypocrite. In one breath they claim to be vegan humanitarian humanists. In another they fight to violently and cruelly kill off the human race.
"What a brave and selfless woman.

America really is a melting pot of mental illness.
These people aren't just evil, they aren't just sick, they aren't just deranged... they're all rolled into one."
Have these people not got a job to go to or somewhere to be.
"As a former fetus, I'm highly qualified to comment on what rights they want."

"So NASTY PIGLOSI bringing her NBA experience to the stage. Would have been funny if the little girl high sticked the DRINKER OF THE HOUSE , or checked her into the boards .Maybe go MMA , and take out those old weak legs ."
"Jack summed this up best. ""I think of a man, and I take away reason and accountability.""- Jack N."
"""we'll help you. We'll pray for you."" For a second i thought she said ""we will help you pay for your bills."" But then i remembered, oh yeah, they just pray but take no action. Clowns!"
It's insane that you have abortion clinics instead of doing abortions in hospitals. The clinics become easy targets for the anti-abortion protesters and also makes it unsafe for both the pregnant woman and doctors who work there. If they were performed in hospitals the protesters wouldn't know who's going in there for an abortion.
In karnataka state day by day fear of gujarat type communal clashes law and order is totally collapsed democracy in danger peoples are feared.please to impose the President rule in the state and to protect the peoples in karnataka state

She is amazing.

"Abortion is a woman's choice in the majority of the world. America is a backward country.
Abortion is NOT mentioned in the Bible or the Koran so why do American Christians think it is?
The US constitution has been amended 27 times and is why each part are called amendments.
WE LIVE IN A GENERATION WHERE TEASING AND LAUGHING AT AMERICANS IS NORMAL."

"I don't believe in abortion, never have and never will, but it's not a man's place to tell a woman what she can and can't do with her own body!"
"Dems are bloodthirsty monsters, they aren't satisfied with the blood of the 65 million innocent babies that were slaughtered since 1973, and they’re demanding the slaughter to be reinstated!!"
Nothing says pro-life more than planting a bomb at one of these clinics.

"All these people want to make females have kids then the government abandoned them… if they care about children so much, they need to search for the ones kidnapped, sex trafficking, organs took & sold etc etc etc"
Some angels wear rainbow vest
"Think their god showed mercy to the firstborn sons of Egypt, or the fetuses he killed in the womb? How about the countless women he made barren? Genocide is okay? Just an FYI, their religion condones abortions, it was standard procedure before stoning the woman accused of adultery or getting pregnant out of wedlock. 12 year old Mary would have suffered the same fate if 90 year old Joseph hadn't claimed to have impregnated her. Yeah, paedophiles are okay by god too, like that ""take the virgin girls for sex slaves"" rule when murdering and pillaging villages. So is incest, like the time Lot got his daughters pregnant when they got him drunk and seduced him. Seriously Christians, read your bible, it's disgusting."
GOD BLESS The Conservative Supreme Court Justices for overturning The unconstitutional Roe v. Wade and saving unborn infants.
"They won't ""help"" any of these women seeking medical care. They'll maybe take her to church and try to extort money out of her while chanting bizarre, inscrutable scripture.  The only ""help"" they're willing to offer is the ""salvation"" of your ""soul"" using voodoo techniques, brainwashing and bullshit.  You're still stuck with a kid you can't support on your own.  They won't help with that."
"Face it, penises have more rights than vaginas! Why isn’t the SCOTUS castrating pedophiles and rapists?!"
"God this, God that, blah blah blah. What happened to NOT forcing your Religion or Beliefs on others? Nice bit of Hypocrisy."
I wonder if these same GOP will have the same faux rage to pray in front of the NRA or the federalist society headquarters.  Will these same protesters clutch their candles for the children lost due to guns and poverty
They are all men they will never have to make the decision
"Still nothing about the insurrection in Arizona Capitol this weekend??? I'll keep looking, because I know how important CNN feels about insurrections."
Do you perform the satanic ritual before or after the abortion?
Both sides are self righteous on abortion. SCOTUS made the right decision to allow each state to figure it out.
"No one, absolutely no one has the right to tell me what to do with my body. A trained, licensed professional can give me advice or there best possible advice for my situation but it is my body, my choice, period."

Now you know what the future with Trumpism will continue to be like !!    More mass shooting will happen if DOJ Garland doesnt arrest all top Trumpists.

No person is above the law!  Listen to former DOJ Eric Holder, you can and need to prosecute Trump.

since January 6 2021 not one single Republican lawmaker has been held accountable for their insurrection actions.  they will win re-election if not arrested and they will cause more chaos and mass shootings.  Put an end to the evil Trumpist Republicans and support the good Republicans and good democrats.

MAGA Trumpists are ramping up their war machine to lie about their insurrection!  Dont believe the lies!  
 .

We need to support a federal law mandating prison time for each lie told by an elected official.

More Very Disturbing Trends -

1 Law enforcement has NO OBLIGATION TO  HELP ANYONE...that is what their Union will fight for during investigations and trials.

2 Law enforcement cant be prosecuted for Not doing their jobs

3 Law enforcement can legally lie unless they are under oath at that moment

4 The District Attorney will side with the cops almost always

5 Law enforcement has qualified immunity, which makes it very difficult to prosecute them


Texas Shooting Coverup .....over 18 armed evil trumpist c o p s had over 11,000 live rounds of ammo and they waited.  and waited.....while people were being killed.  it took the border patrol to take out the shooter.... how sad is that?


nothing will happen to these evil trumpist people unless the locals keep up the pressure and the cops and politicians involved leave!
