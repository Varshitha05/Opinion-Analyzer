"What America should do is have a referendum vote to establish pro abortion and anti abortion the people vote for what they think is right, let the people of the United States of America üá∫üá∏ decide if they want abortion legalised or not legalised"
They will eventually regret it. Now democrats have permission to overturn years and years of settled law. And for sure they will eventually take the court back.
"It was only suppose to be a marriage decision to protect the wife, health. However , she planted in his mind , it was to protect their husbands union, or image  , that he was faithful. It been a matter of mankind controlling their impulses, desires, and organs, I'll agree. The south  example, in the case of protection of the wife temple not the husband reputation. # their been killing, the dark man seed with womankind. ‚ù§"
"It should be ban or 6 weeks and that for rape, and incest. # mothers life matters."
"The principal, is stand on your perception of life and what you belief in ,and it will turn out for the good or bad, but its saying, freedom is always controversial, but her right to war exist, cause tables can turn by truth at any moment in life , as we birth and die, and involved in our practices of medical and health. Like weed was illegal and had penalties, now it doesn't and their not being incarcerated for it. It either this or the world is a hypothetical or hypocrisy bowl of chaos. ‚ù§"
"It is incredible how the devil twistes the ""big"" minds of humans: a right to privacy ??? when it comes to decisioning on the other human's right to live? 
Of course the woman has conceived another human being, another person-every medical science will back up this-that is how the human rase reproducts-intrauterino. We are a really corrupted species to still be debating, in the 21st century, despite the pure common sense ! truth about the human life beginning, whether abortion should be or should not be illegal.
Illegal abortion is unsafe? Well don't do it !"
Excellent video very informative with the varying viewpoints.
Even RBG said Roe was terrible case law.  It created what was never there
"Drumpf drove the US off the rails when he packed the supreme court with evangelical wackjobs. if any republican candidate gets elected expect a national abortion ban. Abortion will go black market, back alley again"
It's so gratifying to watch the pro choice movement have win after win on this issue. I guess pro lifers didn't have a plan apart from overturning Roe. That's pretty clear
Should have been decided under equal protections
"The supreme court needs to go back and listen and review roe v wade. They were using coat hangers back in the days before roe v wade, this could happen again."
"We are human beings being human, I should say we are not human beings we are animals just like our pets in the food we eat. We are not supposed to kill and eat our Children as we are doing today. This is blue planet, animal planet where laws orders rules of engagements predator versus prey continuously in play.
Legalized Abortion is also legalized baby killing murder and what we kill we must eat so readily available abortion is also legalized cannibalism."

Killing of humans (including the unborn) needs to be banned - not just called by another name which makes it sound more harmless.
"If only The Federalist Society could read the 9th amendment and the arguments behind it.
It nullifies all arguments from The Federalist Society."
"Abortion has been going on since literally dirt. Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans were not opposed to it since too many children meant not enough food for everyone. Such is the case on our planet now. Increasing population is never discussed when talking about abortion but we have a fresh water problem, a food affordability problem, a housing problem and most southern states don't like social programs after children are born so there's little in the way of affordable childcare and medical care.  Don't you think that 'better laws and resources for fixing the issues' would have already been established by now? It's not about abortion; it's about control. Additionally, there are no regulations placed upon men in pregnancy. If they, conservatives, were serious about the right to life, there would be child support at conception; support for the pregnant woman and support for both her and the child after the child is born yet that is NOT the case and it's 2023. We don't need more people in the world. We need to move people around because we're running out of resources. Fresh water is finite, the world is heating up, and we can't take care of the kids we have. It's not rocket science. Aside from FACT the decision to abort a child should be between the woman and her doctor, we have entirely too many people on the planet. People in the south ARE going to migrate north. It's already happening. Farmers are moving crops to cooler states. Insurance companies are pulling out of Florida due to climate change. Conservatives want to pretend it's a moral issue when it's really a control issue. They want to force their morality upon everyone else but the reality is that it's a sustainability issue. We simply cannot afford to produce more people on this planet until a whole lot of people die off. Humans have wreaked havoc upon the Earth. Period."
Great information and fact
Abortion is murder. The Bible is clear. Today we have ceased to believe the Bible. The Bible is God‚Äôs Word and He never changes. We will stand before Him and give an account.
Its just amazing how they gloss over the fact that she lied about wanting an abortion because she was raped.
I'm pro choice too shame on the evil anti abortion movement shame on the rotten anti abortion pigs
"Restore Roe, Vote Blue until they do! üíô"
People have to remember we did not have the contraceptive technology back then. Things have changed. Time changes things.
"It is not controversial it is baby killing, harvesting, shoveling out the womb. In other words, killing ,  a baby, a human being, that you don‚Äôt think is a human being,  who  the hell are you? How the hell did you get here? HATCHED, now we are wondering why your mother didn‚Äôt kill you during her pregnancy, no because she hoped you‚Äôd be somebody. Is she disappointed?"
The fetus is not a person. Abortion is a god given right.
"I never thought that ""the right to life"" depends solely under the choice of women who never wanted responsibility. In the land of the free, the basic human right which is the human life isn't really free at all. There's no freedom in such an atrocious choice to not give the unborn human life the choice to live."
It‚Äôs murder
"6:24 ""The right to privacy as invented by the Supreme Court, is the absolute foundation for the modern jurisprudence on  abortion"""
"This question is solely based off of knowledge (not including life of the mother or rape/incest). If a pregnant mother decides to have an abortion, it is a ‚Äúclump of cells‚Äù; but if the mother is murdered it is a ‚Äúdouble homicide‚Äù. Is it a ‚Äúclump of cells‚Äù or ‚Äúa human‚Äù."
"15:48 ""the state having interest in potential life"" WTF, someone tell me any precedent or common law where the state has any legal authority over ""potential life"""
"This fails to recognize the right to privacy derived from the first amendment - freedom of religion. I can make private decisions based on my religion and you can make private decisions about yours.

If you're a jehovah's witness then you have the privacy rights necessary to practice your religion and refuse a blood transfusion.

That means CPS can't investigate you for child neglect, judges can't approve court orders to compell a transfusion, and legislators cannot make laws intruding on your private beliefs.

I realize opting out of a blood transfusion isnt a perfect comparison to opting into an abortion but hopefully my point is still clear."
The assholes literally cherry picked the constitution to justify the evil actions üòµ‚Äçüí´
"Christians want the fear of pregnancy to curve teenage sex, but the only safe sex will be teens having sex with their same gender. They seem to only want new babys from people who make poor choices and haven't learn self-control. All they accomplished was government and parents spending more money for out of state abortions for girl who can get help ending an unwanted pregnancy. Adopting kids is the fastest way to get new members for cults if they step up to help the overburdened system that removes children from mothers. All I see is more numbers of human suffering to stop the poor from being baby killers and higher suicide rates. The bible is proabortion and gives God the glory."
"You will never stop abortion.Women have been ridding themselves of unwanted pregnancies since time began. Nature gives her this option, it‚Äôs a survival instinct and protective of the young already needing her nurture."
"Looking back with hindsight & realising that the Right-Wing Christians in the US are even crazier than first thought. Isn't a excuse but the fact is America is being dismantled law by law, right by right, the US will take one of the biggest decisions in American history during November. If it goes the way of the Republicans I see no way back for Democracy. The Republicans will make sure Trump will be returned as President & from then on the people will never see another fairly elected President again."
Thank you so much for helping me understand the fundamental aspects of RvW.  Really great and informative.
"Question..
So why is a baby called a baby when you WANT to keep it, but called something else when you DON'T? Which one is it? Are you pregnant with a baby, or are you pregnant with a lump of tissue and cells in your womb? I'm thinking that people say this to appease their conscience, so not to feel so horribly guilty when it comes time to get an abortion. I mean seriously people, make up your mind all ready!"
Did I miss the part where the constitution says you can have an abortion?
The Pro Life Movement is about Punishing Women For Having Sex.
"The movie 2001 a space odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion. A space odyssey is a fetus in the womb. The Clint Eastwood dirty Harry movies was angry calm. It seems nasty but it's a good police officer. Angry calm is how a women chooses abortion. 

Everything in motion makes one error. Your supposed to park the errors where it doesn't matter or you play wack a mole with errors. It's intelligently designed that if you try killing God you will always make one error. A movie is in motion so you have to park the errors where it doesn't matter. 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind. That why HAL computer eye is colored red so it still has artistic integrity. 2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made. It only has one error to park. You can't do better than that."
Now it's gone
"Well-made and engaging video. But holy cow is it biased! It would be nice, for example, if they would discuss what Blackmun et al said with respect to the textual basis of the alleged right to privacy. It seems to this reader that there is *lots* of textual support for such a right, despite the fact that the word ""privacy"" doesn't appear in the text. Since they mention the ""penumbras and emanations,"" it would also be good if they spent a little time talking about what that means in the context of the Griswold opinion and how it matters for the Roe decision. At the end of the day, Federalists are welcome to their view. But this presentation pretends that there are no good reasons for the opposing view. And that just isn't the case."
"Omg we are such an awful country, we can't even speak two languages without complaining."
"Roe provided women the choice to have an abortion.  It did not force it upon anyone.  Women could still choose to have their babies if they so desired.  Now the choice is gone.  Now certain states are forcing women to give birth.  They have removed choice.  This is not freedom.

Those that call themselves 'pro-life' & do nothing for children after they are born are NOT pro-life, they are pro-birth.  They are forcing their beliefs onto others.  This is also not freedom.  Only narcissists feel entitled to force their views / beliefs / choices onto others."
"The West is doomed because its men allowed their ladies into governance.
It guarantees demise of any civilization.
No society could survive emancipation of its women."
Everybody acts like it's a right the government owes you. If you want to abort your baby do it but why does the government have to provide the services? Do it yourself if ya really want to
"HOLY BIBLE-- 18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 19 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. 20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. 21 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
"HOLY BIBLE-- 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."

"*Abortion will never be truly abolished as long as society continues to tolerate any form of artificial contraception and the contraceptive mentality in general. After all, abortion is the inevitable backup when those fail.*

"I want to understand something. Covid is a health AND safety issue, and PSA'S BY THE THOUSANDS to get a vaccine. 

How come, with all the contraceptive decices, we dont get any PSA's on sexual responsibility.

I guess its because it is not a communicable disease."
Now get that 2 amendment
So the federal government kicks the decision back to each individual state.  Can the people in each one of these individual states inform their congregational leaders of how they feel about it at a state level?  If the people are not happy about their leadership can they just vote them out?  Makes sense.
"I'm struggling with this video. First, of course, the Federalist Society isn't unbiased, and never has been, on this topic. It's still a fairly informative video, but FAR from unbiased. The video is heavily front-loaded with a LOT of anti-choice language and some lies (ie the legality of abortion pre-Roe). THEN I get to 6 minutes in - on the screen is a timeline. It SAYS (as had been spoken earlier by someone else) that Black and Harlan retired. But the voice over it says ""two justices had died shortly before..."" which is just not true. How did such an uninformed person come to merit a voice on such a complicated issue when they don't know a simple BASIC historical fact? Were people who are actually informed not available?

I don't hate the video, just find it misleading in several places. It's still a good guide for pro-choice and pro-human-rights activists to hear what the other side is saying - true or not - and who they're listening to. Can't defeat this stuff without knowing what they're spouting."
"Abortion was with the States, and unconstitutionally the  Justice's of SCOTUS  was manipulated and made a wrong decision that was extremely popular at the time. Bill Clinton's Claimed far and few Abortions to save a Mother's life and  Incest. That didn't take long to grow into Abortions on demand, and used as Birth Control, and today, Politicians must decide by States, as it should be. We should take our personal lives seriously, and protect ourselves when we can."
And now Roe v. Wade has been overturned! It‚Äôs hard to believe that it took nearly 50 YEARS to overturn this law that had no Constitutional basis at all.
What do six lawyers know about women‚Äòs reality? Is this anger about women?
About time the supreme court did something right! They sure as hell screwed up marriage!

Goodbye Roe. I won't miss you
Why the background music. Very annoying.
"The true  federalists wouldn't spit in the faces of this society. This is nothing more than a grift organization, infiltrating our Judiciary to put religious lunatics in place to steal the freedoms of women. This ban on abortion is not a victory for anybody. Except those who want to cause chaos in America. Those who want to see women  and young girls suffer and die. Those who want to see our cities flooded with unwanted children. Those who want to see are States divided between ideology. This is the worst thing that's ever happened and the federal of society made it so."
"It‚Äôs so stupid how a woman can get an abortion and it not being called murder but when a person stabs and kills a pregnant woman and her unborn child, that person is charged with DOUBLE homicide."
How on earth could a human being ever justify this law or mindset is absolutely crazy. The church was obviously fast asleep during that watch. This was blood sacrifices of the innocent to empower demons just like in the Old Testament.

The SCOTUS has decided what religion the US will follow.
The federalist society believes in originalism. They literally believe no one has a right to privacy or any other rights that arent explicitly mentioned in the constitution. Bunch of religious quacks.

"Protesters should educate themselves on how to prevent a pregnancy instead of killing defenseless unborn human beings, life begins in the womb and those lives matter and must be protected."
"Women have been using abortion care since the mists of prehistory, when women were the plant gatherers and observed what plants had what effects and invented medicine.  Women managing their fertility is a natural right that pre-exists the state.  Criminalizing abortion is the aberration, only a century of American history.  Abortion was legal in early America and Ben Franklin wrote a book on what every American should know and it included instructions for at-home abortion.  Legal abortion is deeply rooted in our history and traditions.  The Founders had legal abortion all around them and they did not seek fit to involve the government in people's private business.  Get a PDF of the document and search on keywords:  women, girls, pregnant, pregnancy, gestation, procreation, reproduction, uterus, vagina, baby, fetus, zygote, embryo...any word you please--it's not in there BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S BUSINESS.  Our privacy rights around reproduction are also rooted in Skinner and Griswold.  Y'all are just WRONG."

"I think there are repercussions for choosing the fate of someone's existence. If I got a woman pregnant, and she were to ask for my opinion, then I'd want her to have the baby because I am against death. I once got married to prevent a girl from getting an abortion. I think, in time,  everything comes back to us, and if someone chooses to destroy and/or alter a human's functional existence, then it will come back in a bad way. The future will bring them a dark curse that they will never escape. I'd never agree with anyone who asks me if she should get an abortion and/or if that child's physical attributes should be altered. The dark curse be on anyone who does. It's not to say that things can't be made right in the future. They can, but the ones who don't make them right will inherit the bite of hate and the bitterness of knowing that they'll be randomly attacked and tormented later in the future."

"If a raped woman is punished by law, how is it different from the Taliban? Maybe there are terrorists in the federal government now lol.
Politically, It is also bad news for you guys. American's freedom is no more exist now... I think abortion law they overturned is definitely crazy. Women's body is women's body. It's funny like the law makes men need to be circumcised. Who could say like this?? From now on, I really disagree with America Constitution. It is human right. you guys are not a god. And now, America need this law 'Men who don't use condom goes to jail.' No Sex with No condom. No sex before you marry. If you don't want more baby, men or women should get surgery. You justice are wanting this?? People have their own rights!!!!!! I want to pledge but I don't know how to do. Please let me know."
I agree with you 100%.
"If you look at the value of an unborn child in regards to legal judiciary decisions, you will find the hypocrisy that is gravely needed to be argued. Example : if you were a pregnant woman who was murdered, and as a result, the unborn was also deceased, the charges would include a seperate fount for the murder of the unborn.
Why is an unborn baby only valued when it is convenient?  And devalued when it is inconvenient?? 
Abortion should be reserved for extreme cases where a woman/child, conceives  via rape, incest. And when the fetus will be born without a brain or similar severe abnormalities (not autism, etc). When birthing the baby can cause the death of the mother or when the mother is unable to safely carry the pregnancy  due to addiction or severe mental illness.
People should be responsible with sex. We have so many options."
Those are a joke of law professors coming from very and very much conservative law schools in the U.S. Just saying.
"I'm on the 'left', and I don't like the idea of babies being aborted. I don't see it as a black and white issue. I still think it should be legal because of the black market involvement in unlicensed doctors doing them under bans."

"Do fetuses have the right to life?

The argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong.
I will simply assume, instead of proving, that your murder is seriously wrong.
I will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder.
Finally, I will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issues to which this analysis of abortion ethics may lead.
The symmetries arising from the analysis of the main arguments on both sides of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult.
Consider the following standard argument against abortion: Fetuses are both human and alive. People have the right to life.
Therefore, fetuses have the right to life. Of course, women have the right to control their own body, but the right to life goes beyond a woman's right to control her own body.
Therefore, abortion is wrong.
The fetus' right to life does not include his right to use someone else's body to preserve his life.
However, an opponent of abortion may point out that a woman's right to use her body does not include her right to end someone else's life in order to do what she wants with her body.
In response, one might argue that a pregnant woman's right to control her body is not much, if it is wrong, to take any action that ends the life of the fetus within her.
However, an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus' right to life does not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses.
The consequence of all these symmetries seems to be a stalemate.
But if we have an attitude, then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of rights, a fetal right to life versus a woman's right to control her body.
One could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control one's own body in the case of abortion, because the loss of one's life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control one's own body, a respect for nine months.
Therefore, the right to life prevails over the right to control one's own body and abortion is wrong."
its funny how women can change their mind about having a baby with  out a problem. but a man can't change his mind about paying chidsupport with out problems
So she lied about being raped? Who did she blame tho? Black men would like to know!!üò°üò°
Your only choice lies right before the moment that meat stick fills your womb and bust baby gravy deep in your guts. Anything beyond this point is murder. If you don't want to have a baby don't do what it takes to make one.
The Burger SCOTUS was made up by Conservative justices
"Roe v Wade was wrongly decided from the start. While there is a fundamental right to privacy in the 14th amendment, it is impossible to frame a workable legal rule in deciding when a government can stop an abortion. And, of course, the government does have an interest in protecting life. The question is, how to do you balance the competing interests in this context when scientists don‚Äôt agree when viability begins? 

The unworkability of Roe is underscored by the fact the SCOTUS in Casey v Planned Parenthood threw out the trimester framework in Roe. Why? Because it doesn‚Äôt work.

But here is the irony: in Dobbs, the SCOTUS was wrong in overruling Roe outright. The reliance prong of the five part test in deciding to overturn precedent is not met. The fact is, there is a strong public reliance interest on the case. But Justice Alito skirted around this in Dobbs by this noting that there is no ‚Äútraditional‚Äù reliance interest‚Äîthat is, there is ‚Äúno advance planning of great precision is most obviously a necessity.,‚Äù ‚Äî this standard, of course, is drawn from commercial cases which obviously doesn‚Äôt apply in abortion cases. Hence, why the Casey Court rejected it. Faced with this dilemma, Alito did the only thing he could do‚Äîi.e., he ran roughshod over the ‚Äúintangible‚Äù reliance standard adopted in Casey. In Casey, the Court found that there is an intangible reliance interest which precludes overturning Roe outright. The Casey Court described it as ‚Äúpeople [had] organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society . . . in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail‚Äù and that ‚Äú[t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.‚Äù 

In this sense, the Casey Court is right. It echoes the reality of everyday life in our society. Yet, Alito said the Court is ‚Äúill-equipped‚Äù to assess this ‚Äúintangible‚Äù form of reliance. Ridiculous. It‚Äôs as if Alito wants us to believe that he lives in a bubble. 

In short, the conservative block of the Court wanted a certain result, and bent themselves into a pretzel to get it. And in doing so, the Court destroyed itself. 

The Court is a Kangaroo court. It should be packed immediately with more seats and life time appointments should be abolished. Enough is enough."
People get in contact with your local politicians and let them know if they don't support abortions you will not support them in the next election there's more people on the side of abortion and there is against it.

Roe and Casey brought to us by a Marxist Court and made up out of whole cloth. Lawless SCOTUS. For shame!
With Roe vs Wade now being overturned we can all look forward to the right to contraception going next
"This sight is bios, the Federalist society is who paid to install the last 3 judges!  The ceos of the Federalist are the koch brothers!  They are 100% far right wing and everything oil! These guys have bought and paid for Republicans in our government!  The actual argument was about personal privacy!  Ruled that its constitutionally right for a woman to have the right to privacy with her doctor!  This new ruling took PERSONAL PRIVACY RIGHTS AWAY! This story is B.S."
Sad how I never heard of this case. I'll definitely be doing some research on this.
"Osg french car lead (manuel mu√±os @$ leg-Y-Ezzi yesterday as-s E.78.46!

ABORTION STILL EXISTS IN THE USA. The US Federal Government will return each individual State the Right to decide their own abortion laws for themselves. VOTE Accordingly
Why didn't they explore what Jane Roe said?
"13509 reported rapes in Texas last year.  We know 75% of rapes go unreported, that‚Äôs over 50000 total rapes in Texas in a year.  Now those women will be forced to carry & give birth to their rapist.  The repulsive feelings I have for the Republican/religious right is quite high."
"What an astonishing shame that in 1973 none of these lower court cases or Roe v. Wade was dealt with on the basis of the child‚Äôs right to life. All this muddied water over privacy, while millions of defenseless children are slaughtered in silent darkness. The same devils who argue in defense of a woman‚Äôs right to choose, or ‚Äúconstitutional privacy‚Äù would also argue in defense of infanticide, or any other evil act of might makes right. It comes down to the law protecting big strong people brutally torturing and murdering entirely defenseless people. God alone knows why he‚Äôs waited in patient long suffering all these years, but He will not tarry forever. The blood of the innocent cries out to Him."
"It once was a mothers responsibility to teach her daughter that it is her responsibility to keep her legs closed. Why? Not for any other reason than women are smarter than men. As a man raised in a large family, this was certainly obvious, girls are smarter than boys, everyone knows it. She taught her boys too, but it never got in our thick heads, we just pretty much wanted sex. But these days, it is a crime to burden a woman with something called responsibility? These days we celebrate women making very poor decisions like abortion and divorce. Women have lost the ability to choose a proper mate. in one generation; like cats, the mother has to teach her young how to hunt. Our women are no longer 'mousers'. You have let the government become your parents, and they think they need to control you."
"Shows you how close we still are to Hilter way of thinking, our own courts thinking the right to abortion is a fundamental right."
My legal argument is that. A woman has the right to keep her legs closed in a peaceful society and should be put in prison if she kills her unwanted child.
"It is like Dred Scott declaring black Americans  were not and could not ever be considered human enough to be granted rights of any kind. Viability, as time passed and advances in science progress, will happen earlier and earlier. However, what I find equally disturbing as the slave owner's willingness to go to war over the right to own a person, is the  modern day glib disregard for the life in the womb. I am all for abortion in cases of life of the mother and rape. But as a method of contraception especially after that heart starts beating and the body and limbs start to form? It is so American. We are a culture that pays no mind to the document that lists life before Liberty. We want our abortions and our guns matter how many lives are lost. We tolerate a classroom filled with 5 year olds being murdered in the name of our rights and having a fetus sucked out of a womb - piece by piece - all in thr name of Freedom of Choice. Sadly, if we made the correct choices in the first place we wouldn't be in this mess. If abortion is to be legal my vote is the heartbeat limitation."
"This isn't a constitutional right, it's a human right to protect life. Abortion is murder. Those who choose to have abortions and those who perform them are murderers. There's no difference in killing a baby and an adult."
NO TERMINATION OF A HEALTHY FOETUS AFTER THE FIRST 8 WEEKS OF PREGNANCY.   How‚Äôs that sound ?
"If you don‚Äôt want to get pregnant , DON‚ÄôT HAVE SEX !!"
"By the time the judgement came down Jane Roe has already had the baby she wanted to abort ?  ,  that‚Äôs  f***** up ."
"Ok , Jane Roe is the woman who wanted to have an abortion ,  who is Wade in all this ?"
"Perhaps I'm optimistic
But
What if the overturning of Roe v Wade can be used to make abortions from a priclvacy law to a public health law?"
"I think that the solution to unwanted pregnancies is not abortion. Abortion is killing life or killing viable life. Women are free to have sex with any man, but they cannot or shoukd not cause it to create life. That is natures responsibility cast on women. If women dont want to csuse life, they can take so many steps and even remove the womb. On the other hand men shoukd bear responsibility for parenting children, which can be ascertained by DNA. If a man is proven to father a child, he should summarily bear full responsibility for that child. If not can serve a 15 year sentense in jail."
"In a dark world, I pray to people being light, and a person that fight to kill a baby, certainly can't be light in no one way!"
"We have to fight everyday for the life, and the good conservative ways, no matter what they fucking scoundrels say about it!"
"Abortion is not healthcare, neither can be, is a assassination of a human life, and a assasssination can't be healthcare. Bunch of evildoers leftists!"
"I don't give a fuck what the Constitution says, a life is more import, save the babys!"
"The baby is the most beautiful and inocent creature that exists, I love babys, every good person love babys, baby are joy. Even hers motherfuckings ugly and disgusting women that defend abortion, one day, was a baby too, but they don't want to allow other babys come to the world, such an absurd."
"Don't matter a dime what they people say, abortion is muder, simple like that."
"As a foreigner it‚Äôs so weird to know that abortion was legalized based on right to privacy, instead of public health."
"I have a good rule, think about the consequences and act responsibly."
I‚Äôm 60 and I don‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôve ever heard how the ruling was made or how they based the ruling that was what I was looking for and I want our girls to hear it because I live I a house with 2 teen and their mother and they are shity and don‚Äôt even know why üëèüëèüëè üôèüèºüéöüá∫üá∏üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüá∫üá∏

Thank God this is over
This should be a state law why is the federal government telling us what to do
Republicans do not want to adequately fund the social programs that are going to be necessary for all of the unwanted children that will be born.

Dumb lefty judges make stuff up = roe v wade.
Thank Hillary Clinton and RBG for this. Trump does what he says he will do.
Good video.  I'd like to see one on Dobbs.
Roe being overturned is such a travesty. So much of this is going to create a horrible chain reaction.
Even victims of rape or incest can't have a abortion now in many states how is that ok to any sane person
The Taliban took over Afghanistan so I guess they can take over the Supreme Court!
"Putin and Trump, via the supreme court, are destroying America!"
Is it true that the Federalist Society is a conveyor belt for ‚Äúunqualified‚Äù judges? Judges who represent a religious cult and pussyfoot around the Constitution with thinly-veiled religious motives like the old ‚ÄúIntelligent Design is legitimate science‚Äù crap?
Great information & facts. Wish we can move forward to this.
How strange it is that this particular YouTube channel has no providence.  What is the name and address of the people that have crafted this want?
"Very interesting how this is the first video to pop up when I searched ‚Äúroe v wade history‚Äù‚Ä¶a very conservative filled, right-wing take on the issue, despite not having the most views compared to other videos. Be aware of the media they pay to push first in front of you ‚Ä¶"
The federalist society is a cabal of satanic worshipping men. Evil in the flesh.
"Uncle Sam‚Äôs greasy paws in control of every uterus in America

"They legalized murder! Genocidal murder! Government legalized abortion is a Communist policy! The former Communist USSR was the first country in the world to legalize abortion under Lenin! So it is a Communist policy, like the other methods of genocide that are typical of Communism and NAZI Socialism! Yes it is! They had to know about this, yet no one talks about this! No one connects the dots!"
"In no way shape or form a ""Right to Privacy"" and due process cannot override the ""Right to Life"" of innocent human life! Yet they over rode it anyway like good Communist!"
Unbelievable!
"Their are only 3 Jurisdictions, the law of the land, the law of the air, and the law of the water."
Republicans are pro-birth not pro-life.
Abortion was legal 1800-1873

"Democrats have used litigation to evade law for over 100 years. Dems were proslavery, against womens right to vote, against desegregation. Dems have never been on the right side of history. Abortion is no different. Using infanticide as birth control is a terrible evil choice. Murder most foul. ""but what about rape and incest or if the mothers life is endangered?"" Those are a very small percent of current abortions. Abortion is about evading self responsibility and allowing a sexually promiscuous life without consequence. Its a get out of jail free card for women who want to sleep around. end of story."
but its not the courts job to say if something is a human right. that is up to the constitution. dems know they can never get abortion in to the constitution in the legislature so they cheated with roe v wade
Fascinating.
"The issue decided in Dobbs is that not only abortion but anything not specifically assigned to the federal government in the Constitution and all other powers not forbidden to the states by the Constitution are reserved to each state and to the people. In other words, if it isn‚Äôt the federal governments responsibility as specifically detailed in the Constitution then jurisdiction of that issue is to be left to the sovereign states. Regardless, the job of setting policy is the job of the legislative branch, not the judicial branch. Given these two pillars of our system of government the Berger court of 1973 should never have even entertained taking the action they took. This court corrected the gross judicial overreach Roe v Wade is representative of."
Uncle Ruckus Clarence Thomas thinks he is white so he took a ancestry test and it came back that he is 102% African with a 2% margin of error.
"Our population needs baby's, china's got a billion people, India, billion people if we get in a war with them it wouldn't matter how many weapons you give our soldiers we are losing at close combat. Not to mention World bank's evaluate a country's ability to pay them back based on population size and growth. Lesbians are literally killing America. Roe was a bad person she gave away a child. Someone find her kid that she put up for adoption and see how they feel"
And it's gone.  ü•≥
"Last week, holding up signs to support a wife beater..
 this week, holding up signs demanding rights of their daughters."
"So Roe v Wade basically upheld a person's right to privacy. The right to have an abortion was not explicitly included in the 14th Amendment, but was interpreted by SCOTUS as such."
Life wins! ‚ù§Ô∏è
ABORTION IS ABOMINATION! REPENT! GOD'S WRATH IS COMING.
I have 5 kids and they are all doing well and I've had to sacrifice and so has my wife.  If you are not prepared then simply do not get into a situation that you have to bear kids...  If you believe in abortion and believe in a loving God then guess what...  God loves all of us including our unborn children...
"I am pro choice but I can't for the life of me understand why people are okay with justices legislating from the bench. This most recent ruling is exactly what happens when the courts stretch so far the meaning of federal laws.  Democrats should have spent all these decades after Roe fighting tooth and nail to codify abortion rights into the constitution. This is what we get for laziness/a complete lack of understanding of our legal system from the electorate. Now people think the supreme court is ""taking away a constitutional right"" rather than what it is actually doing: overturning a ruling that had little constitutional basis and historical precedent to begin with."
Roe v. Wade no more. We need to vote.

We won. We wooooooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnn!

"I'm curious; has anyone found a documentary on whether there are groups trying to get fetal/embryonic rights? As in, fetal/embyonic support, WIC, SNAP, or even legal aid if the potential father raped the mother? Wouldn't an embryo or a fetus have the right to defend itself against a rapist? And even paid FMLA while it was developing into a human baby?
Also, I can't imagine states with trigger laws would want to be shelling out more government aid to women having these babies. Too many people ridicule illegitimate children and the mothers ""popping out babies"" to stay on as much support as they can get. Wouldn't such states want to find the fathers, so the mothers could stay off of the government dole? And would such fathers also be eligible for WIC for their potential babies before they had developed into an embryo, and then a fetus?
This whole thing is pretty messy."
"Roe was a liar. Nothing ever happened to her. She admitted years later more than once she made the entire thing up. 

Nothing should ever be go into a bill based on a lie."
People should use protection and they won‚Äôt need abortion .
"with abortion now rule out, not gonna surprised if their women  would start any pregnancy prevention earlier and perhaps fertility rate going down later"
"My opinion to everyone who wants to overturn Roe V Wade then take 10% of your pay check or government welfare check and offer these unwanted babies universal Healthcare, offer universal childcare (because that shit is expensive), offer Family Leave so mommy and baby can bond, offer a solution to this formula shortage, better yet, supply the baby with formula, pampers and wipes up until 18 months of life."
Life wins
So its okay for America to go to war in Vietnam and Iraq without any proper reason. Murdering tens of thousands of innocent people.  But when one wants an abortion it is a criminal offense even if you have been raped. Having to bare a forced child is wrong morally and religiously. So overturning Roe. V Wade is the result of a leap forward to an autocratic society in which you cannot decide your own destiny. America is not a land of freedom or opportunity. It has become a nation of suppression and cynicism.
"DIY abortions:  Doctors recommend a combination of misoprostol and mifepristone for DIY abortion, but the World Health Organization says misoprostol alone can also be used to safely induce abortion, provided patients get follow-up care.   Misoprostol can be purchased online (sold to treat ulcers). Research it."
Intro song ?
I have a finger for you evil people. It's in the middle of my hand.
ya know... its crazy how they create laws off hypotheticals... this government is a what if government and not based on reality... no one wants to be held accountable for their actions and people always wants to insert their situations into others that have nothing to do with what the original reasons for the situation... stop moving the goal post... keep the scales balanced... get the government out of your homes and be adults... as far as rape victims and those with medical issues i understand their decision to want an abortion which is justifiable because uhhh it was beyond their choice... bit for the people who lack self control and just want others to save them from their actions and irresponsibilities are immature and should own up to their actions... you have xxx you let someone nut in you uhhh wtf you think is going to happen... üôÑ deal with it... yo cant control the laws of nature. you may think there's loopholes but there isnt. just a bunch of dead end paths and bottonless pits...
Rest in hell norma!
Abortion should be allowed as exception to victims of rape or sexual abuse. But in General it should be Prohibited.
this topic is heavy
And we are back here again. On the day abortion is now officially illegal in the U.S.
"It takes two people to produce a child, so why doesn't the man have a  say in the choice of abortion?"

Do not doubt me: Planned Parenthood is already on the phone to states like Texas and load up planes with public school girls to wisk them off to the nearest butchering state during school hours without their parents' consent but with the full cooperation of the schools.

"Let us not forget on this historic day, June 24, 2022, the man who got us over the finish line of this 50 year battle to take down Roe v. Wade.  That man is Donald John Trump.  Thank you, Mr. President, for listening to the people, and nominating SCOTUS justices who PRACTICE fidelity to the Constitution, not just talk about it."
"For 40 years, every opportunity I have had, I voted for pro-life candidates -- a true single-issue voter.  Every candidate was chosen to move us closer to reversing Roe.  I was mocked for voting for Donald Trump in 2016, and was told he would not be able to do anything to reverse this travesty of a SCOTUS ruling.  Today, my prayers, dreams, votes and pleadings have come to fruition -- Roe v. Wade is now, justly, history.  All of the arguments of ""settled law"", ""established precedent"", ""stare decisis"" and ""law of the land"" have all taken a back seat to actual fidelity to the Constitution of the United States of America.  The fight to protect unborn children will continue on in the state legislatures, where we will bring an even stronger voice to these voiceless victims.  We will work to strengthen adoption services, support mothers with unplanned pregnancies, providing hope and support for those who have neither.  The feeling I am having today is similar to the feeling I had on election night, November 8, 2016.  I had goosebumps then at the prospects and potential, and now to see that potential realized on June 24, 2022 after nearly 50 years of barbaric atrocities, is something I will never forget.  This course correction was needed, and will go down with other famed reversals such as Plessy and Dred Scott.  Soli Deo gloria."
"June 24, 2022 - Roe vs Wade overturned"
"This was good insight and why anyone on either side should be very wary about judges creating law from the bench. And today it's sold as women's rights issue, when in fact it was about privacy rights, and doctors wanting the responsibility removed to curtail law suits."
Thanks to the Supreme Court for finally revoking Roe vs Wade...Praise God! Maybe we will end the curse on America for killing all those innocent babies.
"The Federalist Society is a menace to democracy in general and the Republic in particular.

Abortion aint healthcare , 
Its HOMOCIDE !!!"
"Bismillah. Ms. Teresa S. C. Basically, you are saying that a female can have a right to kill her baby!  That's not her right!  That's infanticide! That's no different than what the Arabs did in the 6th century before Prophet Muhammad(pbuh) received revelation! Those pagan Arabs used to bury their daughters alive!   Also, you said that the 14th Amend. have a protection against prohibition of abortion...So, in other words, Ms. Collett, you are saying it's okay for blacks who are 3/5 human to get abortions!  So cruel and apathetic of you! Thank you and the pleasure was all mine."
"The democrats are unprincipled and unrelenting. At all times, they try to change the country by changing the culture, acting at the local/state level when they must, then at the federal/national level whenever they can. When fair elections are held and the American people overwhelmingly return Republicans to office, democrats have no qualms about pressuring their state governments to ignore and reject any federal legislation that the American people have requested be passed. They have no shame in using their states to harm the national economy and disrupt national supply lines, fragmenting and undermining the long-term survival of our country just to embarrass Republican presidents and Congresses. Then, when they're able to steal back the federal government, they immediately use it to hammer through their agenda, overpowering the will of Republican states and infringing on their rights to make their own laws. 

That's the ruthless enemy we're pitted against, one that hates us so much they'd rather see the country destroyed than concede one inch of it for the American people to rule themselves. One that hypocritically preaches federalism when they're on the defensive but then acts as a unitary state when they sneak back into Washington. Since the GOP doesn't believe in undermining the long-term survival of the US in the name of short-term political wins, they act at the local level and take back the country one county/one state at a time (as the Founding Fathers intended). But we're also left at the enormous disadvantage of playing on a field which is always tilted in favor of the democrats, who then use the federal government to hack and slash away at states' laws. 

However, even though our strategy of chipping away at our enemies by working at the local/state level may be very hard work and often agonizingly slow, it's the side that patiently and consistently chips away little by little that always wins in the end. Each time the democrats use the federal government to sweep through their unpopular agenda, they may win today's battle but they set themselves up to ultimately lose the war."
"It's interesting, I didn't know about this. Can one be radically pro choice, but not agree with Roe v Wade? What happens when /if the top down decision disagrees with everything you believe next time  ? Who watches the watchmen ?"
"If your pro abortion are you anti vax?

My body My choice!"
Thank you for the closed captioning.
"Anyone ever think that the abortion issue and planned parenthood are the working agenda of White Supremacy?   Sanger was certainly an advocate of abortion as a way of controlling the black population.   In this respect abortion is another form of genocide.  Go ahead and kill your baby, your body your choice, but the Supremacists aren‚Äôt going to kill their babies."
"Great and fair doc on how the decision came about and why it never really settled the issue. I honestly think abortion would not be in danger of being outlawed had the prochoice movement, from the start, admitted most people think it's kind of icky the further along a pregnancy is. People really don't like abortion. It's depressing and feels just plain wrong to even people who want it to remain legal. But many will tolerate it. What ruined the right to choose was the extremists who relentlessly kept insisting no issues of personhood were at stake at all, up until birth. This insistence has repeatedly inspired prolifers to examine personhood, using ultrasounds and science to strengthen their argument year after year. Coupled with that is every smarmy anti-religious person who has been a part of the prochoice movement saying stuff like ""Keep Your Rosaries off My Ovaries"" and you had a perfect combination of poorly reasoned emotionalism and good ole fashioned bigotry that only made prolifers solidify their conviction the prochoice movement was nothing more than pure evil. The prochoice movement essentially defeated itself with its own excesses and rhetoric. It is undoubtedly one of the most poorly led political movements in U.S. history, given 40 percent of female voters oppose it. I have no doubt had saner people led it, we wouldn't even be having this discussion right now."
"Majority of Americans favor Roe v. Wade. That matters more than mental gymnastics. Abortion is legal in Mexico, Armenia - legal everywhere. ""Unborn children"" don't exist. That is a delusional. There is a nonviable pack of cells that has the potential to be a child down the line. To say it's an ""unborn child"" is simply disingenuous and illogical."
Its 2022. Men can get pregnant just like women.
"Bottom line; if you feel abortion is wrong, then don't have one. If you don't  want to give birth and see your offspring go through this hate-filled life, then end it before  its too late. If your knowing that someone is ending a pregnancy angers you, then mind your own business!"
"The only moral abortion is my abortion, by Joyce Arthur, Google it"
They used the woman and she never even got an abortion
"I'm a man and can't do a bong without breaking Federal law in ANY US state and thrice my privacy did not merit dried dog shit. The state came in with a warrant (did I mention three times) and said flowers were a public health hazard, Schedule One approved.   Privacy my ass.   A fleecing, nothing more."
"Unless I'm misunderstanding something, this video seemed very unbiased up until about 19:42 when the black lady said she believes the right to terminate a pregnancy should be federally protected ü§¶

Epic fail."
"So someone could argue that murder is a ""private matter"" and that the government cannot interfere? ü§®ü§¶"
"""Jane Roe"" was an evil, vile woman and her daughter that she wanted to abort (that is still alive today) hates her guts with a burning passion."
"When man elevates his views, personal interests and conveniences over God's law, separation and chaos ensue. A society that fails to recognize God's hand in creating life and presumes that it can decide to act against God's hand is doomed to fail. We can't ask for His blessing and at the same time refuse that blessing when inconvenient. The arrogance of man. Father, heal our land, turn our hearts, renew our vision."
Stop funding religious organizations with public monies. Once that happens you can't get them out of government and people's lives. We learned that from history.
Simple as that.

"Abortion is about ending the life by dismemberment of an innocent growing and developing and unique individual ‚Ä¶by another person‚Ä¶or persons‚Ä¶the mother‚Ä¶.and an abortionist‚Ä¶.‚Äú I formed you in your mother‚Äôs womb‚Äù‚Ä¶.society is paying a deep price‚Ä¶body and souls ‚Ä¶Dr. Nathanson went from endorsing, promoting and performing abortion‚Ä¶to opposing and fighting for the rights of the unborn‚Ä¶"
"One morning some stranger dumps a ton of bricks in front of your house. You come outside and say ""What is this?""
He says "" This is your new house""
You ""What? This is a pile of bricks!""
Him "" No its your new house and you're going to live in it""
You ""It's a pile of bricks and I don't want another house""
Him ""No, it's your new house""
You ""It's a pile of bricks. To turn that into a house you need cement, wood, wire, a frame, shingles, nails, screws and workers that takes months to build before it becomes anything like a house, and besides I DONT WANT OR NEED ANOTHER HOUSE! Get that stuff off my property""

"Roe v wade was about patient confidentiality,read the holding of the case, ""that protects a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion.""
 They want to overturn Roe v. Wade so that your vaccination status can be divulged by your Dr."
"*WHY ROE v WADE SHOULD HAVE FAILED:*
*Because there is now significantly more scientific evidence that the sole purpose of a the female organ known as the uterus is to house another human life AND human life unequivocally begins at conception AND finally since the U.S. Constitution has been repeatedly tested & been proven to protect ALL human life regardless what race it is, or whether or not it can sustain itself, or regardless how old it is, or what sex it is, etc, then it has become clear that no woman or doctor has the right to kill an innocent human regardless how she was conceived, unless that new human is directly threatening the life of the mother.*

*EVERYTHING is covered in that one statement above. If you take time to review it, it answers ALL possible counter arguments in favor of killing humans in the womb.*

*ILLUSTRATION: Just because the Captain of a ship discovers several weeks into the sea that someone has abandoned a baby onboard without her consent doesn't give her the right to kill the baby regardless how inconvenient or potentially threatening it may be to the lives of the crew to get to a port, birth. Until then the Captain has both a legal & moral responsibility to care for that tiny human.*"
"Trudeau's crimes are not Canada's only. The Canadian justice system can corrupt themselves and deny me my rights, but human rights laws are INTERNATIONAL law. I have Hitler courts to help with that level of hate and corruption."
You can not tell me what is good for me and my son. Over reach. We are not a text book. We are real people.
"A woman demanding her rights and the government and professionals are breaking the law to deny you your rights because of the power they have and their own reason.

Not my rights
Not my son's rights.

Nothing else will do."
"What else has been under raw judicial POWER?
A court order? Fake one? Fake warrant?"
"..they are messing...

Make it ""is"" like the slaves did."
"They left that hand written note so they can later claim she has lost it. It was part of the ""crazy black African savage woman"". In concert! That is the value of Gigi's doll against my son. 

I am about to educate you!

If you see alot of errors - they is messing with my spell check all to make me a crazy black woman. Because it is inconvenient for black women to be smart and capable - for the world order."
"Or ....""OUR""...."
It is very simple - STAY OUT OF OR BEDROOMS!
"So Trudeau's government, if your courts are secretly trying to change the law behind the scenes, so you can get away with your crimes against humanity and child abuse, I am coming for them too."
"You can not spy on me without cause and a warrant. If you do not he me, try me. I will get the courts to explain it to you."
I am more than determined to see this through. Try me!
"If you bully my son in anyway, it gets ugly. Let me remind you of that."
Nothing controversial about HUMAN RIGHTS. International Law.
More symbols on the way if Canada keeps playing ball with my son's life and mental health.

"This was a very helpful restating of the events. I was in high school during the time that the decision was announced. I remember the fellow in my gym class telling me about it and saying he can have all of the sexy ones and get all the girls pregnant he wants because they can just get abortions. I didn‚Äôt think much of it then.

The pro abortion position is suspicious. They always claim the worst case scenarios of rape and incest in the like."
missouri is setting up pregnancy checkpoints to prevent women from seeking medical attention out of state and Women who go to a doctor or OB/GYN for any pregnancy related issue will be put on a list.
This is the legacy of Donald Trump in office.  Installing religious fundamentalists masquerading as impartial judges of the law.
"We live in the world where it's okay for the doctor to change a female to a male or a male to a female. But it's supposedly not right for doctors to help during abortion. AmErIcA the most free, but most dictated nation ever. Can't even provide food for your table like the constitution list without paying a few hundred to be licensed for the year. ü§¢ wait till they try to call off the constitution cause it's listed unconstitutional to our new government to controll the masses. üòÇ"
üòÇ yep totally controversial of telling women they can't do as they please with their bodies. üôÑ people need to wake up. Like why is this even brought back up multiple times still?
"Funny how the right wants these women to give birth, but if they go on welfare they are called ""moochers"" ""takers"" 'welfare queens"" and ""parasites""."
"My great great great aunts were  abortionists for black women when we were being treated as cattle (still are, it's just changed). It's no one else's business. Folks wear a mask of kindness but they want to force a life of cruelty on others.  A woman knows her circumstances and whether she can take care of child before the next person does.  And that's her business,  much simpler if you mind yours"
"This all makes me very uneasy. dont know the courts should even be involved. Are tribal people ever concerned with abortions. our society has a desperate sickness that is permeating all things.
If anyone can actually debate me on the idea of abortion as a right then i will change my mind. It shouldnt be outlawed in all cases but there is certainly no RIGHT to abortion. How does science provide us with RIGHTS????"

"First overturn Roe.
Then overturn Scopes, which engendered the moral decline that facilitated not only Roe, but a pervasive moral decline in American culture."
"God loves you so  much that He sent His Holy Son Jesus from heaven to earth, to be born of a virgin, to grow up and die on a cross for our sins, and to be put into a tomb 3 days and rise from the dead the third day, and He (Jesus) went back up to heaven. We must receive Sinless Jesus sincerely to be God's child(John 1:12).After we get saved by grace through faith in Christ, if we truly love the Lord Jesus Christ, then we will obey Jesus(John 14:15).  Mark 1:15 ""And saying, the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: Repent ye, and believe the gospel."" Jesus said in John 14:15 ""If you love Me, keep My commandments. ""There's a real hell. It says in Revelation 21:8 ""But for the cowardly, & unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and immoral persons & sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone..."" Please sincerely receive Holy Jesus and put your true faith and trust in Him today and please repent.  Will you have a Real encounter with Holy Lord Jesus and stay in a Genuine relationship with Him daily please?"
If you don't own your own body - you own nothing. If abortion restrictions came to where I live I'd sterilise myself immediately - I refuse to be controlled especially by backwards sexist wilfully ignorant religious cult members (aka radical pro-lifers) people who force women and girls to stay pregnant and give birth especially after rape are animals barbaric animals.
"HAS ANYONE ACTUALLY RESEARCHED HOW ROE WAS INTERPRETED IN NON ABORTION CASES? For example FORCED MEDICATION which is foundation to FORCED VACCINATION. 
ROE was INTERPRETED to mean in FORCED MEDICATION CASES that the right to PRIVACY in MEDICAL DECISIONS where the procedure was recognized as legitimate in any or some cases SHOULD REST WITH THE ELECTION OF THE PERSON RECIEVING THE TREATMENT ABSENT A COMPELLING GOVERNMENT INTEREST IN WHICH  CASE SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS IS REQUIRED (substantive meaning actual evidence must be considered and merely a PROCEDURAL FORMALITY being followed. SCALIA said PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS is simply to say procedure twice while the SUBSTANCE of the process is what is actually in question. In the example of FORCED MEDICATION for a mental illness,  did the doctor merely confer among themselves to satisfy a procedure in hearing,  or was the patient given the opportunity to present evidence and have an attorney who could argue legal alternatives).
THE ROE COURT then asked for a definition of abortion which would exclude a legitimate medical procedure . THEN a definition of a fetus as a legal PERSON with rights and duties within the JURISDICTION of a court. The PERSON issue is what would give SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS BY EQUAL PROTECTION TO THE FETUS. (This could have been done under FETAL INHERITANCE RIGHTS as long established law, but wasn't,  WHY? Bad lawyers?).
The fetus as a PERSON then places the mother and child in CONTROVERSY and adversaries in JURISDICTION and the mother can have a right to ABORT which is of a lesser weight than the fetus right to life,liberty and property in inheritance by both CONSANGUINITY and legal posterity who inherits the benefits of citizens.  THE CASE NOW TURNS ON EQUITY in the application of law in a controversy between competing RIGHTS. O'CONNOR pointed to this when she asked if waiting 9 months infringed any right or duty.
THIS WHOLE THING IS A SHAM, ROE doesn't need to be ""overturned "" WHAT IS NEEDED IS THE RECOGNITION OF THE FETAL RIGHTS OF INHERITANCE THAT DEFINED CONCEPTION AS THE BEGINNING OF A LEGAL PERSON."
Abortion isn‚Äôt medicine.
Do not overturn Roe vs. Wade. We‚Äôll be going backwards. Women will be having abortions in back alleys in a non-medical safe environments. It‚Äôs a medical issue.
God is an ever receding pocket of scientific ignorance that gets smaller and smaller and smaller as time goes on.  NDT
"Even Religions cannot agree when ""life"" begins.  The irony is that you have tons of very conservative Republicans crying endlessly about how Govt is too big, to get rid of regulating corporations and industry... that we need FREEDUM!!! etc etc... but suddenly in the case of something that is FUNDAMENTALLY an intimate and private (yes PRIVATE) issue... suddenly they want to be all up in your business...... all for the ""unborn"" mind you.  Doesn't make a lick of sense!.  Especially when they scream and cry that they need to PROTECT LIFE.. Yet they don't want to regulate toxic chemicals in your food, or the environment where people often get sick and DIE.  They say ""Oh no, we want LESS regulations and oversight"" regarding dumping of toxic waste, oil spills, guns etc..   So this is NOT about protecting ANY kind of ""life""... and just about controlling the act of procreation , presumably to continue to create a nice market for ""adoptable"" babies so they can have a xtian nationalist army.       I am sorry, but the ""Right"" has zero legitimacy in this area.  OH and this is not merely restricting /banning abortion.. this is also about banninng birth control, which would prevent the pregnancy in the first place (and many women take birth control merely to help regulate menstruation and menstruation complications like heavy bleeding etc).    Quit trying to take some legal high ground.  The fact is the right is NOT consistant.   The abortion rights advocates have endlessly been portrayed as ""murderers"" and ""godless"" and all sorts of extreme distorted views.     Women do not merely become incubators ... and don't say ""well then women shouldn't have sex"".  SERIOUSLY? What about the guys in all of this? Where is their ROLE? Their RESPONSIBILITY????   No, it is always on the woman. It is never the guy that is the slut, it is always just the woman.  The State has no business regulating sex PERIOD... or a woman's body.. PERIOD!..."
Why is it so difficult to find an unbiased explanation that just looks at this from a standpoint of case law?
"Women need to stand the f*** up and fight back. 
We will not go back to being treated like property. 
We cannot let women die because of this bs and even more unwanted children suffer through life as a ward of the state."
"Completely disgusted that the federalists society and its propaganda showed up in my feed. May the leaders of this anti-democracy, racist, misogynistic, hateful organization die penniless and alone."
"I am an advocate for anything that reduces the awareness of being in this form, Life in this world is not, and can not, nor has it ever been perfect, and if it were, we would be as close to unaware as there could be, so why continue on the misery of existence, if we are truly meant to continue I believe we shall, regardless of these simple practices of science and... well when you break it down it's all science.. That's the best we got and the best we'll have if we choose to live."
The story NEEDS TO BE ABOUT THE CURRENT COURT ORDER < A BATTLE BETWEEN TEXAS and its own courts that said this is ILEGAL to turn WOMEN ANS ASSISTANTS into FELONS WITH MURDER CHARGES...no vote on this from the people of TEXAS...just ABBOTT being an ASSHOLE and pushing buttons...I was going to vote for Abbott but now I'm sitting on the friggin couch! let the border be a seeping sieve for all I care... at least those women would get abortions so they do not have CHILDREN WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKERS!
It's how they revel in aborting babies... If they could I think some of the activists would put the corpse on a sword and run around with it....
procreation is the mother of all evils. abortion is mercy. ALL pregnancies should be aborted as early as possible. end the cycle of death and suffering.

""Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. 7 If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, 8 and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. 9.

And it is that same party wailing and gnashing their teeth today."

"Why abortion is an issue in America, is it because America is overpopulated? The answer is no. If Roe v Wade was wrongly decided and it led to thousands of newborns being put to death, doesn't it need to be rectified? What message are American mothers teaching their children? That it is OK to have unsafe sex and then to report to abortion if it leads to a woman being pregnant. Who are we to decide how the Supreme Court judges should decide? The fact that they have lifetime tenure means that they will decide impartially without any fear or threat of being replaced. Let them do their job which is to allow the individual states to make their own laws on abortion - for or against it. What is the problem? Is this asking too much?"

"One important piece of information that this documentary left out is that _Roe V. Wade_ didn't just make elective abortions legal through the first trimester, as many Western European nations have done. It made elective abortions legal through *28-weeks* of pregnancy (after the _Casey_ decision in 1992, elective abortion is now a ""guaranteed national right"" until legal ""viability"", generally around 24-weeks). 

This decision has made the US one of only a handful of nations around the world to currently allow abortion-on-demand at or past 20-weeks. Scientifically and morally, there is little-to-no difference between such late-term abortions and infanticide.

While I still would have disagreed with the Democrat's efforts this week to codify elective abortions nationally, I would have at least RESPECTED them a little if they had limited their proposed law to _12-weeks,_ rather than *24-weeks.*"
"Looking back, my mother had two miscarriages before I was born. She was given a medicine by her doctor that allowed her to have children.  What they did not know, back in the 1950s, was that drug made some children sterile. Mom had four kids. My sister never had children, neither did I.  Am I thankful for the life my mother gave to me? Yes.  Life, for me, is good."

"""'The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to
advocate for. They never make demands of you; they
are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated,
addicted, or the chronically poor; they dont resent
your condescension or complain that you are not
politically correct; unlike widows, they don't ask you
to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don't need
money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don't
bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage
that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about
yourself without any work at creating or maintaining
relationships; and when they are born, you can forget
about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's
almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You
can love the unborn and advocate for them without
substantially challenging your own wealth, power,
or privilege, without re-imagining social structures,
apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They
are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to
claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who
breathe
Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor?

"The case against pro-life.  The Trump-Republican-Jesus Cult will never allow a life that is good.  You are literally fighting to bring children into an existence of abuse, poverty, suffering, disease, pain and hurt.  Did you know that the murder rate dropped 43% in the 1990s?  Do you realize how big of a statistical feat that is?  It is the direct result of the legalization of abortion.  Guess what happens when children are brought into home who actually are able to love and take care of them?  Pro-life is actual pro-hate...forcing abused women and children to give birth is actually the most hateful thing a society could ever do.  The one and only freedom we have as human beings is bodily autonomy.  Another reason that pro-life is a farce is that it is built upon a lie.  Christians use their religion to justify their pro-life postion...but when you look at the reality of miscarriages...500,000 each and every week you realize either the Christian God doesn't care about the abortion question or the more likely reason is that said God doesn't really exist.  I know that once you can believe a magic man will return and fly down from the clouds one day their are no delusions you are incapable of embracing.  So keep showing your hatred and hypocrisy as you refuse to do anything about the science of climate change...keep celebrating your bodily automony not to get vaccinated...keep supporting the Trump-Republican-Jesus Cult as they fight to kill American democracy.  Just remember your days are number...it is just a matter of time until the lie of Jesus and all religious superstitions are exposed.  Maybe this time you'll actually adopt the drug addicted babies you force into the world."

Contraception, gay marriage, interracial marriage, etc. are fundamentally different from abortion: if a woman wears a diaphragm, marries another woman, marries a man of a different race, etc. NOBODY DIES."

This channel loes and twist things. Like thr supreme court they are federalist  society cult members doing business for dark money donors. Beware
"The illegally leaked early draft opinion in the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization was happily released by the mainstream media to spread fear and disinformation. Incorrectly stating that this would ‚Äúmake Abortion illegal in the United States‚Äù. This has led to the vandalism of Churches and Pregnancy Resource Centers, the disruption of Church
Services and the attempted intimidation of Supreme Court Justices by ‚ÄúLiberal‚Äù Leftist Domestic Terrorist Organizations and supported and encouraged by the Biden Administration and the Democrat Party."
Excellent. Thank you!!!
Was a crime is still a crime. It's murder.
"Illogical US. Gov't could NOT outlaw drunkenness, and WILL NEVER prohibit procreative urges or women's NEED for abortion.  In fact, drunkeness at ""intertribal"" gatherings, part of human mating rituals (think college life),  got selected FOR to ensure genetic diversity and avoid incest's genetic pitfalls. Only blindly religious people, modeling their judgemental and punitive ""omnipootent"" imaginary friend, believe this delusion *IN SPITE of evidence throughout human history.*  Your beliefs and preferences cannot change a species that your ""big daddy of the universe"" god designed to rape as a reproductive behavior, like squid, ducks, dolphins, and orangutans. Strange company! We must admit that female ""choice"" or biological adaptations also promoted rape as a baby-making method. In humans, girls go ""Walkin' After Midnite"" ( Patsy Cline) with a lunar menstrual cycle shared only with oppossums (?!!!).  Barbie gets sold with Ken, but she *comes* with GI Joe.  Barbie WILL get an abortion, legal, or even if dangerous because outlawed by religious, delusional, prejudicial, punitive, under-educated people who also promote military service for the under 25, mentally immature youth of this increasingly misguided nation, thanks to local control of schools."
"I'm so sorry about these Nazi Republicans over turning Roe V Wade. But do not fret! I have a natural DIY remedy to take care of unwanted baby's. It only works if you catch the pregnancy early. Mix 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp ground nutmeg, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp garlic powder in a glass of cold water. Down the whole glass and problem solved."
"From the actual majority of Americans:

I wish every one of you in the Federalist Society an eternity in Hell for actively working to ruin our country.

Every one of you deserves to meet your final judgement as soon as possible.  I look forward to reading the obituaries."

"Here's a bit of education... (which republikkkans hate)... Go to ""NOW THIS with Alyssa Milano, Roe v Wade abortion history""... Oh my goodness I was shocked & armed with more self education. It's a must see... But then again the hypocrites will ignore this video because they hate FACTS... Facts Always Confuse Trump Supporters (AND THE LIKE)"
the right to an abortion doesn't exist within the Constitution. It is a question best left to the States where voters have the most (indirect) impact. I am neither for nor against abortion.  I'm against decisions being made in faraway Washington by 9 people in robes that are best left to the voters or their elected representatives.
"Man, this wasn‚Äôt biased at all, just a bunch of people pulling rights out of dust"
I came into this world with a father who showed up the day I was born and proclaimed I wasn't his. Raised by my mother until she gave up and disappeared before I reached double digits in age. Everybody argues over abortion and how far along you should be but nobody addresses orphans like myself who are left to rot in the foster system and the system doesn't do a damn thing to help those who grow up with the truth you were thrown away. I turned 18 and the state washed their hands of me. Everybody seems to pretend to care about unborn children but turn a blind eye to children who are born and abandoned. How is this possible?
"it WOULD have ""exactly the opposite effect"", when you get KOOP and the swiss cult to push agendas and fry american intellects with flat-out lying. Jesus disapproves. Time for another harrowing. 
19:06 those people don't need to have an abortion, goofy. that's a non-sequitur and bad intellectual syntax. and dissatisfaction didn't just 'arise' -- it was clearly and powerfully engineered by a wealthy elite engaged in deception. lying. lying propoganda. clearly available. never disputed prior by various conferences. deal with it or be seen as the whitewash you appear to be. I advocate life as well. Like Moses -- who ALLOWED THE CHOICE and enumerated the prospects. why do you want a pure soul that has no support birthed into a world of sin exactly, you religious maniacs?

"According to Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe) because she didn't want an abortion. Roe v Wade wasn't even a legitimate legal case.  McCorvey had her daughter.   
   How did this even reach the Supreme Court if it was not a legitimate case?  I've always wondered this."
"People do have the right to exercise their own reproduction rights. To procreate or to not. If we were to take this right away, it would be on the lines of saying one cant have sex, or ripping ovaries or uteruses out of children. Then one will not have reproduction rights over there bodies, ie it would be mandated or taken away. The mis-definition of it has been thrown around on the Senate floor as of late. We all have the right to reproduce, but you dont have the right to kill what you reproduce, because this infringes on an innocent helpless life, or every innocent person's God given or inalienable right. The right to life."
Shows only one side
Federalist Society is about destroying democracy. It is a terrorist group like the GOP. Garland belongs to it. Fire him
Old White Christian Men wrote the Constitution of the United States and siad it was a living document.  Abortion is a healthcare topic between A People and their Doctor.  Sex education and birth control reduce the need for abortions.  Religious Books either support or don't mention any opinion on abortion while destroying entire communities fighting for some God.
"Genesis 2:7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. Hmmmü§î seems to me according to the Book of Truth, Life begins AT FIRST BREATH,"
Republicans really are playing the long game. And Democrats are feckless.
"If there was no rape.(form of adultery)
If there was no fornication. (Sex before wedlock) Simply keeping the commandments solves this issue. But Noone wants to hear that."
A good deep dive.
What is controversial is this evil cult called Federalist Society. Go to hell.
Say nothing at all Amen. Thank You Jesus

"I know many people who are here today by means of In Vitro. I know that many people will know people who have chosen some means of reproductive help. It is common for individuals to seek out Artifical Reproductive Technology. Persons are choosing to become parents by a surrogate. In fact, adoption is becoming more difficult. Many options were not possible in 1973. Becoming pregnant or ending pregancy today, is an equal choice in the 21st Century. Either choice presents chanllenges on a personal level. In our society, individuals have rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The US does not give persons monetary bonuses for term pregnancies as Sweden does. And I hope that the US will never adopt the possibility for only totally healthy full term pregnancies. Every challenge of bringing forth a healthy pregnancy is made by the person. This all sounds like science fiction and yet, what was science fiction in the 20th Century is our future. Every challenge of nurturing and supporting the new child is personal responsibility. We are now approaching a new territory of making decisions which will effect our free choice and how we will live. Be very careful."
ProLife is a Religious force on the secular population to accept and obey their religious beliefs. Pure and simple.
If the roe versus Wade law is going to stay in place then they need to make it a law that a man who does not want to be a dad is not obligated to pay child support if he does not have the right to make a woman get an abortion then he should not be obligated to pay child support she wants to continue having the child without his support then she needs to raise the child without his support
"OK I understand your position but are all y‚Äôall going to provide their pampers, formula, healthcare cost or co-pays for the very poor?? And then the Republicans currently are crying about welfare when all these rich people get corporate welfare it‚Äôs a no-win situation with some of them. Complete hypocrisy for the corporate and wealthy welfare. Not to mention are y‚Äôall going to provide for them for Christmas is birthdays every any holidays?? Every year I buy those angel tags to get gifts for children they‚Äôre going to need five or six or perhaps 10 trees if this goes into affect. Some people are smart enough not to have them if they can‚Äôt afford them and they‚Äôre going to get persecuted for their choice because they don‚Äôt want to bring a child into the world dirt poor?? Or is it the elites idea of having slave labor so to speak disposable for years to come?? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è bad situation if you ask me."
"5 of the 9 justices lied to Congress to obtained a lifelong position.  The GOP have incited the evangelical nationalist to strengthen their war against women.  Remember Frederick Douglas‚Äôs words, 
I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ: I therefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering, partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason, but the most deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity. I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all libels. Never was there a clearer case of ‚Äústealing the livery of the court of heaven to, serve the devil in.‚Äù"
"Roe v Wade is finally banned. I‚Äôm not religious at all in any way, and I‚Äôm very glad to hear it‚Äôs gone. It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting for the most part, except for some very extreme and very rare cases, in my opinion."
"Religious people, my wife included, all think God would not be pro abortion....the problem with getting your information from a book.  We can actually see God in nature, if you take a look at his mode of operation, his intent is clear.  Controlling the species is number one, numero uno, on his bucket list.  God would see abortion in lock step with ""Controlling the Species,"" giving the best chance in life for all his creations."
"Stop Blaming Women for Abortions! 

More often than not the abortion is because of a man.
‚Ä¢ A man who forced himself
‚Ä¢ A man who left
‚Ä¢ A man who won't step up
‚Ä¢ A man who won't support
‚Ä¢ A man who won't participate 

When are we going to hold MEN responsible for abortion?"
"Since Republicans are so concerned about women getting abortions, or so they like to say then they should have no problems banning Vigra as this will lower the amount of pregnancies. However if Republicans are against banning Vigra so that there are less pregnancies that could possibly be aborted than Republicans really don't care about abortions, they only care about controlling women!"
The Texas law should include rape & incest cases; that's just common sense.
Anything can be twisted into whatever the most powerful people want.
i had to have a medical abortion after being sexually abuse on my sister and nice death anniversary the person i consider my friend abuse of me then after a month i found out i had a ectopic pregnancy so my life was at risk on top of the shame and pain i was going through i‚Äôm a medical provider and i never tho this ever happened to me cuz i have protected my self for so long and when i was changing my IUD this happened to me! so if abortion are not legal that mean i needed to die and leave my 15 year old behind without a mother so many emotions i‚Äôm not a criminal or evil this hurt my soul until this day
"Yawl,  tell a man what to do with his sperm and balls, see if it's NOt fascism ..... Working 24 hours a day for 9 months no break no pay is against the LAW. Spermhousing isn't free rent.... Women are being metaphorically continuously RAPED.... Being used and enslaved without pay...... Not sorry.... We need do mandatory Vasectomy for every male of reproductive age.... To be reversed, WHEN HE CAN PAY UP FRONT FOR CHILD AND COLLEGE. PERIODT.  No more B.S.... who is a Nazi bandwagoner? Look in the Mirror. We came to StEAL this land for religious hypocrisy? NO. Ask England why we left. YOU forgot."
"Yes, an act of raw judicial power, so is the death penalty, something that the majority of prolife people oddly support. The question remains, is abortion a private or a public matter? I believe it‚Äôs a private matter between a patient and a Dr. Therefore the ruling works. I have ‚Äòthe right‚Äô to use contraception, even though it‚Äôs not in the constitution. Can the state mandate me not to, or anyone else.? Can the state claim jurisdiction over a fertilized uterus? The answer is: no. If the state is declaring such jurisdiction, what responsibilities is the state assuming as well? Can the state be held to monetarily support the mother and child? Can the state force the father to be monetarily responsible?"
"A very level headed documentary, some of the imagery showing a woman well past the second trimester and talking about abortion is suspect. However, at the end of the day if you are against abortion don‚Äôt have one."
"The  US Constitution was written in the more primitive, less knowledgeable 18th century by clever people who expected it to be adapted and improved with time. It was written when women basically had no rights, only wealthy white men could vote and were African Americans  were worth 3/5ths of a white person. This is what they want a return to, An American version of Sharia  Law, after abortion, contraception and LGBTQ's rights will be axed as will civil rights, after all its not in the original Constitution. These right-wingers are extremists beyond belief."
"Spends most of the time supporting ""abortion as a right"" folks with a head nod at the very end towards the ""the constitution doesn't say anything about that"" folks.  It shouldn't be that hard for the democrats to get 10 moderate republican senators to agree to some sort of federal abortion law, likely with some time compromises around limits."
This extremist Supreme Court will be known in history as the Dred Scott 2 court. The arrogance of  Justice Alito's language in the draft  sounds more like a Fox troglodyte.
To think 50 years ago that single people could not use contraception is ridiculous and yet abortion was banned. Imagine the number of unwanted children and the disease that people would have had.
"Dr. Kivorkian was removed from practice for assisting those I‚Äôll whom wanted to die, but it‚Äôs ok to kill a baby with no voice. Certain situations should be considered early on, rape. Incest, & molestation. Overall the states have the right to decide. Educate and use protection. Be accountable."
I was supposed to be an abortion one month before my birth. My mother went in March to have me aborted and I was born in April.
"Talking about the law and or politicians stepping in people's bedroom. Even contraception had to be debated? And in 2022 the government is intruding in my private life and Zayn's.

We are going back and the fact all the institutions designed to stop us going backwards have been silenced. That is a very desperate state of affairs. Desperately scary and disappointing."
"Rowe never had an abortion. She put her child up for adoption. She became a fierce supporter for pro-life causes before she died. The Constitution which has 27 Amendments & states there‚Äôs NO Constitutional right for abortion. Like it or not the reason our founding father‚Äôs had this the way they did did was so states could have thing‚Äôs at their state & local levels. 27 amendments including freedom of speech, the second amendment,voting rights, unlawful search & search & seizure, etc we‚Äôre the most important rights in The Constitution. 

 It‚Äôs not up a court of public opinion.When the justices hear this or ANY case they don‚Äôt have to take public opinion into account. They have to legally take the Constitution into account. The Constitution & The Bill Of Right‚Äôs & The Federalist Paper‚Äôs are what‚Äôs are taken into account. The Federalist Paper‚Äôs have been used 300 plus times in legal proceeding‚Äôs in The Supreme Court. 

Our founding father‚Äôs we‚Äôre so worried about over reach because, remember people fled England because,of absolute monarchy.When our country was founded we didn‚Äôt want to go back to that ever. This is why abortion or anything else should be left up to the states.The Fed should have nothing to do with it.It‚Äôs a states right issue period."
Excellent vid. Thanks.
"I simply wonder how everyone will enjoy ever increased taxes when the states are sued for child support, medical expenses, attorney fees, etc, for those unfortunate cases with no better option.... (Potential life threatening situations, rape/molestation of the young) after forcing these women/girls to carry in unexpected scenarios.  For general purposes, I agree there should be more responsibility placed on the reckless and irresponsible. However, let's not stop here. Castrate the rapists, w/no matter of their mental state. Then force lifetime payments for forced and unwanted situations. Game never ending."
"The answer is so simple, perform a vasectomy on every pre-pubescent American boy.  When he's financially able to pay for the child's health care and education, then it can be reversed.  Not only will this reduce the medical costs of pregnancies gone wrong.  But the MGM (circumcision) cash cow will get bigger.  It's the American way, at least for the Christian Fascists."
Vasectomy is the future.
"Pro choice assumes that the baby doesn't want to be born.
Pro life assumes that it does. 
Neither side really has the capability to ask the child, nor do they want to have equal division of labor or responsibility in the raising of that child.  So both sides are wrong."
"The definition of freedom for this people is I do whatever I want. When freedom is like that everyone is in danger. This is their philosophy, freedom with no boundaries and no responsibilities. The lovers of death. A woman who aborts a child will have to live with it for ever and will always think about thay baby. Abortion is something they say it is great but poor women have to be alone through that process. Abortion is no different than giving birth but it is painful because instead of having a beautiful baby to love you have a lot of guilt and nightmares. I cry when I think of all those babies that will never get a chance to live."

"I graduated high school in 1973.
 In 1974 I wanted an abortion.  I was told it could only be done no later then 12 weeks. 
  I had understood that to be the law. 
   I am pro abortion but with time limit a fully formed fetus  and  Partial birth are murders.
In my opinion. 
   Consider the many times wimen gave birth at home. Killed the baby or dumped live baby in trash cans .
What was that called ? Was the woman arrested ?"
"Its interesting that in our modern times that destroying a human embryo does not effect the  conscience, but what about destroying a eagle embryo, then the conscience is greatly alarmed. Abortion is therefore defeated."
"If it was about  the heartbeats, so did the children that died in school shootings.   And I don‚Äôt see the right wing rushing to ban assault rifles , or even do something as basic as have back ground and mental health checks ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs not about the heartbeats.   As cleverly and emotionally arousing as they‚Äôve made this video for their blind sheep.   

If it was about babies,  they would make it easier for women to have babies.  If it was about babies, there would be free maternity care especially for low income, paid maternity leave, neonatal care, free medical for all kids till 18,  mental and health care and support for new moms and help with child     Don‚Äôt see the right wing rushing to do that either."
"The Pro-Life people lie like Trump does. A woman who decides to have a baby even though she can't afford it will NEVER be supported by those Pro-Life idiots.  It's the same with the war in Ukraine. You'll never find these people caring about the babies and children being killed by Russians in the war. Those right-wing liars only care about themselves and no one else. The lies will continue from these idiots, but GOD will judge them in a very harsh fashion.  Let abortion be a woman's choice over her own body. Let GOD be the judge. Not liars who really don't care about a woman."
Here to educate myself because I have no idea what‚Äôs going onü´†
"Any child forced to be born MUST be brought up with the same standard of living as the legislators and Justices who forced that child to be born. If the legislators and Justices who forced their birth  don't pay, they must convince antiabortion citizens to pay to protect society from rapists and men who can't provide that support. Make them pay for the society they demand."
"We kill animals, have death penalties, remove organs, transfer organs so how is this different from killing babies? If we as a people kill our own people and other living things"
Earthquake Kelly heard from Jesus himself in an after death experience that abortion must stop this is serious !  Jesus had plans for the children there was something they were suppose to do for the kingdom of God.

"I hate tRUMP, I hate the republicans, and I also hate abortions. I feel children in the womb deserve the right to live. If a woman has consensual sex it is her right and responsibility to use some form of birth control if she doesn't want children. If she does not and gets pregnant she should not have the right to kill an innocent child in the womb. Life starts at conception."

Well communicated and just the info I was looking for. Thanks!
if women think roe v. wade gave a woman a right to control her body they are mistaken. This was population control and the population they wanted to control was the poor and middle class. don't kid yourself. If we (men or women) had any rights to our bodies drugs would be legal.

"Roe was a massive overstep of the SCOTUS by taking an authority they did not have per the constitution and simply by passing all the states.  

That is why Roe is about to to be ""aborted"" so to speak. 

Crappy president by the court that could not stand when challenged by the merits of the constitution and a pure ""power grab"" in the 1970s with raw judicial force.

Even the abortion avocate RBG understood that when you build a castle on sand it will eventually fall.  

If you want abortion as a federal constitutional right there is only one thing that will do that.  

A constitutional ammendment. 

A law imposed by congress can be removed later by another congress. 

The Democrats will never solve the problem because if they did the would lose a means to stir their base. Think about it !"
It did NOT give you the inheritant right to murder unborn children!!!
"during the woman speaking around 7:45, this line of privacies she cites DO NOT PROTECT THE ACT OF MURDER! How shallowly argued by these lawyers' sole judiciary concerns in complete absence of humanity"
"The idea that Abortions are a right is an egregious fallacy. There never was, nor should there ever be such a constitutional allowance, let alone any real excuse for aborting an unborn child (possibly barring maternal death). Seeing so many people rail against their better judgements on this matter is truly disheartening"
This shouldn't even an issue . This should have always been a state issue. The federal government truly has no fight in this. Wow over 50 million have been slaughtered simply because federal government stepped in on state rights.
"A similar conversation with robotic lawyers talking about the Dred Scott Decision occurred years ago, then we had the 13 and 14th amendment.  Overturning Roe V wade will NOT be enough....Human Life Amendment is needed."

Protect the unborn
My money my choice
Roe v. Wade isn't legislation. There's nothing that says precedents can't be overturned and reversed. The issue of abortion should only be decided by the states. There's no constitutional basis for requiring abortion on a national level.
"With perfect timing, this issue has been unveiled to re-polarize America.   The Establishment prodded Democrats brought outlandish proposals to the table, and the Republican establishment handed the bait to the Base.   Smart Red States right now would freeze existing policy for 5 years while a real discourse takes place, and include squaring the rights of medical privacy regarding abortion with rights of medical privacy with the new mandatory experimental covid treatment.    We will be looking at mandatory abortions if this isn't dealt with now."
"This is simply an attack on civil  rights, taking us back 50 years in our struggle.  This is not the way forward.  Clearly.  I am very upset that our rights are under attack again.   We are absolutely positively unable to care for more ""unwanted"" children, when we are so supremely failing those kids our systems already.  Schools are in trouble, downright abusive practices are used, this needs to be improved.  Adoption houses are full, and can not handle the large addition, that would be the result in reversing Roe VS Wade.  Also, our foster system, and our court system,  children and youth is a joke, none of our social service systems are in good enough shape to handle this change in a healthy, positive nor meaningful way.  Who will provide for these lives we insist upon creating?  I guess The Supreme court just wants more pain and suffering for we the people.  Shall we proceed with creating many more criminals?  Shall we add to our overpopulation?  Shall we see the total collapse of our social support services?  Let's NOT make this mistake.  Think of the children, REALLY, think of the children.  The best and only way forward, is to drop this insane idea, and actually fix what is broken. This Roe VS Wade issue, however is NOT BROKEN."

But I heard that this road was lying that the woman in the case was lying or somebody was lying that's what I want to know who was lying they come out years later and admit it they was lying I think it was just maybe 5 years ago
Well as Americans we know about the first amendment freedom of speech in the second amendment the right to bear arms and the Fourth amendment so which is the abortion amendment written you know in the 1700s that a woman has the right to an abortion you know when did that happen you know who wrote that was it Benjamin Franklin or you know maybe Sam Adams maybe he was drunk on his own beer I don't know
The only way someone can have a constitutional right is if it was in the Constitution it's not in the Constitution
This was just TOO ... goddamned GOOD!  Holy crap! MAKE MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS PLEASE!!!!!
Now in 2022 we have to argue for the right for Abortion as republicans try to overturn this Supreme Court Decision. We will find out the results of this soon in June of 2022. 50 years.

I also find it very hypocritical of people supporting by saying ""my body my choice"" when these are the same people that were mandating everyone to get vaccinated while creating prejudice on the unvaccinated. Where was ""my body my choice"" then?"
"if you abort the mothers instead it solves multiple problems. hows that for a draft opinion? now, about that election fraud..."
"And so it's becoming a case of ""raw judicial power"" again."
Funny how everyone reading and writing comments are able to because their moms didn‚Äôt get an abortion. üò≥
3 of the last 4 justices are now caught lying...not just to the left.....but also the right. their public testimony were lies to all americans
You still have the same heart that began beating your mother's womb. Aren't you glad YOUR Mother didn't have an abortion with YOU? I am
Abortion is murder. What if the baby in the womb is a female what about her body her choice ? !!
We‚Äôre in total retrograde üò¢üò¢üò°ü§¨
"Finally the defenseless little angels in heaven receive partial justice.., unfortunately they will never meet their perpetrators including all those who support this  because they will not make it to heaven."
Murder is murder and nobody has the right to.murder anyone.  If they kill another then they should die too. Fair is fair.
"Imagine pretending to care about the life of a fucking fetus. Now we have women being forced to give birth to babies from their fucking rapists and abusers and even births that are a danger to the mother's life are being criminalized. Even worse, Roe v. Wade is being overturned. You ""pro-life"" lunatics really seem to care about the lives of women."
"And suddenly the left remembers what a woman is ????  Distraction from 2000 Mules , com.  Heck with a Funeral, We need Ashley Judd in DC fighting the Roe vs Wade Issue with her pink pussy Hat and her big mouth"

"Fucked up how the Republicans would be against abortion,  Yet, gut all those social programs that benefit children. Is that being ""Pro Life"", when you don't want to do anything to help families,  (particularly, Single Mothers), with programs such as child care assistance or, headstart ! And, what about the Child Healthcare programs  that you voted down and/or gutted during the last two Republican administrations ?!  You're Pro life, as long as you don't have to spend tax dollars in low income communities that provide social programs for children and families!"
Now I hear they reversed the choice
Elite groups.  Eugenics
You denied the children of due process
No more privacy with Biden.. vaccine cards.. hello
It's Genocide.. usually it's single and minorities that have to have an Abortion
Contraception is not killing a life
None of that applies when taking children's lives
What was at stake here is the life of an unborn child! The woman said...
It's not a right to kill a baby.. it's our right to birth control..which abortion isn't..
"Provide the court a copy of a bible. This record of truth, stands the test."
"God (biblical literature) allows people to procreate. Abortions go against the law of nature. The body we're born in, aren't ours. It's a vehicle. Nothing in the world is private. It's all public. 'WE THE PEOPLE'....get it??? ü§î legal system rep-resents Satan. Of course, he wants People to kill each other....hmm"
I love the hypocrisy of Pro Roe v Wade people. Majority of them believe in pure democracy but they would be absolutely terrified if Roe v Wade went up for election through democracy. Allow the people of the land to choose this law and then we can live with it
Why do we even use Roe v. Wade? Roe literally said she was lying about everything that happened to her. She said she was forced to lie about being raped and that she was anti-abortion.

"A mum who has the courage to strangulate his own child can strangulate anyone in this world, where is humanity? the decision of Roe Versus Wade  is  symbol of mud world"
"For any pro-lifers here, your questions of when does the baby count as a hypothetical life:

Why should a woman be forced to bear a child? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd ask you. Pregnancy can kill you, you can be allergic to the baby and painful rashes can eat your skin, you can have organ failure, sometimes you know the baby will die ahead of time and having a painful miscarriage after months of carrying is way more traumatic and extremely painful for a woman. So much happens to a woman‚Äôs body during pregnancy that could cause complications leading to her death or her babies deaths. The fact that the government would be forcing people to go through disease, pain, and death just because one loud group says they don‚Äôt like it, is appalling and outside the government‚Äôs scope of responsibility. 

Would we really prefer to spend more money on services and taxes tracking down the 25% of women in America who need or want to not carry a baby to full term? We‚Äôre going to spend money on that? Which also forces women to take things like Turpentine, a poison that could kill them or back alley procedures done in sketchy health conditions that could also kill them or damage their organs permanently? You would really rather force THAT reality on other people?

Why is the STATE forcing their citizens to birth babies? That‚Äôs ultimately what your question should be."
The right to privacy in the bedroom exists no question there the problem with this argumentation is that ceases to exist when someone else's life is terminated by your decision.
"The problem with this case was that abortion is not the decision whether or not to have a child, that's what you decide in the bedroom, it's about whether or not the child that is in the womb is allowed to be born or is terminated in an unnatural way called murder."
What? Right to privacy to kill an innocent baby? How about the fundamental right of that baby/person to life and to be protected by the state?  God's law is above human/civil law.
"I don't understand how these ""conservatives"" can reconcile forbidding abortion but claim moral superiority when single women ask for help to support the child. What happened to limited government???"
Abortion is killing not caring.May God forgive you all.
No human is ever afforded privacy when it comes to murder
Don't keep murdering babies.
"I had no Idea 62 million babies since 1973 have had severe deformities. Wow, and 95% of them are from the Black community? Then you are saying Margaret Sanger (planned parenthood) was correct in her belief that there should be a genocide for the community that is of a lesser class than the upper class? On another note- I‚Äôm sure there has NEVER been a Woman who has used Abortion as a form of Birth Control, Right????"
"Lately, the current debate about the vaccine mandate and the right not to be vaccinated are very similar in the right to private medical decisions debate for abortion. But the irony is that most liberals are okay with mandated gov't overreach into forced vaccinations for the ""greater good"".  And those that are using the my body, my choice  argument usually the mantra of pro choice advocates don't want that over reach and are mainly conservative, constitutional believers.  But using the Liberal argument for the ""greater good"" , what if the Gov't said we believe that the pregnancy and the unborn is for the' greater good' of the nation. That we welcome and respect life and that an unborn child has a greater good for humanity. And that Gov't ""mandated' that all pregnancies must be full term.  Is that okay?"
The funny thing about Roe Wade is when it comes down to the Republicans choosing to get vaccinated or not they say it's my right to choose but on the other hand is nobody else has the right to choose they talk out both sides of their mouth. I'm glad they use their right of Freedom there for the other people have the right to choose to you can't have it both ways but these stupid people feel they can't have it both ways. They listen to an idiotic Donald Trump...
this is good thing to learn and it is rrally deep
"Abortion isn‚Äôt contraception.
Privacy isn‚Äôt an excuse to kill someone. 
The ruling was both legally and morally wrong and was somewhat overturned recently; being illegal after 6 weeks but fact is that unless the pregnancy is literally killing you and it‚Äôs a form of self-defence it‚Äôs essentially voluntary manslaughter.
Fun-Fact: Firearms WILL prevent rape attempts, if you don‚Äôt want to accidentally kill the rapist use a .22lr pistol as they are basically upgraded bb guns and HURT to be hit with, you‚Äôll have them running for the hills."
Gov should not spend a single dime to fund abortion related activities.
I'm already confused and lost by 1 minute past the intro.
"I am pro life and pro choice, just not pro death, abortion is a procedure that should  only be used to protect the mothers life in some rare scenarios. It should not be used to killed the child in the mother's womb for the choices the mother and father made, or not understanding the consequences of their action. Ending a life is not a quick fix, it's evil and murder should be illegal in a society. These men/women can instead go and have an operation which will make them infertile and have all the sex that they want. I won't stop them. Though I would suggest otherwise cause it's unwise. But it's okay, you can always adopt and its just clump of cells! What? You don't want an irreversible procedure on your body ? I don't want an irreversible procedure that ends babies life's!"
Imagine being that kid and when you grow up you find out you're only alive because your mom was taking abortion to supreme court. ü§Ø
"Abortion is murder of the unborn 
Murder is a crime"
cant the women in texas just go to another state and get an abortion there?
"This was a poor Supreme Court decision then and now. Time for the current Supreme Court to fix this societal mess.
A woman's right to kill an unborn child.
Where is this in the Constitution?
Comparing this right to that of having a family and raising children. Ridiculous comparison.
Privacy as a right to abortion. Huh?
The case was poor, facts were twisted and wrong. The Supreme Court should strike down the decision just because of this.
Viability? Now it is 15weeks when the normal fetus can potentially become a separate individual human being being born as a baby with full legal rights. Abortion after this date can thus be argued as murder even if the baby has not been born. Irrelevant status of the baby born or unborn."
Roe will fall because God wills it.Just watch.
BABY LIVES MATTER   BABIES LIVES MATTER  The New BLM.
"Every person who may be thinking about having a child or engaging in sex between the sexes should watch this. 
There is a flaw in the thinking of the pro-choice stance that the mother's and the baby's life are not separate. They absolutely are separate. The fact that the baby is contained within the mother's body should not give the mother the right to decide the fate of the life of that baby (or babies)."

"‚ÄúAll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.‚Äù 

Section 1, 14th Amendment, U.S. Constitution.

To even make an argument that women have the ‚Äòright‚Äô to slaughter their children in their womb, one has to argue that said children are literally not *persons* whilst in the womb. Ergo, neither you nor I were *people* while we were in our mother‚Äôs uterus. It‚Äôs absolute nonsense. Not only is it blatant sin in the eyes of Holy God - it‚Äôs not even logically, rationally, scientifically, or morally justifiable. If you don‚Äôt want children *so badly* that in the event you had them you would brutally murder them, *don‚Äôt make them.* That‚Äôs not impossible despite what the ‚Äúhigh-minds‚Äù of the Left may say or think!

Don‚Äôt bring up the rape or health victims straw-men - none of the disputes today revolve around those isolated cases that could be handled privately between medical professionals and families (although I‚Äôm sure children of rape victims would certainly love to voice their right to exist) - the argument is about government regulated, on-demand, and taxpayer funded *infanticide* that is the American Abortion industry. I pray and hope to God Roe is overturned, all to His glory alone."
It blows my mind how much effort people put in just to get government permission to murder babiesüòê
If Roe goes down than these Leftist will have to win some election and arguments in local government.
"Pregnancy can be risky and difficult on women's bodies

The status of a fetus before birth is a contentious question inextricable from the question of women's autonomy; two principled, moral people can come to different conclusions about what they would choose

Embryos and fetuses are fragile; spontaneous abortion is very common (30-40% of pregnancies) and difficult to distinguish from induced abortion

Early abortions are far more common than later ones; late-term abortion is rare after the first trimester and only comes up due to medical complication

Sex- or trait-selective abortion is unethical, unless the trait leads to an unviable (literally not survivable) condition

In lieu of safe and legal options, many women will still try to induce an abortion, possibly unsafely

Based on these ideas, I come to several stances on how abortion should be approached in terms of public policy and culture:

Abortion should be legal overall, with minimal hurdles for inducing one

Making abortion illegal would be ineffective at reducing abortion

Making abortion illegal puts an undue burden on women, including compelling women undergoing miscarriage to prove that they miscarried, which is a horrible situation for anyone who is already facing miscarriage to face

Pragmatically, I wish more people would agree on policies that actually made abortion rarer. For instance, sex education and contraceptive use should be more widespread and comprehensive

Personal opinions against abortion are valid, and medically-informed policies that ensure the safety and bodily autonomy of pregnant women and the fetuses they want ought to be encouraged."
How is abortion private? By that logic a person can kill someone and argue that it's private. Is it just me or did they drop the ball by conceding?

"It was said that Abortion was going to be Safe, Legal & Rare. NOW it is ok to Abort up to 9 months and even if the Baby is Born, the Mother, with her physician,  can decide whether or not to Murder it while it is laying on the doctor‚Äôs table. How far have we gone?????...."
"You want an Abortion? Even though I Disagree with your Decision, That‚Äôs your Moral Issue. Therefore, MY Tax Dollars SHOULD NOT Pay for something I think is Evil!!"
"I ask this question out of genuine curiosity. To those who are pro-choice and believe a woman should be able to choose because ""it's just a cluster of cells"", when do they cease to just a ""cluster of cells""? What is that fine line where it is actually taking a life?"
"What I don't get is if Henry Wade is the lawyer then why does it say Roe vs Wade?

Also if Roe vs Wade was only a ruling by the Supreme Court and not a law then why do you have all of these crazy idiots defending this as like it is a law? And not a ruling?

It doesn't make any senseü§î at all to me whatsoever..but then again if you have 2 crafty lawyers Albright and Wadeüòè..they can make sense out of almost anything and everything.üôÑ which is fair to everyone else, except the innocent person inside the womb of their mothers whose having their innocent little lives murdered...and for what?..FOR NOTHING!üò≠üò§

And it is especially unfair to the young women because it is a fact that alot of women suffer guilt and other mental health problems because of the guilt later on in life and ,it is also unfair to the boyfriend or husband that maybe didn't want the expectant mother to murder their child,(or worse yet has no idea that she's pregnant rignt?) because she doesn't say anything and just goes ahead and does it anyway.(you know  more men then you believe can take care of their unwanted unborn children,and his family could help..and the woman has no responsibilities in the matter if she so chooses)...

And I also believe that it is really unfair because alot of people on the left do not even think of counseling these young women before or after they have an abortion..

We as a society need to let these women know that there are other options to abortion...such as adoption..because alot of people are out there that will take care of your baby and raise them as their own if you can't do so.

We just have to make adoption more easier in this country..instead of being so hard..because to me abortion just isn't an option,only if it risks the life of the mother..or there is no sign of life in the womb,and the baby is going to be born still born."

How are they going to buy baby parts or get rid of babies( I mean goop) if it illegal.. and you made it confusing.. if a pregnant woman aborts a baby in the house it is murder.. however i you go to planned parent hood and they can sell it is cute and not murder.  Is there magic air in that building to make it not murder.. can we purcahse that said air then use it too.

"Fundamental rights aren't constitutional right, that's when the Supreme Court needs to set the record straight."
"SCOTUS was right to decide that a woman had a right to decide what to do with her body. However, when the rights of the unborn fetus came into the periphery, they had to make a pretty nefarious argument. Which was that, based on the 14th amendment, the fetus, or child, having not been born was not afforded rights as a citizen of the United States, and therefore, was not afforded the right to it's life, or even the pursuit of it. Which was a horrendously stupid conclusion.

The justices had basically said that if you weren't a citizen of the U.S., you had no right to YOUR life. Which leaves me to ponder if a foreigner enters the country, is it okay for me or a doctor to have them aborted (killed)? Is that legal? As ridiculous as it sounds, imagine how it is for an unborn child?

The legal precedent behind this did nothing but make a mockery of the law. To make such a childish leap by using the 14th amendment, which was created to give former slaves the right to citizenship, was an extremely short-sighted decision. What bothers me the most is that NO ONE addresses this act, or even questions it.

Yet, if a woman is deciding to keep the baby and someone kills her and the unborn child, it's considered a double homicide.

The selfishness of people astounds me. The thought that an unborn child has no rights is monstrous. Especially since a box of 20 condoms costs $12, or less."

The Right to Infanticide?  I don't think so.
The biggest part of the lie was women could not get abortions if their lives were in danger. Before Roe v Wade the decision to have an abortion in order to save the woman's life was a decision between her and her doctor. Now it's between the media and Congress and the coffers of Planned Parenthood and the likes of baby murderers who gleefully support the slaughter of the unborn babies. Judgment Day is coming and not one of these baby murderers will escape the wrath of the true Supreme Judge. It will be interesting to witness the likes of Ginsberg and  Biden and Ted Chappaquiddick  putting forth their arguments in favor of baby murdering as they stand poised to be throw alive into the Lake of Fire. Talk about your right to a late-term abortion!

Apart from the appalling implications for the sanctity of life, it was one of the few times that a travesty triumphed over justice. The only SCOTUS judgment worse than it was Dread Scott."
