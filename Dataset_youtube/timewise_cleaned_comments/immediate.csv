DEMOCRATS DON'T ONEY LAWS
ABORTION is MURDER
"Good, abortion is killing babies adoption is a better option"
As a Canadian I’m extremely glad we have a choice and the issue is that everyone should have a choice for example what if a young girl gets raped
It's about time.
if you don’t want nun in life stay SINGLE
Sick
How discussing dissatisfied  and  horrible  horrible  behavior  of Republicans now as we the person of the United States of America we have to stand up for ourselves  and voter  blue and see what Biden  will  do  for the United States of America we the people 💙 women  vote blue  💙 😊😊😊😊😊Republicans  don't  care about  the United States of America we the people woman  at all dearly 💙 hearts 💙 😊😊😊😊stand up for the rights  💙 😊
Liars! Which states made abortion illegal? Y'all suck
"Pro choice indirectly supports grape culture. Women use abortion as the ultimate birth control. So women go out for a night of fun with friends, never with the intent of getting pregnant or graped. But put themselves out there to be targeted by evil people, which there seems more today.  In 2019 alone, over 625,000 abortions occured. Ranging from 5 to 12 weeks old and 1 to 5 inches fetuses. In that year alone, how high and wide would you stack these dead children? Enough to fill 6 diesel truck trailers!!!"
"1) Abortion bans do nothing. Women will always have the option of abortion, whether it’s banned or not. 
2) Abortion bans actually increase the number of abortions, ironically. So I guess you people really aren’t about saving fetal lives so much as virtue signaling.
3) Fetuses now have a right that no other human being has, and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another person’s body to stay alive. No other human has ever been granted that right. Even if you stab someone and they’re bleeding out, and you have matching blood types, the government cannot force you to give them your blood to keep them alive. Or if you use a mask, gloves, etc. but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organs start shutting down, the government cannot forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organs. You used protection, so the chances of giving this person the disease that you’re a carrier for were very low, but it still happened, and now they’re dying because of you. Guess what—the government does not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive. That’s exactly what an abortion ban attempts to do, however. So I’m not sure why fetuses should have that right when no one else does."
Wow. This is really fucking sad. Maybe our voting rights will be gone next. This is why history is important.
Terrific to see the rights of the unborn finally being respected. We need that in Europe as well.
Easy Solution Ladies… Do Not Engage in Sexual Relations with any men in these states…ask for ID residency
The Democrats are furious they can't control the black and Latino populations in these states. Margaret Sanger must be rolling in her grave.
I am so happy that they are banning abortion it is wrong and should never be done human life’s are precious and should NEVER be aborted and you cant say that I am wrong
Wait so they’re banning abortion completely? I guess girls better make sure you don fuck the wrong guy now.
"But why can’t I chop up my own baby?!?  Seriously my only defense for baby chopping (I refuse to use the pretty word abortion) is that if a potential mom can do this while the baby is inside her for protection, then maybe that beast shouldn’t give birth.  You realize they cut your baby up inside you like you would a whole fryer chicken, only not as nice, right?  Hitler thought he should be able to pick and choose who should live.  You’re all a bunch of mini-Hitlers"
Abortion should be banned
Use your vote America. Don't fuck it up or they will go for contraception next. 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
How can you call abortion murder if you cannot prove there is a child
THIS IS NOT HELPFUL REGARDING STATES(11).  NINE CITIES.  I INQUIRED AS TO THE 11 U.S. STATES.  WHY SO SECRETIVE?  INCLUDE THE DRUG COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE THE ABORTION AND MORNING AFTER PILLS.
"Keep your pants on if you don't want a Baby, MUDERING is STILL WRONG, there is FREEDOM there's CONSEQUENCES, these women may not believe in GOD,  But we will find out at some point, GOD declared, that"" THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH"" so good luck"
Lmao
"Abortion bans KILL women! Ectopic pregnancies! Sepsis if forced to carry a dead fetus! Forcing a child of incest to give birth whence her body isn't mature enough to carry! And where are those who love abortion bans! Where are they paying for funerals! Would they want their daughter to have forced birth for rape or incest? Where are they? They scatter like cockroaches in the light! They run away from the consequences! And those people are the same ones who have a fur ball if criticized saying ""don't you tell me how to raise my child!"" yet want others to give birth to unwanted, unloved kids! Pathetic!"
stop hating eachother bc you disagree the irony!
Ban it also
If they need it let them get the abortion😊
"Ok here’s why, some people need to get abortions If they had the baby they would die so they had to get abortions"
Why not
We can’t ban abortion
I just saw a sign to legalize abortion from conception to birth. Why have we criminally charged women who killed their newly self birthed their fetus?
Yes ban all abortions . im sick if seeing women get abortions they want to keep giing around spreading they legs and want to play but not pay for it  fuck that them babies deserve life what if that was you in a belly and ur momma wanted to abort you. ! And rape is sad i understand but give baby up for adoption let it atleast have chance and incest again if its incest and no rape then like i said before keep your legs closed.
People kill babies and feel nothing
So women will have to take responsibility now?
"These bans put in another notch in the belt of women who just can't win for anything in this sexist society. A man doesn't want to marry no problem. She doesn't want to marry she's called a lesbian or a man hater. Single moms everyone says the kid needs a father! Single dad? No one says the kid needs a mom treating moms as irrelevant and unimportant, at the same time demanding she BE a mom!  Man has a lot of partners no problem. She has a lot of partners she's called names. She abandons her kids she's considered an awful person. He abandons his family no reaction. Well if you have an abortion you'd make a lousy parent some would say  but are silent about deadbeat dads who refuse to take care of their offspring.  Well if you kept your legs closed you wouldn't get pregnant some say. But just me says to him no one forces you to jump in. No one is forcing you to do it with her. You're yelled at if you have an abortion, you have a kid it's oh no here we go again another Welfare kid! Well life begins at conception! But then you have those who have no idea how long it even takes for the sperm and egg to meet acting like women can control that. It can take days or weeks for the fertilized egg to attach to the womb. There are a lot of barriers to cross. And then of course you have the problem of an ectopic pregnancy the ignorant don't have a clue about. The egg attaches to the fallopian tube and grows and kills mom when it ruptures and she bleeds to death! Abortion is murder people tell her! But say to her no problem if you abort with a genetic problem most of which can be managed. Prosthetics for a missing limb, lots of help to learn things if you have Downs Syndrome. They can learn just like everyone else. So abortion is ""murder"" selectively. Abort the imperfect, keep the perfect you don't want. Essentially women can't win no matter what. But no one imposes anything on men. Pure sexist hypocrisy. And of course the pro lifer will never take in a pregnant woman, nurse her through 9 months, be there at labor and birth and be a surrogate relative helping to raise the kid. They're not there to personally find child care. They don't care if mom doesn't get paid maternity leave but get upset if fathers don't get it! They don't care that schools stop their lunch programs because parents are too damn lazy to wake up an hour earlier to give the kid breakfast and pack a lunch but have no problem feeding their own faces! Wonder what the politicians would do if unwanted babies were dumped on their doorsteps. You wanted the kid born now you take care of it! Those against abortion call themselves experts on the subject who've never been in the situation. Abortion is different for people. For some the decision is easy but tough to go through, for some the decision is hard to make and hard to go through. Contraception is also sexist. It's all dumped on her. But he runs if offered a condom. Pathetic all the way around the way society tries to control women it just doesn't like. And oh yeah! The ignorant assumption that she makes babies. No sperm no baby. We don't spontaneously create babies. Not only is there ignorance about abortion but human biology as well. No abortion? Then there should be forced neutering of men. I bet  that would drive men crazy. Shame that will never happen so we can hear men tirade about denial of reproductive choice!"
"Abortion bans are just another form of sexism and stereotype and hypocrisy. Sexism comes to play because no one puts bans on vasectomy. He can do it for any reason no questions asked. He can control his reproductive decisions without government imposition. Same old crap. He can we can't. No one yells at a man demanding she get an abortion, she wants it suddenly doing it is awful. The stereotype remains in that women must have a kid because that's her lot in life. If she's a lousy parent boo! He's a lousy parent or doesn't even stick around, silence. The hypocrisy comes in by those who want other people to have no rights but it must never happen to them. Gun nuts are a perfect example. They don't care of your right to vote is suppressed. They don't care if a woman's right to choose when it comes to having a kid is interfered with. But take away their guns? Even suggest it? They have a hair ball tantrum!"
"I always thought abortion was a need, not a want. Only to prevent the child from suffering if there was something seriously wrong with the baby, I even understand that. So why is having an abortion because you want it okay? I agree with a portion of abortion if it’s a need, to prevent the child from suffering or in a way to save the mother from jeopardizing her health. Why else would abortion be okay if you want it and not need it? Know what I’m saying?"
Ban the shit
"Effective immediately, ALL states that have “BANNED ABORTION” are REQUIRED to collect DNA, of ALL males, ages 12 and above. Since 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice has maintained a nationwide forensic DNA database known as the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). Today, the federal government and all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, contribute profiles to CODIS.Jan 20, 2021"
"Wait I thought most of these pro lifers  are Christian? Which is weird because in the bible it says life begins at first breath. So which is it, either the bible is the word of god or the bible has some errors in it."
"I would never have an abortion, but if they can live with it, then it's not my place to judge. This is really setting humanity back 100 years."
"Hello !
Every doctor swear to follow the Hippocratic oath :
The Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians. It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear, by a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards. The oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the Western world, establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today. These include the principles of medical confidentiality and non-maleficence. As the seminal articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice, the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value. It is enshrined in the legal statutes of various jurisdictions, such that violations of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oath's symbolic nature.

"FYI:  Leader of major Texas Anti-Abortion group arrested for soliciting a minor
MARK FRAUENFELDER  2:14 PM THU AUG 25, 2022
Luke Bowen, the Political Director and the public face of Texas Right to Life, was arrested earlier this month for solicitation of a minor. The forced pregnancy organization fired Mr. Bowen on the same day he was arrested."
That's not right that's killing innocent babies
Well after the Roe v wade was demolished now its getting control over the women and soon it will be illegal to be transgender and that will be a great day for our nation
I'm so happy for this new law it's awesome
"Oh no ... these poor women will be forced to consider birth control methods like , God forbid ,  the pill or condoms ... the inhumanity of it all ..."
"Pouring gasoline on the fire of rage against religious extremism and the march toward theocracy.  85% favor legal abortion.  If you don't show up at the polls and choose representatives who support you then you are the problem.  Vote, it's our only recourse."
I like the fact that the bitches and gold diggers need to get a proper job now instead kill little angels for living
These 11 states have my full support
"This just make people hate the churches even more and not trust their government because they know the governments are influenced by religion. I don’t agree with abortion because to me it all falls under being irresponsible and therefore also making you a murderer. No matter how you see it. but people need to live with their own consequences so it should be legalized. Women saying my body my choice is selfish because it takes 2 to make a LIFE. Not 1. You didn’t make that baby on your own and any guy who support your decision is a murderer like you. Some guys are going support your wrong decision just to get laid. To make themselves look good. But of course you women know that. But as long as they are on your side you don’t care. Here is my solution. Legalize abortion, anyone who gets it under 3 months gets 1 year of federal prison on charges for 3 degree murder. Anyone 4 months and up 5 years in federal prison. Only women who were kidnapped and forcefully rape should get physical and mental treatment and paid by the state. Solution solve. You’ll see how abortion goes down."
"Watch: birth control pills are still effective way to control birth:
https://youtu.be/wbajNTXBdtc
Even in States where surgical abortions are now prohibited, contraceptives can still be used for birth control."
"Contraceptives are an attempted way to stop the babies birth:
https://youtu.be/EcQSwtMR55E
Even in States where 'surgical abortions' are not allowed, 'contraceptives' can be used to control births."
"so rape victims have to keep there baby
or the college student"
"I see this Republican insanity over a woman's right to choose, biting them in the arse, soon."
"Losing rights to kill a baby and shutting down gay parades , finally God is getting His justice."
"WHAT ABOUT ILL WOMEN WHO WOULD DIE WHILE GIVING BIRTH
WHAT ABOUT RAPE
WHAT ABOUT INCEST
WHAT ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS

God that is why Canada is better."
"what happens when a child gets raped is that child supposed to keep that baby if they get pregnant huh? you can't seriously get a child to give birth and lose their childhood because of a man thinking they own OUR BODY I'm am not sorry this is an insult to humanity even the men are thinking this is PATHETIC. or even a woman that gets raped and can't keep the baby due to religious beliefs. OUR BODY, OUR CHOICE!!"
AMAZING ABORTION IS MURDER
When the ugliest women support abortion even though they never had sex
"I think it's great that all these old white rich men are making decisions for these poor black young women, since they are the majority who get abortions, mainly due to financial and health reasons."
"Heatbeat, fingers curl,
A hand out to stay the blade,
Why care, inhuman?"
"Heatbeat, fingers curl,
A hand out to stay the blade,
Why care, inhuman?"
"Democrats kill babies, vote Republican!"
I’m not american but people should know that abortions will always exist now those decisions  will just cause more unsafe abortions that will harm both the woman and the unborn child. Let’s not forget bringing unwanted children that may grow up criminals and do damage to society and increase crimes rate. 👏 thanks and congrats to boomers for making more genius ideas to ruin this world once again.
Get these religious fucks the fuck out of here. God tells them not to judge but they sit on earth doing nothing but judging.
"So does that mean men can't have a vasectomy either?? Or are Republicans just really after women 🤔
The sperm in our scrotum is a living organism before it even gets to an female's egg 🤷🏾‍♂️"
LETS HOPE THEY BAN ALL ABORTIONS EVERYWHERE.WOMEN CANT BE LEFT RO MAKE THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS.THEY JUST ARENT SMART ENOUGH
I think it's fine .There should be a few exceptions tho like for rape and incest .They also need to take care of the unwanted babies properly
This ban is like a christian religious law...since when does the governments do this
cool
"In South Korea, women can have abortions anytime for no reason.
Korean women can abort even after six months of pregnancy and need no reason.
Korean women say That's what the U.S. does
Is it right?"
Abortion is evil plain and simple stop having sex if you can't handle a kid and if your raped give it up for adoption do not kill babies it's evil no matter how u look at it.
Crime is going to skyrocket in those states. By people who literally should never have been born. What do these pro-lifers think was going to happen
Why do men always care about the things that wasn’t born yet lol

"Republicans are pandering to evangelicals, America's Taliban in order to widen the base from just white supremacists. the separation of church and state has fallen. Evangelicals believe in the biblically ordained submission of women. So now women in red states are being stripped of their rights to bodily autonomy and contraception, as part of the plan to subjugate and control women. The country is going off the rails to a mideval puritanical theocracy. Vote blue that's all we can do. Republicans are vicious misogynists!"
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe"
"Many bioethicists warned the ""left"" over the past year that supporting Vaccine Mandates will open the door for other forms of medical totalitarianism. Now we witness the takedown of Roe. Next we will see other examples of medical totalitarianism like Crispr or Nauralink being mandatory for the 4th industrial revolution. The ""left"" is consistently simple minded and unstrategic in their analysis.  So embarrassing."
"Ad the District of Columbia to your list where abortion is at risk.  There’s no state government, it is the jurisdiction of the Congress and if Republicans win the midterms they will outlaw abortion in DC…while sending the congressional aids they routinely rape to New York for abortions"
Abortion shouldn’t be banned it should still be legal under certain circumstances if the baby isn’t going to survive if the mother can’t physically have the baby safely if the pregnancy is threatening the mother’s life or if the pregnancy was the result of rape those are real legitimate reasons for abortion where the mother would actually need it.
Finally
not your body not your right who are you to take someone elses life and im athiest so dont get me with no religious bs
Love will end abortion. I hope you guys know that the pro life movement helps women who are struggling to take care of their baby.
🤣🤣🤣 you lot can't kill babies no more .... Goooooood
"✨✨✨The FBI is taking away people’s judgment and controlling pregnancy rates.  This is one way to do as they please to the people.  The FBI is targeting young women and have been for a very long time.  This is one strong way to derail their lives causing them to have a problem.  The FBI ruined mine repeatedly.  They chased me down after college making sure I wouldn’t have what I planned and had many attempts of set ups for a fall in life.  Individuals aren’t what they use to be.  Their frontal cortex of their brain has been picked apart in many such ways through some government mind control where this effects their judgment.  Judgment is hindered, which can lead to many other types of instances, such as pregnancy.  When the prefrontal cortex is disrupted mental illnesses develop, such as schizophrenia.  We had many cases of schizophrenia in the past two decades.  ✨✨✨The FBI does not want to see young women succeed.  They like to make them fat and ruin their lives.  People might not care for these individuals cause they were brainwashed not to at first.  But, if the FBI targets you as a women it is very uncomfortable to live.  And you have many downfalls.  You just have to act like you don’t care about all the horrible things they cause and keep going.✨✨🐇"
Is there any exception in regards of rape victims ???
"Welp let this be the last moment abortion to be ban cause this day modern women have no morality to kill thier own child even if its came from incest and rape which that its a crime to murder and rape. 

People are blinded to thier sin of pride, lust and anger.  May God forgive thief soul cause they don't know what they we're doing."
It was never a Constitutional Right. Please report the news and not opinion.
"When you speak much about speaking on women's right and right to choose, consider these too; 
1.)Like toddler or adolescent, the terms embryo and fetus do not refer to nonhumans, but to humans at particular stages of development.
2) No matter how much better it sounds, “terminating a pregnancy” is still terminating a life.
3) The one-time choice of abortion robs someone else of a lifetime of choices and prevents him from ever exercising his rights.
Exceptional case must be dealt with separate law, like medical emergencies, rape etc. Abortion just because convenience should be stopped by law.."
I am so glad this finally came through this is truly amazing f Abortion
“My body my choice” lol the baby ain’t your body hun just becuase there’s a long tube connecting you to it.
All ima say is make the best choice and don’t have fucking sex!

That we struggles we are just incubators we carry babies for 9 months right and left women carry’s babies cmon bro just don’t have sex and be cautious on your surroundings m..
"Remember ladies...when you are 6 weeks pregnant,
You can now...
1. ask for child support  
2. child credit on your tax return
3. ride HoV lanes
4. can't be deported because your baby is US citizen"
So y’all out here trying to ban abortion but yet don’t wanna take care of all these foster kids in the system ohhh ok🙃
America land of freedom. But we FORBID you.
Ban abortion? Why not increase tax on meat because it against constitution. And most Conservative party(Christian) should fast on Wednesday and Friday forbid to eat meat. I bet that those Republicans out of control to eat meat on these days because they only interest in politic!!!!

GOD ALMIGHTY BLESS THE ANTI-ABORTION TEAM. IT'S high time to stand firm against this decades of murdering innocent helpless babies. U.S. will thank them when time to come face to face with your GOD CREATOR who hates killing innocent babies.
"All abortionists and those who wants abortion should have been aborted by their own mothers. Then,no one would be killing their own  innocent helpless unborn babies and make excuses to sexual immorality.no brainer. FREEDOM HAS A HIGHER LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY.MATURE HONEST  PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS PRINCIPLE VERY WELL."
"interesting fact:     
 In 2005, the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UN HRC) ordered Peru to compensate a woman (known as K.L.) for denying her a medically indicated abortion; 
this was the first time a United Nations Committee had held any country accountable for not ensuring access to safe, legal abortion, and the first time the committee affirmed that abortion is a human right.[39] K.L. received the compensation in 2016.[39]
 In the 2016 case of Mellet v Ireland, the UN HRC found Ireland's abortion laws violated International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights because Irish law banned abortion in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities."
"And if we can accept that a mother can kill her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?

"Just because a state bans abortion, don't think for a moment that doctors won't continue to perform them. In the world of medicine, it's all about coding a procedure. The use an alternate procedural code to bypass insurance companies who will pay for one procedure (deemed medically necessary) or another code that isn't. I worked in a hospital in the medical reports department and noticed a rise in a procedure called a D&C. After reading through the pathology reports, I figured out the hospital was doing abortions."
What Are The 11 States ?
First of all that was not a constitutional right there is no place in the Constitution where it says abortion but a lot of Americans are having their second amendment rights in French to bond by these red flag laws by the communist Democrats and the absolute trader Republicans that should be kicked out of the party
"See YouTube don't want to admit that anything that says jwoke to the left gets 10,000 thumbs down and only one thumbs up and anything to the right gets $20, 000 thumbs up and maybe two thumbs down"
Ban the damn thing everywhere
"—— We need to work together, give better sex education on period of ovulation and when the reproductive system is most likely able to conceive. Social media also has to stop telling women that being pregnant and having kids is disturbing. We need to help more women and men with mental illnesses too. Miscarriages and deadly ectopic pregnancies are not abortions under the law, you can’t compare them to actual abortions, where the mom intentionally end the life. Some women actually don’t like that people compare or mix their miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy with abortion. It is not and should not be about winning something, but about saving the mother and the kid’s life. Abortion was never safe, and as higher risk then actually giving birth. True that banning abortions is not a concluding solution, since even if it is ban in certain states women can still go to other states, and people are actually creating organizations to help these women get abortions. And some on TikTok are also telling them to use hangers and papaya seeds to end the innocent life. 


—— We should work on the base of the issue if we truly want that the baby and the mom live and have a safe environment. Of course we can’t change everything, but help the people that need and want to be help and try our best. But in order to do that people need to also help pro life charities, that are not represented enough. I also believe that some pro lifers need to be and stay humble, truly care about the life and be dispose and prepared to help these women. Everyone should. People also have to stop saying that helping a women make a better decision, is wrong. Some of them don’t even know that it’s alive. We have to stop letting social media control us and just agree like that with something, just because everyone else does and without even knowing more about the subject. Pro lifers need to stop calling women who had abortions murderers or killers, it doesn’t help. We have to keep calm and truly advocate for what we say, with care and truth. In front and behind cameras or people. Addiction, is also a base of the issue that can lead to abortions, we should give more care to them and people will also have to want to change and work hard to become better. Poverty. Charities need more founding, to help homeless mothers. We have to do what we can, to save both life, republicans or democrats."
So happy the murder rate will be reduced in 11 States.
i never agreed with thanos more than i do now
The fact men were fighting shows the state is Wack!!
Im glad its banned
"Amerika ""lets go..The stone age waits for us"""

Under The 14th Amendment Of The United States Constitution. The Babies Should Have A Fair Trial Before A Death Sentence Is Executed On It After All The Babies Is A Person Made By Two People.
These Mother, Are Yelling To Kill Their Babies; Like The Crowd Yelled For Jesus Crucifixion, And In The Early Days Of America When The
Lynch Mob Hange You Without Fairness Of The American Constitution.
Justices Got It Right This Time. Somebody Slipped A 50 Year Bad Law To Kill Innocent
Babies. You Don't Kill A Innocent Person, You Don't
Go Up In God's Holy Womb
And Kill Babies, A They Drug You Out Of Your House To Kill You.
America Has Come A Very Long Way In Correcting Past
Evils And Injustices. Old Glory Is Still Flying And We Are Still Free. The Bay Is Protected By
The 14th Amendment As The
Mother Is. After All It Share The Same Space, The Baby Is Human, As The Two Humans Made It Are Human.
Justice Clarence Thomas.
Got It Right. And The State Should Follow Suit.
His Name is Jesus. Trust Him.
Read: Genesis 43. Read Sodom And Gomorrah.
Know God Made Us; He Took Care Of You In A Bag Of Water
In The Womb For Nine Months And You Didn't Drown
And He Made You A Human Being, In His Likeness.
You In His House. Breathing His Air, Drinking His Water, Eating His Plants And Animals And Living Under His Temperature. He's The Same God; Who Brought His People Out Of Egypt Into The Promise Land. Life And Death Is In The
Hand Of GOD. Stop Killing His Babies. Satan Lied To You, Like He Did To Adam And Eve.
Satan Had You Thinking You Could Kill God's Babies With A Law From The Government.
Well Will The Government Protect Your Soul From Hell
Can They Pass A Law For That. Answer. No Satan Tricked You Women For Fifty Years, Going In To The Years Of Slavery In America. This Time Its Self Enslavement.
God Have Mercy. America Repent And Beg God's Forgiveness.
I Cry For These Babies. Somebody Need To Cry For Them. Satan Wants To Kill

"Let's blacks makes it,  we need safety"
Blame the dumocrats ...... Jane roe lied about being ganged raped and they paid her.... And they pushed for late term abortions .... And they arguments are outdated their from the late sixty ...... Before google.  Sell phones internet ultrasounds ... Medicines that can save the life of premature born and low birth weight . premature babies in 1970 survived 5 % now its up to 75 percent ...dumocrats are just using outdated argument ..... We have ultrasound !!!!!!! We can see the the baby one to weeks .. Their pushed for late term abortions that was that was the last straw ..... Im talking 7 8 9 months
Why y’all got that women in the red suit reading a script for y’all
Murder is not a right just because it’s convenient to you.
"life must be respected in all of its forms. Whether in the womb or outside womb.
It's not a wise decision to promote abortion laws by raising the issue or rape, medical emergencies and teenage pregnancies etc. Real truth is 90% of abortion kills healthy viable babies just for the comfort of couples or profit of hospitals or companies."
"This is what progress looks like, I’m not American but this shows that they are really getting somewhere"
If it takes 50 years to take it back that’s a lot of lives saved 🙏🏼
This is TERRIBLE. Some women’s lives are threatened due to pregnancy. And those babies die too. Would you rather save a life or kill two?
Oklahoma rules!
"God bless those states, I am so happy. The happiest I’ve been, we have stopped those baby killers, child murderers! These people are real hero’s #godblessthem"
I'm thinking travel bans for anyone who is pregnant could be next to prevent crossing state borders where abortion is still legal.
There will be a mass exodus out of those states
"Hallelujah!!! Abortion is nothing but murder and child sacrifice. We will continue to push back on this murder excuse...bring the fight on, we are ready for you too, both spiritually and naturally. Saying this as a proud believer in the Lord Jesus Christ"
Way to go TN!☺️ Overturn P8!
"Wow
Usa
Democrati
Wow"
How sad that the important thing about taking rights away from your women is the next election.
"i find it funny how westerners argue about democracy all the time and when the majority side wins, they cant handle it and ""protest"" againts their decision. you call it abortion, others call it murder. it wouldn't even be a problem if people didnt have sex before marriage."
"Abortion especially on demand is one of the most demented yet necessary things in this world. I consider women who decided to keep their babies to be greater than those that didn’t, but once again it is their choice.  In an ideal world no one should and will never have an abortion out of their own free will. Since abortion will be hard to criminalize and I doubt that it ever will, it should only be allowed up to a certain point and in the earliest possible time if done so electively."
Right? Killing is right? Instead be mature and make a serious choice before getting pregnant(life is not a joke or casual stuff)whether you kill 5 year child or unborn child it’s the same thing murder.
if you personally dont like abortion dont get abortion. i dont see why it bothers you what people do with their body and personal life choices.
dumbest shit i ever heard
Killing babies is okay!!!
I'm angry I can't kill babys!!!! NOOOOOOOO
39 to go
I mean America was never great. I petty the people there
*Casually drinking liberal tears*
"I can’t wait to vote Republican this time around because it’s insane to think the the obviously failing Democratic Party will do anything for my people. 95 percent of native black Americans whose ancestors died and bled while building this nation got nothing in return! Out of the 60,000,000 babies that Plan Parenthood murdered 1/3 of them are native Black babies! Margret Sanger designed this to solve the “ problem” of annihilation of disabled children before they enter the world and had a chance, and Black children because she deemed our lives worthless because we are born non white! We all know that because white will be the minority in ethnicity in this county that they are not killing their children at alarming rates! These clinics are in our neighborhoods with the full intention of making it easy for silly young women who can’t seem to pop a pill, say no or use some form of birth control! Our people need to wake up! The Biden/ Harris ticket has been a nightmare for our people and where are the Reparations? They use the Race card, play on your emotions and tell you that they are your friend! They don’t care anything about Black women so it’s time to wake up! Stop lying these well to do White women are pisses because in all their privileges they have nothing else to do! Cry about this or that when their “ many rights” are being shifted but the truth is the mass numbers of Black women need Reparations maybe then they could afford houses, day care or a nanny to keep their children! Many of our young women need to stop using murder as a means of birth control"
"Anortion is a crime not a right. I’m glad they finally prohibited it. Also abortion leads to less population. Look at Arab people, they are the hugest race in this world. Keep your race, don’t reduce it. Another thing, if you are with abortion, don’t even start being pregnant. Have sex only with your husband. Don’t have sex with other men, get pregnant and have STDs then you say it’s your right to kill a child!!! You are afraid of having a baby, don’t have sex till you are ready to have a baby cuz sex leads to pregnancy. Sex not for fun. You are horny, go masturbate or have sex with toys or watch porn and use your imagination, don’t do stupid thing then you say you don’t want to be a mom. If you don’t want to get burnt, don’t be close to fire. You don’t want to get drown in a sea, don’t swim till you are ready and you want it. Glad they illegalize this crime. It’s a crime not a right. No one has a right to kill a fetus. Killing was never a right. Just cuz that fetus was inside your body, doesn’t mean it’s your right to kill it. Exactly like having a child, you abuse it, CPS take it from you. You have another human being inside you, it means it has a right to live then this fetus after she or he gets born and become an adult can decide if they want to keep living or not. You still don’t want your baby, send it for adoption bunch of women wish they get pregnant and have babies. Just talk to the nurse and let her find the baby a mom to have it once it gets born. It happens in Middle East. If the mom has too many kids and can’t have any more and she hit pregnant she gives it to her sister who wants more to adopt it."
Oklahoma is now where the baphomet statue is. That’s the first thought I had when he mentioned children. Children are next to the statue. I started my cycle around 13 some start earlier. The government/states continuously fail female victims of all kinds of heinous crimes but to not being given a choice? Pedophiles not being charged more or even at all… kids possible being victims. All kinds of things could come from this
"Judaism is the world's oldest monotheistic religion, dating back nearly 4,000 years. They say that Life begins at birth. ISLAM says that life begins at 140 days. Both have abortions exceptions for the health of the mother, rape and incest. Republicans say ""We don't follow Jewish law"" But the rules against GAYS and everything else they deem deviant comes from the OLD testament That's JEWISH LAW.. Which only proves that MAGA HAT EVANGELICALS  just make shit up..."
"The only reason abortion is being banned is MONEY. It costs $10,000 to have a baby in a hospital in America. Babies = Money.  America is enslaved.  'Nuff said."
I feel I am back in the 70's...
African American women who rely on abortion sounds crazy. That’s why the black population is still the minority.
"The joke is abortion was secretly a way of keeping the leftist population down.
Who is the sexy black woman at the beginning ?"
there never was a constitutional right giving you the right to kill another human being that was the product of your irresponsible sex. it is actually hard to believe that people thought they had the right to do this. you f****** ghouls.
"Non-constitutional right, good riddance e"
The pro life movement wins !
Mandatory vasectomies .. life begins at Ejaculation !!!
MANDATORY VASECTOMIES!!!
If you don’t want a baby don’t have unprotected sex!
We want civil war if this isn't solved soon to give us our life back
"It's not unclear oklahoma bans travel for it already,  they're set to murder us. Alabama and Texas already refuse rights to women to live by denying them D&C procedures and ectopic pregnancy removal there's articles on it already"
U should have the right to choose but other should have the right to scrutinize.. freedom of speech baby
I don’t care about y’all bannin abortions but why yall banning birth controls nd plans Bs im Confuse
No they didn't. In the past few years the media has started existing in an alternative reality.
"Before exporting democracy to other countries, apply democracy to your home."
They never had this when was little girl
Sad to kill babies
"Both extreme positions (banning all abortions and allowing abortion up to moment of birth) do not have majority support. Allowing abortion until the detection of a heartbeat is NOT ""effectively banning"" abortion. Allowing abortion in the first trimester is NOT effectively banning abortion. Allowing abortion up to the moment of birth is gross. That is the killing of a full-term baby. Most people support limited abortion. The media is lying about this issue."
"YEAH!!!!! Roe Wade is dead !!!!!     Women's rights???!!! How about the rights of all the women these women murdered !!!  We women have plenty of reproductive rights --- right to decide to have sex, right ti decide what form of birth control to use, right to decide to keep the baby or place the baby for adoption.  What about  women's RESPONSIBILITY to the child they CHOSE to create!!!   I am a woman, and i believe abortion is reprehensible!!!  Quite calling it women's rights. Most women 
( who know what what the horror of abortion truely is) find abortion UNCONSCIONABLE !!!!"
So six People literally determined for millions that if raped a woman cannot abort Lordy lordy
Some one abort the Supreme Court or make a meme of it
What else would you expect from a developing country like USA
Thay about to make the childe and the woman life a living hell the kid will get out into a adoption centre left alone the woman will either sucide or  die while giving birth .good job USA

WE AS WOMEN ARE NOT GOD MYSELF AS A WOMAN I HAVE 6 kids 3 are my step kids 2 are mine and my blood middle child got adopted by a wonderful family that tried for 10 years to have a baby and failed WE AS WOMEN SHOULD NOT HAVE THE ROGHT TO PLAY GOD YOU KNOW HOW MANY WOMEN CANT HAVE KIDS OF THEIR OWN AND HOW MANY GAY AND TRANSGENDER WANT CHILDREN AND A FAMILY BE PRO ADOPTION AND DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE INSTEAD OF BEING RUN AROUND SALLYS LOOKNG FOR AN EASY OUT WITH MURDERING A CHILD
Pro choice is something I’m glad to see get banned is a great thing for me and y’all that are fighting for pro choice are an honest embarrassment of women PERIOD
"Its one unfair judgement. Whoever made this decision, not wise to lead the future generation. Protect children? how about children who were rapped and got pregnant? What happen to family planning too. Not a good decision."
"Do fetuses have the right to life?

The argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong.
I will simply assume, instead of proving, that your murder is seriously wrong.
I will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder.
Finally, I will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issues to which this analysis of abortion ethics may lead.
The symmetries arising from the analysis of the main arguments on both sides of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult.
Consider the following standard argument against abortion: Fetuses are both human and alive. People have the right to life.
Therefore, fetuses have the right to life. Of course, women have the right to control their own body, but the right to life goes beyond a woman's right to control her own body.
Therefore, abortion is wrong.
The fetus' right to life does not include his right to use someone else's body to preserve his life.
However, an opponent of abortion may point out that a woman's right to use her body does not include her right to end someone else's life in order to do what she wants with her body.
In response, one might argue that a pregnant woman's right to control her body is not much, if it is wrong, to take any action that ends the life of the fetus within her.
However, an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus' right to life does not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses.
The consequence of all these symmetries seems to be a stalemate.
But if we have an attitude, then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of rights, a fetal right to life versus a woman's right to control her body.
One could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control one's own body in the case of abortion, because the loss of one's life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control one's own body, a respect for nine months.
Therefore, the right to life prevails over the right to control one's own body and abortion is wrong."
"All these people who are pro abortion should have been aborted, waste of air"
"Bro who cares, it’s not a real human yet let a woman abort it if she wants. I don’t understand why it’s illegal."
Boo hoo yall wont be able to get away with murder anymore
Move to California and watch your life go to shit. I'll give you leftist a ride
"Can someone tell me why tho? Like why did they just decide to get together and take away this right??

 Was it out of the blue or was this a work in progress over the past couple weeks, months or years..

 it just seems outta no where. Like even the president doesn't agree w this decision so idk. Ik I sound dumb but I'm just out the loop under a rock lmao. Just seems stupid imo. 

Takes up time, money, resources, causes strikes and riots.. it only makes space for a fat mess tbh. So much for ""land of the free""..

even if u don't agree with abortions the choice should still be yours to make.

Hec, this world is fastracked towards overpopulation eventually and this don't help that cause either."
Fake news it says nothing in the constitution about abortion
"a woman carries a child at the cost of her health and future, so only every woman can decide whether to have an abortion or not, and not the state. by banning abortions, you will only put women at risk, abortions will be done anyway. a woman is more important than an embryo. and by the way, at the stage of abortion, someone is not yet a living being."
"Thank you Jesus Christ our blessed Lord for hearing our prayers and answered .Amen . The spirit and the Bride say ,Come Lord Come,amen."
Yes sir
"Woho , finally:) No more easy killing in womb 🙌"
White have more abortions than blacks period so they just trying to save there own but using blacks for an excuses
Im surprised there are so many abortion rate in America and they are banning abortion … God bless America. Guess people need to take more responsibility in having sex!
and rape victims ????? they live in hell and she doesn't have a consent what the actual ....???
"Good job. We've saved innocent lives now. Next is, lets get every state in the US to ban baby murder. God's army will always prevail. Then finally we can start imposing new processive laws like no dating in school until 24 or until young adults can prove their financial stability to take care of a new life they eager to create. Fact is, the more people are educated, the less sex they crave. The problem is, most highly educated and smart people dont want create children to pass on their superior genes while most lowly educated and not so smart people always want sex to create more children. Hope we can address this issue as well."
Good! Ban Democrats next!
U should study Indian constitution...
American constitution is too much rigid....we Indians are 400 ahead than American constitutional rights...
Oh excuse me your all atheists so God has no bearing on your pitiful lives OK got it
Uh well hmmmm God says sex outside of MARRIAGE IS A SIN so what part of that don't u dummies understand??? If you make wrong decisions then pay the consequences or just keep it zipped up and locked geeez what infantiles you call yourselves adults sure lololol
Also you can only adopt at 21 but a 12 year old is capable of raising a baby!
Big up to backstreet abortion and adoption
"Okay so why aren’t men getting their ability to pass sperm blocked  until they are able to conceive, notice how women do all the hard work but it’s never the man who has to make any sacrifices. Women should go on strike and not go out their houses and anywhere near men and kill the population off :) see how they like that"
The funny thing is liberals want to ban guns because of latest killings. But want to be a able to kill thousands by abortion. So it you kill a woman who is pregnant you can't be charged with double homicide. Right because the fetus isn't human by liberals standards.🤷
Think of all the black babies that will be saved
Each state is like a country in Europe
"I got one for you CNN

Res. 261. Section 1. Neither the United States nor any State shall deprive any human being, from the moment of conception, of life without due process of law; nor deny to any human being, from the moment of conception, within its jurisdiction, the equal protection of the laws.

Now I understand your not very versed in the constitutional law of our lan and that’s ok I’m here to help. Basically under law the fetus is it’s own separate entity from the mother getting all of our rights and freedoms from the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg. I’m sorry to tell you it’s not your body and the only abortions protected under law is do to rape and possibility of death"
I hate the influence of religion on politics.

Ohio republican lawmakers said 12 year old rape victims will be forced to have babies. Please keep you 12 year olds away from Ohio lawmakers they are sick men and they are making laws to help themselves and child predators.
"Hmmmm so women can we need a rule that says,”Men needs to get castrated so women doesn’t get pregnant!! abortion problem solve. Or have the kid and drop them off at the pro-life doorstep. The right to judge does not belong to Humans. Ye without sin cast the first stone. We are all flawed. How many of these pro-life speak out against the death penalty? Govern yourself accordingly."
"Most complaining so far seem to be from liberals, people on the left, but basically states who want to cam just decide that you can abort even in the 9 months soooooo... Should not right people complain also for this potential atrocity ?"
"Guess you better be responsible.  Keep your legs closed.  I’m not imposing my religion.  I’m not religious but I think abortion for birth control is an abomination.  And I live in a state where enough people agree.  If you don’t like it, frame an argument and win over a majority to change opinion.  Otherwise, keep a rainy day fund to get scraped in California, ho bag."
"Why do pro=lifers still eat eggs for breakfast? I got billions of unanswerable questions, but I am just lobbing one to show you live in a world with 0 consistency."
Why they ban abortion?
"“I could feel the baby being torn from my insides. It was really painful....Three-quarters of the way through the operation I sat up....In the cylinder I saw the bits and pieces of my little child floating in a pool of blood. I screamed and jumped up off the table....I just couldn't stop throwing up....”

I know two people who were scheduled to be aborted- one was adopted by the social worker and the other’s parent missed her appointment. One of them has founded a charity that has helped over one million people. I wonder how many others were aborted that could’ve brought positive change to this hateful world.

"It’s okay to kill little in school with guns ,"
"I REQUEST ZELENSKY 💙 OR PRESIDENT  PUTIN💚 or any christian in the world ❤️ TO ALWAYS THINK  THESE ,,,A,B,C,D,E AND Fs in your life , for a great future 👍
God bless you
Logic of  joy or peace in Life is very lies in a very moral knowledge of  life style.
That's as below
Everytime or every moment  or always when you do not love  ( careful that someone watches you ) the world ( eyes flesh lusts and pride )
You have lot of 
Peace 
Courage
A) God’s Children have no fear of death 💀 
But we will not die unless it is God’s will👍👍(great peace  in times of diseases or fearful journnies in life battle ,)
B) We shouldn’t be worrying about anything a lot because everything works together for good for those who love GOD ( marriage or death  or any good or humiliation or a great permanent honour,)
C) we must sacrifice our life at least for our children
The world is not  life  to us 
Imagine will a father be happy if he gets some privileges but not his children 👶 
Never 
So something if you don’t get 
Or something dangerous happens to you deliberately is for good 
Because we live for a fellow Christians or a christian family and children and overall for the  kingdom of God in earth ( government)
D) we must know that
Our heart ❤️ is filled with fear and guilty conscience for many reasons
1) for not following according to 1 john 2:-16
2) our unbelief ( jesus could not do Many miracles because of their harden heart and unbelief)
3) Our blind eye ( we don't avoid or cut our relationship with a bad CHRISTIAN,,) towards a bad companionship,
E) IF FOD DOESN'T COMFORT TOU WITH A BIBLE VERSE ,,,WE CAN NOT KEEP IT AS OUR POSSESSION,,
Invite shames to you  Before( you ) expecting a miracle we forget brotherhood and PRAYERS ( God will be glorified amongst brothers and church ,)
So tell your problems to the congregations MEDIAS ,people or governments,( but miracle is God's 😁😉😁)( In any situation what we can do we must should do it  never expect God to do what you should do)( Honour God respect God )
But life is God 
For example 
Lazarus death 
The news reached Jesus ( this means to prayer  and brotherhood )
Rolling down of the stone Take away the stone ( take off the grave clothes) John Gospel chapter 11;39 and 45 
Untie the bandages,,
For example
We got some shops in the middle of a city here ,
But managing to keep it with respect as a owner is very difficult,
But God comforted me with a verse 1 corinthians 1:-31
This shops to us are from our hindu ancestors so though God is helping us to keep it but we get lot of insults ,
Every time when I get a problem I pray God and go according to his counsel,,,
29 so that no one may boast before him.(BG) 30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus,(BH) who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness,(BI) holiness(BJ) and redemption.(BK) 31 Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”[d](BL)
So what 1 john 2:-16 
Says about not to love 
Lusts of the eyes ( because people or enemies watch it make it a issue as sin ,this we must be careful everytime at home and outside holy ,it means do not love sights ,do not turn back and see ,do not listen to what they speak even,)
Lusts of flesh 
Pride of life ( insults)
You must know that there are TEMPTATIONS common to all men ( PAUL TO CORINTHIANS ABOUT SINS OF ISRAELITES IN WILDERNESS,)
F) 
NEVER FORGET ALK ARE SINNERS
ECCLESIASTES 7
G) ALWAYS KNOW BA FACE OUR LIFE IS ETERNAL
NOT IN THIS EARTH,,
BUT HERE TOO GOD CAN RAISE HONOUR YOUR HEAD ,
Philippines 4:-8
Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things.

Governors should not be deciding for everyone because lets be honest you can have more individuals in support of abortion, or gun laws, or whatever at the state level. However, gerrymandering can allow a republican like Ron Desantis to win and hence a enacting laws that the majority of the people do not want. All the republicans from the top down for decades have been passing these gerrymandered voting maps. I have never seen a more maniacally unfair, cheating, dishonest, group of so called Christians in my life."
It has always been evil to kill babies. Women’s rights? The unborn babies also have rights. They have the right to live. Jesus is king. Jesus will have the victory at the end.
"Abortion is wrong. Abortion is murder.
Anything I can do to help make ALL abortion illegal in EVERY state, I will do.  This is worth fighting for."
It's a slap in the face to all society that Nancy pelosi's husband put people's lives in danger because he chose to drink and drive. This woman needs to go hide in a hole and never come out
Yet these hypocrites didn't want the rest of the world to have bodily autonomy with their vaccines
"Onlyfans, instagram, ticktock, twiter """" models """" and cheating wifes are not longer able to hide their irresponsible acts aborting innocent lives. What a shame... They cant keep selling their bodies on social media or hide their affairs to their husbands.. Now they have to be very very carefully.
We finally coming to sense in earth with what we doing. I am happy this has happened 👌🏼👍🏼"
"How long has murder become a right?
Fuck feminism."
I am so happy I don’t live in america….
ban pride and save peoples brain cells
"I come from a ex communist country where abortions were banned for years. I tell you this, many women have died, many children were left in the dumbster and nobody was happy about that. If in my country you try to ban it against all the people would go to the streets, no exceptions."
"Run these slaughter houses out of your states! They are responsible for 60,000,000 black babies deaths since 1973. F ROE!"

Constitutional right to kill their offspring. Poor pitiful bunch of feminazi’s might have to go back in the closet. I call that a breath of fresh air. Poor babies. Maybe they might decide to plan having a child rather then use abortion for birth control. Sick bunch of miss guided minds.
Sadly it was only 11 😔

The capital was overrun with legislators trapped inside. But that's ok right?"
Murdering your own child is NOT a constitutional right.
Here comes  the next migration to free states.
Why ban abortion? I dont get it
"A question for everyone who supports abortion - what is the fault of the child and the generations that are killed??  Is their fault their weakness and inability to defend themselves??  If you do not want the child, there are those who dream about this child that you are killing, make other families adopt him instead of killing him, or not carry him in the first place!!!"
There will be restoration of truths to America.  God  listens to His people. Unbelievers don't   understand. Everywhere there is life shows proof of God. Open your eyes!
"Will banning abortion, stop it? Or will women turn to unsavory and unsanitary methods?  Is there FREE sterilisation or birth control methods in America? How about trying to prevent or reduce  the need for killing first?"
"What does abortion ban mean to men?
-End of financial freedom"
"Oh cool, Texas banned abortion 😎"
Who cares it's not like the massive grotesque land whales that typically demand the right to murder children are ever going to get fertilized 🤢reeeeeeee reeeeeeeee
Seriously what good are any of these democrats? They let this happen on THEIR watch! Starting to think these people suck and they have no plan!
"Those maniac MAGAts are using facial recognition software to capture faces and software that checks all social media for matches ?

       I think We should all , always wear masks , those Dark Web sites are screaming about ""aborting"" US , again ....."
i think i know why they did it. i had nothing to do with abortion. it has all to to with getting the house and senate back. since they cant win in a fair election they banned abortion so democrats in swingstates will move out of it to a democrat state. therefor that state will become red again. they get more votes and more power that way. its a long run process but i think thats there endplay. maybe look into that CNN. just an opinion of me.

Its not a constitutional right. Show us where it says that in the constitution
Abortions is evil only the devil's children get abortions
I just want to know who's going to take care of all these unwanted children it's going to happen and it's not going to be far away is the supreme Court going to step up or is this just going to be orphanages like they're used to be all over the state's
Next: prohibition of all contraceptives… Mark my words… there‘s only a very thin line left between the conservatives and the taliban…
It is not a constitutional right! All states should ban abortion!!
Finally no more kill babes
Abortion is just like inviting someone over to your house and then killing them.

This is an easily win a bow argument for Democrats you propose abortion and you play some limits on it that’s it give it a timeframe that’s all you gotta do it’s not hard it’s not complicated you come up with a time frame. Don’t make it indefinite but you can include the rate for a woman to have an abortion can you set an limit a date within the pregnancy. Once they do that you presented as the federal standard you wish to employ in every Democrat should get behind it even if you want more you say I can agree with this. After that you ask the Republicans for their standard because most Americans believe a woman should have the right to an abortion. If you can present some argument and then ask your competitor 2% there and it’s fractured at best you can win votes
JUST GO AND VOTE IN MASSIVE NUMBERS. #voteblue
"as a man, i never knew that there was such widespread hatred and disrespect for women....i mean the religious right hates women more than they even hate minorities...wow!"

"Here is something the Evangelicals can really sink their teeth in to. They believe that a human life begins at conception. If that is so and it is also so that every person has a soul then every conception has a soul. It is a scientific fact ( look it up ) that in the  normal course of human reproduction approximately 74% of conceptions  do not survive to become a full term baby. For Evangelicals then in heaven 74% of the souls there will have never had a life. They instead were conceived, died and then just moved into heaven. For the Evangelicals and now for the rest of us based on the SCOTUS decision for every million souls in heaven 750,000 will have never had a consciousness in life. To everyone but Evangelicals that concept is absurd."

Pro-choice woman: I demand to be able to cut up my unborn baby in my womb and and have the pieces taken out with special tools. The head must be cut in three pieces in order to exit the uterus. I demand this!   and also I demand that good people can not have guns.
Awesome!!!!  Let's get it to 50-50 states.  Murder should not be legalized in any nation!!!
"People who were given the bless of life by their mothers, now they are against giving life to others innocents babies, because for them it represents a big business. Those are the supporters of  the modern Auschwitz holocaust of babies. 60 millions of innocents have been killed in this terrible holocaust..Killing have been defined as “choice” or “rights” to support that business. It happens when a society reaches a deeper bottom of sin and evilness.. And this society will be judged by God🥲.."

"It should be more than just one woman who chooses whether to end a life or not. Abortion shouldn't be outright banned, but it should be a community decision, not one based on women's liberty. What about the rights of the father and grandparents? A woman's body is her own to decide upon, but a child's life isn't! Women are free to decide whether or not they get pregnant. That's already far more freedom than a father gets. There are plenty of preventative measures out there to make that choice easy enough.

I do believe in a woman's right to decide, but too many women use this right irresponsibly and selfishly."

"From another post > I'm not pro-murdering babies.
I'm pro-Becky who found out at her 20-week anatomy scan that the infant she had been so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organs.
I'm pro-Susan who was sexually assaulted on her way home from work, only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later.
I'm pro-Theresa who haemorrhaged due to a placental abruption, causing her parents, spouse, and children to have to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or her unborn child.
I'm pro-little Cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11-year-old body isn't mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal.
I'm pro-Melissa who's working two jobs just to make ends meet and has to choose between bringing another child into poverty or feeding the children she already has because her spouse walked out on her.
I'm pro-Brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially, emotionally, or physically able to raise a child.
I'm pro-Emily who went through IVF, ending up with SIX viable implanted eggs requiring selective reduction to ensure the safety of her and a SAFE number of foetuses.
I'm pro-Jessica who is FINALLY getting the strength to get away from her physically abusive spouse only to find out that she is carrying the monster's child.
I'm pro-Vanessa who went into her confirmation appointment after YEARS of trying to conceive only to hear silence where there should be a heartbeat.
I'm pro-Lindsay who lost her virginity in her sophomore year with a broken condom and now has to choose whether to be a teenage mom or just a teenager.
I'm pro-Courtney who just found out she's already 13 weeks along, but the egg never made it out of her fallopian tube so either she terminates the pregnancy or risks dying from internal bleeding.
You can argue and say that I'm pro-choice all you want, but the truth is:
I'm pro-life.
Their lives.
Women's lives.
You don't get to pick and choose which scenarios should be accepted. It's not about which stories you don't agree with. It's about fighting for the women in the stories that you do agree with and the CHOICE that was made.
Women's rights are meant to protect ALL women, regardless of their situation!
Overturning Roe does not stop abortions, it stops SAFE abortions! 
Abortion is healthcare.....feel free to share !"

"National healthcare would solve the insurance crises in the US. Everyone including pregnant women and children born in poverty deserve healthcare.

Walmart and many businesses do not give employees a 40 hour work week just to avoid paying for or offering insurance."
What rights have women lost? These ppl are clowns. Women still have rights. You just can't end the life of a baby. Do these clowns not own a Constitution? Where does it say you have the right to end the life of a baby? The Constitution says not to deprive a person of life.
A womb is not the safest place to be. These men think it's a walk in the park. What a horror show. I'm so ashamed... I served this country...my guns have more rights.

"Reading through the comment section, I realize how uneducated and brainwashed CNN viewers are."

How about using contraception and woman being responsible with their bodies???
40% of the black community in America is eliminated through abortion
Karma is always rady 🤫
This is not the Democratic government I grew in this country slowly this country is. Becoming a dictatorship. I so frightened if A redumplican takes over .Its so scary.
People who believe for birth rights you have that always the right to have an abortion has been taken away.that's Not right..
Well abortion is a murder and I'm not religious. Women should not be able to kill their children when they're least protected and face little consequences.
"So please explain....  if the voters go back to this and try and vote it back in. the SOCUS is lifetime and they can over turn it again even if 100% of the people vote it back in.... There is only one way this will change. If the bad apples on the supreme court somehow mysteriously die, then maybe this can be fixed.....Just say'in what everybody is thinking"
Jesus...I never think that US population goes into that bad situation..
Banning abortion will increase the chance of child abuse.
I hope they start killing lawmakers over this...they did it to abortion doctors and bombed clinics when it was legal...So what good for the goose...........
Now if a woman get raped and get pregnant she can't abort. US is a joke 🤣

Stop fucking!
Just think about how young some of these justices are. They are definitely not going to retire until republicans are in a position to nominate and affirm another conservative. Unless one is assonated (god please don’t let that happen) then it could be decades before dens got control of court back. Scary to think about.
There sure is a lot of crying from so many people who have claimed to love our democracy until RVW is thrown back into democracy from federal authoritarian rule
50 years of babys not being killed :).
"The courts not conservative.Their blocking 100 years of medical care.Some are sick deformed , incest and rape victims.Its very personal.often tragic."
"So, let me understand, law enforcement who can barely keep up with the number of murders, rapes, home invasions, robberies and cybercrimes are now going to add abortion to their job description? Good luck with that."
These 11 that past this law. Well done. Because the Lord Jesus doesn't love killing at all. Well done. All the states should do this. Because people are wicked killing off so much babies. The Lord Jesus is going to get everyone that abort a baby..
We won 😃
"This new development should teach us many things. First, both men and women need to be responsible when they interact with women. Secondly, STOP voting for politicians that don’t have your interest."
Poor American people have lost two basic human rights: The right to LIVE (by repeated massive gun killing) & The right to ABORT (by supreme judges who made their decision based on POLITIC i/o LAW) . What a DIPLOMATIC country.

Then they came for gay marriage and 'sodomy', but I said nothing because I wasn't gay.

But then they came for contraceptives, and now I can't have sex before I want children, which basically means no sex before marriage.

Wait, hang, on, this feels like a theocracy..."

We must all stand up to have our voices heard in order to protect our nation from the further degradation of civil rights protections we have worked so hard to secure. We the People who cares about Abortion and Gay Rights need to register and mobilize voters in what will be the most critical midterm election America has ever faced. If you're not registered to vote or know someone who isn't, now is the moment. This is no time for anyone to sit on the sidelines."" Now is the time for all current and former Dems Politicians, Celebrity Allies, Business Owners and organizations to hold RALLIES and TOWNHALL MEETINGS every weekends in Poor White, Latino, Black and Asians Rural Counties to educate voters on how Dems Policies are improving their livelihood. This will help get Dems Voters Motivate to vote in 2022. So Dems can keep control of the US House and WIN a SUPER MAJORITY in the US Senate with 61 Dems Senators. This is the only way for Dems to pass meaningful Police and Criminal Justice Reforms, Voting Rights, Comprehensive Immigration, Economy, Abortion, Gay Rights and Gun Control."
I bet any money people will move out of these states
"LIES, LIES, LIES:  Dear Mr. Biden, on 6-22-22, I was watching news and there you were on TV, lying about how the Ukraine ""war"" was responsible for the high gasoline prices in the U. S.  Apparently, you actually, expect the public to believe that lie.  What you left out of your lying rhetoric was how you came to that conclusion.  Maybe you can explain just how in the hell, the Ukraine conflict could possibly have an effect on the price of gasoline in the United States  of America, especially since the U. S. is completely self-sufficient in oil production and independent of foreign oil.  Let's get this out in the open so that the American people can learn how just you make things up, as you go along, whatever suits you, like for instance, ""the Russians are invading"", the words that was responsible for getting things stirred up in Ukraine, and which has got us to where we are now in Ukraine.  Such as you stockpiling that drug crazy friend of yours with enough weapons to destroy Ukraine, which he is doing little by little and blaming it on Russia.  Today, it just so happens that I feel like strolling down memory lane.  Lets see now, in order to make Americans forget about all of your fuck-ups, you started with your lying rhetoric about how the ""RUSSIANS ARE INVADING"", (yet you did not start any sanctions against Russia) when all the Russians were doing was postering at the Ukraine border.  In fact, you did not start sanctions against Russia until you used the peaceful incursion of Russia into Ukraine as an excuse to start sanctions.  Then you kept up the rhetoric until NATO, EU, and your drug crazy friend, Zelensky got on board with your lying rhetoric about Russia invading.  Then your drug crazy friend decided to go a step further by telling the Ukraine population that the ""RUSSIANS ARE INVADING, AND COMING TO KILL THEM"", which started their scramble to flee that possibility.  Then your drug crazy friend decided to take things even a step further by starting to bomb Ukraine and blaming it on Russia.  Evidence of Zelensky doing the bombing was submitted to you, congress, senate, NATO, and EU. yet none of you acted on that evidence, and allowed Zelensky to continue with his rhetoric and bombing, because he is doing exactly what you want him to do, which is to smear Putin, because you hate and fear him so much. If it was not for your words, ""THE RUSSIANS ARE INVADING, of which NATO, EU, and Zelensky picked up on, there would not be any destruction in Ukraine or people fleeing their country.  So Mr. Biden, whether you like it or believe it or not, you are solely and directly responsible for the Ukraine conflict, which history will eventually show.  What a legacy you are going to leave behind.  First, Palestine, then Afghanistan, now the Texas border and Ukraine. After the Supreme Court decision today to kill Roe v Wade, you can also add abortion to your fucked-up legacy, because you could have prevented it by adding three more justices to the court.  It was a conscious effort on your part to not add the three justices to the court because that would mean that the court would then be ruling in favor of the democrats, and you being a republican in sheep's clothing posing as a democrat, could not allow that. Today being 6-25-22, one day after the devastating earthquake,there is help from the  U.N. AND INTERNATIONAL AND LOCAL CHARITIES, AS WELL AS THE TALIBAN GOVT.  Where is the help from the U. S. to the people you deserted and left to the mercy of the Taliban. Does your hate for the Afghans still linger so much that you refuse them aid and instead help with a worthless war in Ukraine?  God, what a legacy.  Also, you, congress, and the senate were provided with evidence that the U. S. is entirely self-sufficient in oil production and is independent of any foreign oil.  In fact, the evidence shows that the U. S. exports 7 million more barrels a day than it produces.  How is that possible?  Is someone dipping into the reserves?  That being said, then how can what happens in Ukraine or anyplace else in the world possibly affect the price of gasoline in the U. S.?  To make matters even worse, you actually believe what the lying crooked oil companies are saying about being unable refine enough oil to keep-up with demand.  Do you really believe that, even if they could, that they would be producing enough oil to reduce the price of oil?  What, the hell are you thinking?  Make them prove it to you.  Do you actually expect them to tell you the truth about anything?  I can't believe that even you and the dummy congress can be that naive.  So, all of you people out there in Facebook land, if you don't like what is going on at the gas pump, then get on these peoples case, and demand action.  Also, Mr. Biden, it becomes more and more apparent that you ran for president on a false ticket, by claiming that you were a democrat, when in all actually, you are a republican in sheep's clothing.  All of your actions point to that being the case.  So far, everything that you have done has been contrary to the democratic party and has favored the GOP.  In fact, once you stop and think about it, the same thing can be said about Vice president Harris and the supposedly democratic congress and senate.  So far, none of you have acted democratically.  I believe that I can provide an answer for your actions.  If you performed as democrats, then it would mean that you would be risking your lives by crossing trump, and his crazy zealots and the insane and dangerous GOP and of course the president, because he has already shown where his allegiance lays.  Therefore, I guess you poor guys are in a predicament, aren't you?  Your damned if you act like a democrat, and history will frown on you if you don't.  Personally I would not want my children or grandchildren to remember me failing my country due to cowardice.  As far as you are concerned Harris, because of your hate for Biden, you have become the most inefficient vice president in history.  The same can be said about the U. S. congress.  Do we even have a democratic govt. any longer?        Just, voicing the truth. 6-25-22.  CC:  Biden, Harris, Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff. CNN."
"Bottom line; Roe/Wade was bad law. There is nothing in the Constitution that supports it. Overturning R/W was not about abortion. It was about the law. The Court did not ban abortion or make it illegal. In 1973 when the Court said that it was a Constitutional right. They were wrong. Nothing in the Constitution gives that right. No. What the Constitution does say is we ""Have the right to life liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"". Key word here is ""LIFE"""
Shame shame shame shame shame on all those who have taken away women's rights
The State compelling women to be baby bearing slaves is barred under the 13th amendment.   This decision also violates the establishment clause by making the Catholic faith of SCOTUS justices the law of the land.  Time to remove the power of constitutional review from SCOTUS.   Congress can do this simply through amendment of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and limiting SCOTUS jurisdiction to those legal issues as defined in in the Constitution.   There is no constitutional authority for SCOTUS to adjudge the constitutionality of laws passed by Congress.  This type of judicial review was an invention of John Marshall in Marbury v. Madison and it is without foundation in the Constitution.
"He's right the womb is the safest place for a child in Oklahoma. Once they're born his government puts their lives at risk. Oklahoma ranks 46th in insured children, 45th in education, 45th in child poverty and 44th in child well-being."
"5 religious extremists are Holding this country hostage. As a first generation American I thought we were safe from religion, especially in 2022, god isn’t even a thing, how are we changing real live law based on a made-up invisible man? Religious extremists making the rules is something I thought I’d only see places like Afghanistan do this"
"Roe v Wade and abortion rights are not the same thing.  
It just means that abortions are taken care of at a state level instead of a federal level.  
Keep in mind the the reason this is happening is because a woman abused a federal law to force a man to financially take care of her and her child while he wasn’t the biological father."
"""Freedom and Democracy for all!""... LOL.  The Taliban took back Afghanistan, now it looks like they've taken over the U.S. as well."
Anti-abortion but pro-mass-shootings 🤦‍♂️
"Leave those states, reducing their population reduced the sits in the congress and their power in the government, we need workers in our democratic states, better paid and with better laws, more human more safe."
Lie one CNN. Abortion was never ever a constitutional right. Show me where it says killing a child in the whom is a right and I will show you where it Says I can keep my AR 15 to protect my baby from any harm……
IL gonna make that $$$
"Last year, I posted: 
""Those who call themselves Pro-life believe a human life begins at conception.  And those who are Pro-choice believe a non-viable fetus is not yet a human life.  The only resolution would seem to be complete control over conception, so that only intentional pregnancies occur.   Can we just agree that, until control over conception is a medical certainty, this will remain an insoluble issue?  Until then, this will requires tolerance and respect from both sides.  We have a moral obligation to do all we can to prevent unwanted pregnancy.   Yet we must not chastise those who face such a personal choice.  I do not believe anyone has the right to force a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term.  Pro-life beliefs should be respected; but their beliefs cannot supersede the rights of the pregnant woman herself, prior to fetal viability, that is.  For now, the Roe decision on using a viability limit to govern abortion is the best compromise available to balance the rights of all concerned...for now....""  
And now, we are proudly marching into a past that was never as good as their selective memory recalls. 

God help us."
Is it a crime against human beings or a women right like how .... This prouves that the western ppl are running from the responsabilities even as parents
TRUMP DID ALL THIS .......
"Government intrusion into women's privacy and reproductive
healthcare (at the behest of the GOP) is just the beginning. Other
shoes will soon drop as SCOTUS justice Thomas made clear,
birth control availability and means are now on the chopping block."
Good job SCOTUS!
Good
Facing the global energy crisis! Oil dried up! The best way is to produce hydrogen energy and build hydrogen refueling stations!
Found the movement it seems in America by hundreds of thousands of women and by the Democratic party is the fight for men not to wear a condom and it's not teaching women how to use other contraceptives maybe because the Democratic party thinks women are too stupid morons and they will not comprehend the use of other contraceptives besides abortion on the other hand the Republican party is telling them to put on the condom and use contraceptives and not to use abortion as one
"Yes. Crushing a babies skull, ripping off it’s little legs and arms while it is still in the womb, and then throwing the bloody body parts in the dumpster, IS healthcare.   
Oh, and sometimes the baby survives, and you don’t want to know what kind of healthcare they give it then!!
lol"
I strongly advise any woman who does not want to have a baby should not get pregnant.
Abortion is NOT a constitutional right. Show me where in the constitution is says that?
You will now see an exodus out of those states.  This will also discourage people from moving into those states.
It’s mistake then it’s a mistake .. who we  are to tell women what to do with they own body .. that’s so crazy controlling …
They won't mention religion because that would hurt their business.
abortion only increase taxes .
tell the lefties to move to california... where taxes are always increasing.
Lol accountability.
It's a good thing liberal woman have penises
"Taking bets on how, and how often, Sock Puppet Joe will embarrass the US on his European field trip."
Vote out republicans now!
Thank God 🙏 🕊 ♥
The 2000 MULES caused the Biden Administration. Now you have to pay the gas bill. Find out who they are.
"Wow, great time for the ones who were screaming my body my choice about a fking shot"
"So if abortion is not a constitutional right can we make it one?  I think that would be something that can be successful.  The fact is many anti abortion people are only anti abortion because of their local culture but they quietly support it, they will vote for it in private."
When does my body my rights no longer exist???? The minute the baby comes out?? Seconds before the baby comes out??? Weeks?? Months??? Can you kill your child anytime because they came from your body at one point???? So when you get an ultrasound and see the babies fingers you still have no issue having an abortion???? I understand why abortions should be allowed for certain reasons but just confused how people are not realizing they are killing a baby...\
"Bottom line is: If a woman tells another individual she is pregnant, expecting a baby, the response should be, congratulations, you should have the baby, you'd be a mother!! Not: You should abort. 
Beyond that, basic, example without further explanation, it is important to understand the variables, if the individual suggests they are not going to deliver the baby or carry full term. It is not an easy solution, the same exact for every individual experience. 
Thereby, in some instances, people are going to do, at times what they themselves may be inclined to do. 
In addition, it is important to understand a miscarriage is NOT the same thing as an abortion. Women do lose babies by miscarriage, that decipherable by the course of the pregnancy. It seemed one discussion was trying to imply connection between losing a baby and aborting a baby. Two very different experiences, typically though BOTH are VERY emotionally upsetting and leave years of anguish, sorrow, regret, wonder, sadness, etc. Becoming a mother, giving up a child for adoption or any such other experience is usually of serious impact, as a human connection, if the individual has a heart, a soul, emotions. It is not a (light) decision. It is serious and personal. Moms who have had children, a child usually love their children, child and are happy of having had them. Thus if a person has news of pregnancy, try to encourage and be supportive. Yet, understand that the experience is complex, the physicians may or may not know more in regards to the womb and the delivery and that personal opinion is absolutely best in regards to personal decision and as a recommendation, guidance."
More and more people will have a vasectomy now.
Must be the family friendly states .
"Imagine living in a world where people are driven to hysteria and violence at the prospect that babies might be allowed to live . Welcome to, the TWILIGHT ZONE  .😶😶"
"This isn't just a ""slap in the face"", this  will be used as a precedent to take even more rights as fast as possible!!!"
Soon the United States Supreme Court will go after contraceptive rights and gay marriage and then free speech and then take away all opposition.
The man should be prosecuted for jerking off
"Guns in NY, and abortion overruled. Just distractions by the right to get Americans to turn away from the 6th hearings."
Children life mater.
What’s the point of a panel discussion where everyone on the panel has the same point of view?
Thank you Trump ❤️👶🏻🫀Children are greatfull!! Trump for life 🙌🏻
"There is so much time, that goes into talking about, discussing topics, nearly, EVERY topic, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. It seriously seems amazing that people do not become tired of talking about stuff, repeatedly, repeatedly."
VOTE. Vote in the name of every native American that aren’t allowed to vote. STILL in 2022. There are tribes that never got the right to vote. 2024 marks the 100 year anniversary of the Indian citizenship act. But some states still don’t count some tribes as part of that act. Tribes like the 16 Comanche tribes. Who never surrendered. Arizona flipped last election. Because the Navajo stepped up and used their right to vote. Some tribes don’t even realize they too can vote. Others refuse out of distrust for the left and right. Churches don’t pay taxes. But they still are allowed to vote.
Cnn telling lies again. Abortion was never a Constitutional Right.
All this because many Democrats decided to sit out the 2016 election because their guy didn’t get the nomination. Hopefully those people learned the error of their ways and moving forward I only hope those people also learned that elections have consequences. Boy did we pay a horrible price for it as a result of their stupidity.
There appears to be broad public support to ban abortions in multiple states
"🤣🤣🤣🤣 this empty-headed female really just said ""medication through the mail.""  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  abortion pills simply do not fit the definition of the word 'medication'"
As it is their DEMOCRATIC RIGHT. Don't like it? Move.
Good
Is this taliban? Or usa?
Lies.constitution never give that right
#ArrestDonaldTrump 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
"I think that if the baby is black,abortion should be legal!!!!"
I'm sure babies and mothers feel a lot safer now. All medical expenses related to pregnancy and childbirth will be covered by universal healthcare. And children's living expenses will be paid for by the big government that promised to protect every child. Thank you to the Supreme Court for helping the quality of life for children in the 4th trimester and beyond.
"This is disgusting, women should choose not the state, what happened to freedom"
CNN I though everyone is against the ruling but in all these comments I see that everyone is happy with the ruling
"sooooo those who shout ADOPTION...are they going to adopt these unwanted, unloved children?? have they done so already and can't take anymore children in??? I asked my former classmate who uses her Christianity as a weapon..3 days later and my fbf want an answer"
Black markets arise in 11 States as well.
As an unwanted child whose mom only had me because of religious beliefs due to let’s just say “lackluster parenting” I’ve been passed through the system for a while. Why don’t the ones who push for abortion bans/restrictions help fix some of the underlying problems first so us mistakes don’t have to live in the current broken system that is cps after being born? My time in cps hasn’t been super fun but my experiences don’t speak for everyone and most workers mean well; I used to despise the idea of abortion too but with so many kids like me who go down the wrong path because they never had proper structure and stability in their lives needed to flourish abortion might just be for the best yk?
"The way these people are freaking out, I really have to ask the question: How many times a month are these women getting pregnant!? 🤣 This makes no sense!"
"It is called the will of the majority. That is what the PEOPLE in those states wants. I doubt that California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, NY, NJ, New England states will follow suit, so abortion is still available in the US and legal in those states. That is what the  PEOPLE want it. States rights!"
So sad!!! Now these republicans need to adopt all these unwanted children!!!
God is fighting for the unborn good luck murderers!
They can take a trip and get one else where.
Only 11? Keep it coming. It will be a glorious day when it’s illegal countrywide. We all know the lunatics in New York and California will never let their love for killing unborn children go away. 48/50 is good for me.
Mommy stop killing me give me a chance!
If those 66% of Americans who do not wish to see abortion bands vote for Democrats to win the senate they can secure abortion is legal.
"I don’t think there exists a more morally bankrupt political organization anywhere in the western world than the GOP. 
Fascist Autocracy at its finest."
"Clarence Thomas (and Mitch McConnell) might consider that, like abortion, neither is interracial marriage Constitutionally protected. Only since 1967."
These forced breeding bills is just pure insane and completely unconstitutional.
The Republicans Strike Back
The Republicans Strike Back
never visiting or doing business with a red state
I don't understand how so many people who doesn't care how people walk around as if  nothing is wrong people are so worried about other people and no one can help them no one see nothing wrong with that picture right now let us save the lives of the children who are her ect. And try to save our lives and get them to Act and make life easier and more affordable and more liveable we need them to Lower the cost of living food gas rent everything else and keep something high but not that high and make things low that can be low Amen and let what can be free be free I know we have time but exp(if you standing outside and someone approached you to bless you are you going to say no thank you or come back later Amen so today is always a good day
God bless Donald J Trump
Great news!
America has not freedom.
W America
And in Breaking News… Republicans are to phase out the Elephant icon and replace it with a Foot and Crosshairs!
Don't date anyone that doesn't believe in women's rights. Don't live in states that believe women have the right to autonomy. And look how fast they can act. No ability when babies are murdered. That's murky and shouldn't be political but stripping right back to 1898 is all good. No more pretending this is a matter of political differences. Authoritarianism vs Democratic Republic  and if white folks are willing to murder each other what can the rest of us really expect 🤔 😒 🙄
There are Government programs to help the moms out there like free health care and Welfare Programs
"Get your tubes tied. It’s cheap, painless, reversible and there’s no need to murder a baby and go to hell."
"It's amazing how CNN can just lie to everyone and morons eat it up. Think for yourself, know what the truth really is  or shut the f#@k up."
Republicans just want to be able to rape women and not be responsible for the child they create
Hmmmm… I wonder what constitutional rights the democrats will take away now. Republicans opened Pandora’s box.
These red states are used to having inbred people nothing new...
"Whats next, same sex marriges, votes for women or the return of jim crow segregation. Crazy usa."
why are they not trying to prove that abortion is a constitutional right? 🤔
I blame democrats for this! I tried to tell anyone I came in contact with before the 2016 election that Roe v Wade and Obamacare was on the ballet because the positions that Mitch was holding up and justice Ginsburg heath but to many made excuses to why they couldn’t vote for Hillary! Now we all will have to suffer for their stupidity!
Once the government successfully  eliminates a right you would think they would be satisfied. But they are not. They keep going. Look for more limits on your rights with no end in sight.
"woman: he had sex so he has to take responsibility for the cild and pay 20yrs of support.
woman: just because i had sex doesn't mean i want a child. i have a right to kill it with abortion."
Its a distraction from whats really happening - people won't afford food and water that ARE surviving right now. Bidens up to the plate to answer to that one. The lefties will take more of your tax dollar soon too.
AR-15 need to be banned before we talk about abortion...
Abortion is murder.  Cheers!
White supremacists are infiltrating all levels of government from local school councils to state and federal congresses.  They plan to overturn future elections and create a dictatorship. Mary Miller of Illinois is one of them. Majorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert are too. Vote against them in November 2022 and 2024.
Yes to life!
Those numbers aren’t correct.
There 50 States. This is BS
God wins! Save the babies ❤️❤️
Unfortunately that 60+% in favor of Roe v Wade are concentrated in blue states.
I support abortion until a child is able to become self-aware. Until that point the child is no different than an animal. Disagree and you are a pro choice hypocritical monster
If Roe is on the ballot I guess I'll be voting red
"Garland just keeps gnashing his teeth!! 😅🤣
Thank you RBG and President Trump!!!!"
"""the constitutional right to abortion"" says the cnn snowflake.
There is no right to abortion in the constitution. Abortion and constitution are two words that should never be in the same sentence."
You don't have the right to murder your own baby.
If you can cross state lines to get an abortion then you should be able to cross state lines to buy a gun also. Just saying you can't have one and not the other And it's hilarious when  The shoe is on the other foot
Women can we agree that you stop sleeping with men that are uneducated and can't afford to raise the kids. this way you screw over all the losers that voted for this. cause you know they are all broke af with no talent and just want to make you a single mom. it's 2022 stop sleeping with broke people to show you are in control of your body then watch them change the law back asap.
"the supreme court has no constitutional power to overturn laws on the basis of their constitutionality (judicial review), so let the democratic states make laws outlawing the possession of firearms by private citizens who are not part of a ""well regulated militia"".

Evangelical America - using the Handmaids Tale as a blueprint since 2022
"""Abortion"" never was a ""constitutional right""."
"11 out of 50 - that leaves 39 States to have an abortion and in the future the issue will go to the ballot boxes - so the issue is not settled- so dumb!
Speculation and assumptions!"
Women who have misscariages early in their pregnancy or late will be suspect to criminal charges in some of these states and it will be hard to prove ones innocence. Anyone that doubts that this will happen only need to google. It has already happened before even when Roe vs Wade was the law of the land.
Throw in war and pestilence and it's basically the dark ages
"In Oklahoma if you are a victim of rape, incest, or your life is put in danger from the pregnancy you can still have an abortion. They forgot to report that."
good lmao
"""Conservatives"" can celebrate that they got what they wanted via hypocrisy, stealing, cheating, lying, perjury - there was a complete abdication of ethics & morals in obtaining this (temporary) ""victory"". Minority rule is the road to fascism & should not be tolerated."

"Those who would sacrifice liberty for lower gas prices, will get neither - apologies to Ben F."
Abortion is the red herring!
"Dang it, now me and my girlfriend can't go on our cruise next month... how dare they make abortions illegal"
"1:37 someone needs to tell mrs pelosi that the ladies that are carrying the children didn’t just spontaneously get pregnant. I personally think it’s not real fair to the dads that DO want something to do with their children, that they have NO say in wether an abortion should or should not happen. If someone can explain why the dads should have no say in this, I would love to here."
All about a woman’s right to play God!
I wish men had a right to choose they don’t we sure don’t have any reproductive rights and all over USA men are being kept from their children they love that they never hurt or anything forced to pay child support amount regardless of income or bills and food other children overhead prices medical costs no exception if a man can not see his children release him. A man should have some rights really men are parents to we do have a parental instinct and love our children as much as a woman can they are part of us as well it takes two to make one ya know imagine being happy overjoyed about a incoming child but the other parent decides not to go thru with it and you want the baby but have no legal right to fight to save it and regardless of your pleas they abort your child anyway.
Hallelujah
"To all those saying ""My body, my choice"", I am curious what you all think about suicide. If a person wants to end their own life, it is their body and their choice. Many people look down on those that commit suicide and call it selfish. Why? So it's ok to take another person's life (abortion) but not one's own?"
"Absolutely fantastic, these supporters of infanticide, yes, the brutal murder of the foetus (Latin for baby) that's right BABY, do not realise the Most High Creator of life, is going to hold them accountable!

Woe to them!"
"Well, thanks for the list of states in which women should avoid living, simple as that."
God please move against THESE EVIL VOICES THROUGHOUT CNN!
"We need to thanks the late judge Ginsburg for this mess. If politic is chess the democrats is playing checker, my god they are loser. I’m not a fan of conservative ideology but at least they deliver. Get your shit together liberals!!!"
And honestly certain medical abortions should be constitutional
It's a great day in America
I know it’s a big inconvenience but it saves lives good way to look at it
"California Governor Newsom said it right. Don't ever tell me America is the leader of the Free world. Half of American states have now embraced fascist totalitarianism. You  people make me sick. Autocratic, fascist, enslavement.  What I see is that America has just gone to war with itself. This will kill so many. Now I'm glad the second ammendment is in place. Fundamentalism has crossed the red line. 6 months and you'll be killing each other. More than you already were anyway. Once the consequences are felt. Once enough girls and women have died. I don't think any of you is prepared for what is about to happen.  One tiny example. The law abiding father whose student daughter gets raped... previously he would have let the law work while he dealt with an abortion. Now that dad will kill that rapist and anyone else that gets in his way. Another..m the career woman that dies after arranging to get the baby kicked out of her in a back alley. Leaves a daughter who hates men. Grows up bitter and twisted. Have fun with your dystopian reality while it lasts. I would say 9 - 18 months and it all starts sliding towards... possibly the end of America as a union. North and South at the very least. ☠ 🇬🇧"
"Suprem court my a**, conservative fools. These people turns everything back to the stone age."

Many people are not having children until  late 20s early 30s. So I have a conspiracy theory that another small reason is to get more people in the workforce to compete against china's superior work productivity.

Step 1 - Get rid of the Electoral College. Step 2 - make the Senate reflect population. Do these 2 things and the theocratic minority won't be able to do any of this again.
So can row v wade be reinstated?
I’m confused. All this talk of “women’s rights” from the same insufferable CLOWNS who are incapable of defining the word “woman”. 🤔
Sooo....are they coming for gay people next? And then bringing back slavery?  Tell me again....what is the difference between the U.S and Afghanistan?
There is 50+ states. Go pick one that supports your beliefs. Problem solved 👍
Dayum.
Mississippi banned Abortion
"It this doesn't get the indifferent majority to the polls, we deserve the fate of Afghanistan."
Is Clarence also ready to roll back the laws legalizing his inter-racial marriage or better yet women suffrage. That would really get the feminist camping around his gated subdivision.
The craziest thing is that they really think women will suddenly stop getting abortions. Being deluded by self righteousness is the worst.
I am a Canadian and I am a father of two beautiful daughters I would support each of them if they need it my support for an abortion I don't think it's the laws choice or decision to tell what a male and a female can do with their bodies what the Supreme Court has done to the American women is wrong and in a disgraceful
Bravo 👏
disgusting
"The unintended pregnancy problem is easy to solve:
*_1_* Sexually active tweens and teens must use contraceptives, must avoid alcohol and drugs at parties, and must avoid being and walking alone at night. This age group especially must be on the alert to avoid all situations where rape and incest may occur.
*_2_* Number (1) also applies to sexually active women over 20 and married ones. You can enjoy many sex acts without penile penetration of the vagina. Use several birth control methods; condoms are about 92% effective.
*_3_* The government must make any effort possible to end poverty by (1) lowering unemployment, (2) giving universal basic income (UBI) to poor people, and (3) making sure all women have a high school diploma. 💕☮🌎🌌"
"Good, only 39 states to go"
use  Birth control  also  condoms  work be responsible with you're body
God Wins
America is moving closer to Syariah law. Alhumdooolilahhhhh!!!
Women rights blabla yes all gone. Accept it and move on. Go to blue states or abroad to procure your abortions.
This hurts me so much. But the fight is no over we will get our right back.
It’s the states right ..
I'm voting progressive here on out no more democrats and Republicans are unless to us  the ppl
Thank you SCOTUS! Two back to back smackdowns for the Liberals. I LOVE IT. Drinking a diet coke to celebrate like Trump is probably doing HAHAHAH
Yes it is a slap in the face Pelosi so what??
Like I been saying this country should not be ran by old rich white ppl making laws they not going to fully see
Great job SCOTUS 👏 👍 👌 🙌 😀 💪 👏
Time to rewatch the first five minutes of Idiocracy
I like how people cry so much about the kids in uvalde but not for the kids that couldn’t even make it out of their “loving” mother before being ripped apart.
"These ignorant people believe judges are supposed to dictate all the nuanced rules on abortion which involve, whether teens can get medical procedures without informing or gaining parental permission, who will pay or provide them if legal, how late a baby can be aborted, what methods of abortion are acceptable (plyers, coat hangers, poisons, etc), who can perform them, exceptions for victims of rape and incest, child abuse, IVF clinics, what punishments will be for violations, etc. It is not the job of judges to dictate all these rules. The legislative branch writes the details of the law, the executive branch signs it into law, and the judicial branch is there to interpret the law in how it applies to various situations. This is civics 101, which they obviously don't teach in schools or everyone would understand this ruling is correctly placing power where it belongs"
"Are yall really that lazy where you wont put on a 5 dollar condom, but will have a 300 hundred dollar abortion?"
The right to abortion is not constitutional right - the right to parent IS a constitutional right
Abortion is not for convenience or a contraceptive. Stop crying and be responsible.

"They asked Joe Biden about this again today at the G7 summit and he said, ""Listen, folks...no joke.  No really.  I'm not joking.  The dem voters just need to accept that Roe is gone and probably not coming back.  I have no power to do anything.  Let's just move on and unify our people as a country.  There's no red America or blue America, there's only the United States of America.  Just let the country become full stop rightwingy, shooting down the gun laws with teeth, up in New York, and passing the weak paper tiger gun bills in congress and letting Roe get overturned...it's good because it unifies the country.  And don't forget to vote in November, not because the ruby red SCOTUS is middle aged and their Roe ruling will stand for the rest of the 21st century, but so the multimillionaires I go to Five Guys with for lunch every Friday can keep their inside trader privileges and advance stock shareholder information access.

"Is getting a vasectomy worth it?
Vasectomy is safer and cheaper than tubal ligation (blocking the fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy) in women. The one-time cost of a vasectomy may be cheaper over time than the cost of other birth control methods, such as condoms or medication. GUYS TAKE THE LEAD"
"Americans remember,
If you are loosing you’re right’s to free abortion. Remember.
This is the fault of the republicans.
Republicans are the enemy of the people. Republicans are to be ignored in the next election.
Republicans took away you’re right’s for safe and secure medical attention.
All American women whether republicans or Democrat, should remember in the coming elections that the republicans took that away from you. 
Americans just went fifty years in the past. All because a few people decided 
too take away what you’re mother and grand-mother add access easily and safely. Now what will you doo.
VOTE démocrate.
Fuck the Republican Party and send them a message.
Trump and his stooges Are nothing without you’re vote. 
Republicans are the ennemi."
"The best social revolution for equal opportunities in abortion, and also but above all to avoid traumatic abortions because of poverty, is PUTINE who did it respecting all the advice of UN specialists .
And who is it ? Who provoked the war in Kazakhstan which inevitably followed in UKRAINE? By agitating the idea that this social revolution for equal opportunities for children would be a return to communism??? He is the preacher whose vassals claim to defend Europe against the Communist invasion. Meanwhile friendly mothers do not seem to have had the information of this social revolution advised by UN specialists.
It's not communism, it's a pension for children and FUTURE children until the end of university studies. It's some, confederate Europe who wants to keep an injustice of chances in front of access to studies by money, don't like that. The so-called protectors of life don't like it and pay to prevent it. They said they would rather defend poor women's right to abort than give an annuity to poor women who would prefer to keep the baby if she could. They even dreamed of succeeding in pushing Russia to fire Putin, but all these CONS who talk about democracy for them and non-democracy for PUTIN do not have the same rate of acceptance by their people as him.
Biden is 70% who do not like him, Macron is less than 25% who voted for him.
The pension for the fetuses until the end of their school studies, without the parents being able to touch it from a certain age, is what all should do to solve all the concerns of injustice against the children of the fetus to studies. Violence against children...etc....Perhaps it will be necessary to improve but it is already very advanced towards better justice."
if you just check the list of countrys that ban abortion you see the us is in great company. thats the countrys you want join. fuck this modern free countrys.
The womb is not the safest place for a child to be! That’s why they are NOT BORN until they leave it doofus!
"So, a woman has the rights of ""personhood"" when she's a fetus, but not after being born."
Women have been stripped of their baby killing rights which should have never been rights at all.
"just a doubt: is this abortion ban based on ""Christian believes""? 
Because if that's the case overturning Roe vs Wade is illegal, since a judicial decision should NEVER be influenced by ANY religion. 
Because then you're doing the same as the Sharia in the Islam religion and culture."
This troll that's posting nonsense after every comment has a strategy and a purpose. It's to keep Americans from communicating with one another on YouTube. They fear our coming together.
Imagine getting rid of a constitutional RIGHT because you FEEL something isnt right but let this be about gun control and everyone starts losing there fucking minds
Your *NOT* going to be murdering any babies in my state.
"In my opinion, the SCOTUS Roe decision is literally going to cause the breakdown of many American families in Red States, Blue States, Purple States, and for US families throughout the world. If girls and women are jailed... How will their families, husbands, boyfriends, LGBTQ+ partners, single significant others, cope with the dilemma when they might have other children together? If, unfortunately a woman has a miscarriage... Will the police go Gestapo into people's homes to question and possibly arrest women... literally throwing them in jail? What about women who get pregnant within their fallopian tubes or through abnormal processes? Will these abnormal pregnancies health conditions fall within the state medical guidelines of concerns for the life of the girl/woman?"
Move to a blue state that still allows them.  Get ready to pay more taxes too to pay for all the ones who get it for free.
"Why didn't Dems secure it at any point in the last 50 years? They have to stop trusting Republicans. These Republicans are not trustworthy. They aren't even Republicans anymore, they are something else, radical power hungry control freaks that don't care about people is what they are now. We must take the gloves off and stop being nice and never trust one of them again. Fix this mess NOW. We can and should fight dirty too. I know it's not the civilized people we want to be, but to save our country from these terrorist traitors, we simply MUST."
"One need not be ""conservative"" to understand that Extraconstitutional matters are reserved for the States."
Praise God its good to see liberals and feminists being upset.

Condoms don’t exist on this network like natural immunity 🤣🤣🤣
"Didn't the Supreme Court recently rule that California can't impose ethical animal treatment laws on other states due to some B.S. about interstate business? So, if that's the case, Texas and all the other bible bumper states can't impose their bejesus will on the blue states. 

Something else to consider for women of childbearing years, what happens if you vacation in one of these states and have a miscarriage and they don't allow abortion to save your life? Check out the American in Malta that just experienced this scenario. Some of these states will hold you hostage to prove their point, and your life will be endangered.   I'm all for boycotting travel to any of these Christian Taliban states."
Dems need to freaking get in the game. They are playing checkers while republicans are playing GTA
"Looks like the USA is starting to go fully mediaeval. Damned if I'd want to live in a country where the only people with any right to freedom were heavily armed white male bigots, with everyone else being treated as barely human."
The majority ruled by a minority. This is not what America is supposed to be.
"I'm thankful it was there in 1980 when I was raped and am thankful that now I'm too old to get pregnant, but I'm devastated for all the women who will die because taking their own lives will be the option they feel they must choose or back alley abortions that go wrong. People don't matter to Republicans. Control and power matter. Voting for any Republican no matter how different you think they are, is a vote for losing our freedoms and rights and damaging our country. 

Michigan has a temporary injunction stopping the ban so for now, it's still legal."
"Now it's time to fix the foster system, hmm?"
There's no constitutional right to kill babies.  Thats fake news.
Where was that care about body autonomy when it came to being forced to take an experimental jab ?Hypocritical fools.
"Fake News. Judges are not supposed to write the laws. That is for the legislature, a separate body of government. They lament the ""ruling makes no exceptions for victims of rape and incest"". This shows laws on abortion are by necessity very nuanced and complex, and involve not just these issues but whether teens can get medical procedures without informing or gaining parental permission, who will pay or provide them if legal, how late a baby can be aborted, what methods of abortion are acceptable (plyers, coat hangers, poisons, etc), who can perform them, what punishments will be for violations, etc. It is not the job of judges to dictate all these rules. The legislatures job is to write the details of the law, the executive signs it into law, and the judicial system is there to interpret the law in how it applies to various situations."
no child policy for those below poverty and one child policy for those below median income.

Hmm, note to self: idea for abortion rifle. With the right advertising we'll have you all hunting them little critters by next year.

So so glad that the lunatics running our country aren't bible freaks as well!"

Not a constitutional right.
"Regardless of our opinions, abortion is now illegal.  People need to stop having irresponsible sex. There are more protective measures and access than ever before. Much more than when roe vs wade began. Let's start practicing safe sex or no sex. Feminists, pressure men to use male contraceptions."
"Women's rights used to be about equal pay and equal opportunity now it's about killing babies and letting males pretending to be women beat the crap out of woman.
 
It used to be about I am woman hear me roar now it's about I am woman let me hurt other women.

It's about destroying the hopes of millions of women so a few hundred men that couldn't compete with other men enjoy the status of being at the top of a women's sport.


Women would rather now see hundreds millions of other women's hopes and dreams be destroyed and let them be in misery instead of a of a few hundred males.
NOW THE OPPRESSORS OF WOMEN ARE WOMEN."
"My solution:

Women everywhere should stop having sex with men until Roe v Wade is codified"
how about women just stop opening their legs for every guy they meet eh??
"This SCOTUS is completely illegitimate as the cherry picking of privacy cases shows only too well. The idea that that we have to go back to the 1900s for Constitutional protection is in and of itself ridiculous. Their tortured logic is lazy, stupid and cruel. It's just an excuse to codify into law Fox News right wing  grievances. We are now acting more like Iran or Afghanistan in that a court of religious zealots are imposing their beliefs (of Christian America) without caring the least bit about human suffering or human dignity. America is supposed to have separation of church and state but nothing will stand in these horrible people's way. NO right is safe with this court. Even it this comes up again as Equal Protection, they will find a way to squirm out of it. Zero integrity."
fear and sorrow can be the only path for equal rights honestly .
"women should know that the abortion pill is still available by mail. if you get it early enough you can perform the abortion yourself. you do not need a doctor or a clinic, they are only there for the very rare cases when taking the pill causes side effects. 
every woman in these states should know this, that they can still get abortions thru the mail. 

and they cannot stop this. as long as democrats control part of congress or the presidency, they cannot stop this. 

“The political entity that currently exists in the United States that is your Best Shot of slowing the descent into authoritarianism is the Democratic Party.”"
"You people are just insane lol voting only for identity and not for policy is why we're in this mess, the left and the right slowly stripping all of our rights away"
Time for everyone to be proactive… it’s obvious our country has left us to fend for ourselves… it’s time to research and seek all options available for ones individual needs.. there are alternatives to this nightmare… we have to address this reasonably.. protest is nice but once the rights are stripped protest is useless… so find out all of the options available and plan accordingly… it’s time we save ourselves and do whatever necessary to avoid being burden with unwanted…
"Only thing that's happened is they've made it harder and/or more dangerous to have an abortion. NOT IMPOSSIBLE. A woman desperate enough is going to do what ever she feels she needs to do. Desperation trumps laws, even commandments. We are humans and we've sinned from the start, hello. There might be more headlines now like, baby left in dumpster, 19 year old college student gang raped that got pregnant has commited suicide, preachers 13 year old daughter died trying to abort her baby or republican christian senator molesting his daughter paid  for her to have abortion. THERE'S NO STOPPING THE FILTH IN THIS WORLD. Why bring more innocent babies into it that aren't wanted by the woman carrying them, DUH!!!"
"“No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.” – Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Constitution, Draft 1, 1776"
"The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes…. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.”
– Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book (quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria), 1774-1776"
"“On every occasion [of Constitutional interpretation] let us carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying [to force] what meaning may be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, [instead let us] conform to the probable one in which it was passed.”
– Thomas Jefferson, letter to William Johnson, 12 June 1823"

"Why is planned Parenthood saying it's going to close its doors if they outlaw abortions.
They claim  it's only 3% of their business..  Supposedly  97% of their business is still operational .
Unless it's true they were always an abortion mill"
"American Exceptionalism, right?"
This should have always been a state decision. Abortion is not a constitutional right regardless of your feelings on the matter. I also see so many pro abortionist protesting Christianity. There are plenty of secularist against the murder of unborn children. All the blue states will vote and continue to murder innocent life in the whomp. They will probably even double down and push for late term and even partial birth infanticide.
"“Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense? Where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?”

"“What, Sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty …. Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins.”
– Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, I Annals of Congress 750, August 17, 1789"
"“[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.”

"When the First Satanic Church of America makes the statement ""You can't outlaw abortion its part of our worship."" Then we understand exactly  why Abortion is so important. The ancients worship of Moloch sacrificing live babies into a burning fire."
"Regardless of where I stand on abortion, in my opinion there is no indication in our Constitution that it should be considered a fundamental constitutional right. This was, in my opinion, an extreme interpretation done by the Supreme Court at that time. By the way, I also think there is no indication in our Constitution (or second amendment) that anybody at 18 should be able to purchase an AR-15. One thing is the right to own arms, another thing is what type, since what age, and with what requisites. Both these are extreme interpretations that intend to make something constitutionally covered, so it can't be discussed. I think this is wrong. I think both things should be defined in Congress and have limits to when and how you can exercise those rights."
You can’t be in favor of people having the right to bear arms (weapons) to kill people and animals and be against women having the right to choose.
Biden needs to add 2 more judges and explain that this is the will of the people we can't go backwards.Two judge stolen my Trump taken back.
"PS. Where are the voices and demonstrations concerning threats to democracy itself? Where are the loud demonstrations to indict Trump for being a  clear and present danger to the very core of your democratic institutions? He attempted to overthrow a free election. He used militant, armed domestic terror groups to stop Pence from certifying the election. People were killed.  The coup failed but you dodged a bullet.
The DOJ needs public pressure to hold everyone involved fully accountable. IMO it's  the most critical problem before you."

"2022 Welcome to ""THE DIVIDED STATES OF AMERICA!"""
The Roberts Court is the most corrupt Supreme Court in history.  We all know it.
"You know what type of men and women who wants abortion to be reverse? It's all the ugly men and women who are not physically attracted who don't get laid regardless who only have a hurt and anger in their hearts,,, especially to a good-looking or normal people who do get laid👍😏💩🍄 and trust me it has nothing to do with religion"
"What is good about the Supreme Court's decision to knock down Roe v. Wade? Just looking at some of the women in this video tells you that there are only religious people who are happy with this ruling. David Brooks from the NYT says you cannot fact check a person with an emotional state. I would go one more to say that you cannot fact check a person of a religious faith. That's fine until the people of a religious faith who are in a minority end up deciding what the rest of the population should do who are in the majority. This must be maddening to see this happen before your eyes. Nevertheless; what you can do is not to get mad, but get even. What is the root of this problem? It's the Electoral College that allowed a candidate with----listen to this---3 million less votes than his oppositional candidate to win the election for the presidency. That's right, Donald J. Trump won the election that Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote by 3 million people. What happened next is one of darkest chapters in American history. Mitch McConnell quickly realized he had a proxy president who would willingly do his bidding if he got all the credit. McConnell deftly stacked the Supreme Court with religious fanatics that do not even come close to reflecting the views of a majority of Americans. This is a reality difficult to accept where nothing can change a Supreme Court ruling, but you can change your country's disasterous path of having an Electoral Candidates that puts questionable candidates into office that would not have won in a true democracy. George W. Bush got in the same way and America's image has been forever stained by a president whose vice-president called the shots and once again---gave George W. Bush all the credit. I'm an overseas viewer and this is my two cents to sort things out, but I think this is an excellent time to use the rising anger not to explode on the streets, but to take out the seed of the problem making your country a laughing stock across the world. Abolish the Electoral College before a person like Trump once more is in charge but who may just decide to use nuclear weapons."

Women of child bearing age have lost their right? Is CNN saying men cannot get pregnant?
"I would say any constitutional right could be taken if it was born after the 1950s. It wasn't a constitutional right, if it was then congress would have passed a law to make federal abortion illegal. Finally the states have the right to make abortion illegal."
So do u pro abortion people believe in aboration in a 3rd trimester?
"The Republican appointed Supreme Court Justices in their confirmation hearings acknowledged  Roe v Wade as set precedence. In overturning Roe v Wade they perjured themselves in confirmation hearings to be confirmed to be a Supreme Court Justice. If the House and Senate don't hold  these Republican appointed Justices accountable for perjury by not impeaching for perjury these corrupted Justices send a  message that perjury is okay. The Supreme Court Justices by overturning Roe v Wade have taken women backwards in their right to choose which brings them back to when there were many deaths from back room abortions.  Forcing women who have already been devastated mentally and physically who are a victim of rape,  incest or a dangerous pregnancy are once again a victim of their right to choose  being taken away. In most States before a child is given up for adoption both people give consent to give up the child. The Supreme Court Justices and the states that have banned abortions have given the rapist and  the perpetrator of incest parental rights to once again victimize the already devastated women."
Censored me. Blacks the dems ain't your friends.
"It's another sad day for the USA, and a scary portent for what will follow. Land of the free my ass."
This could be harbinger of a split of the United States into two separate nations.  Reminiscent of the 1840s and 1850s when the anti-slavery movement was growing in the northern states.
"Ok but you meant children of child bearing age, didn't you, the republicans are all child molesters and should be executed as such!"
CNN aborted journalism long ago.
The same activists that said Clinton=Trump now think elections don’t matter and don’t want to vote. Lol
If they are going to do this there must be massive investments on child care.
"Factoring in CNN's margin of error, 11 is actually 18-20. 22 states have it legal presently and 8-10 are undecided with more than half leaning to ban. In the end it will likely be an even 25 for legal/ban which showcases that America is divided right down the middle with no chance of that gap ever being bridged. I think it's time for a divorce."
Why would you want to killed unborn child?
"Don't like you State's laws? Move. But until then, be sexually responsible (something you should be doing anyhow). It's really not that difficult."

Liberty and freedom are just words, men have no right to decide what women do with they bodies. You care about the the unborn, but do not care of the the born. GIVE FREE MEDICARE AND THEN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY YOU ARE RIGHTOUES AND CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS.{Note all caps so you pay attention. Shame on you America ,the divided states is the correct name"
Thoughts and prayers to all the pregnant men out there
"Banning abortions does *not* lower abortion rates. 

You know what does?

*Allowing Abortion Services!*

It is a very simple, demonstrable fact, that states (and indeed, whole countries elsewhere in the World) that have the most draconian anti-abortion laws have the higher levels, per capita, of abortions (illegal), STDs, teen pregnancies, and child mortality and birth defects. 

Abortions are part of reproductive health. And that goes hand-in-hand with:
Pre/post natal health care services
Child support
Comprehensive sex education
Access to contraception
Income support
Housing benefits
Affordable health care, or all out state funded universal health care
Payed maternity/paternity leave

*These* services lower abortions, whilst *allowing* abortions. 

And it goes without saying, the States  that are frothing at the mouth at banning abortions do *not* have these services, or are gutting them to point of being meaningless. 

If you're a foetus, your rights are sacred. Once you're born, you can F### off and die, for all they care!"
"I don't think everyone understands the seriousness of this Abortion situation

These are children that's being ripped apart limb by limb they feel every bit of that


come on now y'all."
Yall are crazy to watch this crap
"Amazing that Asma Khalid would be outraged while wearing a hijab...that is forced upon her by male Muslims... and the fact that contraception and abortion is forbidden under Islam....as well as the fact that forced child marriages is allowed under Islam, as well as ""honour"" killings..."
"It's amazing how many women like unprotected s3x, and wreckless casual encounters.   And they told us men were the dogs....this proves the opposite"
"This is inflamatory news imo. Why do American news channels  magnify issues out of proportion and drive stakes between American people? 
Google the question and see which states have 'banned' them and at what stage.
Even deSantis platform supports contraception and early stage abortion. He suggests 15 weeks as a limit to when abortion should be legalized. It looks like the question for States is ' at what developmental stage should abortion be illegal' or even just medically unethical?
It is an important question that includes but also extends beyond privacy rights and choice.
I am a woman, with a uterous, who has had pregnancy scares, has been pregnant and  had childern. I know the issues. I have as much right to influence abortion policy as the pro choice lobby.
Please de escalate the rhetoric and deliver a balanced calm news piece. The American people have been through trauma after trauma. Be part of the healing and unity project not part of the problem."
These creepy Leaders banning women's health rights are insane. What childcare & family supports are they proposing to help pregnant women after the child is born?
America is slowly becoming a shithole country.
Hell yeah let’s arrest women!! Human rights!!
"Republicans will take over the House and Senate, get rid of the filibuster like the democrats always should have, and pass whatever draconian laws at the federal level that ""their God's"" voices tell them to."
God bless those 11 states
Absolute worst decision in the history of the Supreme Court. I am disgusted that anybody could ever support this decision.
"We in Europe have experienced what happens if rights are being reversed. I just hope it will not end in getting slavery back in place. And be sure, we will not come to free you from fascism, you are on you own."
Decent Americans—we HAVE to defeat the TRAILER TRASH HILLBILLY’S that are trying to turn the Country into a THEOCRACY!!!
I thought religion and state was supposed to be separate. I think the women should sue the US at the world court for violation of human rights
EXPAND SUPREME COURT!!  RESIST AND REJECT THE FASCIST GOP PARTY!!
"Most of the 1 million abortions in America are from poor lazy and uneducated women, come on America educate your masses ,"
JOE BIDEN CHEAT SHEETS:   YOU Take YOUR seat💺 😉😀😄🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  This is what YOU get when YOU order a president by MAIL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 THE US IS A LAUGHING STOCK ALL OVER THE WORLD 😂🤣🤣
Roe allowed abortions right up until the time of delivery. Why don't you ask Americans how many of them support that CNN. I'll bet it ain't 66%.
"If we're now going with literal interpretation of constitution and rights which are not explicitly enumerated in constitution being deligated to states, lets remember that 2nd amendment protects the right to bare arms, but it does not protect the right to sell guns, hence states can flat out ban sales of guns. Same goes for shipping of the ammo or guns across territory of a particular state."
"""Oklahoma is now the safest place a child can be"".  what the hell kind of rhetorical bullshit is that?!"
Clarence Thomas is political and Supreme Court Judges are supposed to be objective.
"it’s not going to impact suburban women at all, they can afford to get an abortion no matter what. That Great White Replacement they fear is coming about by their own hands…"
Stop making women look uneducated.
A huge step in the right direction.
"“Oklahoma is the safest place for a child to be.”

‘Are you are increase funds for maternal and child care?’

“Are we what now?”"
Weren’t these women talking about a sex strike?Problem solved 🤣🤣🤣
"Well democrats are keeping the dream of eugenics alive. 
Margret Sanger and Hitler would be proud"
He says Oklahoma is the safest place for a child to be. Except when that armed gun man comes into their school and blows them to pieces. Thanks to republican gun laws.

Hmmm we're all biologists now 🤔
Making America great again! God bless America!
This is Wrong
Why was this not on the voter ballot.  This is unconstitutional. For the supreme court to make the decision against the will of the people.
How about Roe lied that she got raped in an interview and said she was an alcoholic and stole money from people.Her words!!!!
"40-million Afghans -- the people of the ""Graveyard of Empires"" -- have capitulated to a life under the tyranny of less than 100,000 Taliban. 140-Million Russians have capitulated to a life under the tyranny of Putin. So why will it be any different for 330-Million Americans vis-à-vis The REAL Republicans of MAGA."
"Amazing the Supreme Court does not consider the States are qualified to regulate gun control, but are very qualified to regulate women's reproductive rights.   In one week they have managed to produce contradictory opinions on States rights.   The gun control opinion comes as a rebuke to the bipartisan resolution passed by Congress a few days earlier.  It aims to appease the NRA for allowing and cooperating in the bipartisan legislation that no one would have dared oppose."
"And the voters, if they disagree can have it placed on the ballot.  CNN where the terminally ignorant go for misinformation."
"All states should make abortion illegal unless one of the following happens. 
RAPE: Given the morning after pill to abort or no longer then two weeks. After that then they should not be able to abort. 
Medical emergency:  Doctors don't have a choice but to abort but only with two or three doctors in agreement that it would be the best decision. 
Baby's health; Doctors say the baby will not have a quality of life for reasons such as brain damage, severely deformed etc....then and only then with  two to three opinions with same opinion. 
Other then that abortion should be illegal period and if a doctor is caught preforming they should be imprisoned for life without parole , life for a life, same goes with mother. Abortion is murder period , we are a nation that is supposed to be under God but we go against God on many things such as abortion, gay rights and many more things. America has become very dark and we need to get back in the light and stop going against God, if not America will fall as if people can notice it is starting to crumble and pretty soon America will not exist if we don't start getting it right, Democrats are destroying our country a little at a time as per their agenda and we need to take our country back out of the hands of this demonic power that has it's grasp on many people. God bless and love to all."
"Horrible  it doesn't make a baby safe.  It will be in Foster care .
Unloved and abused."
after birth abortion is the most appalling and evil thing i have EVER heard of
"When I thought America couldn't get any worse, right wing nuts with power prove me wrong again. We are falling deeper and deeper into authoritarianism by people who a majority of Americans disagree with! Something must change or America is DEAD!"
at the very very least what i require to feel bad about women because of this: all those women voting blue from now on. otherwise accept what you voted for
Oklahoma is the safest place for children to be...until the next school shooting facilitated by the lack of gun laws.
This should be a big boost for Canadian tourism.
Look at all these Serena Joys rejoicing at having brought about their own subjugation.
"so sad to see 33% of americans support this madness, republican party is a mind-washer to amazing levels, if something this obvious is an issue, how the F are we ever going to pull together on the real problems everyone keeps ignoring because they are too hard to solve. pure madness."
"With body autonomy now voided by these states, these 11 states can make vaccination mandatory."
Thank  GOD  Almighty  for OUR Amazing  Conservative  Supreme  Court  Justices 🙏🙏🙏🙏❤

11 states that should vote blue next time.
"In the same time the court rule in two cases 
First case you do not have control over my Gun
Second case I have control over your body (you do not have control over your body)

"Good!! Hopefully this will wake up the people in those states and get them to vote these ant-American, anti- freedom bastards out!"
"It's theocratic dogma from an illigitimate benched supreme court overturning precident set by at least two decisions by previous courts.

I blame Dems for letting this sit as precident for 70 years and not amending the constitutional privacy sections to include personal medical rights."
Women? Shouldn't you guys be saying birthing people?
"""Women of color disproportionately depend upon abortion services."" CNN is right about that. That's because Margret Sanger founded Planned Parenthood to control the population of minorities."
LMFAO..... YOUR ELECTIONS ARE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH REPUBLICANS ELECTED WHO MAY END UP TAKING OVER WHO GETS INTO POWER AND WHO DOESN'T.  I just shake my head at all of your in America and count my blessings every day that I live in Canada.  America is now in the same circle of 2 other countries which are considered dictatorships and do NOT ALLOW ABORTIONS IN THEIR COUNTRY.  AGAIN  LMFAO.
I haven’t seen Democrats this mad since Republicans freed their slaves! 😂😂😃
Abortion is not a constitutional right!Get your facts straight!
It is time for a female sex-boycott for bringing back abortion rights.
"Take the word “effectively” out of the title of this video and this story becomes dead space.
CNN consumers will likely and/or ‘effectively’ interpret and transmit this story as ‘11 states ban abortion’."
"Irresponsible voters distracted by the sirens'' song of the dog shit, of dog-whistle politics, are entirely responsible for this happening"
"There will be a run on knitting needles and forceps.....the old standbys, disgraceful ruling by the court"
What’s the matter you don’t want the public to know that doctors profit off of aborted fetal parts???
"Funny how the same Nazis who were crying over masks in PRIVATE shops want the gvt regulating bedrooms and wombs. That's not going to happen. We will not allow it, no matter what it takes. The 2nd amendment is to protect against gvt overreach."
The solution is simple..... expand the court
If GOP wife daughter mistress need Abortion they secretly leave the country an HAVE ABORTION. The Hypocrisy so deep get boots on. An by the Rich women will still getting Abortion.
RBG's Legacy.
Yeah what happens next is we fight abortion can save lifes of alot of woman that know can not give birth do to the risks of death and what about rape victims this is an insult to human rights
Oklahomo just became the most dangerous state for women.
The majority of Red Southern states are supporting this insane situation that allows old wyt men to just ravish young wyt girls and then raise their unwanted offspring!!!🤢🤮
"I remember when planned parenthood got exposed for selling aborted fetal parts.Plan B ladies don’t let them profit off of your aborted baby.That is what this is about.No profit in medications that dissolve a pregnancy.22,000 for an aborted fetal brain.Just saying.Stop making women look uneducated.Sincerely a biological woman.Peace."
Kansas should open abortion clinics on the borders adjacent to Oklahoma and Missouri and advertise them like a casino.
Free birth control.  Nation wide.  Prevent as many unplanned pregnancies as possible.  Why can't we do this?   Regardless of left or right can we agree that prevention would be less stress on the health care system and society as a whole.
#AMEN
Oklahoma is far from the safest place in the country for a baby. The infant mortality rate is one of the highest in the country at 5.7 deaths per 1000 births. In fact look up mortality rates and the Red states lead the way in death.
Kevin McCarthy would go for extermination camps if he thought it would win votes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
"These right-wing extreme evangelicals (even non Christian’s who condemn pro-choice) fail to realize that the only sin that can never be forgiven by God is the, “Unpardonable Sin” of grieving away the Holy Spirit entirely. (To reject/not listen to the Holy Spirit.) They are in far more jeopardy of loosing their salvation and burning in hell than a woman who has had to endure an abortion and seeks forgiveness.

Matthew 12:31-32
“Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven. Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come."

Well I think the hospitals could hand out plan B along with the rape kit wouldn’t you say?"
No j6 hearings or......?
Cant wait to hear how many Republicans get called out for their abortions. I imagine Trump and kids have racked up 6 or 7
"For Republicans,to be an American you must be born in the USA, be white, Christian and a MAN.
I would not be surprised in 10 years if women are not allowed to vote."
"To CNN
It was not a constitutional right....read the constitution and stop spreading misinformation"
"All that happens is the people needing it, go over the border into countries that give abortions  - those countries make millions of dollars. Ireland women used to come to England - they do not now, because Ireland Catholicism practice has fallen and sanity prevailed and Ireland realised it needed to get in the 21st Century. Looks like the US has gone back a century."
"The problem that arises from more millions of Americans as refugees from the failed GOP states -- like for California that handed Joe Biden 5-million of the popular vote, that he did not need to win California -- is that it entrenches the disruptive power of a death-grip on the country, that the Republicans -- The REAL Republicans of MAGA -- hold, by way of the Electoral College system."
Sorry to hear this from Canada here. Maybe it’s time to drag these Supreme Court justices out into the street for a trial by the people. You outnumber them don’t take their shit.
"These folks don't care about ""babies/kids"". So doesn't matter how these children come about or what the pregnancy can do to the mother or life it would have being born to someone who doesn't want it. Same folks complain about government assistance, low income, adopt agencies better get more locations & rooms. What about the rights of the mothers? This is very very bad"
"i love that they keep saying ""women"", but they don't even know what that word means"
"RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW, WATCHING THE WORLD WAKE UP FROM HISTORY ❤️🇺🇲🗽"
Stay focused on Donald Trump democrats. Don't take your eyes off of him. Tunnel vision pays off yet again.
"Why American women need the Supreme Court Justices? Recalled the Supreme Court Justices if they can't protect women rights to abortion. They are appointees and can also be removed. Politically motivated overturns Roe and Wade, in any part of the constitution are abortion illegal. They punish women for having sex. The Supreme Court Justices can't read the constitution and sent women to the cavern age, they need to be removed."
"The best way to fight this is for all of the Democrat Supremes to stand down, for to take away the SCOTUS as the stick for The REAL Republicans of MAGA to terrorize the country. Also, make sure that this November and 2024 is the stake through the heart for The REAL Republicans of MAGA."
"The Taliban moves forward.
USA moves backward."
They won't ban ar15s but ban women rights to choose. This country is so backwards.
"Hey in Colorado you can have an abortion at 10 months (just suppress birth for  a month)? Who cares if it is a human living baby. Who cares.  Come to Colorado and abort your baby.
Colorado is going overboard to get your abortion monies.  Heck maybe even free buses and free air fare (Oh, guess Dick's and Tesla are doing that already).  Ok just come to Colorado to abort your baby (10 month is fine ok --- you all come!!!)"
"Breaking news: Roe is dead, and the democrat's leadership has utterly failed them. Now back to Donald Trump, and the never-ending impeachment."
The Supreme Court justices should have term limits and not be in for life.
This is the greatest of Democracy....I love it😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
do any of these people understand US law maybe they should move to move to another state or another country
"Abortion, ah, the ultimate bright shiny object!  The Orange Fuehrer and his Turd Riech has just hammered down the last coffin nail for the Republican party.   Has anyone thought of why did the Supreme Court dropped this decision before the midterms?  To deflect from the January 6th committee dominating the news.  Clarence Thomas is neck deep in the conspiracy to overthrow democracy and is trying to keep himself and his wife out of jail.  Remember the line Trump used to pressure Georgia secretary of state Raffensberger?  ""You just find me 11,000 votes and the Republicans in congress and the court will do the rest!"".  The January 6th committee want to talk to Ginny Thomas about trying to overthrow democracy.   Boom!  Roe vs Wade is overturned!   So now January 6th is back burner and Abortion is the new fight, which just, finally, will give total congressional control to the Democrats.   The dog just caught the car.  And fascism was at the wheel."
they will be going after birth control next...
"Thank you democrats. Just please keep voting for Biden, and Pelosi. We couldn't have done it without you."
"now Kavanaugh can rape through the US without feeling bad about killing the unborn... Next goal: women-voting rights, i guess. Or, stop female education...
USA. you are insane..."
Abortion should not be a constitutional contraceptive for bad behavior bad decisions between men and women
This country is dying as fast as Lake Mead.😔
"5 month old baby girl shot and klld in Chicago's south shore - where's the outrage, i wonder? 🤔 where's ""blm""??"
"“I don’t view Abortion as a Choice and a Right, I think it’s always a tragedy” - Senator Joe Biden, 2006."
It’s not a constitutional right.Get your facts straight!
"What time is it? Time for a constitutional amendment. Maybe to revive the ERA. Maybe to bring back Roe Vs Wade. Maybe to increase the number of SCotUS Justices. Maybe to revise the 2nd amendment.  Maybe something else, It's time to restore the rights that the GOP wants to take away. Make America a leader in human rights again."
"What do you get when you order a president through the mail? An unbroken string of victories like this one right here. Good job, democrats. 👍"
Pph actually lowered the black pop to 12 .4%.
If you are all about medical advances then there is no need for surgical abortion which doctors profit from aborted fetal parts in most cases.There is no financial gain from taking medication to dissolve a pregnancy.That is what this is about.
"Dear pro lifers... you are more than welcome, because I don't make choices for you, to have all the babies your little heart desires.  But don't shove your choice on me.  You do not have that right.  I don't like men with beards... so every man should shave to suit me.  It should be federal law.  Same for tattoos.  If I do not have a right to my body, no one else should have that right.   Also, pro lifers, please pop out more so we can ensure we add to the workforce and foster homes and adoption agencies.  We are doing such a good job of caring for them now.  
You need to do some research on oxygen.  Only 2 things live on this planet without oxygen.  You know, breath of life and all that.  A fetus is not a living breathing baby until such time.  period.  
I can assure you women have very serious talks with God when it comes to this type of decision.  YOU are not God... YOU are not there.... YOU do not know what path God has planned for that person.  YOU are. not. God.  
Your spoiled snot nosed little sheep that think you have the right to be gods..."
I hope those States are prepared to assist the Mother to rear  that child to responsible adulthood!
How can we punish the people that put Trump in office that led to this?
So those 11 States being USA will abort their children while they are at school age in mass shootings.
Democrats seem hell bent on pushing population off the proverbial “cliff” lol Agenda 21 and 30? Paying employees to fly and get an abortion doesn’t that cause a big Carbon footprint? Are they gonna take an electric car? Where does the source of electricity come from wind? Lol The hypocrisy on Democrats is un real open your eyes and ears people don’t be so simple minded. Scientists want the embryonic cells for future vaccines and plandemics.
If democrats want to keep on  winning victories like this then they should just keep on voting for the leadership they've been voting for. Thank you Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden. Good job. 👍
They keep saying my body my choice and they are 100% correct. They have the choice to keep their legs closed.
Like Germany Italy and other countries the states set a time limit like 40 weeks. NY aborts them at the birth day.
So those judges would celebrate the new life to be when a teenage  family member is raped….
"Terra nullius is a Latin expression meaning ""nobody's land"". It was a principle sometimes used in international law to justify claims that territory may be acquired by a state's occupation of it. The State is occupying Vaginas."
RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY is alive and well in these states!!!
"Here's my next observation. How is Texas or any other state going to prevent me from freely traveling to an abortion friendly state, how is that going to work. Maybe I misunderstood, if I go to another state then Texas can prosecute me? How is that going to work? I didn't commit a crime in Texas, I'm puzzled. If I murder someone in NY state, Texas can't prosecute me. I have to be extradited back to NY.  Another question. Mothers who abuse illegal narcotics during their pregnancies, are they going to be prosecuted for the damage to the baby? A heroin addict can't have an abortion so she births an addicted baby, if nothing else think of the costs associated with the long term care of this child....maybe money will make it mean something to you pro-lifers, the human suffering is making no dead way."
But who gets arrested?
Beware the Theocrats.
"I think its hilarious how we're acting like women are randomly waking up the next morning with unwanted pregnancies, as if they didn't make the decision to have sex in the first place."
Good no more killing babies
"YES THEY LIED UNDER OATH WHAT IS THERE PENALTY 🤔🧐just my opinion and thought. 
This is Bull 🐂 Sugar Honey Ice Tea and they know it  .. So when one there family members whomever it is need to due what they just outlawed &  passed let's make sure News 📰🗞️ Media is there to report it.  This is .just my opinion keep a 👁️👀 eye out.  Even the news media family members who agree with the decision. Just my opinion 🤔"
😂 remember the female doctors and nurses that were among the group of other doctors and nurses in different cities in America that were fighting against hospital mandates to juice people. Where were the pro abortion people for support. Where was my body my rights for support. See . This is definitely about money.  Definitely about white people depopping themselves. And a big thanks to Soros for the pro abortion people protesting now when they should had been in protest from the use of the juice to now . I guess Soros had to refill his cash flow for a while . See God is getting ready to bring women to their knees now. God is going to put limits to women freedoms no matter what. Welcome to Jacob's trouble Karen and liberal women .
"Those with money or influence, will not be affected."
"You should show a list on the screen. Show it every day.
Keep a death toll, as well."
"If we look at the striking down of Roe v. Wade in the context of Trump's coup attempt with the massive assistance of his Republican co-conspirators, with those same legislators further abrogating their sworn duties to uphold our Constitution and actually do their jobs rather than obstruct everything they can, then it becomes obvious that the Republican Party is thoroughly corrupt and seeks to destroy our democracy for only one thing and for only ITS benefit, not America's-- power.  Does anyone in his right mind want to give ANY power to this criminal cabal of traitors?  No, I don't think so, either."
Constitutional right to kill babies.
Let's hope this attack on womens rights  sends them straight to the ballot box!
Thank you Harry Reid and Ruth Bader Ginsberg. We couldn't have done it without your help.
"Reproductive freedom, same sex marriage, immigration, social programs, control of arms of war, poor people opportunities to have a house, good education, health services, a government that work for all and not for the riches. Those rights are on the election on NOVEMBER VOTE VOTE VOTE WE KNEW W WE ARE MAYORITY WE ARE MORE !!!!!!"
If they  try to band birth control  for  women  does  that  include  condoms  that  help prevent  STDS  ?
"I'm a semi retired activist of 25 years on all human rights anti war in the 90's was a very lonely movement. I always encouraged younger people to never take any of our freedoms for granted begging young people to be vigilant about abortion and usually it was an ""OK, boomer"" response but I warned about selfish unimaginative right wingers want to take away safe legal abortion and frankly if they could take right to vote as a women too. Take nothing for granted. I am however still totally amazed that I had more rights in 1991 age 21 than women do now. We need to fight hard voting rights is also on the chopping block. Women have always been undermined in patriarchy. At least todays women won't be screaming into the wind as I did in the 1990s nobody cared much then. There was no social media to organize with except newsletters. Remember the words of the great Fredrick Douglas who did activism with the suffragetes ""Power concedes nothing without struggle."" Well Woe to the vanquished because we will devastate the GOP in the house and senate. Look out for Harris county and gerrymandering."
The unborn only wish they were worth “three-fifths”.
Most of these states don’t even allow exceptions for rape or incest. Republicans don’t think there won’t be backlash.
"The Supreme Court giveth, and the Supreme Court taketh away."
Talk is cheap. Someone has to take their case to Supreme court again
"There some elements of the  dystopian science fiction of the Handmaidens Tale, are beginning to look like a documentary commentary in some red states. It will not be sufficient to ban abortion in these states, it will be necessary to restrict the movement of potentially pregnant women, to stop them leaving to have abortions in other states. They may face arrest on return, should they leave for such operations. Natural miscarriages will be subject to legal investigation. This is simply following the change in the law to its logical conclusion."
Abortion was never a constitutional right. It's not in the Constitution.
"Leave those states, reduce the population, that way you reduce the numbers of sits in the congres and the power of those who dont care about what the people needs and want"
"Who voted again? oh wait, it's the people... So who's fault is it that these laws are made? You guessed it! Might not be what you want, but you should consider that when you vote someone into power😂"
"It’s so funny that the Oklahoma governor said “Oklahoma is now the safest place for a child to be” when the state is ranked third to last for overall newborn healthcare, labor and delivery. Seriously the hypocrisy knows no bounds."
"A sentence from Rui Barbosa (a lawyer that was 3 times presidential candidate in Brazil in the beggining of the 1900's and consider one of the most brilliant minds that ever existed in Brazil) says: ""The worst dictatorship is the one coming from the judicial power, against which there is nobody to whom one can appeal"". This decision from the SCOTUS against the overwhelming majority of the american population is raw judicial dictatorship."
"Damn right, it will be bad for Republicans. I was going to vote Red before, because Republicans were promising to improve economy. Now I realized their word means nothing, when 3 of their conservative judges lied to be confirmed. I am voting Democrat now, hope many other women will too."
The red trailer trash states will be asking for larger handouts.
"There's zero parental leave, healthcare, social services, affordable housing, safe schools etc AND there's already a huge shortage of foster homes and too many of the existing foster homes aren't properly vetted.

What could possibly go wrong?"
Sex with women should be illegal unless for the puposes of childbirth. Problem solved.
Welcome to the republican caliphate
If a woman is already paying for the abortion then why is Planned Parenthood being funded by the government? If the government is funding the abortion why is Planned Parenthood charging the woman anything for the abortion?
but it takes two
FACT: Abortion cannot be banned unless an election is held statewide and voters make the decision. State legislators can only act on voting results.
Fk fanatical fascists!
Cool...the will of the people!
"The 3 trump puppets should be impeached for perjury, occuring during their confirmation hearings. Just more lying pub garbage."
psychopathic democrats want to kill babies in the name of womens health!!! That proves they are EVIL!!!!
"The ""pro life"" should start paying the child support, since they wanna be the baby daddy of all the children that get ""saved"" from abortion."
The trouble with any right a court gives you is a court can take that right back anytime it wants to.
Apparently it wasn’t constitutional.
Haha 😆 a Muslim woman at a abortion table telling women to vote
It's about time the constitution is followed and the people of the states are given back the power of the government!
When Americans start voting on abortion it's going to be illegal to get an abortion after the first trimester. That's going to cut into Planned Parenthood's profits significantly.
F—k i just moved to one of the states that banned abortions. I’m moving back
"It's really pretty simple to fix.  78% of the country disagree with banning abortion.   So get off your lazy azzes and vote in November.   If you vote blue, you can finally put this issue to bed once and for all.  If you vote red, or fail to vote then you are giving the right permission to take away more freedom from you. SIMPLE LOGIC !!"
"Well then it sounds like alot of people don't support abortion in this country...

Welcome do democracy 

Deal with it you crybaby liberals"
"𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗨𝗽 𝗘𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗵 𝗼𝗳 𝗢𝘂𝗿 𝗣𝗼𝗹𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗛𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗡𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲

The United Nations recently celebrated the International Mother Earth Day as a reminder to protect the environment. Heat waves, droughts, fires and heavy rains that cause severe flooding have become more frequent in many parts of the world due to climate change, which affects the entire worldwide population.

The Earth is facing a “triple planetary crisis,” warn UN officials. Climate disruption, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste are the main areas of concern regarding the current state of the environment. This year, the Earth Day’s theme is “Invest In Our Planet,” so what would humanity's best investment for the planet be?

We need to start by cleaning up the planet. There is no place on Earth where the air and water are clean, and that's a real problem. In theory, tackling this issue should be our priority when it comes to taking action to improve the dismal state of our planet. But let’s not fool ourselves. Such a plan alone will solve nothing.

It will only help the international organizations to justify their own existence. They tick off ""done"" to raise as much money as they want, and that's it. If we do not improve relations between us, we will not be able to achieve the great and ambitious improvement in nature that we want and need to attain globally. We will never achieve a good result through bureaucratic, mechanical measures.

There are a lot of people sitting in their comfortable offices profiting from the environmental crisis and demanding money and respect. They keep flying from one end of the world to the other on all kinds of missions to make a lot of noise with what they are ""doing"" and which everyone ""needs to hear"" as if that alone means something is happening, but in practice we see no real progress. The Earth must also be cleansed of them, of these people who engage in useless campaigns that only cause harm because they mislead the world, leading it away from the real solution.

The cleaning of the planet should start inside out. If we do not clean the planet from within, and continue with our reckless behavior and the selfish nature of our hearts as before, nothing will change for the better. The immense sums invested in environmental initiatives should be directed to spreading an educational process aimed at improving the way we relate to each other.

Humans are the most developed and influential factors of all of nature's levels: still, vegetative, animate and human. Since we occupy the highest level in nature, positively affecting the environment, the climate, and nature in general can be achieved by reaching positive relations among us. On the contrary, by letting our divisive drives tear apart human relations, we also destroy our surrounding environment, the very nature that our lives depend on.

The more we humans are able to correct ourselves by changing our divisive attitudes toward each other into positive attitudes of mutual support, encouragement, mutual responsibility, and reciprocal concern, the more we will receive positive feedback from nature. And the more we develop without making this necessary correction, the more negative feedback we will receive from nature, as we have experienced in the form of natural disasters, pandemics.

It is of utmost importance for us to organize our thoughts, desires and qualities so that we understand that saving the environment and a shift to a better future depend solely on changing our attitudes to each other: from antagonistic egoism to positive, compassionate and cooperative relationships."

Even with a 10% margin of error that's 63%."
How does this end any way other than civil war
Praise God that we’re saving this country from leftist evil.
The people who are protesting needs to be working on a plan. The SCOTUS decision is the final word. Don't be wasting energy on that matter any more. The make-up of the court is not going to change anytime soon.
"The Red States can pass their BS LAWS. They however CANNOT STOP anyone from traveling across states line for anything???? What they gonna friggin do, build a wall between states???"
VOTE THE REPUBLICANS OUT!
Funny how the focus is on 'red' states whereas Democrats haven't done anything to put a law on the books since Roe to protect Women either...
"The GOP took the choice away from Americans and gave it to the government. They are fascist, plain and simple."
Republicans will not stop until there is a complete country wide ban codified in Congress.  Do not give them the Congress or presidency.  I guarantee that is their next step. They will also go after gay rights as well.
States consider an embryo 'property' by the state.   So your 5 week old embryo is now owned by the state.   Honestly disturbing they completely ignored the 11th amendment.
The Repuglican party is boldly leading America into the 19th Century.
Democrats shouldn't be surprised that Joe Biden is mucking  everything up. That's what you get when you order a president through the mail.
How is it a constitutional right? It's not.
"What is going to happen to the innocents that are born to mothers who simply don't want a child? I don't want to get in to the right or wrong just the outcome. What will happen to these babies who grow up, if they survive, to be adults? Our foster care system is horrible, list to what the kids say that have been shuttled from foster to foster. How many will be adopted successfully, a family that will cherish & love beyond measure. What will happen to the babies that stay with the mothers who didn't & don't want them? Lots of physical & emotional abuse is my guess. Are the legislators, justices, pro-life folks going to step up and care for these children? Of course they aren't. They talk it but don't ask them to walk it, inconvenience themselves....This isn't just about abortion, what about the devastating effects this reckless decision will have on the innocents?"
It’s amazing the BS that these continue to spill. PRO-CHOICE ALL THE WAY!!!!!
The best possible scenario was to have abortion legal: Those who choose to have abortion have the right and others can choose not to have one. Now EVERYONE cannot choose. There is no choice here
"This ruling is a great victory for democracy. Before the Court ruled on abortion by fiat. Now the people will vote on it, and decide the issue."
ppl on the left go crai
"LGBTQ, Ladies, Daughters, Moms, and others, VOTE the ""LARS"" ""CHEATS"" & THieves out of the office and reclaim America for you."
Describe where abortion is mentioned in the constitution. I'll wait...
"The good news is, they didn't take any rights away from men. Family can still abuse family members, men are still able to rape, men are still allowed to be adulterers, and take zero responsibility for anything. So, their answer was, women's lives are meaningless. Sit down do what men tell you, and let the frauds, be frauds."
"Women, get to packing & move!"
"This can be laid at the feet of people  who just couldn't bring themselves  to vote for Hillary Clinton. They flipped about her emails then gat in office and did the exact same thing  and much  much worse.  This is the America  yall wanted. Put a puusy grabbing  conman  in office  cause  Hillary  was a women so yall turned against her. America  wasnt ready  for a women  presdent  So first we get a manchild opportunist conman who stilll robbing the people,  then we get joe. can't believe  what is happening  in this country. The right is winning  and how they get to the called  the right  when they are wrong  about just about everything.  Idgt."
"Never have I witnessed such incompetence by an administration in the US. Racial divide is at an all time high, murders, killings, funerals, hand picked jurors, rape, protests, wars, the blaming others, drugs, crime, arms sales, lying to congress, bent cops, suicides, food prices, energy, gasoline, all rising with this useless administration.   My Black, White and Latino friends,  let us all, end this misery come November  !"
Pro-abortion Activists attempted a Coup on Friday in Arizona.
"If democrats and media and supporters not calling for there to be no rioting or burning of pro life places like there already is, then you are just as bad as Donald Trump and Jan 6 rioters. So start policing your own or be branded hypocrites and rioters yourselves, just as you all did to all conservatives that didn’t support trump or Jan 6. There are no buts or candy nuts. But the hypocrisy is starting to be glaring."
"Love the logic of Christo fascist Republicans ... the womb is the ""safest place"" for children. Once outside the womb, forget it. They'll let kids be slaughtered in classrooms, not have enough to eat or to have a roof over their heads. ""Pro-Life"" No. The are anti choice and privacy. Get ready, America, the fascists are taking power. Read the history of the Third Reich to get an idea of what is coming. Too bad we don't have an opposition political party to oppose the GOP fascists."
"Trump Draws another 20,000 at a rally last night to ensure the election of American First candidates in Illinois.   Biden can't get anyone to listen to him at the g4 as he tries to give away the farm to Europe.  Get on board America- Trump 2024."
"Oh so Oklahoma has solved the poor and suffering children and adult issues in all their state already? 
Or are they also putting their shoes on before their socks?
Handle ALL the child poverty and suffering of the breathing humans in your state FIRST, then maybe you can offer housing, food, safely, security, healthcare to the women you're forcing into having children."
I am an Aryan from Germany. I like this news.
Margret Sanger founded Planned Parenthood to control the population of minorities. 46% abortions are performed on people of color.
Elections have consequences. Thank you RBG..
"Welcome to the new Fascist Amerika...where you longer have choice and control of your own body, forced to carry a pregnancy.  Be criminalized for simply loving a person whom you choose. Losing the rights and privacies in your own home ....and these conservatives say don't TREAD on me ?"
Vote those Republicans out
V.O.T out Republicans
The states are cultivating laws they have their hand on the plow. Trying to grow the law in every state. Where the federal government says Roe versus Wade we shouldn't make laws governing abortion. Maybe that's good for the goose is good for the gander State shouldn't be making laws about abortion. Leave it up to the doctors in the patient
Interesting that it's mainly the lighter-skinned that are protesting all over and up in arms. Where is the diversity on this topic?
Since Joe Biden has come to power democrats have suffered an unbroken string of losses. Everything he touches turns to disaster.
"I'm pro-choice, but since democrats are so anti-America and insane on every other issue facing our country,.....I can't vote blue."
Boy these Democrats sure are pissed off they can't kill more black and brown babies
"11 states ban freedom, but thanks for handing the new order to russia and china, the yuan is getting too strong, so we buy rubles now, and rands, and russia gives us cheap oil, so we capitalize, and please buy btc, tesla, apple, and amazon, so our factories keep pumping, we on giga 4 now, all you need, and order with features, so we we see you better, leave africa to russia and china bz it is ours, you can have leftist south america for free"
I saw someone make a post that they would remove their womb in protest. That's kinda crazy tho. Sigh.  God help us.
"They’re pretending there is a problem with white reproduction rates. Spoiler alert, America has the largest white population in the world.
The irony is this could lead to a mass exodus, and actually cause the problem they’re pretending they have now.
There are plenty of English speaking free countries around the world with no religion, no RW extremism, no racism, free healthcare, and no risk of being shot or jailed for nothing."
"The Republicans are anti-freedom, and they only preach about ""freedom"" when it comes to their own needs, even if it means ruining our country."
I'm glad abortion is now illegal. Women have lived their life on easy mode never having to deal with accountability every terrible decision they made the law was always on their side to help them but not anymore.  It started with the Depp and Heard case and now this and I'm ALL FOR IT
"Hey, how about that, democracy in action!"
"This is where the matter should be, at the states. CNN also might focus on the states that allow abortion or abortion procedures. This issue falls back to the stats and that is where it belongs."
"This is frightening 
I’m embarrassed for this country. 

How do we get rid of these Supreme Court freaks?  They LIED!   Doesn’t that mean something???  They’re the SC!!!! 

The majority of this country has No!  Respect for the SC. They are corrupt liars and need to go!!"
"39 more to go.
Abortion is no different than walking into a school and shooting children. At least the kids have a chance to run away. 
If you had a abortion your a depraved murder."
How many Republicans in any government capacity have had or paid for an abortion?
Another reason why I won’t live anywhere but the west coast. At least out here a woman’s rights will still be protected!
Dems begin terror campaign in 4 cities.
"Imagine how many cheating spouses will soon have extended their step families. Having your husband introducing his mistresses new addition to the kids will be what memories are made of. 
Supreme idiocy is what this is all from."
The Supreme Court has taken women to the 1500/1800 periods. Please watch the movie Homesman directed by Tommy Lee Jones and Hilary Swank. The SCOTUS want women having babies NOT to compete with jobs that should only go to white men.
"If you want to restrict abortion then surely you support welfare for all those poor babies, right? No. Because it isn't about children. If they actually cared, the foster care system wouldn't be unable to house the kids in the system, we wouldn't have street kids with no place to lay their heads, and poor mothers wouldn't feel hunger and desperation. They don't care about children."
If men would just keep their pants on!!
Muslim in favor of abortion right😂😂😂😂 fasigh
Well Child surpport will go up I hope all these new dad's that live in Ban States are ready to pay and the big hike in goverment assistance to house and feed the Children. Great Job Supreme Court.
Is abortion mandatory for all women? I'm really confused because I know multiple women who will never think about abortion.
We really hate each other..that is the tragedy...I wish we could get a divorce...the ununited states caused by these republican conservatives nutz
"The tragically absurd thing is that these people say they HATE religious extremists from other countries. Yet here they are, the Christian Taliban....forcing Christian Sharia Law down our throats. All due to the Conservative Mullahs on the Supreme Court. Vote, women, vote. In Iran and Afghanistan in the 70s, women wore what they wanted, married who they wanted, became doctors and lawyers and, in the space of a single year, it was all ripped away by the Religious Right in THEIR countries. In the blink of an eye, they became property with no rights. If you thought ""that can't happen here""....it IS happening. Right Now. This is step one. Unless you fight back through engagement in the democratic process, through words, through solidarity with your sisters."
"Democrats will continue to pay the price for as long as they think that the filibuster is more important than the rights of women, just like Pelosi did when she pushed for an Anti-Choice candidate over a pro-choice, pro-worker candidate. As long as Dems gang up on progressives, the ""regressives"" in the GOP will keep getting away with murder. 

And quit blaming the corrupt justices for this; it is the Democrats who allowed this to happen by protecting the filibuster. So, yes, SUFFER!"
Boycott products sold by those States. Don't travel there. Starve the Ameri-Talibans
music break bye.
11 red states  given power  by gerrymandering . they also  dont want  anyone but  their  base they have voting .
I want to join the army like Emma. Defending her country and marching for equality with her two mums while being told they can't have an abortion after getting raped 🕺💨💩🇺🇸 Never been so proud to fight not only for oil buy also for women's rights 😂🤷 Shithole US! Imagine living abroad and just watch 2020 Season 3 of the USA. Keep going and more guns. I heard season 4 gonna be wild 😂
"I don’t see how a Federal law legalizing abortion is going to negate an existing state law criminalizing it. I hope that can happen, but, we’ll see. People have got to realize, voting is always more than simply voting for a candidate or a Party. It affects policy and lives."
"First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."
could be just a stunt  too get eyes of the treason of jan 6th .the lack of morals allows the owners of the party of the rich  to do what ever their  far right  fascist  bosses  tell them too do. if you live under the fiction  that we are no more then slaves  as far as the far right rich see us. think again. for sure their  women  will have the  power to chose to have kids or not. if your not  rich .if uncle  crazy  gets hi on drugs and  rapes you at  12 years of age  your having  that cock eyed   kid .its no longer up to you. your mom or  any sane person. its up to  some old  man with preg  envy .its a private issue only the women  involved needs to face. not a  neo fascist   tyrant  g o p  fanatic   that  stole  office via gerrymandering. or  by the 1804  electoral college . elect  democrats and they can  amend the  constitution  too match the needs of the people. not  some  c e o of cult of personality   nut case  we never give the most votes too.  we would use the popular  vote and ban gerrymandering  if the dems  get the power to do  so.
"No consequences for lying under oath for Supreme court nominees or breaking of laws for justices ?

"the murder of a 6 month old baby is a disgrace, it is simply satanism. there is not a single civilized country where so much is expected.

The most dangerous place for a child to be is in the shower with Joe Biden.
God wins! Those against God will lose.
Some of them do not even have an exception for rape and incest.  That is sick.
More states will join them and then the real political fight will start to clean up the rest now that the courts have eliminated that roe wall of protection.
And if you think that abortion rights for women are the only law that the far-right extremists are banning then better wake up! They will attack everything that American democracy holds dear and come after every progressive accomplishment that there exists. It is time to finally treat this people as real domestic enemies to USA who have now infiltrated the government. I'm serious. And jail Trump! Don't wait until they will do more damage to America before the world won't recognize this country anymore. It's going sectarian backwards 200 years at least.
The Supreme Court was supposed to protect citizens instead of fighting against them.
It's unrealistic to think that the recent decision by the Supreme Court and states enacting laws will actually stop abortions.  What they will do is stop safe abortions.
"""Reproduction freedom is on the ballot in November.""  --Nancy Pelosi

Reproductive freedom has been on the chopping block for decades and the feckless Democrats have done NOTHING to prevent this day.  They care more about the filibuster than your rights."
Pro choice states should boycott antichoice states .all anti choice states are red states with no economy and rely on federal money just to operate at a deficit .
"Come and have a vacation in Canada , we are a free society"
No child is safe in this country with  all the guns and mass shootings.
"If people only knew the actual procedure and how abortions are performed, they might change their opinion"
Ban and confiscate all guns in America.
Last time abortion was illegal a man could say it wasn't his and skip town. Men have almost zero parental rights already in conservative states. A woman can put a baby up for adoption the father will pay child support no matter what. At any time over the last 50 years congress could have passed a law. So every 4 years abortion and the Mexican border gets brought up to distract you from the fact your children have no future.
"I’m pretty sure she has the right to choose if she wants to get pregnant in the first place. Accidental, incest and rape make up less than 1% of abortions"
Time for guns to be up to individual states.
Red states government are pushing restrictions against people just like in ww2.
Margret Sanger founded Planned Parenthood to control the populations of people of color.
this is effectively bs 😏
Rest of world should look at America. If you vote for looney this is what you get.
Pretty sickening that the first effort put forth from this Attorney General is to activate law enforcement. Nothing about getting healthcare coverage for pregnant women or maternity leave. Nothing about helping these women that will be affected not to mention the poor children that they are forcing to come in to this world. Obviously it’s never been about the sanctity of life. Punishment is what they have wanted. These people are dangerous to society and are trying to take us back to a time when women were the property of their fathers and husbands.
📺 this is only a break from January 6th regular programming 🧠
The US now effectively a kangaroo Supreme Court
There's a reason why abortion bans disproportionately affect women of color. 46% of abortions are performed on women of color. There's a reason for that too. Margret Sanger planned it that way.
"I can't wait to look at the shock on female right-wing supporters as it finally affects them personally instead of plain politics in taking sides, after being so brainwashed all these while. I bet they be like after the abortion ban, ""You say, what?!"""
"Pelosi is quite hilarious. Women are still able to make their own decision but BEFORE having a baby. If you dont want to give birth dont get pregnant. You still have a choice. You dont decide to create life to only then question ""do I want this or not"" you simply do it before."
This is ridiculous..I can't believe they overturned it. What kind of country is this because it's definitely not a free one. Good America you failed again
"Vote for republicans if you wanna experience ""a maid's tale"" first hand! ..."

trump lost by  a what 8 million  in 2020?  and lost  GA.and  AZ.and the rust belt. come on  the congress needs to be solid  blue  if we are having too wait for  the court members that lied to get  the bench  too die of old age. we need to take the power of the  court  back by  electing democrats  too congress and as Uvaldi shows in fascist  coward  infection  runs deep. if we are too remain free  the  post nixon  g o p needs to be voted out.
The republicans haven’t offered a better solution to any problem since 1861.
You might want to check your facts before you start spouting off about matters of any importance. Nowhere in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights is abortion the legal means to kill a baby legal means to kill a unborn baby spoken of or addressed even in the slightest. And since it's not in either of those documents it definitely is not a Constitutional right for women to be able to have an abortion. There is no wonder why so many Americans consider CNN fake news; this is a prime example.
When this republican party gets there agenda done We the people will have No rights....what will you cling on nut huggers who voted for them do then..😭😭😭
"All Republicans, don't forget TRUMP added the Judges that overturned Roe!  This is another Mess your guy is responsible for. Now deal with it. LOL! 68% of the country was against this ruling.  Once again, he could not care less about the majority."
24 weeks ? WTF
"Bad times in America. Progress of the last 50 years destroyed for women by Trump loyalists in the now corrupted Supreme Court who want to enforce their religious beliefs on all American women. There is only one who is so happy about all of this, and that's Marjorie Taylor Greene, that traitor. I put her on spot in the first video in my playlist, because I don't want her to get away with it."
"If you dont want to live in the handmaids tale, then dont give up your right to bear arms"
Thirteen not 11.  CNN can't even be honest with that.  If I watch CNN does that double their viewership?
If a state forces a minor to have a baby shouldnt they be responsible for all cost including food and clothing
Just move to California. Sure gas is $8 a gallon and 1/10th of the state is homeless because homes cost $800k. But you're free to abort those clumps of cells and smoke dope all day!!!!
"Women in these states need to start thinking of privacy, browser/apo data could get them a murder charge now.  If states can request data from Facebook, Google   Microsoft, etc.

Using Tor and Linux should become the norm"
"I supposed to good news is this tidbit of red meat for republicans is likely to get even some Republican voters to vote against them.  It is also likely to motivate so-called undecided voters to actually go out and vote which will most likely be blue.  Effectively, I predict that we are going to see a turnout for a state voting that we've never seen before in order to show where the people actually are on this issue.

Also I suspect conservative voices who were concerned about the domestic supply of children in the Foster care system are really just looking for a lot of kids that are going to screw up their lives and feed into the prison system in order to provide crap loads of virtually free labor for States and some corporations that depend on it.  The other big concern that I've seen for the future, is the prediction that the white race is going to become a minority given the birth rates of white families.  Wealthy people do not have as many children as not so wealthy people there's no need.  As such white families tend to be waiting later in life before actually having a baby if they have a baby at all.  And it doesn't compare to poor families of Hispanic descent which tend to have about five or six kids out of necessity considering that about half of them are not going to make it to adulthood if the police have anything to do with it.  To similar story with black families.  But now that we've taken abortion off the table, we are instead looking at flooding the United States with babies of all races.  Or more specifically we're going to be flooding red states with babies of all races, meaning these otherwise predominantly white States are now going to have lots and lots of babies of color and they're going to lose their majority.  This is kind of counterintuitive to the whole white nationalism thing.  Which to me kind of shows that these guys do not think ahead at all at least not very well. 

 It's kind of like the whole anti-science agenda you want a great United States and yet you do everything you can to put sticks and sabot into the gears of science and progress.  This in turn weakens the United States and to becoming inferior to other countries."
"Oh no you mean the voters get to decide?
That's a Democrats worst nightmare"
its not like  women  are stopped from having  kids. the reason for this is too cause  discourse   .100%  divide and conquer .its the g o p party of the rich way post nixon. it works until they  screw things up so bad it dose not work.  if your not rich and want too decide   that you  own your body  you best stop voting the  slave maker party of the far right neo fascist  g o p .simple.
It's debates like this that ruin the political discourse in America. Trotting out a statement that abortion rights may not be on the ballot in November because it's not the #1 concern is incredibly condescending to the voting public.  People are capable of considering more than one policy topic you know.
"""11 states effectively ban abortion?"" Ah, so these are the 11 welfare states who love paying their poor women and men food stamps and checks and then sending their kids off to get slaughtered in the army."
"The dumb Supreme Court just gave the Democratic Party super majority in November and I love it.

At one time democrats called black people 3/5 human. I.e. a clump of cells
Use birth control.  It's not that tough.
Hail Gilead!
the constitution   is the rule of law. the  rich owned  g o p  are criminals and they  are  down to the hate vote as their only dependable  voting  block.  they know it and they  are not  giving the wealth they  stole  based on anything. if you are not rich and  cant hate people you  dont even know  and dont like  being broke  stop voting g o p . because  you are the rino  who they want too hunt.
When anyone “takes” away your rights you have the right to take from them ala American Revolution. That’s precedent and American AF!!!

"I'm old enough to remember the time before Roe. This is going to sound callous, but I think these state bans need to stay in place for a few years: long enough for women, particularly in red states, to get a bellyful — so to speak. Most people now alive don't remember what pre-Roe America was like. Now they're going to find out. Education is good!"
For a woman to vote republican is the same as the abused posting bail for her abuser.
This is going to be SO bad for Republicans.  Just the 65% voting blue will give the Senate the ability to codify into law a woman's right to choose nationwide.  VOTE in the mid-terms!!
Who the hell does the conservative Supreme Court judges think they are? The only reason that they did this is to keep capitalism the consumer and low wage tax payer strong for the future.. Telling you that you that authoritarian corpo-fascist ideology is in control cause the didn't want to financially help Americans that much they cut unemployment they cut and limited stimulus and try to blame the financial help that most of us hadn't seen in years no raise in the minimum wage assholes tried to cheat to keep a stupid fuck and a cheat in power cops shooting unarmed citizens and fuckers ducking and covering when one kid with one weapon is killing children and lying to the public about their response and heroism these people need to be taken out Trump his henchmen his stupid lying followers Congress needs to put term limits on Supreme Court judges any one who would flag a comment about Trump being taken out is part of them.remember his buddy is killing civilians in an illegal war.. Committing war crimes lies about election fraud created a coup that got people killed.. Fuck Trump and anyone follow him
Let the hillbilly inbreeding begin.
"As an African-American man, I honestly don't support abortion, with that said, I vehemently support and served for a decade defending one's personal and private right to choose.

I identified my race, because African-American women will suffer more than anyone due this this ruling.

I identified my sex, because I wanted to express that regardless if I was Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, African-American, I am a MAN, I should shut my damn mouth and stay in my lane when it comes to telling a women what to do and not to do with her body!"
"Perhaps its a good thing for red state economies.  

It will create lots of business for illegal abortionists, who will need: schedulers to set up the illegal appointments (probably working from out of state); assistants to dump the bleeding women in an alley, when the procedure has unforeseen complications; lawyers, to keep them out of jail...  A new cottage industry."
"To all women who value their privacy and decisions made between themselves and their doctors, and the men who agree with that, let's support states that support those rights. That includes tourist dollars, goods and services to shore up tax dollars to states that uphold women's rights. We are far from powerless and we know it."
"this is about saving white lives, the white population is declining significantly"

we need te court  to  decide  what the constitution  says.  people need to understand that  the congress can amend the constitution and the court must   do  as the  congress decides. in fact  its how  women got the vote.  how  the booze  prohibition  was ended  how  other then whites got the vote .how we  get  people  like mad donny   because  the 1804  congress  added the  electoral college   a deal between old white men. yes i now im an old white man. still not for me to say to  a women  she must give birth no matter what. SO  STOP VOTING G O P IF YOU WANT FREEDOM AND  RELIGION AND STATE APART.  way simple  dont vote  g o p .the new deal was  democratic  party  . it made us number one for over 50 years. we need a new new deal.vote  democratic  a few  elections and we will get one. it saved us before and it can save us again.
"""at conception it is a life""...

of course they want to fight. they just don't want to take responsibility for their actions. it's easier to slaughter babies than to keep their legs together.
Oklahoma is going to have a lot of rape and incest babies
It was never an abortion issue. It's about a womans right to self determination about her own body and her own life. Remove the first and how fast will the rest be removed. When I was younger my mother could not have her own credit card or even her own bank account. She had to Prove she couldn't get pregnant to get a mortgage loan for a house. Ect ect ect! The right has already stated birth control and IVF are the next on their list to be taken out.
Why is this bad for republicans
Democrats will educate the public on safe drug use but not safe birth control.
Women still have the freedom not to become pregnant Crazy Nancy.
The USA invented a time machine. Good job?
Just come for fun of f a k e news!! Hahahaha
"Based on the fact that these Trump/McConnell appointed Supreme Court judges obviously committed perjury (lied) under oath their decision to overturn Roe vs Wade should NOT stand, instead these judges should be held accountable and impeached for lying during their confirmation hearings."
That is so backwards. US is declining towards pre 60s mentality. Your conservatives are your Taliban destroying decades of female rights progression.

Why should any state get to force thier beliefs on another group of people .abortion should be a woman’s choice between her own conscience and her doctor.that’s true freedom.that’s separation of church and state. Why should republicans get to take away anybody’s right to thier freedom of choice politics should not play a part in abortion at all.the republicans claim they care about life of a child until that life is hunted down at school by the second amendment...if one woman wants an abortion she should ba able to get one and if another woman does not believe in it she doesn’t;t have to. It;s that simple.people who are for abortion are not telling people who are against abortion to have one it;s the other way around people who are against abortion are the one;s trying to force thier beliefs on people who are pro abortion and that is not right.
The left can’t define what a woman is much less define a person or life . This is the result . You lefties voted for big government and you got it . You guys preach “democracy” now you have it . You now get to vote in your state on abortion. That’s the democratic process. Welcome to America learn to cope
TALIBAN supreme court taken over women right ✅️ 😒 😴 🙄
"For all the money red states are spending on denying abortion, how much are they spending to help with childcare, a living wage, education, health care, and safe affordable housing? I’m guessing the contrast is stark. It’s talk to line their golden pockets. It’s never been about abortion."

It shouldn't be the mainstream democratic party job to fight an extremist party. 

We need a three-party system with a confident progressive party that will fight back the extremism coming from the right feverishly under a different banner without having to drag mainstream democracy in the mud. 

This new party should be a new yellow-party head up by Bernie, AOC and Elizabeth Warren! Together they could raise a good amount of money to start a new party off."

The Supreme Court has just unleashed the Twilight Zone! Oklahoma; have you lost your Fckn minds? Criminalizing Women's Reproductive rights? This is such insanity! GQP have lost their Collective minds!
"Oh, so you banned firearms?  Great!!   Oh, wait.....my bad.  I guess our school kids are still the best subjects for target practice with weapons of mass destruction.   Anyway, congratulations to all Oklahoma women - you are now listed at the bottom of the food chain - just below plankton.   You will have to look above your position to see microscopic human embryos."
This is brought to you by the same people that ended free lunch for children.
Banning things dont mean there a going away. So what are the GOP doing to prevent unwanted pregnancies: absolution not sexual health education i guess as they did under the Bush administration. You need to understand that many democratic countries are not taking The US seriously anymore.
"Lol, this story is so easily verified false.
The court ruled that Texas has the constitutional right to limit abortion after a heartbeat is detected. CNN is listing Texas as “banning all abortion”. NOT TRUE!
In Texas abortion before a heartbeat is still legal.
How many lies does it take to show how dishonest this network is.
The courts heard this case because the Left challenged the “heartbeat law”. Roe failed because the left’s desire to have zero limits applied to abortion."
Is divorce still legal in US??
"In 1861 republicans put an end to Democrats slavery and dehumanization of blacks.

In 2022 republicans have put an end to the democrat eugenics program called abortion where children are labelled clumps of cells and have their brains mutilated in the womb."
Is the womb really the safest place to be Oklahoma??  What about drugs or alcohol?  There are some women that need help and can’t get it!  Why add a pregnancy to this serious issue??
Now we know why Trump surrendered to the Taliban:  He IS the Taliban...
It isn't the end of the world just less rights for women and their government telling them what to do.

Should i be alarmed or am I overreacting?"
"Oklahoma had better build more orphanages and more prisons. 
The unwanted children born today will be the prison population of tomorrow. Women will money will simply travel out of the state to obtain abortions."
"I hope men in those states will dutifully stand outside the Govt office at airports, and state lines waiting for their wives and daughters to pee on a stick to determine if they are pregnant. Can't travel outside state lines cuz they might get an abortion."

From now on i will refer to the US as the Divided States of America
"Imagine you are blind but you think you can see. You've spent your whole life in this condition until one day, someone approaches you and asks, ""Would you like me to remove your blindfold?"" You reply, ""But I'm not blind!"" Actually, yes you are. Spiritually. Only once your blindfold is removed and you give your life to Jesus Christ will you realize you've lived your life in utter darkness. Hopeless and destined for an eternity in hell. But it doesn't have to be that way because Jesus loves you and died in your place so that you can live forever with Him. Sin causes blindness that separates you from the saving light of Christ. When you repent of your sins and accept His sacrifice on the cross, He removes your blindfold. We are approaching some really dark times ahead according to Bible prophecy. Now is the time to wake up and see what's going on. You can have peace instead of fear and joy instead of depression. Please give Him your life before it's too late. I'll be praying for the removal of your blindfold. God Bless."
"Liberals will need to learn about contraception, abstinence, or anal sex!"
Those children end up dying in school gun shooting
Racist and misoginist those states.
They need to band abortion in all states. There is such a thing as birth control pills condoms you can have a shot so you don't get pregnant. It is against the law for mother to murder her child but because it is in her that's okay. At 5 months the child was pretty much formed. Just because a woman is in responsible and gets pregnant then she has the right to murder her child I don't think so. Need to change Nationwide and ban abortion
I am sure that these states are all proud of themselves.  Let's see how they react when their mistress or teenage daughter needs an abortion? See the law doesn't just apply to democrats.

"Dems foolishly pretended the GOP were pro-democracy, & acted on that misplaced belief.
So, therefore, we're at a place where, we must expand to balance the SC, abolish the filibuster AND, immediately thereafter, codify voting rights protections, then, with real votes COUNTED, win elections.
Democratic policy builds a middle class, our only hope to thrive as a nation.
The Dems have waffled in denial for too long. We may be out of time--immediately, abolish the filibuster and expand SCOTUS to balance, or we literally lose American's fundamental DEMOCRACY.
The ignorance, cynicism, & denial of too many MILLIONS of Americans is horrifying. 80 million eligible voters DID NOT VOTE. Yet, they fully expect their lives to improve---if they don't start voting, and Voting pro-democracy, Blue, the Constitution becomes a mere artifact."

Where are the questions to/about the men/boys, without whom girls and women cannot get pregnant??? Whether immature teenage boy or grown man they experience  no physical consequence. No change in hormones. No physical change. No labour, birth, lactation etc etc.  He can continue education, career as if nothing happened! A girl/woman's pregnancy and birth, lactation, child-caring will ALWAYS set her back in education, job opportunity, healthcare, pension etc etc"
Extra humans for America this is what they want
"CNN is fake news thats why their ratings are so low. Democrats wanna kill baby's, disarm law abiding citizen, turn children gay, abonden women by saying their is no such thing as a women, they wanna destroy the constitution and turn us into a Communist country"
"This is so weird. Guns and abortions kill life. That's their only purpose. Why are they treated separately? You can't blame politicians, they are only doing what they are hired to do.
This is all on citizens. You need to meditate on this. Make it make sense."

BTW - mothers of girls of all ages who live in those states: Enroll your girls in the track team TODAY. They will need to be able to run fast and run far.
"These ""pro life"" extreme right-wingers say they even oppose the elimination of a one month old embryo which has not taken a definite life form and cannot think or see or act in any manner. That embryo should not be eliminated even for the protection of the mother. That means they really don't care about the 'life' of the mother. Moreover, these same people most fervently support the use of guns even by children for so called self-protection. But the vast number of gun related deaths happen in the US are not incidences of self-protection but mass shootings, violent gun crimes and aggravated assaults. These 'pro life' people really don't care about those tens of thousands of 'lives' as well. These same right-wing people are big supporters of the US military and their numerous wars around the world. What about the millions of 'lives' killed in those wars? They really don't cared about those million lives as well. It seems, in real terms, they are very much ""anti-life""."
GOOD !!! some of these foolish women use abortion for another way of birth control !!!
"Don't be misinformed. This is not about dem or republican, not about black or white, equal rights, or even just about abortion. It is about an unseen battle going on between light and darkness.

Why would anyone want to be born to someone who doesnt want them ? So take of the future mothers then adopt them out to parents who are new born with drug or other problems to begin with. One drug lady can get 10 kids pimp them while getting welfare free housing free medical care . Or better yet ophans who cant get a family will get them when their crack head adopted padents go to jail. End up instuationed for life. Better lets lock the insame up like them were before.  Get a bunch of wire clothes hangers as plastic has replaced most and break while giving abortions. The law will change back when the goverment ( rich) realize how much money their loosing with clinics closed. Why do you think probation was revoked?  Your loosing money. Who gives a sht that peopleike to fk. Thats what makes the world go round !

You can’t have an abortion but you can shoot your kids😵‍💫
I hope women remember this when it's time to vote.  Republicans demand you have that child so they can murder it when it gets to elementary school.

Should a woman be more responsible with her body before needing an abortion? Is abortion murder of a child? Is the baby in her belly a living life? Should a woman use her right to choose before she is in a position to abort her baby? Are woman using abortion as a form of birth control?

"It is horrible, obviously, but it is also fascinating. These politicians must be sure that doing this will help them in the upcoming elections, even though polls indicated that the vast majority of voters is against abortion bans. So ... do these politicians know something that we don't know? To me, this seems like political suicide, and totally unnecessary: They could still do all those horrible things after the midterms. They waited since 19873, surely they could wait half a year more.
Intriguing.

So why doesn't Biden issue an executive order to protect abortion rights? I'm asking as a British viewer. My knowledge of American politics is limited.
Jesus is not pleased that so many are fighting to kill unborn children. Remember Satan  killed babies to try to prevent the birth of Moses and Jesus. Being born poor is better than being killed. How many great people rose from poverty and achieved great things. Birth from assault is less than 1% of abortions. What if the father wants the child? Do they have any rights?
"I lived through the last time abortion was illegal. The ""chiropracter"" across the street was running an illegal abortion clinic for years. The other fellow up the street was his ""assistant"".

Good job guys, way to go. America gets dumber and dumber every year.."
LOL they act as if voting rights haven't been blocked at every level.
Interesting that Oklahoma Goes straight to law enforcement strategies instead of health and social support of those who would have had their abortions legally and safely otherwise. Nothing about recognising the injustice of natural abortion events being safeguarded from law enforcement agencies. Force is the operative word and clear intention. Life is precious and God is good - I don 't think so!
"USA has lost the moral ground of accusing other countries of human rights violations.  In many countries, abortion is protected by law, not court decision.  USA just join a few countries in the world that abortion is banned or restricted.  Countries from Japan to India to Canada, as well as most of Europe, women can safely access abortion either on request or based on broad social or economic grounds."
A state can't ban a pregnant woman from traveling out of state for an abortion
So that means you flakes have 39 states yall can move too so you can toss your baby's out. 🤔  get moving.
"If the SCOTUS decision was based on federal over-reach on an issue they said belonged to the states, how can they turn around and make a federal ban? They claimed this was not even about abortion. How can states take their laws and try and exert them in other states? This is stupid on steroids. Women should realize this is an attack on their autonomy and equality regardless if they themselves would access an abortion. These absolute bans can affect their daughters, grandchildren, sisters, and nieces. Imagine rape, incest, and the health of the mother all being ignored by MEN who are more concerned with how many white babies can they FORCE women to have."

The way this panel speaks as like a joke
"When Texas passes a law that says anyone traveling to ANOTHER state to get an abortion will be prosecuted, that's what we call OVERREACH.

The current Supreme Court is most definitely NOT ‘conservative’. They are radical, reactionary, fascists (at least the perjurious five who voted to cancel Roe v Wade); enemies of progress, humanity, humanism, science,  and democracy…and anti-conservatives.

I still can't get over these hypocritical Republicans confirming Amy Coney Barrett as a conservative justice for the Supreme Court bench after the passing of Justice Ginsburg in the middle of an election, and during the pandemic, not to mention they were OK with her lying under oath about Roe V. Wade. This country is heading into dark times, and the Republicans are to blame for this. When it comes to the Republicans, it's ""freedom for me, and none for thee."" On that note, they need to remove ""land of the free"" from the lyrics to ""Star Spangled Banner"", because this country is far from free, and it's all because of the Republicans."

Essentially the people who support this are the same people who are likely to dissolve responsibility when children are being born into poverty.
Next up...election decertification

Good! Several more to come soon!
"Hooray!

Hopefully some personal responsibility will make a comeback!

Stop spreading your legs ya sloots!"
Honestly every state that has passed their bans still have law written to save the life of the mother so that's good
"Anyone who votes Republican has no right to complain about this. Republicans, as a whole, have never hidden their agenda. Voters said, ""Oh, they say they want to overturn Roe, but it could never happen."" The GOP understands the political game better than Dems."
It's official. USA no longer has a supreme court. Just another branch of political parties. SAD.
"To USA Women ... migrate to Australia. We love you. You have freedoms here that give you control of your own bodies. Also, a great Country to raise your kids ... there are NO School mass killings of your child (30 so far in USA, and we're only 1/2 way through the year ... 40,000 Gun related deaths in USA, EVERY YEAR, virtually ZERO in Australia), we have affordable Health Care for you, and no-one loses their House over Medical bills in Australia.
Great beaches, great cities, great life styles. Why live in a Country that does NOT respect your freedom?"

They don't even listen to doctors and scientists about when life begins. After birth they vote against every proposal to help mothers and children live. That's NOT pro-life!!!"
"I am not American but saw on piece about this on the international news. They were reporting that the US is no longer a free country because they have lost basic human rights to healthcare and privacy. This is terribly sad as the US used to be a respected nation. I support my American friends who are fighting for their freedom- you have international support- don’t give up.
Edit: The news was also reporting Ireland was in a similar situation years ago. They got the United Nations involved under international torture laws (forced birth being a form of torture). Perhaps it is an avenue for your country to explore as well."
ALL REPUBLICAN STATES. ITS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF WHAT THIS SUPREME COURT WILL TAKE AWAY FROM WOMEN .
Look at it this way. I’m a few years actual murder will probably be legal. Then we can wrap up a lot of issues a lot faster.
If women stopped having unprotected sex disease will go down too.
Mostly RED STATES ....GO FIGURE STUPID REPUBLICANS.
"We need to stop letting people get away with the idiotic ""life begins at conception"" myth. It is not a medical or scientific construct. Calling a fertilized egg an ""unborn child"" is stupid. I guess it makes conservatives feel morally superior. Now, that moron thomas wants to go after same-sex marriage. I thought it was a great example of societal progress, that, after Obergefell, people accepted it and moved on. It became a non-issue. Create more hate, clarence!"
Gawd dam conservatives are deplorables.

And it was the right decision to let the states decide they can still go to Democrat States it's just like everything in California causes cancer well all the other states disagree with you
"So stop and think about this.. If a woman cannot prove rape and she gets pregnant, she has to then go to court with her rapist and have a custody agreement. How is that ok? We have that going RIGHT NOW because the rapist is well connected in their town he got FULL CUSTODY of his rape victims child and she had to pay child support to her rapist! Are you guys out of your damn mind? So sitting in a room with men now women aren't equal with rights... Wtf is wrong with you Talibangelists?? Are men going to start being made to pay child support at conception too???"

"If these people are so pro-life then, why are they not adopting children out of orphanages? I know why it's because they don't want the children either. And that's why abortions should be legal."
"It is disgraceful what USA have done ... taking the freedom from Women. This is a Human Rights abuse and should be looked into by the UN.

Unheard of in a developed Country.

"Also, I'm pretty sure some women choose to seek abortions just to stay alive themselves, it's not to allegedly ""murder babies"" like Republicans claim. If the mother dies, the baby dies anyway, but Republicans didn't think about that either. Idiots."
"Always remember this and what republidiots  did.
And we need to show up in Nov
And get rid the idiots so they can't continue to take our rights away"
The party of small government and more freedoms has scared the living shit out of their base about liberals taking away their freedoms using big government for decades. This ruling is the antithesis of what the Republican party are supposed to stand for. This party of radical hypocrites believes their right supercedes the right to choose for the other 70%.
Well maybe if Democrats would have treated the judges a little nicer instead of putting them through a circus this wouldn't have happened did you think they forgot karma's a b**** and as far as abortions go with the rising inflation and recession they couldn't afford an abortion or the gas to get there

It's time to review and revamp all these small amendments and create a proper and definitive declaration of Human Rights in your country just like the majority of the Nations around the world have done decades ago.

This will result in young girls and women being butchered up and dying. A lot of misery for incest victims and rape victims. Shameful for a country like USA. America have their own religious fanatic Taliban…WOUW

The problem with people who believe in abortion is that they have a real big issue with when  an unborn child call can be called a human being.When does an unborn child go from being a foetus to a human being ?.Where is the cut off point? If a baby is half way in its mothers birth canal and half way out is it human? If a baby is no different 5 mins or five hours or five days before its born but for the fact that it is now outside the womb and its umbilical cord is cut is it now only considered human? When does it go from foetus to human being? People who belive in abortion really need to answer that Question.Im sure people who believe in abortion like being alive at this moment in time but yet say its ok to abort an unborn child if it needs be.An unwanted pregency is a hard thing for any womann no doubt but its not the end of the world and there are services that can help women in this difficult time im there lives and yes abortions happen more in less well of parts of society then in richer parts.The testimony of a former abortion doctor Dr Anthony Levatino to congress a few years ago is worth watching if your so sure abortion is a womans right to choose.
More to come.  Yay!
Time for all women to close up shop

You are a hateful, miserable force determined to force YOUR religious views on others who do not share them.

Always remember, democrats use us for votes. They want us to think Africa is poor too because if all black people left they wouldn't ever win another election.
 They put abortion clinics in black areas & sell the bodies.
 They use SA & poor families as an excuse for killing babies so, If your father is a criminal you should die? 
You have 3 million men in prison so, Should all those children of father's in prison just disappear?
America is lost the plot.

"Ask all the woman who support abortion how many they have had. I can bet you whatever amount, that most have never had one and many have no kids or just 1, maybe 2. So then ask, HOW is it possible to NOT have numerous abortions or several kids. It's called PROTECTION. Why in God's name do you people not push for safe sex? If the woman AND the man use protection the cahnces of become pregnant is ALMOST zero, very very very rarely if at all, will a pregnancy happen."

A show trial is a public trial in which the judicial authorities have already determined the guilt or innocence of the defendant. The actual trial has as its only goal the presentation of both the accusation and the verdict to the public so they will serve as both an impressive example and a warning to other would-be dissidents or transgressors.[2]

Pretty funny when the freedoms where already very limited in the first place, owning a gun was mainly the only one and that one is shared by lots of countries that also have affordable healthcare, childcare, good pensions right to organize. Soon contraceptives and minority rights will be gone, voting will be extremely hard if you are not a white evangelical fascist. Guys, do you really think voting doesn’t matter and both parties are the same, from my perspective I can actually see a slight difference! the big divider is Juridical laws or Religious laws. Right now Christian shariah laws are winning, abandoning the abortion law was a religious ruling."

Abortion is not and never was a constitutional right.

It was because of women that they won their voting rights. It was because of women that ended the Vietnam war with bringing our sons home. It’s always women that repair the damage that powerful spiteful man due to this country and worldwide. There are now two different United States. There are the United States with the US Constitution and there are fascist states that disregard the US Constitution. Those fascist states happen to be Christian. Don’t let them secede from the United States. Expel the fascist states from the United States. It’s war that they want.

“We all want progress. But progress means getting nearer to the place where you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turn then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man. There is nothing progressive about being pig-headed and refusing to admit a mistake. And I think if you look at the present state of the world it's pretty plain that humanity has been making some big mistakes. We're on the wrong road. And if that is so we must go back. Going back is the quickest way on.” - C. S. Lewis
"Why isn't cnn covering the riots? Or will they pass them over as ""mostly peaceful protest"" lol"
Children in these states are NOT safer. They are now endangered more because predators know they can rape a child and force her to birth his child. Unwanted children will be neglected and abused. This made children and women more at risk and gave power to the predators and men.
"Governments should start payment child support for every new pregnancy..   if is a life at 1 week, then pay the mother for that child."

If you don't like the abortion laws in your state.    Move.... very simple.    Leftist socialist are too stupid to realize that.

"Evil Evengenital Kkkristian Republickkklans wrath against women was inevitable. Their fight against abortion was made through trillions of dollars of tax breaks for the Christian churches. They get $1 trillion worth of tax breaks every 12 years. That adds up. What the fuck do you think they’ve done with it? They’ve stacked the goddamn Supreme Court. It’s time to end tax exempt status for churches, Since they used it politically. Fuck the Christian churches with political power."
Ask yourself 'Why now?'. Why has SCOTUS chosen this timing to start revoking rights? Thomas has made it known that same sex marriage/adoptions and birth control/contraception is next. The SCOTUS which is there to interpret the law has been politicized and weaponized against the majority of Americans. This cannot stand!
If a clump of cells is now considered a person can  we now get life insurance for that person.
To the Midwestern states.Staying your ass at home= Trump+ conservative judges= Ban on abortion. Your fault Demofucked.

AND YOU MITE NOT BE ABORTED WHILE YOU GROWN!!!!!

O"
Big shout out to all the abortion protestors that got arrested.  Let's go Karen
"How's Build Back Better going?
What was built back better???
Is ANYTHING better now than when Trump was in office?"
Court took this decision based on religion instead of being neutral
Sad republicans telling people what to do with their healthcare? Wow! Republicans want more laws and a bigger government?!?
No one lost any rights. How is CNN still in business?
This will only help the black community this black woman is paid to misinform her own community🤦🏾‍♂️
🍺🍺🍺🍺 for every Liberal going 🦍 😡
"Bye Roe vs Wade 👋
Cnn does more race baiting than Joy Reid"
"Colorado has abortion through the 9th month.
Enjoy!"
All three of trumps appointments for the court lied under oath and said they felt Roe v Wade was settled case law. And yet here we are. All three lied under oath to get the appointment.
"Good 👍. At least one good thing happened during the Biden Administration  term of office. 
And killing babies is NOT A RIGHT."
"Let’s see the financial plan for taking care of all these forced births?  This will increase poverty, depression, deaths, prison for children now known as foster care, disease.  This was never about women having body autonomy, it’s about power, hate and control of the majority of Americans."
And they will lose voter and tax revenue as people move away from their tyranny. Republicans effectively ended their careers this week.
"Our Founders warned us that our great freedoms were only fit for a moral and ethical society and one only needs to look at the headlines to see the Founders were correct. Thanks in part to Roe, we are no longer a moral and ethical society. It is high time we started on the road back to personal responsibility. SCOTUS nudged us a little in that direction."
No abortions = more welfare mothers and more foster children = higher taxes.
so DAD now you have an 18+ year sentence as well . Child support at a minimum
Taking away rights most likely never good. They can do this because it affects the poor.
"Truly, If any American actually understood the definition of Conservatism. They would find out it is the fundamental antithesis to what it means to be American.  Truly our nation is regressing under these Conservative "" Justices """
Child support really needs to start at the first missed period.
"Hay men pray for the health and safety of your woman because yours depends on it, oh and we are working on taking some rights from you."
I'm sure you guys are real proud huh.
ameristan........like Afganistan but with bacon
"I find ironic what the GOP christian conservatives did to undocumented children at the border and yet in the same breath say that the life of an undocumented unborn child is more important than abortion rights of a us citizen. Truth is, this is about religious fascism. We the people shouldn’t have to be forced to conform to christian idealism."
"31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: HOLY BIBLE"
"26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; --HOLY BIBLE"
abortion yes 👍👍👍
No state has made abortion illegal
gather around men and don't sleep with ugly women
the majority of women are against killing the unborn.
why do women scream like banshees to kill their own?
RIP to the 65+million babies aborted since 1973
I want abortion/murder to be illegal in all 50 states. The only case where it would be considered would be if the mother and baby were both gonna die guaranteed in childbirth. But it would be an emergency thing and not something anyone could do.
Muslims take religion seriously and in Russia but not the west
One night stand vs gay a difference
Good from trump
I would ban abortion in the UK unless it’s extreme circumstances
Im having 5 children Im transforming my life
Italy should ban abortion and Japan should
Don’t complain about fertility
"This reporter is so ignorant, there is no Constitutional right to abortion, never was!"
How can women be so damn stupid!!! Giving up their own rights as WOMEN!!  This is a woman's right!!
This moment will go down in history ❤
"I'm adamantly in favor of legal abortion at anytime for any reason. However, I'll make a deal with you all. Pass laws that make vasectomies mandatory for *ALL* men and boys of puberty age nation wide, and have it enforced to the letter. No exceptions. He can have his vasectomy reversed when him and his partner are *both* ready to have children and will be legally obligated to get a vasectomy again once his partner gets pregnant. Then, and only then will I co-sign banning abortion with acceptions for minors and health complications of the woman or fetus. To be clear; When I say health complications I mean right when the problem is dected, and not waiting until the woman is on death's doorstep.

That person in the thumbnail nial needs to thin those thick, ugly eyebrows!"
"it is not freedom to kill a child, it is murder."
The pro choice supporters are unhinged and embarrassing. The liberals get worse and worse every year.
Hoes mad 😭🙏
Abortion is not a constitutional right.
Great win!   Babies can live.  Like all the abortion rights folks can live
"Bruh, imagine crying because you can't kill your unborn child anymore. 😂"
Women do abortion for the health of themselves and they will only be killing something not even resembling a human. It’s not like that kid is going to be the next Albert Einstein or Alan Turing. You call this progressing? I call this one step into a dystopian country.
"I believe abortion should be banned except in last resort emergencies and there should be no government funding of abortions. Getting rid of Roe V Wade actually secured women’s right by giving women the right to be born. 

And of course the pro choice and pro abortionists are angry they are always angry about one thing or another"
Blessed be God
"The idiots who said ""my body my choice"" failed to uphold that principle across the board and only doing so when it suited them, and now their hypocrisy has come back to haunt them. No mistake, this is a bad move, but ultimately for the worthless and inept feminist movement is their chickens coming home to roost."
*Texas left the chat*
2:00. The Court is not the right place to “expand[] freedoms.” Period
"Fortunately, the re-criminalisation of abortion in Canada through legislative and/or judicial means will never see the light of day.  Evidently, abortion has long remained a 'proverbial' third-rail of Canadian politics."
Lady are you nuts? The unborn are separate people from the mother. Unborn human lives matter.
Imagine being mad because you can’t kill a baby
Thank God! This is the greatest news of my generation!!!
"4:43.  Well, of course people who kill babies ought to go to jail.  They ought to get the death penalty.  ☠️"
"Since when is it a right to kill a baby in the womb: where is the baby's right?  ""the right to choose is the right to murder a baby - a living human life in the womb"".  All of these people even the reporters will have to give an account to God."
FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT. I want stuff that I can upload youtube to get hits off of and make money from
"""WOMEN ARE ****ED!!!!"" - No, LEFTISTS are ****ed. REAL women don't care because they're not the immoral, baby-murdering SCUM that you are!!!! REAL women are sickened by abortion."
Never have I seen people SO despondent about not being able to murder innocent children. The immorality of the modern American Left is beyond anything I've ever seen in my ample study of history. Genghis Khan slaughtered children without hesitation nor remorse. Is there a difference here?
"Look at all those women protesting against ""women's rights"""
"""I should be able to f*ck with zero fear of responsibility! If that means killing an inconvenient child then so be it! It cant be wrong if its legal!!!""

These fools would have been spitting on slavery abolitionists. Non-christian post-abortive here. So my perspective kind of trumps so many of their pro-abortion talking points.

Thank God for this step in the right direction. I disagree with 99.9% of abortions, but can at least concede to debate it for the extreme outliers that they love to tout as the reasons it should be legal."
Where them ladies husbands at. They need to grab them and settle them down. Aint no way my wife be embarrassing me like that in public without getting a spankin.
"These people are possessed!
They want to satisfy their sexual desires without facing any consequences. There is no argument to support abortion."
Someone best tell these women about condoms or the fact he can pull out 😂. If they hadn’t treat abortion like a contraceptive and wanting to do it in the 3rd trimester then it might not have been overturned. My body my choice 😂. Where was that with covid jab 😂😂
LOL everyone in the comments so based
"LETS END THIS STUPID DEBATE BY MAKING IT AN ISSUE FOR ONLY WOMEN TO VOTE ON, THEN LIVE BY THE OUTCOME !"
W. Pro life. Finally atleast some babies will be saved from these murderous monsters
"Would you agree, that without one's ""health, Safety and Welfare"" that The right of the people to be secure in their ""persons"" cannot be assured? 

Would you also agree that the basic foundation of Healthcare is about ones 'Health, Safety and Welfare"" and therefore it is implicit in Amendment 4 Persons. 

Would you further agree, that being that Abortion has been an accepted medical practice for over 50 years in us history, that Thomas's assertion that it is unconstitutional can be outflanked by those who actually know the US Constitution?

To outflank Thomas, According to Amendment 10, Amendment 4 and the Bill of rights is superior law to the States adhoc that were post Thomas assertion, for persecuting people. 

Hence these state laws would have no traction - if the Dems had the MOJO to USE THE US CONSTITUTION IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE!"
"POV: ""Constitutional right to abortion"" Where does it exactly say that killing babies is a right?"
“Fundamental right” says Biden. How can anyone stand with a straight face saying that killing a baby is in any way a “right”?
Murdering babies shouldn’t have ever been legal.
"Poor liberals, now they  cant murder babies anymore."
"It's a bit bias. I honestly came to listen and not have an opinion but it's so bias. I just can't. Sure pro life person didn't completely answer the question, but she did put down her standing. It seems non negotiable. Her stance is similar to make sure gender are equal we should kill the other gender. I'm not saying that's what she's saying, just an example of what I think of her stance. Now she did bring up a point abortion is mainly a social problem of what society might have become and social issues shouldn't be paid in the children's lives. She should have asked the pro choice about that"
"Human sacrifice has been there for thousands of years, the length of existence doesn't make it right."
"I was never more proud to be a conservative than I was the day the Dobbs ruling was handed down. What a glorious day that was. I’m a young guy. I’m not a lawyer or a judge or a politician. But if my vote and my yearly donations to pro-life organizations played even a small role in making this possible, I am content."
this is good now people have to be responsable
KIDS THEN WHY DO YOU NOT RALLY TO SUE ALL ORGANIZED RELIGION THEN WHY I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU WHEN YOU DO NOT RALLY TO STOP COPS AND POLICE UNIONS FOR THE FACT SO MANY HAVE DIED BY POLICE SHERIFF FBI STATE TROOPERS CROSSFIRE BUT ITS A STANDARD OF DISARM EVERYTHING THAT IS DUMB SUE AND PETITION TO STOP CENTURIES OF CHILD ABUSE THAT IS THE REAL ONES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT OWNS ALL THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OWNS ALL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ITS THE ONE THAT THINK THEY HAVE A RIGHT STILL TO TELL YOU WHAT TO DO WHILE IF YOU DONT LISTEN AND REALIZE DISARMING THE ORDINARY CITIZENS IS SO STUPID GET READY WHEN USA ENDS UP BOMBED THEN WHAT WILL ALL OF YOU DO OH THATS RIGHT YOU ALL RALLIED UP FOR NO MORE 2 AMENDMENT RIGHTS ALL OF YOU IDIOTS RALLY FOR ABORTIONS INSTEAD OF ADOPTIONS AND OR SENDING THE FETUSES TO LABS TO HELP TRY AND GIVE THEM TO MOTHERS NEEDING AND WANTING CHILDREN
All fine and dandy until the courts are dealing with more children than they can support because parents didn't want the kid and had to decide keep or give uo for adoption.   until there are more parents in jail due to child abuse. Until all these unwanted kids become the problem of our country.  Don't agree or disagree with abortion.  It's a sad reality that noone is going to win.
Weird to see women out in the streets squealing for the right to rip their unborn babies apart limb by limb.
It was never constitutional to begin with.
The united states government can't stop killed they killed people everyday even americans and non-americans
"Right you can be executed but can't get an abortion? 

Logical 🤪🙃"
"Is it wrong to wish gang rape on a person? I mean, I just wanna see the look on HER mangled face when SHE can't have an abortion."
Bunch of baby killers on the lib side.
"God formed us in the womb, as we read in Psalm 139. It should be a protected place, as God designed us. If people claim to be Christian and also say they are pro-abortion (substitute their euphemistic term) then that is a massive contradiction. Exodus 20 - don't kill. God bless you Americans who have realised that, and we need more here in Europe!"
"the will of the people is to have abortions?
then why are so many states banning it?"
"These woman’s minds are so warped. They put the emphasis of choice and rights at a wrong juncture. Their right is to choose a proper mate and to choose a proper person to take their panties off for NOT to take their panties off for random multiple men and then kill an innocent infant because they were immoral in their decision making. That is NOT woman power. Woman’s power is in creation not destruction. Woman - love your self! Males you are not manly because you have tones of notches on your belt! It is not manly to string multiple woman along, its gross. Males respect your selves, respect your seed!"
"Wow, women now will have to think twice before laying up with CHAD or TYRONE without birth control."
No right to abortion
"polls?
like the ones that ""showed"" brits didn't want Brexit before they voted in favour of it"
"Well Biden, unlike you, Trump actually kept his promises that he was elected for"
"taking liberties away?
what greater liberty than the right to live?"
"Here we go, have you guys ever heard of the book called Freakonomics? I'II cut to the chase when Roe v. Wade got institutionalized. There was an economic study done on the amount of criminals in incarceration, 20 years later, after Roe v. Wade got implemented the crime rate suddenly dropped/the people incarcerated. This means that if those parents would've been forced to have those children, they would've grown up poor and neglected, the most important parts when making a criminal. But 20 years later they weren't there. What does a good mother to for their child? They do what's best, and maybe what's best for some children is wiping them off the face of the fucking earth before they have chances to lead miserable lives with the rest of us!"
"The left: “Men shouldn’t have a say concerning an abortion!”
Also the left: “Men can get pregnant”
Oh, so now men can get pregnant but can’t make laws concerning what happens while they are pregnant!? 
The left: “stop using our own words to show how stupid we are!”"
"Truly unbiased reporting right here, award worthy."
Let The Foetus Killers Perish🔅
Abortion is not a right Channel 4.
Murder should never be a freedom.  How   would the left feel if abortion was only accepted if a women can prove she was raped with DNA evidence of the male who got her pregnant?  And also only in the case where a Dr can scribe that she will be in a horrible medical situation if she does not get one.  No other exceptions.  That will still be less than 1 percent.  Something tells me they would protest even more.
Great day
"You can over turn those rights, the difference is women can make themselves abort however they want to or need to.
You can't stop women from doing it causing an abortion onto themselves."
"What's an effective way to get Texas Lawmakers to change their view on abortion law?
Get their wives pregnant, if they have any."
If they want a abortion it should be just like cosmetic surgery if you want it you pay cash no free money or insurance accepted
Is abortion still allowed in the first trimester? If yes then what's the issue?
L+ratio+roe is gone+baby saved
"I am so happy it makes me sleep so good. I sleep on a puffy cloud, knowing you people are in pain because you cant have what you want"

How can and girl scream abortion is a human right...so sad
"3:40 if the majority of people wanted to bring back slavery, should USA bring it back? Obviously not. I don't care if even all America wanted to kill children, it still should be illegal. And praise the Lord Jesus, it now is."
"Women will just abort with pills. What is trump going to do, break into their houses? Lol."
I love that American women like killing babies.
I'll pay for any woman who want a abortion to travel to a legal state to get it done.  So FU all you states that made it illegal....guess I found a way around your state laws and a big SCREW YOU!!! LOL
Don't we want leftist woke liberal women to be first in line to end future voter's ? I say yes please. Hurry down there right now...
Now we can call it a Fetus shower instead of a baby shower. Congrats
So Glad Im next to Kansas
"Pro-Lifers be like: White, Male, Christian, Over 50 .

You aint having babies sir, your opinion is not valued."
"* GO BACK TO ALABAMA *
Is the only appropriate response to pro-lifers"
Scotus Based?
Still kinda insane seeing so many people upset over not being able to murder infants
"For crying out loud, you screaming pro-aborts. Women's rights are not just about abortion.  In fact, Women's rights didn't even begin with abortion in the conversation. If you really care about Women's rights, then start caring about the little women in the womb. Hey..., bald guy. 'a right that has existed for 50 yrs'... Think about the thousands of years previous when it wasn't legal..., and why it wasn't."
FJB..fool
God please save us for the world has been corrupted by Satan. If I become president I'll make a point just by banning anything with abortion and even condoms for a year. Can you live without lustful desires or will you take the chance to have a child?
"Scream, baby-killers, scream! 😂"
Abortion is not a right. It’s a medical service. You do however have a right to do whatever you want at home with a coat hanger. Good luck.
I could watch this all day lol
Abortion was never a constitutional right. And now it is up to what the citizens of each state vote to keep abortion legal or to make it illegal. Lefty overractionists
Liberal Americans are Brain washed Americans
"This is why women shouldn't be leaders in anything, when emotions take over they lose all logic and common sense. Show your emotions in the comments liberals. I know you can't help it after reading this LOL .... PS abortion is murder you psychopaths."
To the idiot reporter abortion is not a constitutional right no where in the constitution does it say that is a right what an idiot statement
"Channel 4 is known for its poor, biased reporting.
Nobody with any intelligence takes it seriously"
It wasn't ever a constitutional right you fucking lying retard
So wait please tell me why it is wrong to kill a child out side the womb but it's ok to kill one inside the womb thelifeof the 1 week old child is nodiffrent from a kid In the womb please explain to me all u pro abortionist
Bad reporting
why is women rights more important then a babies rights they should be the same
pro life for life
"Abortion gives women the ability to determine whether or not a man becomes a father, that's a lot of power to loose!"
"Roe v Wade passed 5 months ago and yet  women riots who think abortion should stay alive is so pathetic, it makes me laugh every time. Abortion is not a constitutional right. Never has, never will"
"Some of those women claim my body my choice,  it's your body but not your life you're taking and first of all they shouldn't blame the unborn baby for the irresponsible decision they made to get pregnant."
what if it was one of the supreme court people had a child that got pregnant by  force they would think differant about it
Which states made abortion illegal? The dems are fos only late term should and is illegal in some states. You can even cut your boys parts off if you wanted a girl.
Most of these woman should be ashamed there not using abortions  because they got took advantage of there partying sleeping around getting pregnant  then casually Aborting a human life after a long weekend making bad choices  or lying about it  people don’t take responsibility anymore they can all stand around yelling my body my choice but most of the time abortions are murder from a bad decisions.
Abortion is the death of an unborn baby. End of story
"They're gonna have to use birth control now and be accountable. 😥
What's the world coming to"
"They talk about women's rights, women's right to choose, what about the rights for the unborn babies? So sad that too many babies did not live because of their mother's decision to abort them."
Jippy it is a win for poor baby's
I drink your feminist tears. *SHHLURRRRP!* I drink them up!
"Whenever I hear people talk about this case it's always about what they think should be allowed morally, rather than looking at what the Dobs v Jackson is actually about. The decision wasn't based around what is right or wrong, but instead it's the question of ""should the government be allowed to tell states what laws to hold on abortion?"" To prevent the government from having too much power, states tend to make most of their own laws apart from the federal government, and abortion laws vary greatly from one state to another. Most states allow abortion up to 24 weeks, and in New York it can be at full term. Personally, I'm fine with abortion being legal, but not at full term. But that's just my opinion, and my opinion isn't the issue here. The issue is about who should decide what all the definitive laws on abortion should be in each state. Should the individual states be forced to adopt laws based on the bigger government's desires?"
The Biggest Rally in the World is from the Pro Life Movement.. therefore the Supreme Court speaks for the Majority of the American people.
Just because you put rights in front of something it doesn’t make it right
"Oh no...my state made abortion illegal,  I guess they win and I'm going to have to have this baby. Oh wait...I know..I'll just travel to a state to where it's legal to get it done....ROFLMAO"
I love all the comments here by anti abortion people who completely ignore the fact that the only thing this did was make people who want it travel to a state where it's legal to get it done..
Where was the energy for voting ??? 😂😂😂fuckin women bruh
"There are two things a person should never be angry at, what they can help, and what they cannot."
"Love how the Pro-Abortion women are saying “The women are mad!”, as if all women agree with this smh. Trust me there’s probably more women in favor of Pro-Life then you."
"“We lost our freedoms”, look on the bright side, now millions of babies have the freedom of life 😁"
"I love how 95% of the Pro-Abortion protesters have never even had an abortion, or will ever even get one."
"Why is the punishment only on the women? Some men lie, some are married and creating single parent homes elsewhere circumstances are different for everyone."
Look how they portray the pro lifers as the crazy ones 🤣 and the baby killers as oppressed victims.
I see  on one hand with a lot of women are happy that this is gone only the crazy little women who wants to kill babies are mad he probably want to sacrifice the babies that they killed to the devil I'm not surprised if they do
She shouldn’t really worry about abortion not with those eyebrows.
The hypocrisy of baby killers.
A great day for protection of the most innocent who do not have a voice in this!
Hoes mad x 24
"Funny how these “MY BODY, MY CHOICE” protesters are the same people ridiculing ANTI-VAXXERS for not getting a shot. Whatever happened to MY BODY, MY CHOICE? 😅"
"""Pro-life” believers say it’s about saving a human life, but it is not. It is about the pregnancy. If they cared about human life, they would pour energy into robust development of adoption agencies, social support for needy families, education, and general welfare of all children so no child would be born with the risk of poverty and poor educational opportunities.Pro-life is all about forcing everyone to the same set of rules. Kind of like forcing women to wear a burka and only travel in the company of a male relative.If the anti-abortion people really cared about reducing abortions rather than forcing people to abide by their rules, they would work to make family planning and contraception free to all women in the United States (and vasectomies for men). If there are no unwanted pregnancies, the number of abortions would plummet.John Messmer, MD, Hummelstown, Pa.“Pro-life” is not about saving a life | PennLive letters https://share.newsbreak.com/21y2awlv"

"Those pro-abortions who are terrified about the roe vs wade overturn, have never been loved"
"The constitution doesn’t protect abortions, it doesn’t have any amendment or right stating it, this “news” agency needs its credentials removed"
Make a short story short for those who think murdering gods kids is ok.  They should be worried god doesn’t abort them. There are women who have had an abortion and know what they did is wrong under their father in heaven and pray for forgiveness and have a relationship with him. Then there is monsters who who have an abortion/murder gods children and spit on their father in heaven. You say God or Jesus and the demons come out of the wood work.
"abortion=murdered unless it is for medical reasons. 
those young zygotes or features also deserve the right to come to society even if it is just one minute and a taste of life.
and I promise you this, the supporters of this crime that, regret in the future is an understatement.
if the baby suffers because of coming to the wrong person, what do you think you will suffer. go and read about the consequence of abortion before you suffer from what you jump around the street and beg for  coming back to you in the harsh way possible.
this is my advice from a women to women."
The first major ruling going in the opposite direction? A little bit biased formulation isnt it?
LoL poor babies
"I thought men didn't have a say in this, or is that only if they aren't on the left."

I don't care if you Democrats don't like it. It's the law. Comply or face prison.
"All of you who think it is a women's  choice to kill a baby. Where is the child's right to live and its choice. Since when did we say it is okay to kill! Is it the child's fault that it was conceived?  As for women dying..
Look at the stats 2% of the abortions are incest,  rape, and molestation and women's health. So why are people fighting for the 98% who chose to lay with a man!!!!"
"In 2021 in New York City more African American babies died  in abortion clinics than were born in hospitals in New York City. The next time you hear any politician defend abortion being legal in America, please make them aware you are not a fool. Make the politicians aware you know abortion would never be legal in America if the same percentage of white babies died at abortion clinics."
"Question..
So why is a baby called a baby when you WANT to keep it, but called something else when you DON'T? Which one is it? Are you pregnant with a baby, or are you pregnant with a lump of tissue and cells in your womb? I'm thinking that people say this to appease their conscience, so not to feel so horribly guilty when it comes time to get an abortion. I mean seriously people, make up your mind all ready!"

Breaking someone's leg, so that it remains that way and it causing the person to be disabled forever."
"Or playing baseball, breaking the neighbor's window, and then refusing to pay for innocent neighbor's window to be fixed"

The Word of The Lord Spoken to Timothy
For All Those Who Have Ears to Hear


Thus says The Lord: 

Peoples of the earth, you have hated life, you have polluted My garden! Diseased and awful generation, you have destroyed the garden! And so I am come to cleanse, and to wipe away! I am come down, My face is very near! Do you feel the heat of My wrath, O ignorant and vain peoples?! You retain no knowledge at all! Only greed and wickedness, wickedness upon wickedness, passes before your eyes without ceasing, and oh how you love to have it so!
DEAD GENERATION, YOUR HEARTS ARE STONE! Day after day you build up wrath, the vessels overflow! Day by day, the bodies are stacked up in heaps! Day by day, the unborn are slaughtered, whole generations of people murdered without cause, multitudes of innocent cast off as refuse! Yet you think Me too harsh, and My punishments too severe, My judgments unfair.

I AM THE LORD, AND THIS IS MY EARTH!
THESE ARE MY CHILDREN!...
All you see, from the ground beneath your feet
To the farthest reaches of the universe, is MINE,
And I shall do as I please!...
I shall do according to the counsel
Of My own will,[2] for I am God!

Therefore, O peoples of the earth, because you have slaughtered the innocent and murdered your neighbor, lo, you have even made for yourselves laws that all may do their pleasure in unrighteousness and perform evil at their leisure, so then shall I also declare MY Law, and it shall fall hard upon the backs of all nations! Yea, I have put forth the decree and hasten to carry out your sentences, O peoples of the earth!
And what is the sentence, you ask?... Look upon the slaughtered innocent! Look upon their torn and broken bodies; behold how they are torn in pieces! See how their blood pours down and their limbs are strewn about! LOOK! Look how they are scraped out of their mother’s womb! Look upon the works of your hands, you evil and most wicked generation! LOOK UPON YOUR WICKEDNESS! LOOK UPON ALL YOU HAVE DONE!
Thus says The Lord God, Creator of Heaven and Earth: Because of this blood which remains on your hands, because of all the multitudes of slain you have piled up in heaps, because of the evil works of your hands in where you have agreed together, to both do and allow them, to make them law, THUS SHALL I IN LIKE MANNER DO UNTO YOU! IN LIKE MANNER SHALL YOU RECEIVE AT MY HAND!
Lo, even double shall you receive at My hand, and double again, until there is no place found that is not laid waste, until every land is polluted by the stink of rotting corpses! Both man and beast shall lie down in death together; they shall be as refuse upon the land! I shall tear down your cities and break apart all your dwelling places! I shall tear your leaders in pieces and pour out the blood of your mighty men upon the ground, until it reaches unto the neck![3]
Behold, all mighty and evil men shall be torn in pieces, with their limbs strewn about in the open fields and in the waste places![4] Behold, the great army, the astonishing company, the assemblage of nations who have come together to fight against The Holy One of Israel,[5] shall be broken in pieces without hand! For strong is The Lord, and sharp is the sword which proceeds from His mouth![6] Behold I, even I, The Lord of Hosts, shall scrape every last vestige of man and his inventions from the earth at the last day! For I am God, and the glory of My strength is revealed in My Holy One!

The glory of men must die!
Declares The Lord of Hosts,
The Only Creator, The God of Israel...
YES, I AM HE, YAHUWAH!...
Hurry now, those who hear!
Hurry now, those who know Me!
Hurry and kiss The Son![7]
Hurry now and kiss Me upon My face,
All you who know My name!...

"Cann we focus more on the problem of fertilizing chimp embryos with human genes? We do NOT need human chimp hybrids, Spending the money on that rn when our children have little odds of being able to have water in their 20’s is ridiculous.  I feel like Roe Vs. Wade is a distraction from the real problems, If you think abortions is the real problem in the world rn get ready to be traumatized.."
How women support having their own rights taken away is mind blowing.

"Too many pro abortion people, other than me prove their hypocrisy over the issue. Waaa waaa Roe was overturned they cry! How dare you politicians put bans on abortion! But they're hypocrits! I keep shouting there should be NO restrictions. Restrictions for abortion are stupidly  fine by most pro abortion people! I'm outraged and have said it at the time heartbeat laws are wrong! Other pro abortion people are silent! Waiting periods, forced sonograms are wrong! Where were the protests about those? Non existent! The LGBTQ people are getting into the fray saying our rights will come next because Roe was overturned but NOT ONE OF THEM cared about abortion restrictions during Roe! NOT ONE of them while demanding Roe and the years after have joined or started protests demanding no abortion restrictions! They never cared because most women who get abortions are straight! But when their rights are infringed the world must stop spinning! In these protests now over the abortion bans where are there any LGBTQ people holding up protests signs decrying the overturn of Roe? NONE! They're just mad that they'll be next for rights removal! And men? Sure they're all for abortion so they don't have to pay child support! Where were the men marching with women in the 70's demanding with them the right to abortion! The namby pamby pro lifers certainly won't take pregnant women and young girls into their home while they're pregnant paying their medical bills and being there at birth and helping to raise that unwanted kid! If you say life is so precious then where are you when that life is growing in utero! And the namby pamby well I donate to charities who help single mothers with kids people won't even donate unless they get a tax deduction because they have to personally benefit! I'm fed up with the hypocrisy on both sides! I'm all for abortion! I had one! But in 1987 there were NO waiting periods, NO forced sonograms, NO heartbeat laws and the minute those came out years later I was yelling about those while other pro abortion people were silent! Abortion will NOT stop! It'll go back to back ally butchers!"
All these w people crying about abortions when we no what hood these clinics are in. How many abortions are given on Martha's vineyard🤔

"Technically speaking, they didn’t take any constitutional right away. That’s just a talking point used by one side to try and state that it was inalienable. 

What they did was reverse what they found to be a mistaken decision from 49-50 years ago. 

That is to say, people were operating for those years under a mistaken premise. 

Whether you agree with the court or not, that’s the objective facts of what occurred.

They didn’t strip you of some explicit entrenched right."
What I'd like for them to do is get a copy of the constitution and read it all front to back and they will find there is no abortion rights in there to begin with
"These ""women"" that are crying🤣💀🤡🤡"
"They never overturned the right to abortion. Overturning Roe v Wade gave the decision back to the states and I am so tired of repeating myself on this issue. If you don't know what Roe v Wade actually was, then don't claim to have an opinion on it."
"Don’t worry, there will be a Republican landslide this November.  And abortion shall be fully banned and illegal in every scenario nationwide!!  So excited!!  I love America and president Donald j trump!!  Abortion rights are a joke and always will be!!"
Ooooh noo i can't kill babies 😭😭😭
When men abandons the kid they are seemed as evil and they should pay child support no matter what.but for a women she could kill the kid too.
This is what ideological possession looks like. On both sides
The fuckin country is falling apart with rents and cost of living that makes middle and lower class a living nightmare and people argue about this bullshit…
I think it’s good. Women shouldn’t have the choice. Men haven’t had a choice when it comes to child support or getting any kind of assistance. I call this equality
"Nobody has the fundamental right to end a human life. Yes it was legal for 50 years but what about the 200 years before that? Women can still get abortions but they may have to drive to a different state. Women still have the right to choose abstinence, birth control, common sense, self control and in the worst situation ( rape or incest) the morning after pill which doesn’t kill anyone, it prevents conception from taking place. I don’t understand what is wrong with these women who are crying over a hypothetical baby and their right to murder it at any point in time."
They didn’t take away a constitutional right to abortion they stated that it was never a constitutional right to abortion in the first place. PERIOD.
"I never realized just how insane some women really can be until you take their ""murder"" away"
"The movie 2001 a space odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion. A space odyssey is a fetus in the womb. The Clint Eastwood dirty Harry movies was angry calm. It seems nasty but it's a good police officer. Angry calm is how a women chooses abortion. 

Everything in motion makes one error. Your supposed to park the errors where it doesn't matter or you play wack a mole with errors. It's intelligently designed that if you try killing God you will always make one error. A movie is in motion so you have to park the errors where it doesn't matter. 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind. That why HAL computer eye is colored red so it still has artistic integrity. 2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made. It only has one error to park. You can't do better than that."
Yes! Finally abortion is banned🎉🎉🎉
why are people crying over this 💀
So your upset cause now you gotta be more responsible before you sleep with anyone?
Abortion is murder. Change my mind.
Half these women won’t even get a chance of getting pregnant with this attitude lol
Handsmaid Tale for real
"Saving children's lives is the best decision the court has made. Now it goes back to the states. Welcome to Australia. Also, the 14th amendment protects ""Life, Liberty and Property.""

"Wow, the reporter is just like SO IMPARTIAL."
no one has the right to take a life. you know babies have constitutional rights.
Iam a woman to me pregnancy is the most beautiful feeling in the world in all stages of pregnancy. Going through the labour stages i felt the  pain but it wasn't the pain i thought about it was hoping the baby would be ok that is what is on every womans mind who is ready to give birth. Those who abort their beautiful babies will never get to feel that.
A sad day…for baby killers.
a baby has rights too you stupid women dont kill them
It's OK alright these aborted babies are added to God's kingdom as angels 😇  at the same time all these hoes will be thrown in the lake of 🔥  fire for an eternity.
The fish prolly goin get an abortion

"We are focusing on the wrong problem here. Only 14 of 100,000 women of chilbearing age chose to have an abortion, while god sits over in the corner, being completely ignored as he rubs his dirty little hands together thinking about how to take out the next BABY.

In 15% of pregnancies God chooses to kill babies, and that is just the miscarriages. This doesn't account for the countless times he gets it wrong and plants the egg outside of the uterus or tries to strangle the poor thing to death with its own umbilical cord as a last ditch attempt to prevent it from seeing the light of day. Forget all the deadly birthdefects where the poor creature, designed in HIS IMAGE, is born without a brain, kidneys, fully developed lungs. At least these abominations give us a good clue as to the kind of ""higher being"" we are working with here. Add these in and GOD is by far the most prolific ""baby killer"" on the planet! 

Not to mention, the US has the highest rate of murder of women by god just for trying to give birth to a HUMAN in HIS IMAGE out of any developed country in the world. You think with all these laws being passed to hinder the doctors who are actually trying to save the lives of babies and mothers on a daily basis, he would cut us some slack, but it seems like his blood lust continues. 

Just based on these FACTS, if you really want to stop all these murders of babies and pregnant women it would make so much more sense to get to the root cause of these MURDERS. Logically we should ban god from all forms of government, because he obviously could care less about the LIFE of a baby and it's mom. More god is definitely not the answer."
Pretty sure the thumbnail lady won't have to worry about getting pregnant.

"There has never been a constitutional right to get an abortion. The only thing done was restricted states from prosecution of those who get an abortion, and of those that perform abortions. There will never be a constitutional right to end a pregnancy. In order for that to happen, the opinion of the Supreme Court would have to be that ending a pregnancy is an unalienable right, a right that you are born with, given by your creator. So, until someone can show how ending a pregnancy is an unalienable right, then there’s no reason for the people to think that it’s a right, and not a privilege. You want to argue that it’s “your body,” then if you can show me where your creator has endowed you to do whatever you want with your body, then you have an argument. Do you have a constitutional right to get a tattoo? Do you have a constitutional right to commit suicide?  No, you don’t, so the, “it’s my body” argument is moot."

Abortion is murder.
Constitutional right to abortion? I don’t think it is in the constitution since it’s murder
I don't understand the hysteria.  It just means that each state can now decide whether to allow abortions or not.  It's not outright banning any abortions anywhere.
God… America is fucked😅

Ok let's try a different logic and see who really is against abortion.  The age of abortion starts at 15 and goes to 18 then till adults 44.  Let's just take a look at 15.  A child may have an abortion at the age of 15 no parental consent.  They can't drive a car.  They can't smoke a cigarette.  They can't have alcohol.  They can't vote.  They can't join the military but there old enough to decide all by themselves if they want to end a life!   If your a parent I want you to look into the eyes of your child and see if that's a good idea to you.  Since the parent is responsible for the decisions till 18yrs old!  The parents body and choice it really is!  Most of all another lie told by the devil the truth is it's God's body and not your choice!  But I digress how many children have made this decision alone and then had to live with it's consequence for life?

"The land of unlimited opportunities becomes the land of unlimited stupidity initiated by humans believing in imaginary sky daddies and ghosts. Fetus is not a baby, not an infant, not a teenager, not a grown up not a senior. It is a bunch of dividing cells without self awareness with a potential to go through the above mentioned phases. Only very ignorant, and genitals obsessed humans would take the right away from the women to their bodily autonomy."
"Former Pro-Choicer here.  Seeing our first baby during the ultrasound  was just incredible!  It was a BABY!  And it was ALIVE!
The lie that ""it's just a mass of cells; it's not a baby"" was EXPOSED by seeing our baby's image on the screen!
Some time later, I saw a video showing the remains of an aborted baby.  I learned that after an abortionist cuts & slices up the baby inside the Mommy, they have to reassemble the baby's body parts on a tray to ensure none of the cut-up pieces are left inside the Mom.
Now, WHY do pro-abortion people go into a rage when responding to proposals that women see their baby's image in an ultrasound before going through with aborting their baby?  Why do they oppose transparency and full-disclosure?  Why do they oppose letting women see the truth?
Why do people lie about abortion being a constitutional right when it is never even mentioned in the US Constitution? 
If our future is a more civilized one, History will judge harshly those who advocated for the mer dur of babies, including them with the architects of the hollow cost and other historical mass mer dur atrocities."

"26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; --HOLY BIBLE"
"HOLY BIBLE- 18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 19 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. 20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. 21 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
"HOLY BIBLE--- 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."

"protect civil liberties.amazing grace or more disgrace.....the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness...the right of a woman to take a sacred life even if she chooses only to take male unborn childrens lifes...it is not a civil liberty...it is the worship of bal in child sacrifice for ones own pleasure...freedom of choice begins and ends with the choice to sleep with a male out of marriage...for money or even more foolishly for free."
All the women who want to sin and not be accountable.
"The supreme court overturned a universal fake unconstitutional ""right"" to kill a child that hasn't fully gestated and left it to the states. 8 of which now have banned killing babies at any stage. Isn't it great? It is and you should be happy and not slant your titles to call it anything else than what it is. It's not her body therefore it's not her choice."
"For anyone that's unsure about this issue please think about this: what about the babies that are fertilized in the fallopian tube instead of the womb? That's fatal for baby and mother. Or what if a mother has a miscarriage and it's incomplete and she needs an abortion to remove the rest so she doesn't die from infection? It doesnt matter that its uncomfortable to talk about, a woman should have the right to lifesaving medical treatment and sometimes abortion is that treatment. Imagine being a doctor and knowing this and being told that you're not allowed to save your patient's life because other people decided for her that it's IMMORAL. None of that has ever occurred to most voters yet the lives of women are now in the hands of ignorant people. It could happen to any woman. I hope that the people who decided this for us eventually feel shame for what they did to all those women who died because they forgot abnormal pregnancies happen and there wasnt proper treatment to save them."
Go somewhere else then if you want to kill babies

"Pro-abortionists never actually address the concerns of pro-life activists in their arguments. Saying, ""My body, my choice"" will inevitably fall on deaf ears because pro-life activists fundamentally believe that it's the fetus's body. They are trying so valiantly to shove a square peg into a round hole."
They stripped away my rights to take a vaccine which is giving my heart ❤ problems I swear after the vaccine my heart is not normal.

Cartel has a right to muder inocent lives? No different than abortion.
Get ready Britain its coming to you. The fascists and corporations dressed in dark money groups are here.
"I guess women would rather have 9 judges in black robes tell them when and if they can have an abortion, and what they can and can't do with their own bodies, instead of putting it back to the states, where they can actually have a say in it! They would rather have the federal government tell them what they can and can't do with their own bodies, and have no say in it whatsoever. Regardless of who it is, the government is going to be telling them what they can and can't do with their bodies. I guess they would rather have no say in it at all."

Channel 4 news is trash. I only watch this video to hear the good news of the end for roe v wade.
"This truly was a great moment for America, it's so rare for good, truth, and common sense to prevail in this day & age .Personally I celebrated & rejoiced in my spirit over Roe vs Wade being overturned.  Abortion for one is not a constitutional right, I'm tired of women claiming 'their body, their choice' that is not a valid argument. Women need to practice responsibility in their personal lives and avoid pregnancy like a responsible adult instead of using abortion as a catch-all & eraser. That's not how life works, if you as an adult choose to be intimate & become pregnant that is now your responsibility. You don't get to slaughter the innocent soul now attached to your body simply for convenience! By liberal logic I as a man should be able to 'abort' my responsibilities as a father should I get a woman pregnant and she carry it to term. By their logic men can say My body my choice, I don't want to be a father to my seed shes on her own. But they only use logic when it's convenient and liberal women especially hold men to ridiculous double standards. Then to claim infant health will also be affected by this decision as if the infants well being has ever been a priority to a pro abortionist is an other example of them using emotional vomit in place of facts, rational arguments, and empirical evidence. If they're so concerned about infants then they should be appalled that almost 70,000,000 innocent human beings were murdered in their mother's womb. A place that was once the safest place in the world for a child.  There is no logical, scientific, or moral argument for abortion. I hope this country stays on the right track"

"That for the sins of a people God may suffer the best government to be corrupted, or entirely dissolved; and that nothing but a general reformation can give ground to hope that the public happiness will be restored ... The kingdom of Israel was brought to destruction, because its iniquities were full ... because there remained no hope of reformation... Their government degenerated in proportion as their vices increased, till few faithful men were left in any public offices ... At length, when they were delivered up for seventy years into the hands of the king of Babylon, scarcely any remains of their original excellent civil polity appeared among them ...

I think this is hilarious🤣🤣🤣
We should all be against anything bad that happens with any human remains. What was done to us here is wrong.
"This isn't reported as news. First of all, it was NEVER Constitutional. This is an opinion piece."
"The problem with journalism today, they're all activist not a news reporter among them."
"Why don’t we ever talk about what this procedure does to women?
It’s incredibly damaging to a woman’s body, mind and soul.
Idk any women who aren’t emotionally damaged after having one. 
Addict1on, depression, se1f harm, being unable to have children, instability and on and on.
Do you know who doesn’t suffer from any of this? 
Men. 
We always debate whether it’s a baby or a clump or cells, but I don’t ever hear what is done to educate and help women from the damage this leaves emotionally and spiritually."
"Honestly, reading many of the comments makes me feel like there isn’t much hope for the future. Why do these anti-abortion people want to criminalize and take away womens right to choose how they live their own lives so badly? It’s hard to believe that many of the anti-choice activists and supporters have mothers, sisters, dauthers or even more unbelievably, are women themselves. What is the next step? Criminalizing women for every time they DONT get pregnant because tecnically, the egg is an unborn baby?"
""" I'm absolutely terrified, I'm so terrified. Your terrified about not having the ability to kill an innocent child. We have bigger things to be terrified about"
"Why do some people think it's ok to kill an innocent child. Like seriously that's not just a fertilized egg. When the sperm and egg come together, it becomes a human. I don't agree that if you get pregnant in any circumstance, you can just kill that baby because it's your body. That baby has its own body. When the man and woman do it, they know the risk. Yes sometimes a baby gets conceived from a horrible situation (like rape) but that dose not mean the baby will grow up to be bad person. Also you can give the child up for adoption. Everyone deserves a chance at life even if it's an unborn baby."
Congratulations America has successfully created a new category of criminals :) like we need more criminals than we already have

Seeing the emotion in the women’s voices made me cry
Nobody would want to impregnate tge majority of those effers
Man its so sick seing these pro choice women crying because they cant kill a baby. It almost comical. Most of the pro choicers look like they dont even like men anyway 😂
I wonder what those prochoice women Trump supporters are thinking of him now . Can someone interview them ?

"I like how they say ""my body my choice"" yet fail to use the required steps to prevent ""accidentally"" creating life while sleeping around.
Its just mind boggling how they think, after being promiscuous and lustful, then getting pregnant, that abortion it's the best solution.
IMO make condoms more accessible than they are, give extensive sexual ed for teenagers *and* adults, and those who think they are better than everybody else and ""screw around"" like a bunch of rabbits, then that's their problem"

Abortion rights are not illegal yet unless your state gov says so."
I’m so happy it was overturned. Hopefully people understand how wrong abortion is now.
When will people shut up about this stupid law? All it does is shift the law from a federal level to a state level. That's no reason for sjws to start rioting and acting like literal cultists.

why are women happy about their right being taken away? that's like me having a party when my right to a gay marriage gets taken away(which will probably happen at this rate)
Wahoo 👍
Tired of all these man-boys shouting they're not ready to be fathers but want to play house. Vasectomies for all. That would eliminate the need for 90% of the need for abortions. Fact!
"Literally the entire issue baffles me! First why would you get yourself in the position of needing an abortion? Besides the less than 0.5% of rapes, most heathens killing there children are healthy 20 yr olds who act irresponsibly, are self entitled, have blue hair, don't value life, or don't know who the father is because there riding the pony express well past common sense! While I have had my wild years, it was rarely an issue that I got the ho pregnant and didn't know what to do! I knew the gun was loaded so when I fired away, my aim never hit bullseye! Why because I wasn't always ready myself, but would have NEVER wanted the female to torture the BABY to death! After seeing abortion survivors on youtube, I am glad I never felt the need for this procedure to exist!"
"Since males are so intent on ending abortion rights and taking away a woman's right to privacy and control over her own body, I say take all these newborns to their daddies to care for and feed."
I am glad the fathers have the rights to stop the woman from killing his unborn child.  Thank you president Trump and President Ronald Reagan for appointed those Judge to the Supreme Court .

Imagine breaking down in tears and going into a fury of rage because you can't kill babies.
love how its a very non american woman doing the voiceover talking about the american government
Let those babies grow. Stop abortion rights. If you lived. Why can't others live as well. It's not there fault you didn't use anything for protection. Girls first open there legs without thinking the consequences then they end up having an abortion. No you open the legs because you wanted that to happen. Now the baby has to grow.
I have had a horrible week and I needed a laugh today . Thank you silly feminist. Tell me you know nothing about us politics because your a foreigner without tell me. Roe VS wade was severely outdated .
Not a constitutional right
What are the liberals so upset about. I have seen most of Bidens appointed people and they cannot even define what a woman is.
"I remember the first time I worked at grade school. This tiny little girl who was missing her two front teeth looked at me and she said, ""Hey misthta, come here. "" I went over to her. She said, ""let me see your finga."" I extended it. She took her little fingernail and gently dug it into my skin a little, and she started laugh and she said, ""say ough ough ough ough."" Like that. That was a precious kid. I said, ""ough ough ough ough,"" and we were hysterically laughing. It was one of the cutest things I've ever seen in my entire life. Later, I covered for the Gym Teacher. We were going to race. I said, ""Okay kids. Don't go until I say GO!"" I said, ""line up!"" They lined up. I said, ""On your mark! Get set! Do you like squirrels?"" They said, ""What?"" I said, ""okay okay this time this time!"" They started laughing. I said, ""On your mark! Get set! Squirrels are so cute aren't they?"" They started laughing. Finally, after several goof offs, I said go. LOL Kids are beautiful. I love kids. You mean SELFISH people! You should be ashamed of yourselves. You've turned into complete MONSTERS! I HATE YOU!"
Awwwww. Have you ever worked in a grade school with children? Aw! I love those kids! Aw! Come on! Aw! They want to go to SCHOOL LA. They want a chance to LIVE UH. Come ON UH. What are you people doing? You should be ashamed of your selfish selves!

"Women self-abort all the time and a lot later than heartbeat, it is called miscarriage and it is an aborting of the fetus. In fact, in the latest scientific studies most women, do this many times before a pregnancy takes. Almost zero women get pregnant on the first go. So, this change of law has criminalized being a woman, go America."
"I think they should overturn Abortions, and make it very clear. By over turning to legally allow abortions, the woman will be sterilized after her abortion. You aren’t ready to have kids now, than you won’t be later!"
"What we have to get across to abortionists is the baby's body is not the woman's body.
And The Supreme Court simply gave the Choice back to the people where it always belonged, as the left got everybody to believe it was part of the constitution oer the years..., and it never was part of the Constitution."
It’s still a baby. I don’t care if you were rapped. Name me one other crime where we punish the perpetrator’s child and not the perpetrator? What’s that? There are none? You don’t have to keep it but you do have to carry it. Cause it’s not your body. The part you want to kill is the baby’s body.

I genuinely believe abortion is wrong. I don't really see why that's a controversial opinion.
This video is truely abhorrent...Perhaps the pro life supporters should be charged with impersonating human beings and having grandiose delusions that they have the right to decide what a woman does with her body. Personally I think they are the ones who should be sterilized so they can't reproduce and  take away any more of our freedoms which the constitution guarantees us.
Wow...we will make it a crime to kill a baby. Nuff said
We need to ban abortion to make sure John Connor is born

"Here’s a question, why don’t women use all these protections to prevent pregnancy?! Oh the responsibility, huh? Get your back blown out and go get an abortion to correct your bad choice.
  Men do you part as well, use protection because these SLORES will lie and say they are in the pill. After you finish with your condom, throw it in the toilet and watch it flush. If you put it in the trash she will get it out and put it inside her, Drake incident. Protect your seed men and don’t be stupid!!"
Roughly 3% of the United States population are black women capable of pregnancy yet black Women make up 50% of all abortion cases each year Unpopular opinion Roe v. Wade being overturn was a major W for the African-American community
Are these nosy holy people going to pay your medical bills ?
Abortion is murder the Lord is tired of seeing his children being killed over 60 million unborn baby lost. I will pray that every 50 state will ban abortion. Spirit of God will win against killing about abortion we will win. Joe Biden suck he is a murderer

"""My body, My choice""... Sure... what about vaccines???"
It was the first and most simple way to start taking away our human rights little by little
Nobody sees the big picture here this overturn doesn’t mean a thing to the Supreme Court they could care less about abortion this just opened the door for them to start taking away our human rights little by little watch and see

"Correction on the title, they didn't overturn a ""right"" because it never was one. Abortion isn't mentioned in the constitution, and it isn't mentioned because our forefathers were God fearing men and they never would've allowed abortion. It being a constitutional right makes no sense. This country was founded on Christian values and still is. If the Scotus did anything they admitted a mistake, that Roe vs. Wade was a decision they (previous Scotus) never should've made, that it should be up to the states to decide what is allowed. Funny thing, these same women wouldn't like the Vatican telling them what's allowed but they're OK with the SCOTUS telling them but yet they scream no one has the right to tell them what they do with their bodies. Hmmm??? Sounds to me like they're OK with the Scotus so long as they do what they say. They seem a little selfish and vigilante to me."

Those raped children are now dead
"We are all so worried about our rights and lives. But who is protecting the liberty and lives of our most precious? Unborn babies that can’t speak for themselves. Why doesn't the unborn have the right to live?
Children are a gift from God. The Bible says in Psalm 127:3 KJV, “Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.”
We kill our unborn. God's most sacred creation! We pluck it out like it’s cancer. We should be ashamed! Who gave us the right to play God? We don't have that right. It's a sin, so how can it be alright? We have no right to kill. It is one of the Ten Great Commandments that God said that we must obey. The sixth commandment in the Bible says in Exodus 12:13, “Thou shalt not kill.” Why is that so hard to understand?
A mother that has just given birth can be charged with murder if she kills her baby, but a Doctor can do the same while God’s Child is safe and sound in the womb. They are then called heroes. They are not heroes. What they are is murders. What they do is absolutely a sin in the eyes of our God. How can we expect to have God's grace? I believe God turned away from the United States when Roe versus Wade became law.
God knows all those children. The Bible says in Jeremiah 1:5 KJV, “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.”
This means that God has already given that baby a name!
I want to ask all the lawmakers and Judges in our country. Since you’ve failed to protect the next generation, how can we trust you to protect our generation? You have the blood of millions of babies on your hands. It is the worst genocide in history! You will have to answer for your position on abortion when you stand in front of the highest court in existence. God’s heavenly court. I hope you have a good answer because you can’t use the “I didn’t know” excuse because you know it’s wrong.
You have been warned!
2 Corinthians 5:10 KJV says, “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.”"
Those aren't protesters they are far left domestic violent extremists.
"The court just “ RETURN IT TO THE STATES”  so STATE CITIZENS WILL VOTE on abortion limitations “ if any “ depending on the state. This is DEMOCRACY, California should not tell Texas what to do any more than Texas telling California what to do."

Look into how much these clinics make on the sales of the body parts of the unborn they murder to labs for studies that’s on top of the price they charge the mother to murder there unborn……….. can’t you see it’s a business and the mothers are the incubator for the product and that woman’s rights to be used as a cash cow and incubator for a product they sell ?

"I love the ""Future is anti abortion"" sign. When the rest of the first world is looking at us like a bunch of ignorant, white trash morons."
Now all these rich white idiots are gonna go out and expand Medicaid and adopt foster kids...right?
So I'm not from America but I just wanted to know what if a minor gets pregnant because she was rap*d? Or if the mother or the child have fatal condition? Abortion is through and through illegal?
"Lets be civilized, killing another human for your own mistakes is not how our future generation should be taught and be normalized into. Respect all living being and start taking responsibility for our own actions, what if your partner killed you because he doesn't want you anymore, does that sound like the world you wanna be living into ?"
"The Supreme Court did not overturn right to abortion.
The Supreme Court sent the issue of abortion back to where it should have always been...with the States."
The sad and WRONG title  of this video....
Ha... you  murderers lost.
"america is dead KEEP FIGHTING GUYS(the sane ones left who can actually think for themselves without putting god in every fucking sentence) BEFORE THESE LUNATICS TURN IT INTO A WAR ZONE FILLED WITH BIBLES AND GUNS
also change your country's name while you're at it it's about time we call u the divided states of america"
My friend's wife is five and half months pregnant. At least she was until a recent ultrasound revealed the baby's kidneys hadn't formed properly and there was little to no amniotic fluid. The baby did not form lungs and is now a non viable pregnancy. You people would rather force her to mourn this baby twice. Now and again when she delivers a stillborn. Quit pretending this is about Christian beliefs when half the people that support this are the furthest from that.
That woman is an idiot. She never answered one of those questions.
Women are NOT discriminilized men are
I just see a lot of people who want their clam smashed without consequences and who also don't understand the country they live in. Way to go public education haha
"**🚨Trigger Alert!🚨**

I only support aborting “woke” liberals and “feminists”. 🤔."
United states  of Afghanistan. No women rights. Lots of guns. No global understanding at all. See the similarities?
"2022 You must deliver that baby!👿
2072 Any family with more than 1 child will go to jail.👿

Smart. Make the problem too big to handle then come down on the people by infringing on their rights again. For the greater good....

Control is a nasty thing"
I don't have anything against a women murdering her unborn baby but she doesn't have the right to spend my money to fix her f@ckups.
"I am actually scared of America....
I thought that women are allowed to make their own choices.
Bruh, I used to dream about living in America
But as far as I have seen in terms of treating it's women, POC, Blacks, East Asians...i feel as if my country is far better.
Abortion is also legal here.
We may not be as developed as ""THE GREAT AMERICA"" but i actually feel safe here."
Roe v Wade started because a woman who wanted an abortion didn’t have her life threatened by her pregnancy. Yet most of these pro choice protesters talk about how it saves women’s lives. You can still get an abortion in pretty much every state if it risks your life.
"Womans rights do NOT include murder! Baby killers screaming because they cant kill babies. Unbelievable, the vile creatures!"
If you crazy leftist want to abort babies because they don't fit in your life don't complain when a man don't pay child support or take care of the kid because it doesn't fit in his plans or he just don't want it don't be hypocrites
The nose on the thumbnail speaks for itself.
Welcome to Gilead
Ugliest thumbnail ever 🤢
Demons shrieking because they really wanted to have been aborted.
The Left has pushed the culture wars way too far. Now the Empire Strikes Back.
5:49 she didn’t even answer the question???
Screw all of you who don't like abortion.  I will pay and help ANY woman get to a legal state and get a abortion.
Woman’s right to kill their babies. Sounds insidious
Seeing trans women crying over abortions is crazy ngl.
Hehe
"Hey get it through your head people. Abortion is not a state choice but a individual choice, based on personal circumstances that differ from person to person. If you're not the one to question ""should I keep a pregnancy to term or abort ASAP?"" then it is not your place, nor the state or any law to decide. What America did banning it will just lead to deaths, depression, poverty, trauma and only troubles but I guess that's the goal."
Im democrat and i support the ruling
"Where are all my Pro choice people at for my right to choose?

Legalize safe and convenient Suicides!!!
I should have the right not to live amongst you baby murderers."
"Can someone explain to me like a 5 year old why is abortion good? I mean I can understand medically if the doctor determines the mother could die or if it was a miscarriage or something like that but man other than that i find it to be unnatural, grotesque, cruel and selfish. Plain evil to summarize. None of us should have the right to decide if someone should be born or not… We are not God. I agree people have the right do whatever they want to their body, but a fetus or baby is not an organ or a part of the body, it’s a separate living organism, and it has the right to live. If the parents don’t want him, there are always options more sensible than killing."
We did it!
Channel 4 🤡
What if adoption was Banned ?
Praying for all the pregnant Men🙏😎
Man this is some bullshit reporting right here. Want to see what fake news looks like? You should be ashamed of how pathetic this is
Ok so 15 years of illegal abortion and 5 years in prison for raping… that’s fucked up.
IF YOU DONT WANT A BABY THEN STOP FUCKING AROUND
So my question is.. if there's a rape victim in a hostage situation we're she's not able to get a plan B or any such pills to prevent the pregnancy to go for longer .. then she finds a way to escape but she's already about 5 months pregnant.. does she have to keep the baby? Will you have to let .. let's say a 13 yr old hold on to her baby aka rapist father .. or is that OK for an abortion.
''There will be no functioning society without women'' Suddenly men don't exist anymore.
Cry about it. All I can say.
W for humanity today boys
Keep that same energy when it comes to child support
"""taking these liberties away""   oh no, how could they stop people murdering defenceless babies? how horrible! thank god they did this"
Is that person in the thumbnail even a woman 😂
"these stupid women who never done anything and will never do anything want to abort John Lennon, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, John f Kennedy, Hemingway, Mozart, Beethoven, Einstein, Davinci, Shakespeare..."

"What has to happen now, is a national referendum on what the ERA was supposed to do in the first place. Make women equal to men. Bypass the congress, bypass the courts. Make the ERA the law of the land by a vote of the people."
"It's not about rights, it's about what's right."
"For all of you saying ""there is no constitutional right to abortion"" you are right, there is no mention of the word abortion in the constitution. HOWEVER the right to privacy (which abortion was previously protected under) is not explicitly stated in the constitution either, it is INFERRED and this a right that every American holds near and dear. Just because it is not stated explicitly does not mean it isn't inferred. Bear in mind this Constitution was written in the 1700s."
pro tip if u seem to be getting drunk and fucking ppl go on the pill. if u support abortion then where u ok with ppl in China doing it if it was a girl?
Build More Prisons. Parents will kill more babies after they are born stupid Fu**s. They probably will abuse them for a year or two. An innocent helpless baby will be in DANGER ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗
"NO ONE THINK about the BABY❗❗❗❗ IF a person is NOT RESPONSIBLE enough to take a birth control pill how in the FU** will they be able to take care of a baby. There is SO MUCH CHILD ABUSERS, CHILD PORN. I don't care about the women I Care about the Misery, abuse, and murder AFTER the BABY IS BORN dumb Mother Fuc----s."
There should be a nation wide memorial for all the babies that have killed.
It is never a right to kill a baby. There is severe mental illness involved in the killing of babies. Straight up insanity in every sense of the word.
Ah yes then people ask why does a child have to keep someone's baby if she was forced and r###
Everyone is crying but hey guess what you can still go murder your babies in other states congrats. I for one cannot wait for it to be illegal in all 50 states.
😉😍😉😂🙃🐆🐎🐴🐵
"abortion was never in the constitution or bill of rights. the court decided it is left up to the states, as it should be."
"It’s going to be decided by the states. So if you live in a state where abortion is prohibited, just go to another state."
THANK YOU JESUS
"Mandated, forced or compulsory pregnancy contravenes enumerated rights in the Constitution, namely the 13th Amendment’s prohibition against involuntary servitude and protection of bodily autonomy, as well as the 14th Amendment’s defense of privacy and freedom."
"Tyson James, Hi-Rez and Bryson Gray Rapped about this... 🤣"
Finally... 🙏🏼
umm its someone elses body
We're so sorry you can't kill babies
All of the people who are upset look mentally off ...... what does that tell you?
"the very same people that were applauding individuals to lose their livelihood over an not wanting to take an experimental vaccine are the same ones that are extremely against roe v Wade being overturned. 

Sucks when the shoe is on the other foot, doesn’t it?"
😭
it’s correct that there never a “right to abortion” or a constitutional right to abortion so literally we only made abortion a right because we felt like it. And then there is just pure ignorance. The overturning of roe v wade only now gave the states the power to set terms of abortion and didn’t completely outlaw abortion I mean people should take a history lesson all this commotion is totally unnecessary if we all knew what roe v wade was and what it did.
"The ruling that abortion is legal was based on a right to privacy. This was a misapplication of the right to privacy. Your right to privacy does not include the right to plan murder. Laws are not based on the opinion of the people in the country. They are based on the exact wording of each law. If every person in the country decided that taxes are bad, they would still have to pay taxes until and unless Congress repealed the tax law s
    All the court did was say abortion is subject to legislative revue. Each state can allow or ban abortions, or Congress can enact laws either for or against abortion.
      The real question is: Why are the current justices right? How did all the other Supreme Court justices get it wrong? Is the current SCOTUS correct, or just religiously biased?"
I like how people think the majority opinion matters. This isn't a democracy it's a republic. Babies have rights too and it doesn't matter what the majority thinks
"Amy is such a pick me. ""I'm one of the boys... 🤤"""
"American is filled with cancellable-cucks. Don't matter how much money you have,  not the life for me thank you"
We need abortion. Or there is going to be so many single black moms. And all those black babies are going to cost the tax payers so much money. Democrats and the left are correct we need population control.
How is this any different than medical marijuana patients who live in states that criminalize marijuana use and possession? They usually have to move to California to get the access to the  medicine they need to live?
Hoes mad
"I think when a minor gets raped they should implement law with death penalty for rapists. Other methods should be castration, or injection for infertility for the rapists. If the woman is adult she should decide what to do with the rapist s life  since her free will was taken by force from her I think he should no longer have free will. If she decides she wants to marry him, he should comply with her demands and be forced to work and be a provider for her and the baby."
"It’s not in the constitution that you have the right to kill your unborn babies. These are some sick feminist who want to be like men. Now that men want to be women and swim and beat them they get upset. More men will become women soon. The definition of women will be nothing, worthless piece of trash. So be it. Shall it be done. Said Cesar."
"I say let them fight for their pro choice views, it will only make their punishment all the worse"
Hoes Be Mad!
"HOLY BIBLE- 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."
"26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; --HOLY BIBLE"
"HOLY BIBLE- 18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 19 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. 20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. 21 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
Are you fucktards going to protest muzzles and vaccines????? I doubt it! Losers!!!!
Poor things do not have enough self esteem  to believe they could learn how not to get pregnant. A little education goes a long way.
"MEAT IS MURDER , oh dang I’m at the wrong protest ."
Abort them all!
"A fetus has no right to live? At moment of conception ? Very poor logic . Planned parenthood donated money to political campaigns?  
Men should refrain from contributing to creating people , the loss of family and centuries of law .65 million having less is ok . Barrier method so an ova and sperm dont get together seems ok."
You have options. Take the pill the morning after pill . Pull out. Etc
"The old abortionist biddy in the ""Green Abortion"" kerchief at 2:33 ... WTF is a ""green abortion"", you kill the unborn with a solar windmill?!"
Wow the reporting is so unbiased!!!!!
"Why are so many people fighting for their rights to Kill Babies 
I’m scared for the future"
No one has the right to take another persons life
There never was a constitutional right to abprtion. There was a court ruling this is just making it a choice of state legislatures to pass laws
6:00 - 6:09 By the time women usually get abortions the baby literally looks like a fucking a clump of marinara sauce.
"Lol..libtards throwing a tantrum, again."
Don't understand how killing unborn girls is good for women's rights
"Who in their right mind would get these harpies pregnant. They don't want just the right to kill their babies, they would to kill your baby. Baby killers"
"This Supreme Court ruling is a real relief. It's great that we, the people can undo legalized abortion. This is a real victory for the rights of everyone, and we celebrate it."
Its not a freedom! Its murder! People are so blind!
Love seeing libtards lose their fucking minds. #ABORTIONISMURDER!
"And if we can accept that a mother can kill her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?

Do we really want these people breeding? Just saying if their mothers would have aborted them this would be a much better place. I'm a pro choice conservative cause I want less of these people.
"Logically, lets look at several things that influence how the law makers decide things. The goal for the creation of Row V Wade decision was to initiate a slow down in the population of the US. Birth rates reduced. Now, birth rates are so low, due to several reasons, that its important for the economy and future of the US to have people who can work for the beast. Look up the stats. Its obvious it has NOTHING to do with what you Want or what you have control over!"
Good the people of this country side killing a baby is Wrong

"America is falling from being a modern, developed country, and this ruling confirms it for people around the world. Now, any personal liberty can be challenged."
Abortion is the genocide of the black race in America.
People going crazy over babies that are not born but will gladly buy cows milk that strips mothers from babies. And happily eat a mother pig who was tortured and had her babies slammed to death against concrete walls to die slow and painful deaths. Enjoy your bacon and cow milk with all the suffering that comes with it.

"“we will make it a crime in all 50 states to murder a baby”

> children being killed in classrooms on the daily
> lots of children being neglected in the system
> not imprisoning child abusers
> black innocent children being murdered by police

but hey, they’re not babies anymore."
"As always the truth is painful and somewhere in the middle. I am old enough to remember deaths from back yard abortions. I am also old enough to be disgusted with how many women use abortion numerous times as a form of contraception.
As always abuse of any system in place which intentionally was there with good intentions leads to the chaos and hysteria we are now witnessing.
Is it a good idea to bring unwanted, unloved children in the world? No
Is it right to tear apart a baby limb from limb after the first 12 weeks? No
If people were rational, reasonable, and had some order in their lives these options would not be an issue.
I feel sadness for the unwanted, unloved children born to ferals. 
And I feel sadness for the babies torn to pieces.
This world is too cruel and insane for me."

"If it’s your body then why aren’t you women fighting for legal prostitution.  Countries already allow it, it’s your body"
Women have a false sense of power in America and this clearly illustrated the power they thought they had.
"Funny how the woman they put in the thumbnail is YUCK! She doesn't have to worry, believe me."
NOT YOUR BODY 👉👶🫀NOT YOUR CHOICE
A bunch of baby murders and proud you don't want a baby don't do sexual acts that make babies period! If a women consented and was all for it why should an innocent life suffer. What if your Mom aborted you? So contradicting too that a lot of those pro choice protest women are Moms 🤨
So is the morning after pill still legal then ???? Free in UK or was ...get from chemist
the hair pulling liberals' reveal the depth of their total denial of reality.  SCOTUS returned the power to the states. Considering libtards elected a demented criminal is indicative of their stupidity. Dementia never gets better fools.
That woman on the left is so fill of it.
The direction in which USA was going ... it would take another 20 years and chinese would open their companies factories in USA ...
I am so terrified right now .. and I am going to turn my fear into anger and  storm a hospital with my feminist frends and rip apart some white babies..
I'm scared for women in the US. I'm scared for myself that they will do this here too. 😫
"HOES MAD, Time to be more conscious of the dudes you bang handmaidens."

1:17 they messed up the chant
Keep your knees together.
"Yo, I don’t understand. I didn’t see one “woman “ on the pro choice side that will ever have to be concerned about getting an abortion anyways! I’d get into the details, but just look for yourself!!! No wonder they can’t figure out what a “woman “ is!!!"
the way that woman with the brown hair just avoided all their points 💀
""" i cant murder anymore!""  booooohooooooo!"
Supreme Court isn't there to make law its to make sure laws are following the constitition

Hardcore facts yall are so genuinely shocked because your school did not let you take the harder political classes. I’m sorry they took away your right to education. Please learn online the constitution.
I’m embarrassed behave of all women that our reaction is getting angry and crying. Seriously wtf did you all not learn the us constitution….we won’t be seeing any changes of this is your reaction and I see y’all posting it on social media. Guess what it doesn’t change anything. Politics aren’t emotional! Looks at the gun laws! Time to write a constitution written by our genius women. Come on now.

"I wanna know how many of you out there crying over a persons right to an abortion have taken the time to help out or adopt at least one of the 34 million children in foster care to date since this ruling? None of you I'll bet because that's not something you can protest and whine about and it would actually help out a child or teenager in the foster system so you won't do that, it's not your problem. Why should you help a child if you can't whine about it? The government winds up paying foster parents every month for a child none of you want so don't call this a success for you or the children, the foster parents are being paid to take unwanted children in for you so you haven't accomplished anything by raising protest signs and marching down streets. The children that my wife defends as a CASA volunteer are still left in foster care since none of you have done anything to help their becoming part of a real family and someones child. A 10 year old child impregnated by her father has no way of supporting a child, legally too young to work and provide for that child but that's okay for you I guess? After all it's not your problem it's someone elses problem but you've won? Not hardly."

"*Absolutely false, the Supreme Court does not make laws and the ruling for Roe v. Wade had nothing to do with an abortion, because Jane Roe did not have an abortion.* They ruled that going into her medical records was a violation of the 4th amendment, and create case law.

"God gives life once, he's the only way to true peace."
It's messed up how they take away women's right to murder thier unborn babies so sad
"One thing I don't understand: Most people find it terrible when someone simply opens fire on innocent people in a school with a gun. He is considered cowardly and disgusting. But the difference is that people at school can call for help, hide, fight back, or run away. At least you have a chance. A baby can't do that. Is it enough to simply see a baby in the womb as not a human being to legalize murder of him? I can imagine that these people are also against the death penalty in people who are guilty, but in a child who has done nothing they find it is women's rights."
Am I missing something.. all the supreme Court did was say its up to each state to decide.. sort it out yourselves..
"Good, women don't have rights to commit murder and you can't call it anything else, it is mainly used as a escape from responsibility👎💯👎💯"

I wonder how all of these right wing Christian zealots will feel once their daughters who were getting abortions behind their backs will feel once their little angels start turning up pregnant.

"""It's like taking Normandy Beach... and we will get to Berlin!

Pro life people should have been aborted
Even if Roe VS Wade wasn’t overturned. The SCOTUS case of Planned Parenthood VS Casey gave Republicans the power to make as many loophole anti abortion laws as they want to where it’s basically illegal to get one in a Republican state.
Lololol
"About 39 years ago I was close to 13 weeks pregnant and had an abortion. Near the end of the abortion the nurse said 'Oh My God' and stared for about a minute then left the room. The doctor continued staring for about a minute or two longer. I saw they were in shock and knew they watched my baby die. My legs were draped so I could not see. Please read below of the extremely fast speed of fetal development. 
Heart pumping blood day 21, brain waves day 40. see ""Baby Center- Fetal Development Week By Week""
 which states on WEEK 11 the baby can FEEL if the belly is gently poked on mom, is KICKING and STRETCHING, almost fully developed. Look at the pictures - the fetus looks like a developed baby. I was told at the appointment the fetus was just tissue - the same lie told today despite the advanced technology showing the truth. Many women do not discover they are pregnant until 6 weeks have already passed. - heartbeat and brain waves are present. The babys have bodies and rights also. Murder is not a right.

THERE WAS NEVER A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION.
Stop killing babies
The SCOTUS has decided what religion the US will follow.

Sorry killing babies was not found in the Constitution. But owning guns was.
If you cry because you can’t kill a child….you need to be in a federal prison.
If women are so scared of their lives getting ruined because of abortion then get an implant birth control that lasts 5 years. You won't get pregnant
Their social lives are at risk because of not aborting. Ridiculous and selfish
"""there will be no functioning society without women"" 
Lol there still are many anti abortion women"
"Women rights to be heard by government. Get policy to be protected and information to avoid unplanned pregnancy. It’s not moral to  get  pregnant out of plan, abort the baby and then claimed it as your moral right. , it should be women get protected  and policy in guiding them to become   Morally future mothers."
"50 years of abortion and killing of innocent babies. How many babies killed per day? Per week? Or the entire time. If those babies  were given chance to live, American could have millions of  genius people.  It’s not issue to help this kids, as Americans help other country problems. Yes, abortion can be avoided if women inform how to avoid unwanted pregnancies, and men will understand on this aspect. You cannot make law  or policy  which means of killing, as human being we value each life no matter how ugly and poor that human life is."
A win for LIFE!

Biden is the corporate trickster whose only job is to simulate you into a factory product to produce future soldiers to fight abroad.   Why do you think they want so many babies born.

FAMOUS DEX NAILS IT"
Praise god
women's rights is not getting stripped away by this decision.  Please look at the real enemy - transgender competing in women's sport - that scares me!  The lack of common sense in this country scares me.
Great video. We really have returned to medieval England...
Some of these shouldn’t worry about abortions 🤣 no sane person would sleep with them
I feel sorry for your country and your all just twisting and moulding your amendments to fit the monthly narratives  your country is a mess
This report is such a joke. The Supreme Court is not there to “protect civil liberties”. It’s purpose is to ensure laws passed are constitutional. More propaganda.
Oh yea lets protest bc we have lust
Making abortions illegal doesn't stop abortions...it just makes them unsafe. Women's rights over their bodies should never be questioned. This is terrifying
That’s what y’all get! Lol it turned on all y’all low key racists women and supposedly non racist women all y’all who voted for him y’all thought he had y’all back??? NOPE!! 😂 I don’t feel bad and I won’t be standing with y’all on this…
Is it just me or is the pro life representitive jusr pouring water there. I just can' t understand her argumentation. It' s empty drivle. She can't  even deffend her opinion in an argument then how can she stand behinde it?
If you go into a Pharmacy and ask for a Plan B pill guess what you can buy one for around 20$ and the best part of this is you don’t need a fuckin prescription!!!!!!!!!whooooo
Ex leftist from Texas here. No applause please. You'll embarrass me. Pro abortion women are skanks with that not-so-fresh-feeling and the men are womanizers. I'm sorry. I mean birthing people izer nizers. Good times. Blackmailed Biden to the shuffle board. Away!!!!
I guess the “festering” part isn’t referring to democrats
Just remember that we warned all those people who either didn't vote or voted for the rebublic that it would destroy the USA. You understand that this was Donald Trump. You chose Donald Trump... Blame all those morons who voted for Trump and helped this happen.
"This news sucks! Yea, all ya’ll are “pro life” until u have an unplanned pregnancy! Dont get all happy when u know you’d be terrified if u HAD to have a baby u cannot take care of!"
God forbid those who wanted it to be illegal go trough a situation where they got themselves into and can’t get out.  so many situations that can happen and unfortunately the help won’t be there. Shame
"Let me get this straight. So the media calls people activists when it’s convenient and fits the narrative right? And the Supreme Court just gave the states back their individual lawmaking capability correct? So people in California are protesting and throwing temper tantrum‘s because other states don’t want to do what Nazifornia wants to do? And they are upset because they feel their personal freedom is being taken away , which it’s not in California, so they think it’s OK to take away my personal freedom to drive on the expressway without being impeded? Or are liberals so driven by their emotions they can’t understand logic? Or are they so open minded their brains are falling out of their heads so they can’t process facts and laws? For anyone proabortion/murder, have you considered how fortunate you are that your mom had different beliefs than you? Otherwise, you wouldn't be here to harass others (who might actually have similar beliefs as you) and throw temper tantrums and complain. Mother Teresa said, ""I will never attend an anti-war rally. If you have a peace rally, invite me."" She understood the difference in what is in the hearts of protestors. Pure anger and evil. Bye Felicia"
Cry harder demons life wins
We stay smoking on that Roe pack 😹🚬💨💨💨
4:48 99 years is crazy lol imagine millions of women in prison 😹
This is very funny lol your asking to have the right to kill a baby 🫵🏾🤦🏾
"And yet women get pissed about rights or choice yet men have no choice but all financial responsibility...men have no rights. Now you know how men feel,,,.how's it feel ladies suxs doesn't it. Men should have right to financial abortion.. equality right..or is it only equality when it benefits women..."
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh
"I’m sorry, but to have abortions when most countries aren’t having enough babies to replace their own populations seems insane. It’s not a human right to kill babies - that’s insane."
Women are outraged. Then again its mostly women that are in favour in the video LOL
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 THANK YOU JESÚS FOR THIS VICTORY
This dude is confusing rights with privileges
"Anyone ever read the publicly available Roe v Wade ruling? 
Left leaning people seem to think that they're not allowed to have an abortion any more... fucking idiots"
"In 2020, over 6,100,000 babies were born in the US.  Of the millions of women who gave birth successfully, about 861 died in childbirth.  So the For the Mothers Health stat is verrrry low.  Source: CDC"
"People who are happy about other people being forced to birth a child they don’t want, could kill them, and will ruin their body/lives are evil. They like to hide behind their religion, they just want to control women like cattle. I will not breed for you! If you want kids have them! Don’t force others to!"
It is disheartening to see how people are vocal about having a right to kill a human being who is unborn. Their rights demand tearing off a living heart by ruthlessness of forceps in a place where it should have been its safest place. Those sissy tears of pro-murderers should meet the real tragedies of life that brings those genuine droplets.
are the new born children not Americans with rights?
"The women are pissed? Firstly, you are murderers and not women. Understand that."
"unfortunately the new “Republican supreme court” are doing their damnedest to, destroy this country ! 
If thinking about how many shootings and mass killings of innocent people we have had bothers you. Then just wait! 
From the date of the supreme courts irresponsible ruling, Of Roe v. Wade. 
in as little as 8 to 10 years, youth gun violence , will have increased 10 fold !    No one will be safe ! I dread to think about the impact this irresponsible decision. will have on society ! Especially in a country that lacks necessary and even the most basic, and common sense laws, when it comes to Gun control !!! 
guns are too easy to obtain! anyone can get one! 
Yet a womens autonomy is no longer her own! the right to choose what’s best for one’s own self. will now be decided by the state in which she resides!?!? WTF???
Bringing another life into this world. Is now chosen by state laws, that vary state to state! 
   Due to the huge number of unwanted pregnancies that so many women with be forced to birth! 
  Its going to be huge!
And the majority of these children will be born into poverty.  
  Take into account the statistics and The number of children that are currently neglected and suffer some kind of abuse , in America?!
 Then Try to imagine the huge increase in that number, and imagine how many children will be neglected , and or abused! be it mentally physically or sexually! one year from now! 
  The increase in the number of children effected, will start to become noticeable , literally ONE year from NOW!!!!
 It makes me sick and incredibly sad that The Crime rate and mortality rate will continue to increase in America ,due to the lack of gun control laws!
 In addition to that , we will start to see the crime rate and mortality rate  increase greatly in less then 6 months time, among American women.  Due to STRESS , PANIC HOPELESSNESS and pure DESPERATION ! 
  Everything has a “CAUSE & EFFECT”
 These are just some of the devastating “EFFECTS” that are to come. 
All “CAUSED” by the supreme court’s decision, to taking away a women’s lawful right to choose what’s best for herself!"
if they want to kill a child they should also be charged with murder 😒
"if yes to abortion ,no to child support that will be equal rights . If she has a child without the man’s agreement no child support and that’s the equal rights"
watching ugly women cry about not being able to kill babies is def a new low
Wow americans seriously need to change their Constitution... Or else anything that wasn't in the sphere of public life in 1776 gets to be seen as anticonstitutional haha losers. Vote Trump again see what happens this time
"I’m not strong either way but the reaction on the left leads me to celebrate this ruling with extreme vigor.  Cry more left wing nut jobs, it motivates me even more to vote Red and encourage those around to do likewise 😂"
"It took nothing away,Supreme Court just said States have the exclusive right to decide if its legal or not..."
That’s cool look here’s a donut 🍩
"Ah, the United States, once the envy of the west. Alas, no more.

The Bible belt has taken over."
*WOMEN: KEEP YOUR LEGS CROSSED*
"Woman are more educated, live longer, work easier jobs, commit suicide less. They have it easy."
The skanky woman are pissed.
Abortion shouldn’t be what liberates women while promoting sexual immorality
Plain and simple solution . KEEP YOUR LEGS CLOSED
Get married
"Republicans kill you on the front end democrats kill you on the background. 20,000,000 black babies"
Not really 1970 was worst for some
Selfish
"Once the male and female cells fuse, its already an independent being."
"Both sides, a sea of fools."
"I cant lie, I love to see these feminist crying. Also this news channel is trash."
"Contrary to popular opinion the vast majority of women who get abortions dont do so because of rape, incest or the possibility of passing on a deadly disease to the child.

Here are some Examples of the main reasons women get abortions.

1. I Had a Abortion because the baby father don't want me no more. 

2. I had a Abortion because the baby father is not financially stable.

3. I had a Abortion because I found out the baby father has other kids and I wanted to be the first babymama. 

4. I had a Abortion because he is married with a whole other 👪

5. I had a Abortion because I got too many kids already. 

6. I had a Abortion because my parents say they not gonna help me raise my child.

7. I had a Abortion because the baby father hurt me so in turn I killed his baby. 

8. I had a Abortion because I dont know who the baby father is. 

9. I had a Abortion because I don't want to be tied down with a child.

10. I had a Abortion a few times already and I'm not keeping no child if the father not gonna help take care of it.

These women constantly screaming my body, my choice but judging from these examples they not not making very good choices so its due time someone take the responsibility of having some checks and balances on this irresponsible and reckless behavior."
Where is this so-called right in the Constitution???
"If I can't kill them , I just won't have them."
"Make sure if you get arrested to take it to trial. Only 7% of criminal cases go to trial. If everyone goes to trial, it screws the system. That should prevent these people from getting too crazy with arrests. Important- Do not waive your rights to a 90 day speedy trial!

Along with that, make sure to record everything and livestream when possible. If you don't want to be recorded, wear a mask. 

Also green laser pointers that spread out are only 10 bucks free shipping when they use tear gas and rubber bullets like they did in Los Angeles and Arizona."
"So now our foster care and orphanages are gonna be crowded, with more families in poverty, more single mothers in need, and many deaths from at-home abortions. Nice going Supreme Court, who's going to support all these new lives, the states? Not to mention if a woman has an ectopic pregnancy, do we just leave the woman to die because her only option is abortion to live. Rape victims... need I say more. No one gets to control other people's bodies and you definitely do not have the right to force a woman to go through with a pregnancy she is not ready for or wants. The right to privacy extends to personal items, well my body is my most personal item and the government has no right to infringe on it."
"FYI for all these room temperature IQ’d, liberals making fools of themselves (per usual)-
As long as you continue to reside in your high crime, high homeless, democrat managed crappers abortion isn’t going anywhere.  But, ya might want rethink any possible moves to the greener pastures of Arizona, Florida, & Texas…Or, anywhere else for that matter."
"Who would have thought America in some states would go backwards 50yrs & take away civil rights from a women to have the choice about her own body & life.
Without medical intervention a premature baby wouldn’t usually survive, without medical intervention a woman who can’t get pregnant wouldn’t become a mother, without medical intervention after a miscarriage a woman might die from poisoning, it’s ludicrous in this day & age to deny medical help for terminating a unwanted pregnancy.
Most unplanned pregnancies the woman has the baby, termination is a difficult decision but it needs to be a women’s right.
Best thing to do is get a termination within a state where it’s legal & in those states that it’s not legal a ongoing ‘go fund me’ could be set up for disadvantaged woman to pay for fares & accomodation.
Don’t let the rats that use religion to take a woman’s rights away, some priests have been known to impregnate nuns, the church gives her the choice to either have the baby or they organise the abortion & the nun can continue with her vocation."
These protests never solve anything
"Don't like Abortion?
Then don't kill your baby."
"I think it's up to the baby to decide if it wants to be aborted. At least wait for baby to grow up, then ask if he or she wanted to be killed."
look at all the skank *ss bitches complaining that they cannot murder an infant. That’s pretty sick.
"Look at history, Satan has been throwing ideas into the minds of powerful people for children to be killed since years before Christ and after. Children were sacrificed to idols, and it seems that to this day he throws this devilish idea into the minds of many people."
What is a woman? 🤔
"The bootlickers suprised the boot is now firmly on their throats. They were acting as cheerleaders during covid for mandatory/coerced vax, now they're suprised they are the ones being treated like livestock. Funny and sad in equal measure."
It seems the left is so passionate about killing the unborn these days. Sickening.
Glad they stopped these baby killers at last
HOES MAD 😆
"Helping moms?! Where? Since when? They are the main group of people to shame single mothers, struggling families, etc. 😂"
"Another summer of ""mostly peaceful"" riots.......I MEAN....protests......yay"
Pro Choicers never protest a man's right to choose go figure.
that 1k-6k ratio give me a lil bit of joy
Abortion is NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT!
Half of these women identify as men loll
Men can have abortions
This also takes away medical privacy
"I get sad when I see women happy about this, and sick when I see the men. You don't get to say what happens with my body. A separation of state and church, that is what our country is built on."
"Roe vs. Wade, God please don't lead the way"
"Jesus Christ, not even trying to hide your bias here Channel 4."
"The reporter says ""The tribunal took away the constitutional right to abortion""
It was overturned bc it's NOT on the constitution. How are these ppl supposed to be journalists? Don't they feel disgusted w themselvs lying like that?"
Well pro Choice can sit in jail and prison if they want to abort a baby
I'm so happy that these sluts are angry yay
YAY I'm so happy
60% of abortions are white women
Remember when the vax was not ur body and choice
"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13)
He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. (Proverbs 28:13)
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. (Psalms 51:1-4)"
Remember when you satanists said Trump was dumb? Hang tight 😁
The notion that abortion is a constitutional right is patently absurd. Being born is a constitutional right because the constitution clearly states everyone has the right to pursue liberty and happiness. Being aborted pretty much exempts that now doesn't it?
"Where were all these women when governments were making covid vaccines mandatory and they just went along with it?, my body my choice 😐??"
NEW JERSEY IS PRO CHOICE SUPPORTING ABORTION SINCE THE  1940S! COME TO NJ ALL THOSE WHO NEED REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM
I hope all the ANTI CHOICE WOMEN GET UNPLANNED PREGNANCIES AND THE PRO LIFE MEN HAVE UNPLANNED PREGNANCIES. Let's see what choice they make behind closed doors
"Love how they make it female vs male, when there is towns of women who support abortion. Also funny how quickly they remembered what a woman actually is, haha."
I love watching ugly feminists have a meltdown.  And baby killers too.
That’ll put a halt to their gallop 👌🏼
"Dr . Levatino performed  over 1200 abortions.. Listen to his description of the procedure.  Pro abortionists, I'm not calling you with that cute name ""Pro Choice"", listen hard!
https://youtu.be/A16gzm9eaa8"
Sore losers!
Less murdered kids. A good thing. 100% of the time. Disagree? Move to an island of supervillains.
"YEAH! Take that, women who get raped!
Now you must keep that baby, how dare you want to have an abortion!!!"
Now they'll have less rights than before- serves ya right
"""Conservatives want live babies so they can train them to be dead soldiers"" - George Carlin about ""pro-life"" conservatives"
"If you step back for a moment and look at this, it seems pretty gruesome... people crying and angry because they can no longer KILL a baby in any state they choose.  Of course there are states which welcome you to go and KILL your baby in their state.  I read that many large corporations will pay your travel expenses to a KILL state for an abortion.  Unless a person was raped or something horrific like that, if we choose to not be responsible in the use of contraceptives and consent to being with a partner which turns into pregnancy, then buck up and be responsible on what your next step will be.  Stop blaming the supreme court for their decision.  They made a responsible decision.  Your turn to make a responsible decision in your life.  I am a proponent of choice.  It's my body and I will do whatever I want to my body, including getting a Covid shot or not.  Do not separate these things, it's all about my body my choice.  However, in my opinion people protesting, etc., is stupid.  You can still KILL a baby in your womb if you made a dumb mistake, just go to the states who will facilitate this for you."
4:25 why ask a bald guy about abortion. Why are men involved in abortion issues? None or you morons get it both the left and right are just idiots
There is no such thing as a woman or man we are all beep bob boop. I am a bip boop boop boop bop. Respect me!!!!

Thumbnail is so funny
How is having an abortion is a right so you telling me it's OK too kill a baby. Wow
"They want to bring a theocracy to the U.S.  it's insane, AND they want the orange POS trump as their leader.  Frightening."
All these people gonna go back to work the next day and this will all be forgotten.
I just came to watch ugly women cry over something they’ll never have to worry about 😂
I hope this will happens in all Latin America I mean the end of ab0rti0n
Once you know you’re pregnant it’s already a human being a month old fœtus is human being Im sorry to say that getting rid of him no matter how you put it it’s murder  they’re actually fighting to have the right to murder or keep their babies  this is sickening.  There are always mitigating circumstances  like if a doctor can establish that the mothers life is at stake  but even in that case  of the baby has a chance to live some women would rather die and give the baby a chance to live .  When I was a kid I learned woman was synonymous to love and tenderness  these senseless reactions just break my heart
We are dancing on the grave of roe v Wade what a chad
1:06 to 1:27 no one cares there should be no right to kill a baby u it so dumb and God say it murder to kill and look what u are doing what the heck. this is a great day for the US no more abortion
Hoes mad
"No more organ harvesting, blood sacrifice or child killing!!! Sorry satanic cabal times up!!"
Are there so many “Billie Jean” in USA?
Look at how evil and sinister these pro choice people are. They seem bloodthirsty. The genius move of donald trump has got to be respected.✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
"As a previously unborn fetus, it is hard to be outraged"
Hiring someone to kill your children should be very illegal because it’s illegal for anyone else..Your child isn’t a choice at all.. You had a right to create the child and you did it..Do you want to legalize killing a human being because of the inconvenience of your actions. If so will we next target the disabled?
They should only make abortion legal for trans-women 😂
"For all those baby killhas out there, just keep ya'll legs closed! Problem solved."
Yay it’s illegal too kill Undeveloped humans
The choice to kill babies is devil
Lol
There never was a Constitutional Right to begin with. Thankfully the adults are now in charge of the court.
"The court has over ruled  opinion 75% of the American public . Abortion is a fundamental right  for women. There’s gonna be a huge network of  people who will  take women to  pro choice States.  We will fight and  we will  object to  this ruling.   This woman is spewing BS, with no care for the  health and welfare of women.  Women will die  without abortion care, they will die for what most religions don’t consider a life worthy of funeral services. 
This horrible woman thinks he values, feelings and religious thought need  out rule legally those of all other women."
"Such misinformed individuals to the point were they are being manipulated into thinking and acting in this way. Abortion kills a million babies a year which is insane to me. Before all of you liberals come at me, most abortions occur because of the woman’s choice and not for a valid reason like assault or the woman’s life being in danger"
"Dude I'm pro-life and choice. Pro life with myself and partner and pro choice for everyone else. I'm religious but at the same time how am I suppose to parent everyone else from committing sin, it's impossible."
Has anyone else noticed that most if not all of the crazy woke freakouts over Roe v Wade are middle aged white liberal men and middle aged white liberal women? From the video footage neither demographic seem capable of scoring a date much less get pregnant.

"Channel 4 News = propaganda machine pretending to ""news""."
Cultural Brainwashing .
64 million babies dead since 1973 the killing babies business has slowed a bit.
Abortions were never a constitutional right to the Idiot woman speaking in this news segment.
Liberals now migrate to Sodom and gamora states leaving free states to prosper amen!!!
Channel 4s comment section passed the vibe check.  America still has the most liberal abortion laws compared to ALL of Europe.  NY and CA you can abort up to birth.  It’s not right.
For anyone who doesn't know they where trying to push abortion up to the third trimester.. basically before the babies are born... i don't care about a blob of cells but that is fucked up!!
"""The Supreme Court whose very purpose is to protect civil liberties"" That's categorically false. It's also false that the Court follows public opinion. The SCOTUS's job is to interpret and apply the law to cases before it, which it just did. SMH. Channel 4 is a joke. 🤣🤣🤣"
"0:32 This ""news organization"" just told a blatant lie to all viewers. Abortion was never a constitutional right. Leave it to the British to not know a damn thing about our country!"
Democrats and Liberals never disappoint.....here are your true insurrectionists!!!
Send the national guard to some of these cities
Anyone see where blantifa assaulted that pastor on the streets in la and got away with it?
"hahaha. i don't care one way or another about this issue. it's a female thing and women have always treated me like slime.
Still, it's nice to see feminists and their simps running around like a bunch of rabid psychopaths. great entertainment"
"All the women standing up for womens rights were not aborted women. We don’t give half the population the ability to kill the next generation. 
Thank your Mom for not believing in abortion. You wouldn’t be here if she agreed with you."
"Dear God, how many abortions are these women getting? Do their vaginas even still function at this point?"
What an asshole president!!!!
These women aren't technically women though.. they are angry entitled shits.
Biased channel 4 news
"as a woman, “murdering an unborn child” is absurd. its not a child, and its not murder if its smaller than a heart and doesn’t even have a heartbeat yet. what if someone with a uterus is raped? without the right to abortion, she would be stuck with her rapist’s child. but just because abortion can be made illegal now, doesn’t mean that people will stop having abortions. they would just stop having safe abortions. i have another question. if a 16 year old is raped and can’t financially support the child, if they want to keep it, what are they going to do? they know they will not be able to fend for their child without any support or money. would the pro-lifers be there for the mother when the child is born?"
If woman have the right of abortion then men should have the right to do a financial abortion.
"Men are necessary!! 
The world we all live in is build and maintained by men."
I read the constitution and I can’t find anything on the right to have a abortion. So you might want to print a correction as the report is wrong. If you’re a reporter facts should take first place or in my mind.
"No one has freedom to kill, either it is a life or it is not, determine that line, and only then seek a legislation."
Sheeesh 99 years in prison?
I love how the entire narrative is built around the idea that women are destined to have tons of abortions due to letting tons of strangers bust inside them
"I'm a Brit and apparently I know more about the constitution than Americans.
The constitution says Americans have the right to ""Privacy"" not Abortion. Ffs take responsibility."
"There are two rules created in error by our government in its early days that have been a disaster. 1. The fillibuster, a clerical error in the Senate. 2. Power of judicial review by SCOTUS which was the result of an error in the Judicial act of 1789 that allowed Marshal to use the Marbury vs Madison case as an excuse to appropriate the power he wasn't given in the constitution."
"WRONG. IT JUST GOES TO STATES TO DECIDE. MANY ALREADY ALLOW ABORTIONS. STATES DECiDE...nothing was removed. 
Why does media lis so much?  STATES RIGHTS."

I remember there was a day when a woman's virginity was a gift to a man now they just hand the most important thing that they have the gatekeep for, and they just handed out like candy."
Pro lifers should’ve  been aborted
I have no idea why people are so upset about the roe vs wade decision?   It's not like we outlawed dumpsters.
Should be a crime punishable by death. 💀
"Kicking. 
Screaming. 
Crying. 

All things an aborted child will never do."
Common America L as always
Roe v wade was never a constitutional right. It was a majority opinion of 7 justices on the supreme court. Only the legislative branch can make laws. The constitution does not give the right to abort.
What will Hillary Clinton eat for breakfast now!???☹️☹️☹️

They do have women out there like an occult mental and stupid and just wired and all the wrong ways that support women's rights being violated and taken away and put into the hands of the sketchy state
"Do fetuses have the right to life?

The argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong.
I will simply assume, instead of proving, that your murder is seriously wrong.
I will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder.
Finally, I will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issues to which this analysis of abortion ethics may lead.
The symmetries arising from the analysis of the main arguments on both sides of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult.
Consider the following standard argument against abortion: Fetuses are both human and alive. People have the right to life.
Therefore, fetuses have the right to life. Of course, women have the right to control their own body, but the right to life goes beyond a woman's right to control her own body.
Therefore, abortion is wrong.
The fetus' right to life does not include his right to use someone else's body to preserve his life.
However, an opponent of abortion may point out that a woman's right to use her body does not include her right to end someone else's life in order to do what she wants with her body.
In response, one might argue that a pregnant woman's right to control her body is not much, if it is wrong, to take any action that ends the life of the fetus within her.
However, an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus' right to life does not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses.
The consequence of all these symmetries seems to be a stalemate.
But if we have an attitude, then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of rights, a fetal right to life versus a woman's right to control her body.
One could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control one's own body in the case of abortion, because the loss of one's life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control one's own body, a respect for nine months.
Therefore, the right to life prevails over the right to control one's own body and abortion is wrong."
The right to privacy only extended to pregnant women. It was never a right .It was a ruling.

"THEIR ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICA ALREADY, IT GONNA BE WORST"
"I remember when the pro-abortion side was so virulently opposed that they wouldn't even allow a PAMPHLET to be given to woman that explained abortion, and also gave her other options prior to a procedure. That was absolutely ridiculous so I don't feel bad for their side right now. They refused to meet pro-life people anywhere in the middle and even advocated for partial birth abortions."
"Honestly just have your partner wear protection or have a hysterectomy or vasectomy. It's not that difficult. I do think exceptions need to be made for rape, incest or when the mother's life is in danger, or the baby has major quality of life issues due to medical reasons NOT financial issues."
This is a good change to end all the unjustified murders
“Stares Rights” the same propaganda pit forth prior to the Civil War . States rights to  own slaves

"Keep fighting! A woman’s body is hers and hers alone! 👊🏽 we are so sad and angry here in Australia for you, this is just backward and wrong."
"If white women vote for Trump and other Republicans again, it's just more evidence that abortion is not something they want to have as an alternative if they get raped by their twin brother or have a baby with fins not arms."
PRO CHOICE IS THE MAJORITY OPINION OF US CITIZENS. More than 8 in 10 Americans believe abortion should be legal.

"When Roe v Wade was passed in 1973, women had their husband to support them and the children that they created in their marriage, so what’s wrong with that model?
The children will have their biological father and mother as well as their biological grandparents for a lifetime. And the cycle repeats for the next generation and because husbands supported their families, less people should not be a burden to society in the form of welfare.
Furthermore, marriage is good for every economic class of women, especially, for poor women."
🙏HONESTLY 🙏KILLING DISMEMBERING  BABIES IS OVER THANK GOD. WOMEN OWN UP. WHAT IF YOU WERE ABORTED?????
"""FINALLY I HAD A FEMALE ABORT MY WOULD BE BLESSED FIRST CHILD  AND I OFFERED TO RAISE THE BABY ON MY OWN AND HAD NO CHOICE IN THE SITUATION BETWEEN HER PARENTS AND HER. I THINK ABOUT THE WOULD BE CHILD ALL THE TIME. I'M SO HAPPY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO KILL BABIES. HONESTLY WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE REALLY THINK IT IS. SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY."
The left is evil and truly demonic.
"In the guise of “equality,” evil cannot and must not have equality with good. 
It’s not a right nor protection for women’s for her pregnancies to be murdered; to do so is unnatural. It pits women against her unborn baby.
Abortions are unnatural and perversion like homosexual marriage and adult men marrying little girls.  It’s evil.  
Murder and sexually immorality cannot and must not have equality with life and purity."

Abortion is NOT a constitutional right. Get it straight
Watching this video enraged me. this is so wrong. I’m usually one to believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion but choosing pro life just makes you look like a joke
love seeing them cry
Theses comments do not pass the vibe check
I bet half of these pro choice protestors are vegan because they want to save animal life and avoid using plastic for the same reasons. Yet when it comes to a child 🙄 the world has gone bonkers
"This British woman reporting is so ignorant it's frustrating. The Supreme Court didn't overturn the right to abortion, they simply said ""Abortion should have remained a state decision, this should have never been involved with the US constitution""."
Killing babies is wrong and immoral
"Satan's minions really make themselves evident when you make it harder for them to kill the unborn. I'm appalled at the ladies who should be old enough to know exactly who Margaret Sanger was. I mean, even if you're pro choice, after researching that woman you'd think more people would be at least thinking ""ummm, maybe we need to revisit this whole planned parenthood thing"". It's kinda the same as the ""gender fluid"" stuff, where the pioneers were sick men like Alfred Kinsey and John Money. If you read about those men and still think this ""gender fluid"" ideology is good, there's definitely something wrong with you. It's unfortunate how many people are so easily brainwashed by evil people and terrible ideologies."
"Those who advocate for abortion should stand by their convictions, step up and abort themselves. Problem solved."
Damn imagine being one of these anti choice women and being brainwashed by the Patriarchy. 😵‍💫 dumb motherfuckers
Abortion is a huge sin killing babies  is something they proudly encourage and support if they're saying it's their bodies they can't do what they want then those doctors who are mostly men have the freewill go not perform these abortions too matter of fact any person with morals will not condone this
It’s a roe vs ease donation link

"Taking care of your young whether it’s inside your body or out is deeply engrained into the brains of almost all mammals, for you to take pride and joy in the killing of your young your mind must be so twisted beyond repair."
Your title is deceiving. They didn't overturn the right to abortion. They ruled that states will take control over the management.
No bias here…… move along.

"On the basis of which law do legislators and judges believe that they can limit the natural right of every person to self-determination? They have no legal basis for doing so, because the natural right to self-determination need not be granted, nor can it be denied. All cases concerning individual privacy are part of that natural law. I have serious doubts about the quality of law schools in the US."

"Why can't you claim an unborn child on your taxes?
The law is, you have to wait to see if your child is born alive."
"can anybody tell me what's the positive side on anti-abortion?  i mean, is there a merit on banning abortion?  coz i can't think of anything good on banning abortion🤨"
Don’t support women. Look at Lisa Rutledge as a leader and allowing sheriffs to profit personally off prisoners. Do not support women
It’s interesting how crazy these people act yet the pro life people are so calm and nice. Pro abortionist act like lunatics! Just by common sense alone I’d rather be with the normal people then the crazy left!
"Some of the convulsions of screaming and crying by these people who are upset should be reminded that if an unborn baby, whose about to be aborted, could scream they would both sound similar."

"💥🔥🔥Last Wed (6/22/22), I was touched by God to pray for overturning Roe v Wade or abortion by US Supreme Court and two or three weeks before with Ps Ruben and our church during prayer meeting.  Praise God for the victory ! 👍☝🤴✌  That is why the more you come against God for being wild, the more you would lose.  Do not wrestle with the most high God! The two young women protesters at Lakewood church should have never despised God's churches, His Bible, and His Prophetic Voice and Word.  If I were Joel, I would rebuke them harshly to stop them.  God has sovereignty and power above all.   It is no joke. I am a major prophet of God. I saw the harsh judgment of God towards the rebellious and prideful people after the grace period.  Abortion is an abomination to God (Romans 1); it is murdering.  It means you both brought God's wrath on yourselves.  Very dangerous situation!  STOP!  You women are foolish.  God created them; their bodies belong to Jesus, not them.   I am here to warn and protect you abortionists and protestors from going to Lakewood church to protest again but the Lake of Fire!  Got it.  That is Love of God to tell you all truth.  When you do not know something and the negative consequences of it,  keep quiet and be humbly pray.  That is my advice.  🙏Call on Jesus, our Final Judge!  He ❤may forgive you."
"It’s a sad reflection on humanity to see such a pathetic rabble get so upset about the killing of unborn children. 

But then perhaps this is what we should expect after decades of trendy education, media brainwashing, poisoned water and food.

"""pro lifers"" are worse than the Taliban. They hate real freedom and women. Pure evil"
The reporter is an evil clown liar. She is a demon.
It's not a constitutional right to kill a human. All these angry people are alive killers. It's not a woman's right to kill mass murder.
"Are Americans... dumb? If we completely ignore the discrimination against women's rights and only focus on the child's aspect, this is still a catastrophe. Many of these children will be the result of incest or rape, or even rape against a minor. Who do you think is going to love these children? Most of them will end up in foster care, and we all know what that's like in the US. Plenty of physical abuse, sexual abuse and so on (not everywhere of course, but it's overwhelmingly common). The mothers who decide to keep and love them will probably struggle with trauma and have a hard time taking care of their children. People who have grown up with parents struggling with mental health know it can have huge consequences on their own mental wellbeing. 

Then we have the children who are the results of a faulty condom or two young people not being informed about protection. They might grow up with parents who love them above all. In most cases though, the father won't be present considering most women opting for abortion are single. In addition, it's very likely that the mother won't be able to provide for her child since she didn't even have the money to travel to another state for an abortion. In other words, the child will have a pretty rough childhood. 

But hey, as long as the child survives birth, it doesn't really matter if they suffer the rest of their lives. Right? 

I hope all of you who are pro-life are ready to open your wallets, hearts and homes for all the children you have forced into the world."
Y DON'T ALL these ABORTION PROTESTERS GO OUT and  MARCH AGAINST  the B I D E N GOVERNMENT
All these women anti abort.. what if they get raped and dont want the baby anymore? Shame

Good!! If you want to live in a liberal state then go ahead. Otherwise the States can say what they say. Liberals are so looney they think life is over....but when that peganancy is terminated that's really a life being taken. Think about it 🤔

Leftism is a mental illness.
I’m 100% pro-life. There’s been a good effort to support women who have chosen life. But now more than ever we need to do better. We need to make adoption more affordable. We need to do a sweep of the foster care system. We need to make sure that mothers and fathers who choose to keep their children have the resources they need to raise those children. Free school lunches example small example. Now is the time that we stand up and show what it means to really be pro life. Let’s let them all know we’re not just pro-birth but we are pro-life in that we are pro-safe happy life and we will do everything possible to make sure that that happens for every life.
White women freaking out!😂😂😂now deal with it! Your votes put these white men in power 😆😆😆😆
Your body your rights. Then dont beg for tax payers money to raise kids from multiple men
I wish so bad all those abolish abortions” people get handed a flyer announcing “yay!!!  Every pregnancy will happen… now.. we are raising your taxes several hundred dollars a year to support these unwanted pregnancies happening and also inform them to stay tuned because they will soon be watching underground footage of homemade coat hanger abortions happening throughout the country.  Yay
I expect all pro lifers to put their money where their mouths are in including the Republican justices to support the forced births! Don’t just open your mouths roll the money or cut your genitals!

I’m pro life. Glad this happened. Hook up culture? Please… what’s funny is that people can’t educate themselves to fully understand what happened. Government taking their rights? Um no you stupid bitches! They’re have the power back to the states… TOO the people to choose whether abortion will be legal or not. Abortion is murder and there is so many misleading “facts” that the Left is showing to the USA. Abortion causes more health problems not birthing a child. Also abortion doesn’t change your financial status. There are plenty of resources so idk where they’re getting that they can’t. I’m a 26 year old with 4 kids. Oldest is 8. Plus I’m Latino from east LA. I don’t have issues. Those who want to abort a child just straight up doesn’t want the responsibility. They can’t woman up and admit that. They use excuses.

"Wow. This news channel REALLY lies. The ""majority"" of Americans did NOT support Roe being upheld. The American public agrees with this ruling (i.e. that each state has the right to determine its OWN laws pertaining to abortion)."
False dichotomy: pro choice vs anti choice
"Serious question: did the US actually vote on this or was it ""some people in the court"" deciding for everyone?"

"This is on the level of overturning Dredd Scott. And like the overturning of that abomination, the overturning of this one isn't the end, there is a long road ahead."
"The abortion industry is not about ""rights"" or ""freedom"", it's about pushing eugenics and profiting from it. It has been  about eugenics  from the start, and like every institution, profit motive is never far away."

You know what doesn't help. Man for abortion and a WOMAN for anti-abortion
But women are protesting against it as well and have been the main advocates. What do you call there rights?
Why is killing a human life a liberty? Is that not the definition of murder?
"This has nothing to do with ""rights"".  This is about the dismantling of a corrupt and evil system."
Why are men even speaking on this !? Or commenting !

Why silence that wonderful heartbeat 💗 i am so happy about the outcome

1:21 there will be no function in society without babies and the babies are dead. Gay community and abortion rights is ending the world for Caucasian people. Tragic and sad. Gay and abortion rights are human made up theory's that goes against the creation of life.
What is the creature on that thumbnail
😂😂😂😂yesss ban those killing of the babies...and the way they said there bodies thefe choice...your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit not you bodies and😂😂😂 ban the killings of the abortion😂😂😂
"Abortion is not a constitutional right. 
Misleading media!"
"If women have a right to opt out of parenthood, men should too. #mybodymychoice #mymoneymychoice"
"The reason the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade is because they consider abortion as ending the life of a living human being.  If that be the case, I think the government needs to reconsider the fact that  you can't claim an unborn child on your tax return because the government says it's not a person.  Sorry, Mr. Government, but you can’t have it both ways."
The majority don't support abortion.
What about the rights of the children ?
There is no constitutional right to abortion. It leaves the issue with the States .more totally biased media.
I can't believe people are crying because they cannot kill babies.  We are living in the days of Noah and the days if Lot.  People need to turn their hearts to God while grace is present.
This is sick. I never saw people so angry they can't kill their children.
"I used to think the BBS was better than American news programming,,, but ... I just... I have a copy of the constitution right here in front of me.

We will make it a crime in all 50 states to kill a baby🐏🐏🐏
This has triggered the fight to a whole new level and we will see countless protests
"Say what you may about President Donald Trump, but he wasn't dumb after all."
"The reporters obviously know nothing of our American system. Courts don't make decisions based on majority rule. We are not and never have been a democracy. We have God given rights that the government cannot infringe upon. Abortion is not one of them. In fact, Abortion is murder of another human being with their own DNA whose life started at conception according to science."

"No matter how many chicken bones and lemon juice you use, you will not find abortion listed in the Bill of Rights.

bout time we overturned it. It was wrong in the first place. We need the SCOTUS to rule abortion is murder. Science backs this. Or do lefties not like science anymore. That's right. they despise science with their 374 genders.

"MANDATED COST OF PRO-LIFE LEGISLATION

Any state that rules against women's rights to abortion services MUST provide free maternity healthcare for all it's resident pregnant women in all hospitals (private or public of their choosing) in the state, plus five years of mandated support services for the child and mother (for daycare, food, health and pediatric care) for the child/children born in the state. 

As the government and the law are being used to deny women these rights, so MUST the government and the law be used to create MANDATORY oversight to ensure the women are not discriminated against in any hospital based on their minority status. In addition, there must be comprehensive scrutiny laws enacted in the state to guard any discrimination and hate crime in general.

The decision to deny women the rights of their bodily autonomy must be paid for by the states that deny those rights.

Come out and see the world. Marry a loyal, conservative and responsible Chinese man. There are many such men in China. The best husband to his wife in the world is a Chinese man.

"It is okay if women are denied abortion. They can now give a nice gift to their government. They can drink, smoke and do drugs during their unwanted pregnancies and abandon their defective babies to be the responsibility of the state which banned them from having an abortion. The state may ban abortion, but women can still drink and smoke like they are not pregnant and gift the state a baby which is addicted to alcohol, nicotine and drugs."
These women sure want to be able to sleep around and kill whomever they want. Glad they were stopped

There never was a constitutional right to abortion.

It's illegal in sc now lol. Make you cunts responsible for the babies help create.
Why are they crying..lol..it's easy just close your legs and make better choices.
"My body my right, what about vaccine mandates …. Welll eeeerrrrr"
Taking away rights of women? More like giving rights to babies who are too innocent and helpless to speak for themselves.
"If Fauci, Bill Gates, Justin Trudeau, and Boris Johnson, together with their cohorts were foetuses I  would be pro abortion, in fact I would be prepared to carry out the procedures myself, as they are not, I don't! Hallelujah the Pro-Life Lobby! Amen 🙏"
"The dangerous part is the media’s roll in this. It’s the states right to decide. It puts the power back to the states. 
In many cases I’ve seen is abortions after 6 weeks will be illegal in many states. Not illegal across the board as the media wants you to believe. 
Also having members of congress here is a violation of their oath of office. Because you don’t like the decision doesn’t mean you protest the action as Maxine Waters and others have done."
I've never seen someone cry because they can't kill any more children.
Feminists are just screaming prostitutes who should be killed immediately before they kill more children.
"Onlyfans, instagram, ticktock, twiter """" models """" and cheating wifes are not longer able to hide their irresponsible acts aborting innocent lives. What a shame... They cant keep selling their bodies on social media or hide their affairs to their husbands.. Not they have to be very very carefully.
We finally coming to sense in earth with what we doing. I am happy this has happened 👌🏼👍🏼"
Hoes mad yuh hoes mad hoes mad hoes mad yuh
How about fixing the social ills that have distroyed the family structure first...?🙄
"Evil feminists turned the greatest gift in humanity, the ability to create life, and turned it into a horrific burden on the mother and normalised the indiscriminate killing of babies for contraceptive methods and any criticism is discriminatory, regardless"
Seethe. Cope. Sneed.
What a shithole country.
there is no such thing as the right to kill a baby
"abortion should be abolished everwhere, it is murder, it is evil"
This is disgusting to watch
Waaaaaaaaaaaaa 😭 😭 😩 hahahahaha

Basically it should be difficult to .end a pregnancy....strange how... the left support the opposite.. ignoring the baby to bes. Human rights
I’m surprised that the reporter didn’t loose her temper or choose which side. she’s really professional
「明確なメッセージ、明確な構造、理解しやすい、ありがとう」、
Democrats have not been this MAD since they had to FREE their SLAVES
You the man trump.
The Supreme Court went against the will of the people is irrelevant. They went with the constitution. If they really wanted to go pro life they would have ended it by applying the equal protection clause to the unborn. Such bias
Good
"Wonderful news! At long last, the Silent Holocaust of 50 million babies has at long last been decisively ended. The American left's culture of death will soon self-destruct from the inside out! :)"

Wonder how these people who are for abortions would feel if they were asked  if their mothers had a late term abortion with them  and they were survivors of that abortion  ended up having mental or physical repercussions of that decision their mothers made would feel!!! Don't think they'd like it too much if they did have the mental or physical abnormalities to live with for the rest of their lives!!!
Abortion is Murder!!
"I wonder where these people were with their ""My Body My Choice"" when a certain govt mandated medical procedure was being forced on me a few months ago"
"I love your saying that roe v Wade abolishes the right to privacy essentially. First of all that right has been established in quite a few Court presidents second, reasonably if abortion is a right it is so far disconnected from the right to privacy that when I had a college professor who is himself a former Democratic candidate for political office and I brought up that roe v Wade was decided on that basis he didn't know that. It makes no sense whatsoever to say that you have a right to abortion because you have the right to privacy."
Hoes mad
Need to pass more laws in Texas that makes it unbearable for these sub-humans to live here so they'll leave.
"Wow, I really appreciate how the reporter was so unbiased. True professionalism."
The  democrats have just been handed the midterms if everyone gets out & vote blue.  🌊🌊🌊🌊
"I've had a revelation. Suddenly, after 70 years I'm FOR  abortion. Because, I just realized, the people that aren't pro abortion and get the majority of abortions,by far, are the people I wish didn't exist. Let them get as many abortions as they want. In fact,speed it up."
So this means if someone rapes me I have to keep their baby WOW F U Trumptards That’s why your Supreme Court justices passed another law that they and their immediate family can use your tax dollars to provide security detail which they will need 24/7 ofcourse nice win Trumptards
👍👍... The Democratic party loves to encourage violence... They're pretty much encouraging abortion..🤔 such a sad party to be in .. President Bill Clinton was the last decent Democratic President we had .. what happened to the Democratic party they've become angry.. bitter and encourages violence every chance they get... I think it's the only way they think they can win .. that's why they're supporters are so angry... bitter and violent.. Just saying

"It's really simple! 
It's all and always about race. 1ST time in America history, whites are the minority race and that is what they always feared. That's why abortions are illegal in Red states and Abortions are legal in Blue states (with Minorities). This was all planned for obvious reasons. THAT'S IT!!!"
"They aren't pro-life. They are pro-zygote. When women have tubular pregnancies, or a zygote dies in the womb etc. Do they care if that woman dies from not getting life saving surgery? That's why in no way are they pro-life. So quit calling them that."
Thank God!!! Lord forgive us!
Why in C4 News opinion are only the pro abortion states called 'democratic' 1:40 ....? Hahahahaha. the mainstream left wing bias is REAL!

I hope the tape over mouth trend takes off
Why is everyone getting upset after all “ What is a woman”. ?   Gender is an identity based  on feeling . As a man I can identify as a woman when I feel I should
"June 24 is a day I'll never, ever, ever forget! Kyle The Warrior Rittenhouse was aquitted and abortion was banned! America wins again! The Republicans and Consertive democrats are gonna take back the U. S. senate, lower taxes, inflation, gas prices, close the border and pass brutal anti-crime bills and give law enforcement more authority and power than they could ever want!"
The regret meter just spiked about another 20 million feet or so
Murder is a murder regardless of how it is done.
Never was a constitutional right. Dumbasses.
Yall was real quiet when they forced a vaccine on yall
Why not abort all the pro abortion people from life right now.  Would sure be a lot more peaceful right now
This reporter is big mad. She’s also not good at hiding her bias. Terrible journalism.
All of these idiots that support abortion should be forced to answer what an actual woman is - a biological woman - bc we’ve seen time & time again that they can’t/won’t do that.
"It is mind-boggling to see women crying because they do not have the right to kill their baby.

What kind of society do we live in where we make it normal to have the right to kill a newborn inside a mother's womb?

We're in the 21st century! I am so thankful that the law has finally caught up to science!"
Abortion is murder but I don't care.
"If “liberals”/communists and demoncRATs are so interested in “democracy” and as they always say they are the majority, WHY ARE THEY AFRAID TO LET “DEMOCRACY” WORK (ie let the people vote on it state by state)?"
"If these people would put that much energy into raising their kids the world would be so much better off.

 Instead they're fighting to be able to murder them...."
ABORTION ISNT A FUCKING RIGHT
lol no more fcking i guess
This is sad. Just get your tube snip no more kids. Men and women stop using abortions  for birth control.
We are living in a crazy country that hates women.
Bunch of crazy no conscious good for nothing baby-murderer supporting BOTS.
"Look at all those people not murdered before they had a chance. 

Shelley Lynn Thorton says (the babe that WASNT aborted in Roe vs Wade) she is glad she's alive. Who would thought?"
There is no right to abortion in the constitution. All the news outlets are frigging liars.
Oh so sad... Now there is a consequence to being a hoe And you don't just get to dispose of it. Boo fucking hoo. Quit being a hoe and get a better job
No constitution right to abortion you baby killers...
a bunch of nut cases
Abortion is not a reproductive right since reproduction has already taken place.🤣
Fascism always comes as liberal.
Try responsibility before you get pregnant and while your trying to do that come and see a baby on a steel table being put into a bin bag and burnt with general hospital waste .
"It was Trump he did it , it's all Trump even Channel 4 being sold off is Trump it's all Trump ."
It's not a right...its murder...stop the lies...
Some of these nut jobs want to abort upto the day of Birth!
So you can't have an abortion but you can carry a gun and shoot at children. Glad to be Canadian
"What, you mean we will have to take responsibility."
Where does it talk about how abortion is a Constitutional Right? It's NOT!!
"I understand the fetus could be a potential life. But as soon as a child is born, all care leaves this world. How does that make sense?

Instead of saving a life (the mother’s) it will most likely ruin the life of two, the unwanted child and the non-consenting mother.

I see that people write that when a fetus appears the woman’s body is no longer her own.

But it is. The foetus is IN her body. It doesn’t own it, just by existing.
No one should own somebody else’s body, in any way. 

I’m not a slave to a fetus.

I refuse to be."
America is the land of the free? Lol women don't even get a say so over their own body.
Beautiful people
Its just a matter of time before your rights are affected. Then maybe you'll understand.
F**k you channel 4 marxist  perverts. You can tell princess Charles to s**k it too.

There is no right to abortion.  There is no right to murder helpless children.
What is a woman?
Its over for murderhood
A baby can grow up to be  80 or more   wake up you are killing a human being
You force people to wear a mask even now so why not a Jonny?
There is no such thing as an constitutional right to murder an unborn baby!
"I love how they are saying womens rights and choices are being removed.

As a woman it’s my choice to use contraception and not have to rely on an abortion to correct my own irresponsible decisions regarding my body. 

There are very few other cases that abortions would even be for."
Oh so terrible.. we can’t murder babies anymore by the millions. The horror. If a woman’s life is at risk due to the pregnancy then I understand abortion in that case. But there’s no other compelling argument for it that’s actually justifiable
70million babies .if they had a voice what would they say .this people are evil
"There are many women  crying and completely upset  because they do not know how to prevent unwanted pregnancies! The older ones obviously know who Is going to take care of those babies.......
Do not get pregnant!
On the other hand:
"" there are specific medical and or medicolegal indications for abortion"""
A fetus now has Civil rights.......
"The issue is abusing abortion, most are careless and dont tell their guys to wrap their tools or take plan b"
"In the same time the court rule in two cases 
First case you do not have control over my Gun
Second case I have control over your body (you do not have control over your body)

"And just like that, everyone knew what a woman was again."
"stupid pro lifers , ah well that's the US for you, you have to share the space with others who's opinions are different , both a blessing and a curse."
"Abortion isn't the solution. Providing care for the baby AND the full needs of the mother goes hand-in-hand. 

The left's idea of caring for the life of a woman is by promoting abortion for ""any reason,"" like this so-called reporter said. The right's idea of caring for the life of a woman is by offering baby products, mental health counseling, childcare, adoption resources, etc. for FREE via nonprofit ""life clinics"" which primarily serve the needs of young, impoverished soon-to-be-mothers in the inner city.

Why is that so hard for the left to grasp?"
"idiot liberal democrats insist on the right to Murder Children, SO SICK"
Chanel 4 is straight out biased
"""...took away the constitutional right to abortion."" 0:32

IT IS NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. That's why the Supreme Court overturned it. Now the states get to decide if they want abortion or not."
Abortion is evil! It is a perversion and I am glad this happened.
Fk America
"This is a dark day for women’s rights and I’m so angry people’s choices are being taken away. 
Ironic how a lot of these conservative people supporting anti-abortion laws are pro guns but happy to allow those killing machines to keep murdering children."
Lol imagine dem states flooded now
I love it when  libtard gender confused democrats scream at the sky and run around like their hair is on fire. The best
Not just increase the minimum wage. Force employers to hire every woman!! Give them something to do!!

President Biden had a chance to codify abortion into law. Name one bill he bought to Congress to this effect. Name one Democrat who has?
Thank God for president Trump
Not even a semblance of unbiased reporting.
"Killing a baby isn't a constitutional right, it goes against everything the constitution stands for."
Why now? Something ain’t right
"Dear women, dear feminists, for your information, men have always been in danger to be made a father against their will. In those cases, there is hardly any personal autonomy left, since you have to pay and care for a child although you did not want to.

Women have benefited from the privilege to be able to undo their mistakes/accidents after the fact, whereas men always have only had the option of contraception.

Also, plan B, the application of which is only the woman's chioce, continues to exist.

How could it ever have been fair that a potential father has 0% authority in the decision about plan B/abortion, but 50% responsibility for the child? How have women been able to infringe men's right of personal autonomy and not care at all for decades but, now, thes are going nuts, because some of them lose one of two undo options? 

This now is the perfect example to show that women are extremely privileged regarding the societal empathy they receive. Where were all the protesters fighting for men's rights of family planning/life planning/personal autonomy? Also, it shows that women hardly care about or empathise with men like they care about/empathise with each other. They are equally egoistic as men."
Lost a beloved grandchild through abortion does it give me rights to overturn abortion? Certainly not
"Very biased. Very, very biased."
Horrible reporting fake news like this is why so many British people have misconceptions about the US
The Supreme courts didn't and can't take away anyone's rights. All the rights you have as Americans is in the constitution. They are just there to say you can't interpret the constitution in any way to fit your narrative and say it's your constitutional right so the Supreme Court has to do what you demand. That's not how it works. Until you put a bill through the house this might be the trend of America on abortions one moment its a federal law the next it's not based on politics. The constitution shouldn't be a political game or tool. It's in there or it's not that's it.
God is good. Abortion is not.
Not a constitutional right. Fake news.
"""Women's rights, women's rights!!!! Whaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!""

"Funny how the anti-choice idiots think that this will reduce abortion. Sorry assholes, you only made it unsafe. In fact, if you fools have other conservative views, guess what, you are going to lose even more when the majority wake up.

A heart-felt FU to all of you who said that our Handmaid references were over-the-top paranoid hyperbole. Apologies accepted if you get 3 or more of your progressive friends registered to vote. 

On the plus side, this crisis could be used as the impetus to rally enough sane Americans to finally end the Electoral College, and/or make the Senate reflect the will of the people instead of a radical minority that live in red states. These institutions were created solely to get slave states to join the fledgling union. Any excuse that is made to keep them has now been proven to be outweighed by the negative effects."
"Yes as a mother I do not think abortion is a way to fix sexual irresponsible actions. But the getting  rid of something that Yes is the personal choice is absolutely wrong.  No one is talking about the background of Roe versus Wade. They  forget about all the back alley abortions  a woman would get when it was not legal and died from. Or having to carry then give birth to an abusers child or pregnancies the are so unwanted that the child will end up thrown out like trash a found dead or barely alive. I remember all the news reports. I am a 56 year old woman, mother,  grandmother, wife and daughter. A choice is  your own if it doesn't do harm to others. Yes a fetus will not live but no others have the right to tell no one what they should do.  I had an abortion and also chose life."

Until their daughters get raped. Let’s see if they are celebrating then and watch their daughter forced to have the baby. Disgusting
"Yeaaah except no it doesn't... Lol

This title is a full blown LIE 🤦‍♀️ you can still get abortions! Each state just have the right choose now. Jesus Christ 🤦‍♀️😮‍💨 lol"
"ok so outline me what women are worried about?  Tell me why you want to protect the right to kill a baby,  because you are a junkie and you should not take care of a child....hmm well maybe thats your life change you needed.  You are too young, well maybe you should have thought of that before hand.  Pregnancy will kill you, well that is 0.0001 percent so if you are that person than ok and also sounds like you should take responsibility for yourself if you knew ahead of time."
"Wow... this reporting is pure biased trash.  Like dirty diaper, steaming hot dumpster trash."

"More trash, divisive ""reporting"" to spin this like every other issue. Disgusting."
It’s not a right to exterminate your pregnancy and damn sure not a constitutional right!
The idea that women have a right to kill their baby is bankrupt
abortion is a way for women to escaping consequence of fortificating. take responsibility women
So wearing a masks or getting the shot should be choice too right?!! That shouldn't  be forced on you to get the jab!

"Actually, women have more rights than men do when it comes to reproductive rights. If these feminists are so pro-choice, then they would be for men being able to financially opt out of an unwanted pregnancy."
It was never a right to begin with and the entire thing was pushed through the courts on technicalities. The tenth amendment is a right however and its very clear where abortion belongs
Pro-life women jumping up and down in excitement thinking it’s just about abortions. Fucking idiots celebrating their rights being stripped away. When their babies miscarriage  and they become felons and go to prison for it maybe they will understand then.

TRUMP make America great again!! 🤙👍
Bunch of idiots crying go make me a sandwich.
"what a lie!   Look, the fight isn't against women's rights.  Its against the RIGHT to FORNICATE & MURDER.   It's that simple whorish people.  The Right to Fornicate without consequences is what the liberal wicked folks want.  They want to sin without being held accountable & responsible for the consequences it brings.  Most abortions (99.9 percent) are based on purposes of 'convenience'.  There's no reason to penalize the baby for the crime of the father (for those who've been raped and impregnated..  Just do your child a favor, spare his/her life and deliver him/her and offer him/her to adoption.   There's plenty of families that cannot bare children of their own who desire to be father and mother to them."
A majority of people against abortion are women......
Save the babies and abort the mothers.
"These British ""journalists"" always think they are more clever than they really are. Smug and sorely misguided. UK, Canada, Australia were all lost decades ago."
"Right, cause nothing says PRO-LIFE like getting the death penalty for an abortion, right?"
Such wisdom. 50 years of babies being murdered finally getting justice.
"You are allowed to kill babies as long as you use a gun, preferably a concealed one."
"Abortion is MURDER. Abortion is NOT a constitutional right. Let the individual states decide; if one wants an abortion, they can go to where it is legal. Pro-Life citizens do NOT want to have abortions conducted in their state."
"these people are just a bunch of baby killers, we need the sacrifice instead of common sense and resposibility.  What about the civil liberties of the life you created....I understand why you say my body my choice...but why dont you say my body my responsibility....so how about its your responsibility to not have a child if you dont want one.  How about we promote responsibility instead of a quick fix by killing a baby.   See the thing is its not about taking away womens rights, its about not killing babies you fucking crazy women."
"So ""my body, my choice"" is suddenly a thing again? I thought you guys gave up on that when people were forced to get the experimental jab & you supported it for profit? 
Do you still support people getting arrested for inciting violence? You people on the left implicitly, boldly & blatantly call for violence, yet no one gets arrested, but on Jan 6th, Trump never called for violence, or suggested anyone enter the capital, and you lose their minds & waste millionsof tax payer money to produce hearings for show. It's so obvious that Democrats don't play by the same rules, and continues to blatantly break laws without shame. News flash...Americans from ALL parties are getting tired of your hypocritical ways & dirty antiques. November is going to be a house cleaning that is long overdue!"
"Liberals got violent because they didn't get their way??? Crazy, who woulda thunk?"
Abortion is not legal in half the states an illegal and a half the states… That is a blatant lie you are putting on your news program. This is not what is going on. It is up to the states to decide via vote. This is an assumption he’s making because he’s talking about a worst-case scenario. But to tell everybody that this Is some sort of definitive outlying of abortion is the definition of fake news. You are lying through your teeth when you make that statement
Ohh my god... cant do abortions anymore.
"The abortion camp owns this. Your own fault. The 50 yrs you took rare and safe to 98500 elective abortions in a 100,000 and right up to the day of birth, you lost the debate."

I have to constantly remind myself that not everyone has a brain capable of logical analysis, and that some are indeed slow and/or special ed.  These people seem to fail to read the fine print of what has transpired.  The Supreme Court didn't ban abortions, they merely gave the power back to the states to decide.  Even then, most aren't banning them outright, but banning them after a certain time frame.  A lot of these people are demonstrating a condition known as ""blind by emotion"" or BBE.  Where they are so emotionally invested, that they lose all sense of logic and reason.  It's sad."

Roe vs Wade is dead! Farewell...
"Based, make it a crime everywhere"
Ok now let's make it illegal for men to get Vasectomies!!!!!!!🤣😂
There is no constitutional right to abortion that is a LIE.  Truth is Americans forced to pay for these abortions are illegal and now they are no longer force to pay for this slaughter of the innocents.
What the suprem court did with Roe V. Wade was sent it back to the states. It is up to each state to decide if abortion will be legal or not. Hopefully We the People will be the ones to decide in our state by vote. I wonder if people are so bad inform or uninformed. Base in what I hearing in the liberal media people are bad inform!!
"Roe v wade wasn't a ruling on abortion.

It was a ruling on privacy that assumed abortion was a legitimate medical procedure.

All the courts sid was say ""woah wait a second we don't have any laws about this,  we can't enshrine it because we don't have the laws to act upon"" which is their duty

Cope and seethe child murders"
"I don't know if people are disinformation or bad inform in the suprem court justice overturn on Roe V. Wade. Base on what I have been seeing and hearing on CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC news and even what I listen Biden said as he was trying to read the teleprompter. It is a  combination of disinformation with bad information. And a clear show of brain washing to protest about something that didn't happen and a insensitivity to violence to push a narrative that fit their agenda instead of information."

"I have been hearing a sudden spike in birth control. Ummm, why haven’t people been protecting themselves from pregnancy in the first place? 
I mean, that’s just irresponsible. Birth control has been free in clinics for years now."
no more creampies. 😂
"What is woman? Hang on, answer that one first. 😂"
"NO PUNT INTENDED BUT TO THE SAME ""WHITE FOLKS""  MAKING THESE LAWS & FIGHTING AGAINST A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOSE.  AS SOON AS ONE OF THEY'RE LITTLE GIRLS COME UP PREGNANT WITH A CHILD OF COLOR.  OHHHHH'  THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN DOCTOR'S ON CALL ""BELIEVE THAT""  IT WILL MAKE THE NEWS SOON & VERY SOON !"
"To women in states who are going to be forced to have children, make FULL USE of WELFARE of your current state!  Full use!"
"Dear reporter, its not taking away a freedom to kill a baby. Its taking away the perverse right to legally kill a child. If a person can be charged with with double homicide like Scott Peterson was, then the killing of a baby in the womb should matter if the woman lives. A great day for children, its their fight, its their right.

Why not report on Margaret Sanger and her desire to kill off the black population through the means of abortion? I'll be waiting reporter lady."
I had one night stand with a woman who had abortions.
"You know, your body, your choice includes body responsibility, and if you are a woman and aren't intimately familiar with your CYCLE, then do you truly love and respect yourself??
The easiest thing to do in this world is to take responsibility for ourselves, and ladies, this includes knowing your cycle and acting accordingly. The chances of getting pregnant are ZERO if you simply use logic, know your cycle, and live accordingly. Include your man also wearing a condom every time, regardless of cycle!

One easy step to body freedom!!!

Question is, do you love yourselves enough to take responsibility, or do you need to continue making bad choices?!?"
Stop calling it women’s rights. It’s not your body it’s not your choice it is textbook murder.
"Babyphobes seething rn 👶👶👶 love and the miracle of life stay winning, hatred will never stop the birth of millions of new lives. Goo goo gaa gaa to the haters"
The moment you realise that the Islamic militant sorts and Right-wing Americans are simply a retexture running on the same Matrix code. 😶
I think you should start with all the doctors that have a boarded so many babies in the past and abort them off this Earth and the politicians that made it legal
Even though rha sun god worshiping band iron maiden has the lyrics in a song that says.... to kill The unborn in the womb 2 minutes to midnight let's take the word abortion out of the sentence and make it kill or murder call it what it is quit sugar coating it
loving vs Virginia isn't deeply rooted in out history either maybe we can repeal that?
"Legalizing abortion decades ago didn't solve any problems, because it caused many people to think lightly of getting rid of an unwanted baby.
However:
Making abortion illegal again (or difficult to obtain) WON'T solve any problems, either: it will only cause even more division, violence and hatred.

It might sound like a 'good law' - but good laws don't necessarily create good people......"
"Disqualify the SCOTUS.  This case is a medical issue, not a supreme court issue.  This case should throw out of the court."

What about the rights of the unborn? Literal baby murdering scum all of you!
ABORTION IS NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT NEITHER IS A WOMENS CHOICE! THE REPORTING IS SO BIASED BUT WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM CHANNEL 4 NEWS! PATHETIC NARRATIVE PEDDLING MEDIA!
Leftist propaganda network newscast.  FTFY
On a technicality
Wait what this is bullshit
Abortion isn't illegal. These people are complete morons. All they've done is allow the states to dictate their own abortion laws.
These people are fucking disgusting. I wish they would have all been aborted!
"""What is a person?"""
"Ah, America... where you want the fetuses to live long enough to be born, but not long enough to see recess."
It ISN'T a liberty to terminate an innocent life.
Can Donald Trump and his Republican Congressmen still access abortions for their mistresses? Asking for Matt Gaetz...
"Channel 4 - this is incredibly sloppy, and irresponsible reporting."
Baby kullers are big mad
"All of these fucking women cheering and applauding this decision should not only pay for the medical care of those women they are stripping of a basic woman's right, but also take and care for any resultant children!!! SHAME ON THEM"
I will continue to help young unwed pregnant women get their start.
Thumbnail have a wildly unfkable 'woman' who would NEVER have to worry about getting pregnant! 🤣
4:41 99 years in jail for an abortion in Texas under current rules!!??? the heck? How do you justify jailing a woman for 99 years if she performed an abortion that could save her life from potential health risk or even death?
"I have tears of Joy here in Ireland listening to your fantastic news,  let's abolish abortion entirely ."
Remember when bodily autonomy was thrown under the bus during the world's CoVid vaccination drives? If you supported that then you helped normalize the notion that bodily autonomy was not worth protecting. Now you reap the results.
"""There is no longer a constitutional right to an abortion"" Huh what... It's never been in the constitution."
"American women can dial back time and rely on metal clothes hangers, and self induced medically unsupervised  home procedures with bent metal clothes hangers."
Standing up for women's rights but can't tell you what a woman is politics gone mad
Biased reporting and fake ness WOW
"Why are channel 4 even reporting on this?
When have you ever seen CNN CNBC MSNBC or any other American news outlet reporting on British policy or politics. Why don’t you earn your ratings and report on British issues like the blatant hypocrisy of the British Labour Party. And can I add there’s a lot of mis characterisation in this awful journalism they’ve not made abortion illegal they’ve handed the reigns over to the state who are elected officials and legislators elected by constituents of the states they live in."
"It amazes me how the Left in America have twisted this whole thingbinto something it isn't.

Firstly abortion isn't a legal right elsewhere in the world despite what pro abortionists say. Not every country has a Constitution eg the UK.

Secondly all tbe Supreme court did was say abortion is a state issue not a Federal one meaning the decision is  made at a local level not a federal level.

The Supreme court did not ban abortion."
Biggest overreaction ever.
"Incest is a big problem in Southern States in America, so bad facial hair is becoming common on females, the focus should be on this not the gun lobby"
Thus will be used by the democrat to stack the supreme court.
LOL....Where were you when males and females were saying my body my choice when the scumbag American government and the corrupted Democratic party were trying to push a vaccine mandate back in 2020 and 2021 over that bullshit global pandemic we went through? People didn't want no part of that jab but those pig headed asshole democrats trying to push a vaccine mandate on people who didn't want the shot. Going out on television making fun of those truck convoys in Canada and in the United States who were desperately fighting against that scumbag president Biden making sure that this asshole wouldn't push a law mandate on everyone to take a jab that NO ONE KNEW ABOUT. Liberals on national tv saying well if they don't want to get the shot or have a vaccine card.....Throw them in jail.  Now crybaby women are going around rioting in American cities and protesting like crybabies because they can't get rid of a life THAT THEY BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD.....IT'S YOUR PROBLEM....IF YOU GET KNOCKED UP.......DEAL WITH IT. IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AND THE DIRT BAG THAT YOU F UCKED TO DEAL WITH YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES. STOP TRYING TO BE A CASEY ANTHONY AND TRYING TO GET RID OF A PROBLEM THAT YOU CREATED. ABORTION IS WRONG. IF YOU CAN'T SEE THAT....THAN DON'T SPEAK ABOUT THE ISSUE MORON.

Goodbye Roe v Wade."

In sickening disgusting USA protests do no good but people are wage slave cowards and theyre afraid to do more.
Such great news. Abortion is the biggest crime against humanity. Muslims support those that are fighting to make it illegal.
So they are just killing human because of money these mindless people think child is a curse
"I just hope with this comes a lot of support for women. Pregnancies are hard as is. 

Whilst I am pro-life, I'm not delusional in thinking there aren't any problems anymore. I care about mother and baby. Obviously in extreme circumstances, abortion may have to be used. But it should not be normalised."
What are all these lgbt's mad about they can't even get pregnant  or have kids?
Babies.Lives.Matter.!!!!
So when a person murders a pregnant woman. They a are  convicted and charged with 2 counts of murder.
Only  in the states..... Save a foetus ..............  then protect the right to kill a child. Unbelievable.

Jesus hates abortion... EXCEPT when he carries them out in Rev 2:23!! 🤘😈⚰️😈
"Jesus is indeed Lucifer the Morning Star, which is why Isaiah 14:12 lists Lucifer as the Morning Star and then Jesus calls himself the Morning Star in Rev 22:16.  The reason Christians fail to see the obvious is because they are brainwashed by their churches into reading the Bible BACKWARDS and reading the New Testament BEFORE the Old Testament.  We read books from FRONT TO BACK for a reason, and that is because you can't possibly understand the end of a book that you don't understand the beginning of.  And it is not even possible to fully understand a book from reading the LAST QUARTER of it.  With that being said...---->  Adam and Eve were NOT first, and the 2 stories of Creation in Genesis are NOT about the same Creation as the Christian church teaches.  GOD makes people on the 6th day of Creation in Genesis 1:26.  Then in Genesis chapter 2 God rests, God sanctifies the 7th day, and then the LORD God of Israel creates Adam and Eve on the 7th day of Creation.  To work on the 7th day that God has blessed and sanctified is BLASPHEMY, which is what makes the LORD God SATAN the LORD of this world.  That also makes clear that Adam and Eve were NOT FIRST, they were made second.  Doesn't the 6th day of Creation come BEFORE the 7th day of Creation?---->  The family lineage that begins with Adam and ends with Jesus is the family lineage made by SATAN the LORD God, not God.  That's why Isaiah 14:12 lists Lucifer as the Morning Star, and then Jesus calls himself the Morning Star in Rev 22:16.  Jesus was Lucifer in the flesh, not God in the flesh.  Jesus is Lucifer the Morning Star!  Go to my channel for more details...

That NEW WORLD Order that Alex Jones and other GOP Christians pretend to fight is really the goal of Christianity otherwise known as the NEW EARTH (Isaiah 65:17, Isaiah 66:22, 2 Peter 3:13, Rev 21:1) to be ruled by the New Jerusalem.  The New Earth is where the nations are destroyed and massed together for a world government that will be on the shoulders of Jesus.  Well, isn't the New World Order a world government as well?  And gee, New Earth even sounds exactly like New World, doesn't it?  That is not a coincidence, the New Earth is indeed the New World Order.  It's all right there in your NEW WORLD Translation Bible if you actually bothered to read it...  <-)

The GOP already used their NRA lobbying dollars to REWRITE THE 2ND AMENDMENT in 2008.  The GOP and the Koch brothers REWROTE THE CONSTITUTION with the Citizens United ruling.  Now the GOP has FIVE MORE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS planned.  That makes SEVEN Constitutional Amendments in 9 YEARS for the GOP.  Anyone who cares for the CONSTITUTION would NEVER vote for the GOP EVER...﻿

The media in the country is corrupt, it is all right wing Fascist MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX run pro-Christian pro-Israel PROPAGANDA, plain and simple.  When has ANY media channel EVER allowed someone like myself to BIBLICALLY challenge the Christian religion?  NEVER, because if someone like me had access to major media channels, very few people would be Christian. CBS was founded by Westinghouse, a major DEFENSE contractor.  NBC was formerly owned by General Electric, another huge DEFENSE contractor.  And this is the LIBERAL media, huh??  Pfftt, hardly.﻿

No... most Americans don't support killing babies
"THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH WORLDWIDE 
IS KILLING UNBORN BABIES 
THAT DID NOT HAVE A CHOICE"
https://youtu.be/Fq3VTOV_iA0
Abortion has never been a constitutional right. What about the right of the unborn?
"Hey all you women that want to kill unborn humans, just have the operation & take out your uterus. This way you won’t be a murderer."
America land of the not Free and not Brave cool.
"My Country Feedback 🇺🇸♥

They seem awfully ""touchy"" about this abortion issue, don't they? Over reacting"", and overacting?
Why all the ""over reacting"" and ""overacting""‽

What's up with that? 

This isn't the first law in our history to be repealed.

Sincerely,

Look out guys there gonna start peacefully protesting
I'm just amazed liberals figured out what a woman is.
"So right to privacy exists now, but vaccination status was mandatory? 🤔"
"Roe vs Wade 1973 was advocated by Margaret Sanger a racist white woman who supported Eugenics the elimination of the Negro population. Now, finally the stain of Roe on America's conscience has been overturned by BLACK Scotus judge Thomas. Clarence. History will look back on this important day as important as abolishing slavery"
Trump really cant stop winning my man
Abortion is wicked
At least men can still have babies 😂
"States can’t regulate guns but women's rights on abortions with no exception to incest or even r@pe 💀?? ok America, call urself a ""free country"" why dont ya"
Abortion isn’t a right ….
"“Because women are pi%%ed!” Funny, I just saw hundreds of women who were crying tears of joy in celebration 🎉"
"2:36 No, sista, we’re not going back to 1970. There are now around 20 forms of contraception to fit every lifestyle; female contraceptives, according to the ACA, must be covered in full, whether the woman has a private plan, a government plan, or is on Medicaid. No excuses! The barbaric days of abortion-as-birth-control must end!"
"Hey foreign journalist,

There is no Constitutional right to abortion, there never has been. That was the entire point of the U.S. Supreme Court decision. Roe was always based in bad law, even Liberal legal scholars concede this. The SC’s job is NOT to legislate policy, but ONLY to interpret the Constitution. Try educating yourself. Also, there is no violation of women’s rights here. This has always been about the essential human right of the right to life, to not be killed in the womb, but be born. An unborn child is not part of a woman’s body, it is a distinct human being with it’s own unique genetic blueprint. No one lost any natural rights with this correct ruling, but countless millions of people over many future generations just gained the right to life."
The ignorance and dodging of the people in this video makes it impossible to take seriously.
Do these Channel 4 British news station have any clue as to how America works?
"I can't believe that the reporter is too stupid to understand what the ruling really did, so her scaremongering is basically just her intentionally lying."
Funny how a woman is speaking on behalf of the pro-life movement and a man is speaking for the pro-choice movement… I thought men don’t get a say?
"Wow, the propaganda language is think with this news station."
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄....D'oh !!!
Hoes mad
Imagine meeting your maker and having to argue that you fought to allow the killing of children.
Same people that are against murdering babies are the same people that will skin an animal and eat it. Except humans are animals too. Peoples hypocrisy really blows my mind.
"Never forget, Trump is responsible for this!"
It's going to cause back-alley abortions
We should not be stripping away a woman's rights
I'm a republican but this right here really does not sit well with me
"You are all sick people if you think killing a beating heart in mid-term late term or wtv is OKAY, and that the baby's body is yours choice. I'm sorry to disappoint, but your body is carrying the life you want to kill. If you wanted to do that, you should have done it in early stages."
Womens rights or child rights?
You know accidents do happen and sometimes people might accidentally take a certain antibiotic that cancels out the birth control or they may have been raped. But they should not be forced to give birth to a child that they're not financially able to take care of or that they never wanted. Number one in overpopulates the country and number two it puts too many kids into the system that don't even have a family. Remember that child will grow up one day and it could possibly be a murderer stop looking at them like their children. We have got to control population
Abortion is not a contraceptive… You have Plan B.. you also have contraceptives to not have a baby… There’s also tubal ligation… You have more things today than you had in the 70s don’t be stupid!
If you want abortion… Just take your female innards out and then you won’t have to worry about having a baby!! Because if you don’t want one then.. you surely are not gonna be a worthy mother now!!
just vote in your state why is that so difficult to understand
Abortion is not a constitutional right... CHANNEL 4. I have a question to you. How much have you been paid to say bs like that?
"I’m crying, laughing not tears."
This channel isn’t even trying to fake impartiality
Woman vs woman…🍿
"What about the grey areas? Women who may die if they go through with the pregnancy, women who were raped and dont want the child. The possibility that a very sick or disabled child will be born if the pregnancy proceeds. These are reasons that put things in a completely different light, it is not a black and white issue. Its really not."
Left should have worked with the right but once you say a women has a right to have a abortion all the way up to birth just turned too many people off.
I'm sorry you have to do a better job of shutting your legs after a drunk night at the bar
Stupid libtards
i'm excited to see the efflux of people with substandard morals exit my state. ✌✌
it's a good thing this happened. I'm glad it happened in my life time and i got to see it. No one has the right to murder another human being.
"Boy, they really want to torture and murder babies."
Woman against woman. It's nothing about woman rights it's about human rights
Channel 4 thinks Not killing babies is taking away freedoms?! Sick
Hopefully we can get Trump back in office 🥰
Now we are finally bringing God back to the states 🤗
im a democrate but i will never vote again democrate. women in the usa are the most organized mafia. more powerful the police mafia. women have made the democrate party the femanazi party. all the laws today are antimale antnatural. men are being destroyed in this country. even fathers day is a joke. these antimale laws must end.
"For all you depressed winey liberals relax. You will still be able to kill your babies since you live in blue states . In fact please do since we don’t need future liberal woke people .
On the other hand red states will increase voters because we are not having abortions 
A baby heartbeat starts after 15 weeks . This is a fact for all you baby killers"
gay marriage is next!
They should survey Orphans if they would rather be killed or have their lives. Imagine fighting to kill your kid
"Trumps choices don't want you to be able to kill a baby.
Bidens choice doesn't even know what a women is, and thinks we're to hard on paedophiles and Trumps the bad guy???"
How a woman could get two abortions herself and then take that very right away from other women is disgusting.
"Such balanced, unbiased reporting 🤔"
♥️♥️♥️
We live in a society where the the Supreme Court believe anyone and everyone  that purchase  a gun will make the right decision  but a woman don't have enough  sense to make the right decision when it comes to a pregnancy.
My :God!! The thought that a baby about to be delivered can no longer be subject to having a pair of forceps thrust into its skull and its brain sucked out is unconscionable!!!  We demand partial abortion!!!!!  Too bad the protesters' mothers didnt about them.
You body your choice.? well abort your body stop killing babies . God's abomination the shed of innocent blood.. remember religion don't save only Jesus Christ saves
And let's not talk about the dad's that want to keep the baby. If they don't wanna have a chance of getting pregnant then don't lay in the bed it's that simple stop getting in bed with every man that u see............ duh.........
"As a news channel, please report the news, not express your own opinion !"
Better pick a better man to lay the bed with unstead of fuckin low life men 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"i cant believe they went through with it... you republicans are sick, go shoot yourselves"
I guess this means they actually have to be responsible now.
"The “Pro-Life” movement is Pro-Death, and more people need to recognize this important fact.

The same justices and politicians who weep crocodile tears for embryos are the ones who sentence thousands of the elderly and children to die.  How “pro-life” are they really when they refuse to protect people from COVID and guns?  The blood of thousands stain their hands, disproving their rhetoric about caring for life.

We need to vocally label conservatives as the pro-death party, and directly call out people like Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas as the heartless, treacherous wretches they truly are.  Don’t let these hypocrites claim the higher ground on the cause of saving lives; challenge them and ask how many people died from their other actions."
They way to fix this.. is make a law no one is allowed to have kids unless a licence.  If welfare you are not allowed..only if you have money.  Lets see if they like this law instead. I a have a funny feeling they would scream no more welfare entitlements.
I see nothing but cry babies crying over not being able to kill babies
"Hilarious how only conservatives comment and watch I am conservative, I love god and ya and I think that killing children is horrible"
No such thing as constitutional right to kill your own child
Yeah NUGGA
The complete evisceration of Roe v. Wade by the reactionary justices on the Supreme-(ly Political) Court of the United States clearly validates the sad reality that the United States is no longer 'the land of the free & the home of the brave.'
People are crying over not being able to kill babies
There are 1000’s of forms of birth control abortion is so archaic and barbaric
Until one of these women's children get pregnant after being rapped then they won't be so happy!!! Women's rights being taken away certain people NEED to be voted out of office  I'm going to fight until I die.
"There never was a 'Constitutional Right' to an abortion. It's not in the Constitution, and the Judiciary cannot make law. The decision ha been returned to the states where it should be. Democrats are just enraged they cannot murder and dismember babies freely anywhere."
"All you have to do id's go to vegas if you want abortion, the ruling is a joke it's like putting a fence on the Mexican border they still can cross by the millions."
"Hahaha great news, all these emotional crybaby liberals balling their eyes out!! Cry babies Hahaha!!"
“everyone who is for abortion has already been born”.
Seriously these people need to all be deported to the rock from which they crawled out from under. There are literally no bigger losers on the planet
Good 👍 the Supreme Court don't want yall womens babies blood on their hands u keep that on your own #judgementdayiscoming
There is simply nothing more satisfying than seeing the liberal left angry and upset… i just love it !
"Time to keep the legs closed and peckers holstered.  No glove, no love."
"93+% of abortion customers do it for no reason, without any victimhood"
"""Women's Rights"" . You mean human child sacrifice?"
"What about the man's rights ?
 Takes a man and a woman to make a child"
"If a company sends an employee to get an abortion in another state .please maKe it public .
."
"(*small minority group of women are upset.). all I've seen was women who were happy about the decision

Trump 2024"
"Nothing was taken away, that future person that might save lives because of the life he or she chooses to live is now protected. Just imagine a woman sleeping around with no protection and going to get an abortion for somebody who might have saved her life."
"Terrified that they have to be responsible. Amazing.
Now they can force the ja6.
No longer your 6ody, or your (hoice.
They have you right where they want you.
Take a few steps back.
This was not truly what you think. It's a means to an end. (of your freedom)
I would expect another pla9ue soon."
Hoes mad
woman shouldn't have a voice
What good is bodily autonomy if you can't stop your body from getting pregnant in the first place
If they band birth control they should also band vasectomy for men
I hope that all those woman celebrating this decision adopt at least five kids from those abusive orphanage
"Abortion is not a constitutional right, why would you say that? The first and second amendment are rights protected by the Constitution, which is why they fail every time they try to take them, abortion is not a right. The majority of this country was okay with abortion when it was safe, legal and rare. The minute they started celebrating abortion, pushing abortion up until the moment of birth, wearing it as a badge of honor and demanding taxpayers foot the bill, they lost. You did this to yourselves"
long live president trump.
its the supreme pleasure to watch this snowflakes. meltdown. oh thanks GOD.
"YEAH, I wish everyone who is pro-
abortion had parents that ABORTED THEM. Then we won’t have to hear from all these democrat pro-abortion cum dumpster sluts!! 🤣🤣🇺🇸"
"Women protest and want everything banned now, but won't protest against their favorite Hollywood celebrities who are p*dos,  r*pe kids AND women."
Wow. This reporting is completely neutral. Said no one ever.
the fact that channel 4 excluded the fact that a majority of Americans oppose 2nd and 3rd trimester abortions (and democrats advocate up to birth) shows everything you need to know about media
"Roe v Wade overturned. Every supporter of killing unborn babies loses their mind and acts like a hysterical toddler. 

If we hadn’t taught them that crying and acting irrational will get you whatever you want — a lesson most children learn by the time they’re five — they might be dealing with this like adults."
"No matter how you cut it , abortion is an abomination!"
Yes pro life
"Women do have a right to choose, but that choice should begin in the bedroom not in the clinic. Maybe now men and women will be a bit more cautious about who they sleep around with."
"As someone who is both 'pro life’ and 'pro choice’ I am totally disgusted by the ‘pro life’ campaigners still out on the streets celebrating their ‘success’. If they were truly motivated by their ‘faith’ rather than their right-wing political views, they would - if they were true ‘Christians’ -  be spending time in quiet contemplation giving ‘thanks’ for their perceived ‘victory’ Conversely, ‘pro choice’ campaigners have a legitimate right to demonstrate after this retrogressive SCOTUS Decision!"
"“My body, my choice” funny how the left was singing a different tune on vaccination mandates."
Babies are dancing with joy in heaven.
"DAMN, that thumbnail!😳 Are those eyebrows or caterpillars? My god!"
"Gotta keep those babies so the repubes can have them shot in schools, and complain about them being freeloaders. What a joke that country is."
"what I don't understand is why women are fighting Roe v Wade, no one is forcing them to have abortions---"
Guys don't worry you can still get a abortion you'll just go to jail if you do it. It's still your choice though. Don't you think this goes past your right to choose?
"Channel 4 are so dishonest I feel I have to right this - Just so people know - the supreme court did not ban abortion. Abortion has not now become illegal in the states. All that has happened is the Supreme court decided it is not a constitutional right (obviously it's not) and that state governments are best placed to determine their own laws when it comes to abortion. My ""liberal"" friends, don't worry LA, NY, DC, and all the other blue states will still continue to kills baby right up to the point of birth. I know this will disappoint you but Republican States will most likely put a time limit on abortive to the end of the first trimester. You know .... Like here in the UK. That's what really happened."
I love how these crazies say that men are the ones pushing for this...but the pro-life women in this video were the most excited. 😂
"The crazy thing is that the right to bear arms is in the constitution and the right to murder unborn babies is not, let that sink in"
It was NEVER been a Constitutional right. Read the Constitution for pity sake
"You don't need me to tell you that an unborn child is too small, too poor, too weak, too innocent for a Liberal  to acknowledge it's existence as you already know all this.  Considering God created the Heavens, the Universe, everything and  owns everything, can you just imagine how small, how weak,  how poor, how wimpy, how pathetic  a Liberal must appear to God?I assure you God loves the weakest, poorest, youngest, oldest people on earth every bit as much as he loves you and I."
It's all about choice? Why not choose to close your legs or choose birth control before you get pregnant? Why not choose to be responsible?  Dogs breed indiscriminately.  Are you no more than a dog?
"It all boils down to, liberals want to kill babies out of convience of a woman.  The only reason this was even an issue,  is because the left comapigned for abortions on demand, up to birth. If you want to blame anyone , blame the, shout your abortion crowd. The Lina Dunims of the world saying they wish they could have had the opportunity to have an abortion. The fact is, the decision is now at the state level. If you want to kill babies, move to democrat sanctuaries. If you want to skip that nuisance,  where a condom. At the state level their can be discussions about when abortions are permissible. Likely they will deem it ok in the case of health of mother, incest and rape. If you think they wont, you are being disenguous.  Just imagine the campaign slogans of people competing in a primary. Do you really think that someone will win, or hold their seat if their opponent paints them as someone that will now fight for an abortion for a mother if she will die if the baby is borb. Wake up people."
Horseshit. Forced birth is evil.
While showing women celebrating that it is gone.
"God, their breaking down in tears because they no long have the right to end a life???"
To all those fking liberals this is what happen when you play stupid and forget what women is .
"They are so dumb they report it’s a “Constitutional right”. No. Remember it was 5 unelected justices who gave you federal abortion law 50 years ago...if you don't like the fact that 6 unelected justices returned the law to the states remember that we put up with it for 50 years. Now it's back where it belongs. The Dems say they love democracy so much but they argue against this very democratic process. Now, the people in each state will decide."
This is dark day for USA 🇺🇸 poor America 🇺🇸 sending love ❤️ from Uk 🇬🇧😞😞😞😞
"it's should be equal right for both parents when it comes to abortion & child support, because the baby has half of each parent's DNA. If this is not the case, then man/woman should have no say in these matters when a pregnancy is involve. 
Ty🙏"
Next they will be protesting that they can't murder school children. No difference liberals murder is murder.
God's gonna nuke this place
Jesus coming soon it's too much seen in this world !
So women are now upset they lost their right or choice ....men have no say either way and should have right to financial abortion...only fair right. Now you know how men feel....how's it feel ladies...suxs doesn't it
"This isn’t about the fetus at all, it’s about taking woman’s rights…"
"Hey women out their who want to murder babies, get some contraception or keep your panties on. Murder should never have been an option."
Trumps last gift to America
"LIFE, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness ❤"
Utterly lying liberal media peddling lies again!
So what this means is women aren't going to be able to engage in promiscuous relationships? Women are going to have to be more selective with the men they choose? GOOD!
The Curdled Cream of Society!
"Pro Abortionists are worse than slave owners.

At least the slaves got to live..."
Good decision. Give a chance to unborn baby’s they have a choice as well
Two words: the pill.  It works and has for decades.
This is amazing
If the woman has the right to choose and wants a abortion the man should have the right to choose to get full custody and the woman pay child support!
A woman has never been allowed to do whatever they want with their bodies. You can swing your arm around all you want. The second it strikes and kills another you have crossed the line.
Pro life men are fucking sick mother fuckers but what is worse is another woman who thinks it is okay to force other women to have fucking babies.  The post roe idiots make me fucking sick.  it is not okay to force your religious beliefs onto others.
Are these women crying because they can no longer murder their unborn children?
"The fact there are women crying over this only leads me to believe they had goals of killing a fetus in their future, and now they can't and they hate it."
Wonder how many of these anti abortionists are in favour of the death penalty for children and against school lunches.
"Not to sound petty!!! Why do the people who are for life seem normal, then you go over to the pro abortion side and you see green hair, blue hair, red hair, goofy clothes, just goofy looking people in general.... they look like Barnum and Bailey circus, a big giant busted bag of skittles. ABORTION is MURDER!!!! Im happy about all this"
"America be like : 
political religion in the Middle East is a scandal! Look what they do to women! they are uncivilized barbarians! We can't let that happen!
Also America : 
Let fundamentalist evangelists rule the United States and take away women's rights.
French people : 
..."
Same people that wanna put your child in a mask at school for seven hours a day can’t put a condom on for three minutes think about that .
It's not constitutional. It never was. This was a proper decision.
You have no right to an abortion. And no there is no majority that supports abortion. Those polls are taken in strict liberal states.
Forced birth is what we're talking about & it's going to kill many thousands of women and destroy far more lives than it will supposedly save. Let's call it what it is. Forced birth. It will be a disaster for our country. We already have one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world. This is the opposite of pro life. It's pro death. Forced birth is wrong on every level. Many states have zero exceptions for rape or incest. This is a literal death sentence for thousands of women.
"They overturn Roe v Wade because states rights.  Then they over turn a New York gun law, overturning a state right.  Now they have suspended your Miranda rights.  What rights are they going to take next?"
"For those men who are 'pro life', an alternative solution is to give all males vasectomies say at age 14. Sperm samples could be frozen. How do you feel about that?"
"How would you anti-abortionists  sleep at night if YOU had to put in the forceps and pull the innocent baby out limb by limb, crush it's skull with the forceps and pull out the skull and brain piece by piece."
Yeah 99 years for abortion!!!! Right desicion!!!
And i hope trump will desmantly evry news channels for ever!!! and create new news!!
And evry men whit these liberalist cunts are SIMPS AND LOSERS
They should let the babies decide if they want to be aborted or not..
And these liberalist people shoud be put to camps for re-education for normality
I would like to ask this man how many times has he paid for a woman's health care and how many times has he babysitted a child for free.
Nice job supreme court!!!!. Evry woemen who make abortion shoud be jailed for 50years for killing child
What are the rights of men? What are the reproductive rights of men and fathers?
They are crying because they can’t kill babies. Channel 4 News is simply fake news. No attempt at objectivity.
Most whites woman voted for trump. Thanks for fucking over the rest of us!!
"Libtards:  😭😭😭

Me:  😁🍿🥤"
Unborn lives matter
leftist women are a cancer on the planet
"wah wah wah, i cant kill a baby"
"2nd class citizen? Try being a woman in China, Latin America, or Yemen. Those hard-working, tough-as-nails women would put these pathetic spoiled excuses of a woman to shame. None of those pro-choicers would survive outside a 1st world country. Despite whatever laws get passed, it is a haven compared to those countries. Privilege is invisible to those who have it. It's time to actually be responsible for your choices."
I laugh at all you women who want to kill babies.... I feel sorry for the innocent unborn not women who want to kill their children..
this is so biased.  Yeah for America and the rights of the unborn... woo hooo
The United States is a federal system. This means if an issue is not covered in the U.S. Constitution then it defers back to the individual sates. That's all this ruling corrected... that abortion is not a centralized  government decision. Duh.
Hoes mad y'all
"It's funny how Pro-Abortion People, ALL have PRO-LIFE MOTHERS, for if it wasn't for their PRO-LIFE MOTHERS, THEY WOULDN'T EXIST."
Finally this 'witnesses of abortion' sect is cancelled. Thank Ktulhu
"The world is celebrating this, may Spain, Argentina, etc, follow your lead, for once Im happy about news coming from USA."
Great..delighted to see some meltdowns from the cohort that no man would impregnate in the first place.

"It's amazing how these same groups of people, who previously denied what a woman is, now suddenly can define/admit what a woman is."
"There never was any constitutional right to abortion, there is no Amendment to the Constitution that states you have the right to murder your child."
Cry about it! WAA WAA BOO HOO I CANT SCRAMBLE BABY BRAINS ANY MORE😩😩😩😩
"First of all, it was never a constitutional right because it was never in the constitution.  And it did not outlaw abortion.  It only turned it over to the states.  In these states that they are protesting in, will not outlaw killing babies."
How is abortion a right ? It’s NOT
Cope
😂😂😂 So many other issues that need to be addressed like gas and everything else that has doubled!! Whatever happened to let people make their own decision!
No more rights for women 🤭🤭😂
"Protests no longer work. ACTION NOW. Every women need to stop and this country down. They have the power. If women stopped working across this nation for just a week.  watch how quickly things would change. The Constitution was written by the Founding Father' s not the Apostles. Christianity is a religion, not a political party. How dare men dictate what women can do with their bodies. Guess we need to cut off their Viagra."
"The Supreme Court is not meant to protect civil liberties, it’s meant to determine whether something is CONSTITUTIONAL. If abortion is to be required via the constitution, it requires a constitutional amendment. The decision is correct regardless of your opinion on abortion."
KILLING IS NOT A RIGHT IT'S A CRIME
"I love when Americans talk about the constitution like its what they MUST follow, last time I checked it did probation, you know your 18th amendment. I don't see many people screaming about getting that back any time soon? if you want to get rid of basic human rights then lets put back in those restricted ones. I already made up a slogan for it.

Make Alcohol Illegal Again. Its simply just perfect, its the bestest best slogan that ever had sloganed.

Can't wait for the day."
Quick get a picture of a Jew crying for the thumbnail!
I only clicked on this video to see Liberal tears.
Demonrats are gonna openly run on packing the Supreme Court now. They are gonna use this to try and get the votes they want in the Supreme Court.
"WOOHOO! America is turning back to Jesus!
God has truly answered our prayers! 

#prolife"
What about protecting unborn child's rights? Why does an innocent child have to die?
It’s about time!
I don’t have to go to prison if I get convicted because I decide where my body goes #mybodymychoice
"Does anybody still watch the amateur media (CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, MSNBC...) ?"
"I'm eagerly anticipating the day when SCOTUS will address the constitutionality of the leftist college administrators imposition of ""speech codes"" that are flagrantly unconstitutional!"
No one ever seems to mention its your own damn fault you got pregnant in the first place. Your poor choice shouldn't allow you to kill someone
It's not just your body when you have a child in it.  Not hard to understand.

There is an estimated 20 Million LGBT population in the United States.

There are an estimated 332, 900 (58%) women in the United States.

There are an estimated 40 million women in the United States that support abortion rights.

Listen up!   This does not include the families that love and support these Americans.

...That is a POWERFUL amount of VOTERS that Republicans want to nullify their rights.

--- WE have a powerful VOTING voice.  A lot of voting power, and we can vote to remove.... ABORT Republicans from all types of elected offices.   
Where do we begin?   Start at the local level and move up... all the way up to the Republican Congress.

Republican Senators and Republican SCOTUS have made it clear that they will restrict women's rights, now have sights on LGBT rights... And that has begun with striking down Roe VS Wade. 

... Republicans from all levels of government across America have picked a fight to beat women and LGBT in submission.

... Republicans from all levels of government across each state in America want to rule our bodies and take away our rights to choose.

I say to you all, we will fight! 
...  WE must ABORT with our votes every REPUBLICAN in every position in public office.   It is not enough to walk and march across America.   Now is the time to do grassroots campaign.   ... Let's elect people into office that will protect WOMEN, LGTB rights and fight for us at the highest levels of government.   

VOTE to ABORT all Republicans that now hold office!    The Senate is a good start!.

WE have the power, WE will become a force to be reckoned with and will not get pushed around anymore by these self-serving Republicans. 
... VOTE Republicans out!

Yup, it’s an OXYMORON… SAD that FEMALES empowered MALES to be FEMALES and now BIOLOGICALLY BORN FEMALES have less POWER than NON-BIOLOGISTS FEMALES and now they COMPLAIN that FEMALES in AMERICA 🇺🇸 are crying  and screaming “OPPRESSION”."
PRO-LIFE DOES NOT FORCE YOU TO HAVE BABIES.
EACH STATE HAS ITS OWN LAWS ON ABORTION. WOMEN’s RIGHTS is still alive. THESE LIBERALS AND DEMOCRATS just want “ALL OR NOTHING”.
Ah the return of back street abortions that killed both mothers and babies....good job
"I like how in the beginning of this video the broadcaster claimed “there is no longer a constitutional right to abortion” there was NEVER a constitutional right to abortion. It isn’t mentioned in the constitution, it never was. Stop lying about the constitution."
“There will be no functioning society because of women” this “birthing people” going to reduce herself to useless while real women go about their lives living responsibly and contributing to society rather than fight for murder on their hypothetical unborn child. Get a grip
keep crying
"Wahhhhhh, I wanna kill babies, wahhhhh!"
Strange to watch people cry because they put restrictions on killing babies.
Where we're all these protesters when the government locked down the entire country????🤔🤔
"Oppose the Withdrawal of Women’s Abortion Rights in the USA through an Order of the Supreme Court.
All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) strongly condemns the recent order of the Supreme Court of the USA which reverses the right of abortion available to American women for the last five decades through the judgment in the Roe versus Wade case. This judgment which had allowed women to opt for an abortion in the first trimester, and under certain circumstances even in the second trimester of pregnancy has now been overturned by a majority decision of the Supreme Court allowing the states to impose their own restrictions depriving women of their right in the matter.

It is feared that strong anti-abortionist lobbies will prevail in many of the American states and push through harsh laws making all abortions beyond 15 weeks illegal and punishable and imposing severe restrictions even on that. The moot point in the matter is that the power to decide in the matter is being transferred from the woman concerned to the state authorities.

AIDWA sees this as a dangerous turn towards anti-woman anti-poor right-wing reaction within American society which will particularly hurt women from the more vulnerable sections in the US and young adults among them who are anyway denied health and reproductive rights and rights to safe contraception; now they will be deprived of the right to safe abortion as well and may be pushed into taking recourse to illegal clinics jeopardizing their health and even their lives.

AIDWA expresses solidarity with activists within American society opposing this reactionary judgment and asserting the right of women over their bodies."
"Jose Vela does not seem to grasp that under the Constitution, it is perfectly acceptable for one state to declare certain acts to be criminal, while other states do not. It is the STATES, primarily, that pass criminal laws, and these laws presumedly reflect the will of the people in that State. That's precisely what the Constitution provides. In order for a crime to be federal, there usually has to be some nexus with interstate commerce. So the primary authority for defining what is a crime and what isn't is the State legislature. That Vela doesn't know this is amazing."
"How about allowing the father of the child to actually have a say when it comes to the future of that unborn baby? I find it hilarious and shocking and disingenuous that women scream all day long about how it's their decision and their decision alone. Hello? Until you are able to conceive a child without the help of a man (and I will point out a man born as a man not a transgender man) then a man has a say in what happens to the future of that unborn baby. Now granted a lot of men may not care and will decline having any input. But at the very least a woman should talk with the father of that unborn baby and get his input. Allow him to express his decision and she needs to take his thoughts and feelings into account while making that decision. I would say that he should even have legal grounds to give input on the future of that unborn child. So tired of this bullshit. So tired of women screaming about how it's their decision and their bodies. Girl, you didn't get pregnant without that man. He DOES have a say in what happens to that child. At the very least if you make a decision to allow that baby to be born and if a man DOESN'T want it to be born and wanted an abortion? Then he should not be liable to pay child support for 18 years. It's only fair. It's all about you ladies? Then stop being disingenuous and keep it ALL about you! The father of the child doesn't get to be part of the decision? Then the father of the child should be absolved of child support. You can't have it both ways..."
"BS… it is not three justices.  Given the opportunity, the left would install three appointees with their ideology.  The issue was that Roe v Wade was unconstitutional and scholars on both sides of the isle have acknowledged this fact."
You are the father!
Lol! All these crazy libs weeping! Love it! Of course they never shed a tear for the killing of unborn babies. Oh well! You have plenty of options to have that baby murdered so no worries. Just go to the state next door...
''my body my choice'' except when its about the covid vac then u either take it or lose your job
Why some women crying and some cheering…
finally accountablity for baby killers
Congress shall make NO LAW respecting an establishment of religion
"""Fifty years of women's rights in America overturned in an instant.""  What shamelessly biased reporting. The court decided that  the legal reasoning of the Roe vs Wade case was based on weak and spurious arguments. As a result, it is up to the US states to legislate on abortion because it is not a subject mentioned in the US Constitution."
These people are fuc&ing lunatics. Their mad they cant kill babies.
"What baffles me is they talk abt women's right to kill babies bcz they couldn't keep there little cats to themselves  or be reckless .
Talk abt freedom to murder many young innocents lol."
The Supreme Court has effectively divided the nation further pushing people Balkanizing the American landscape.  America is on its way out of a unified nation.
And now foetuses have more rights than actual humans. Society has just got 100 times dumber.
Liberal demonstrations across the United States protesting the overturning of Roe V Wade are quite hilarious and entertaining to watch.
It's like people don't realize condoms exist.
Killing babies is not the solution to any problem
But women don't like or need men. So they won't be getting pregnant anyway
Provides more targets for school shooters
Right to LIFE!
Now let’s see how many lives are lost by women going underground to find an abortion clinic
Abortion was never in the constitution you lieing bastards

"Aww, poor woman crying in the thumb nail, “oh no now I can’t kill babies, I can’t be a real woman any more!”"
"Here lies the problem.

One side believes abortion is about killing babes. The other believes its about women rights.

Both have a point. 

I agree 1000% on my body my choice. If any woman wants to get a boob job or butt implants; I support that (it's your body your choice).

However, you can do anything with your body as long as it doesn't kill a born or unborn member of society. 

I believe this is a fair compromise."
Hoes mad. Hoes mad. Hoes mad. Hoes mad. Hoes mad. Hoes mad. 😎
I've got news for these idiots who are anti-choice... abortion will NEVER end... all it means is more women will die in back alley abortions.  I hope that once these anti-choice women (and their husbands or boyfriends) get raped or are a victim of incest enjoy watching their rapist's baby being born.
"Liberal meltdown, lol"
Lol imagine being devastated that the right to kill children was taken away haha
is it so hard to use contraception. everyone wants to go bareback.
abortion is murder
"he Bible says ""Love Thy Neighbor,"" but Trump's far-right homegrown terrorist new motto is ""Hate They Neighbor."" There will no longer be any peace and love as long as those fanatic hooligans' control our once loved America before Donald Trump. Our nation is so divided that it will never be a leader of the free world. Fight back against those hooligans destroying America. Jan. 6, 2011 gives video proof to that Donald Trump wanted a coup that nearly happen. If it hadn't of been for people up holding their oath of office (True Americans), Donald Trump's evil plan would have worked. A dictator would have taken over America as he wanted. He won't give up with the continued lies as he learned from criminal Roger Stone as he pardoned like so many others. He wants that power back as the Republican Party wants. Donald Trump's Supreme Court is just the beginning. Do we want a Russian America or America as it was before Donald Trump? Jan. 6, 2011 was worse then Pearl Harbor or 9/11 because it came from within. Don't let the so-called religious creeps tell you differently. They are NOT OF GOD. Those people follow the devil like Donald Trump. He never represented all of the people because he never lived up to the oath of office he swore upon to represent ALL OF THE PEOPLE.  He lied as he does today to keep his power. It was all about him. No one else. He knew people were stupid enough to believe him because of criminal Roger Stone. Only criminals get pardoned. Listen to the facts, not a dictator."
I wonder how many of these woman really read what the rights are?
"It's that time of year again when democRATS start looting, vandalizing and burning down their communities. HAHAHAHAHA"
“Polls show most Americans support abortion” were those polls done by the same clown who said Joe Biden will win by a landslide.
I think states should pass a law that if you are prolife you now have to adopt a child and take responsibility of telling others what they can do with their bodies. I'm so sick of people telling others what to do and talking zero responsibility in that action.
Watching these deranged satanic mobs having a meltdown makes me so happy!!
If abortion is legal then men should have the right not to pay child support..MY WALLET MY CHOICE
Killing unborn babies is a right?
"PRO ABORTION ALWAYS WILL BE.  I HATE KAMALA HARRIS, BUT I GUESS I'M STUCK VOTING FOR HER.  WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A JILL STEIN??  WHERE IS CAMILLE PAGLIA?

Good News ✅👍👏
If I'm forced to have a kid I'm going to make that child's life miserable I'm going to take pills to make a die!!!!!!
Nobody is talking about the rights of trans women to have safe abortions.
These violent abortionist monsters are the vilest form of hypocrite. In one breath they claim to be humanitarian humanists. In another they fight to cruely and violently kill off the human race.
Abortion is murder.
Satan lives in these protest.
"Why don’t the radical women just get hysterectomies?  They don’t have any problem with men getting vasectomies or with even giving “gender reassignment surgery” (if there even is such a thing) to children.   Apparently, there are people who are incapable of understanding that constitutional rights apply to all, born and unborn."
"You are biased trash! Nowhere in the constitution does it say that ""Americans are entitled to hoover out fetuses for convenience"". FFS-- anyone that pounds their chest in support of this practice are repugnant!"
Whaa....I have to drive a bit to murder my child.. what a dark day.....the protesters do make a good argument for retroactive abortion
"maths time: 
under 1000 women die in childbirth each year 
this is consistent a with only a slight change if abortion allowed or disallowed.
 since abortion allowed about 1 million babies aborted each year in America 
if america allows abortion for 100 years they will kill  the same as 1/3rd of their population  
abortion is not a contraceptive option ladies thats what this is really about"
IF YOU DOMT LIKE IT MOVE TO A MURDER AND EVIL STATE !
A woman still have their rights . They have a right to keep their clothes on
A massive shortage of baby formula in the US and the Supreme Court says “MAKE MORE BABIES!”… America is INSANE! So many starving babies on the horizon.
Thank God for Donald J Trump
Abortion is not a constitutional right.. it is mentioned 0 times in the constitution.
"Abortion isn’t an constitutional right, end of story. Marxists, go home."
Nothing worse than seeing young teens of this new sensitive generation Protest against abortion pathing the way for a Dark future for themselves
Democrats are free to move back to abortion states. Please do. Thank you
"There is no such thing as ""Constitutional Right to Abortion"".  Get your facts right.  And the Supreme Court did not totally ban abortion.  They only reverted back to the States Legislatures, as representatives of the people, to legislate reasonable and justified abortion (which is actually terminating a life of an unborn child, that also have a right to life as bestowed to all human beings by our Creator).  These people should understand and respect the states that don't support wanton abortion."
No where in the constitution does it say we have the right to kill children
channel  4 news is just another left wing outlet. don't expect any objective journalism on this channel.  but as a man i believe i also have a right to have a say in this debate seeing as men  can get pregnant too according to the left.
This overruling is absolutely outrageous! Shame on Supreme Court!
A truly historical day for helpless children brilliant great news.
We’re putting the life of women against future leaders. This is sick.. women want tooo much of everything.
Baby murderer’s have a big ego don’t they! They wanna fight for their right to murder babies. What a sickening thought which they want to make it a right! Disgracefully satanic
"Taking away a women's right to choose..
Oh great!  So you can define woman now?"
What’s sad about all this. Is there will likely be another rittenhouse case by the time all this is over. Does no one ever look back at history and learn?
It wasn’t turned over in an instant. U can still get an abortion!

"This was recently posted and is something for the
Supreme Court to consider:
Can a 13-year old girl adopt a baby if she wants to?
No. Obviously not, are you nuts?
What about a 15-year old girl? Can she adopt a baby if
she feels like it?
Absolutely not!
How about an 18-year old girl? Surely SHE could adopt a
baby, right?
Still, no. No way.
What if she's 20? No longer a teenager. A 20-year old
can definitely adopt a baby if she feels like it, right?
Actually, no.
Hm. Weird. Why not? There are 400,000+ children in
foster care, why can't she adopt at least one of them?
She just can't. You have to qualify to adopt a child.
Rigorous background checks, home visits, proof of
financial and mental stability, etc. it's a whole thing.
Cool.
But if she, at 14, gets impregnated by an abusive ex-
boyfriend (who shoved her out of his moving car and left
her for dead), she must carry to term, give birth and just,
figure it out somehow?
Yes. That is correct.
But, she's only 14 ...
SHE WILL FIGURE IT OUT. She should have been more
careful. Made better choices.
So, to ""punish"" her for her poor choices, we force her
into motherhood, which we've established she's totally
unqualified for? And now, we are suddenly comfortable
with a young, traumatized girl, caring for a vulnerable
little screaming human being that is wholly reliant on her
for survival?
Yes. Absolutely. Such an unexpected blessing"
Being a woman is the hardest thing to be in today’s society

"So Americans can have guns as a constitutional right, but they don’t have the right to deciding what happens to their bodies??"
How can people be ok with killing babies
Proof that the US is a country full of who.res who can't keep their legs shut
There was never a constitutional right to abortion
"They be like,
""I AM SO PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW! I CAN'T GET PREGNANT JUST TO KILL THE BABY ANYMORE!! HOW ELSE WILL I FEEL POWERFUL? KILLING KITTENS AND PUPPIES BECAUSE THEY GET MORE ATTENTION THAN ME IS SO 2ND THRU 12TH GRADE!! AAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHH!! I NEED MY NARCISSISTIC SUPPLY!!!"""
"This supposed pro life crowd is not pro life, they're pro forced birth and control of women. This isn't your life, it's not your choice and quite frankly you all don't care what happens to mother and baby afterwards. The poorest women in society from deprived backgrounds will be most effected by this disgusting ruling. Quite frankly why would any young girl want to be born into a world where she has no say? The lack of shame from the anti abortion crowd is disgusting."
"Good job America....
This is bright day of America....
America become vergin from this law..."
"Americans are so far behind the rest of the world its so sad. In debt, misinformed, and living like its 150 years ago. America as I know it won't be around for much longer I think. Someone will overturn these people and take that land back and I wish I could have been there to see that"
It’s just about control and oppression of women
Surely if Americans cared about life they would have a proper health system like every other developed country in the world and stop people running around with automatic weapons! The richest third world country on Earth.
Stop being a bunch of hoes then
I like how the interviewer was scoffing and talking over the pro-life advocate but she wasn’t saying anything to the pro-choice advocate.
If she comes to Britain she will get her abortion on the N. H. S. free. R. A.
Point to where the Constitution of the United States says that we can murder unborn children to excuse sexual depravity.
"Outside of Rape, Sexual Abuse and the life of the mother being under threat, I don't believe abortion should be legal. Keep your legs closed."
Womens bodies are their own not their country's
US is not more free country unfortunately
"This is scary

""home of the free"" what a fucking joke."
In many countries they abort only female embryos.Maybe that is why there are born 107 boys to 100 girls.
"Wow, I was told the BBC is garbage now, but actually worse. This news channel is leftist scum."
"On this morning ten years from now, there will be thousands of American children making there way to school who only exist because President Trump decided to protect them."
She is on video admitting she lied and nothing happened but an agenda❤️
Cope and seethe!
"No women from RED states should be allowed into Blue States to get an abortion. NO registered Republicon women should be allowed to get an abortion in any Blue States. NO evangelical christian women (of which there are many) should be allowed into Blue States for an abortion. We all know conservative women have the bulk of abortions but until they come out of the closet, stand up for themselves and vote appropriately they need to take their pregnancies to term. Those born should then be required to be placed into conservative and Republicon households to raise. If the mothers are unmarried then any one of the Supreme Court Justices who voted for this ban should be listed as the father on the birth certificates. They should then be sued for child support."
"You dont have a right when you have a baby in the womb,its not your body your choice anymore when you have a baby growing inside you,abortion rips out the baby in pieces and it suffers ,it is murder...shut your legs that's your choice ....."
Baby killers are despicable. How can you reason with such serial killers?
Happiest day of my life .
The best news in fourty years.  These millenial  feminists are nuts . Murdering babies .
It’s so sad and unthinkable that this would happen in 2022. So many delusional zealots out there. If god existed he wouldn’t want a world where people idolise him to their own suffering and the planet is essentially his baby factory in absence of people caring  for moral standing of the people who already live here.
Unborn babys lives matter
Why are media so focused on pro-life supporters? These people are a mass minority. And why are they so focused on the hypothetical situation where other rights are repealed. Women will suffer and die as a result of these ruling. Babies will suffer and die as a result of this ruling. THAT SHOULD BE THE STORY.
"Welcome to the British media where they are eternally Committed to Bias, Partiality, Prejudice and a complete lack of objectivity."
A bunch of lunatics crying for the camera!
"I guess these abortion guys don't know the meaning of ""not"" in ""thou shalt not kill."""
Lol! Cry me a handful! Bunch of losers!
So... murdering a baby is a womans right??? Evil people.. evil
"COPY AND PASTED, please share.

I'm not pro-murdering babies.

I'm pro-Becky who found out at her 20 week anatomy scan that the infant she had been so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organs.

I'm pro-Susan who was sexually assaulted on her way home from work, only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later.

I'm pro-Theresa who hemorrhaged due to a placental abruption, causing her parents, spouse, and children to have to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or her unborn child.

I'm pro-little Cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11 year old body isn't mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal.

I'm pro-Melissa who's working two jobs just to make ends meet and has to choose between bringing another child into poverty or feeding the children she already has because her spouse walked out on her.

I'm pro-Brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially, emotionally, or physically able to raise a child.

I'm pro-Emily who went through IVF, ending up with SIX viable implanted eggs requiring selective reduction in order to ensure the safety of her and a SAFE amount of fetuses.

I'm pro-Christina who doesn't want to be a mother, but birth control methods sometimes fail.

I'm pro-Jessica who is FINALLY getting the strength to get away from her physically abusive spouse only to find out that she is carrying the monster's child.

I'm pro-Vanessa who went into her confirmation appointment after YEARS of trying to conceive only to hear silence where there should be a heartbeat.

I'm pro-Lindsay who lost her virginity in her sophomore year with a broken condom and now has to choose whether to be a teenage mom or just a teenager.

I'm pro-Courtney who just found out she's already 13 weeks along, but the egg never made it out of her fallopian tube so either she terminates the pregnancy or risks dying from internal bleeding.

You can argue and say that I'm pro-choice all you want, but the truth is:
I'm pro-life.
Their lives.
Women's lives.

You don't get to pick and choose which scenarios should be accepted.

Women's rights are meant to protect ALL women, regardless of their situation!

I am actually 8 months pregnant and looking for alternatives...
These women are hysterical.
Under a democratic president. Hilarious. if Trump can do it why can't he reverse everything? because he is a senile old corporate fool.
"Why don't they grow up, learn to say no

"They didn't make the procedure illegal for ""birthing people"" look up any Democratic tv appearances for reference. AOC can't even say pregnant woman 😂. It left it up to states. Which means the court left it up to the voters. It has 81 million plus votes guaranteed based on last election. ."
they love screaming my body my choice but when you ask they'll all in favour of the government forcing a jab on you
They didn't exactly pick the brightest of the bunch to defend the overturning of Roe.
"Trump does not feel a thing for women who have abortions, look this up.  He has been quoted quite a large amount of times for saying Women who have abortions should serve prison time......he does not know a blank thing about abortions, he is the biggest fool in the world, TRUMP NEEDS TO SERVE PRISON TIME....NOW!"
"This does NOT violate women's rights. Abortion violates babies lives, by KILLING their life. Do women have a right to kill babies? NO That's like saying a gunman has the right to shoot up a school!!  QUIT playing game using misleading words!  Perhaps all you baby killers secretly applaud school shootings.  Abortions and school shootings results in the same atrocity."
"Sustainable communities? Are you kidding me? The right want to be pro-life for a clump of cells but not pro-baby or child to ensure children don't go hungry. Not pro-family, because they shoot down family leave. No access to affordable housing. All you are doing is making more kuds born in poverty and a rise in child abuse and neglect when parents are stressed and can't afford to care for them. Not only that, but parents who never wanted them to begin with. That breeds abuse as well.

This pro-life woman is a fucking joke"
babies have rights now!

I invite you to see the videos, see how the suffer, how the move, how they are cut in pieces, their arms, and legs, how they cut their heads, see it, comitting murder is not a ""Constitutional Right"", so sad the people protesting were not aborted right? Why not getting a surgery to never have children? or take out their wombs, that way they will be making a favor to the world actually... besides you have to see the amount of the people that actually supports murdering babys o how they call it abortion,  just think about it. As a woman they don´t represent me at all, a bunch of irresponsable people, use protection, get a surgery, don´t be murders and try to make it look good, your body your decision, take out your wombs then! do it now!"

You mean killing rights
"Constitutional right  (M) was protected for the past 50 years.  Most thought was settled law.  Then the unthinkable has happened.

Stopping the Killing of  babies is not going in opposite direction of freedom
How dare this woman narrator saying killing a baby is a right!
Abortion ban? What about the human rights? USA is the self appointed contractor of world human rights …doing injustice with their own people regarding the abortion ban.  See their hypocrisy.
Rightousness exalted a nation but Sin is a reproach to any people. God is with America. abortion is Murder. murder is murder. dose not the unborn have rights.
abortion is not a constitutional right 🙄
"look, if you don’t follow the bible to a T don’t correct people and be like “it doesn’t say that in the bible” bc imma just hit you with that “do you carry you cross daily?” “do you actually read what you’re saying are gods words or does it just sound nice coming out of your mouth?” at the end of the day if you don’t want the baby just give it to a foster home bc of your scenario so he/she can live a shitty life and probably repeat the cycle, or even better raise it when you’re not able to because of the abusive relationship you’re in, or the fact you got raped and you’re only 15 now you have to raise a kid that’ll be 18 before you’re 35, all because of “prolifer’s” think that their opinion should overrule a constitutional right"
"Wow what a lying headline, and people actually believe this If it's not in the Constitution,whatever it defaults to the tenth amendment,if you have a pocket version of the constitution and can read,the tenth amendment gives the power to the Individual States The right to an abortion  has NOT be overturned What a bunch of simpletons,who haven't read the US Constitution"
so sad they mad because they can't murder their baby. what does God think of this. these woman our beside themselves. what about the babies life dose not the baby deserve to live? people get darker and more selfish everyday.
Why? Why not focus on THE MASS SHOOTINGS going ACROSS America!!
What’s that poll you cited where you state the majority of people want abortions in the US? Because that’s simply not true.
So many ugly angry females...... i approve!
The same women who cry about Roe v Wade being overturned are the same ones who condone trans men competing against biological women in sports.
The right to a baby's life trumps your right to kill whatever you want. Cope and seethe :)
June 24th is Constitution Day. Needs to become a new National holiday.
Legalize Prostitution .its her body. . lets not forget Heroin . its her body ... and any other self destructive behavior
Idc what law y’all mfakas bring if I get a girl pregnant and she doesn’t want it we are flying out of country and ☠️that baby
"""I vote Democrat because I am pro-choice...except on education, energy, unions, healthcare, the foods you eat,  the car you drive, light bulbs, the home you live in, etc."
I thought female was just a social construct 😝🤡
well well.....for those women that like to play loose loose aint gone be no more just going to the abortion clinic. Better start taking accountability for that area and start making your flings wrap it up lol.
Keep your knickers on or use CONTRACEPTION. Very biased report.
It’s not in the Constitution of the USA Abortion.
For all the toddlers watching this video the justices on the Supreme Court are supposed to act by the constitution not by there political views. So most likely if the scotus is not BS than there was something wrong with row v wade when it was introduced in 1973.
their very PURPOSE is NOT to protect Civil Liberties. The SCOTUS is there to PROTECT the Constitution  against ALL
Thank you to all the supreme Justices and President Trump..
Greatest SCOTUS decision ever!
"Life is a human right, the right to murder is not a right."
"If the protesters were aborted, we wouldn't have protests now would we?"
"Hey correct your report!!!!

*Abortion is not in the Constitution*"
The Civil Rights for women have not been done away with woman still has the right to vote a woman still has the right to medical attention
"Lol!!!  My body, my choice!  Lol!!!  Ain't nobody trying to dump a load in any of those nasty bitches"
feminists lost. yeah womens right to murder
MEN SHOULD THEN BE STERILISED. RAPE VICTIMS. SUICIDES WILL RISE. A SAD STUPID PEOPLE
Usa they are back to the dark ages. Laughing stock. What happens to victims of rape... morons
"""Will the Jewish people love a 45 year old, catholic, polish women as their Jewish Messiah"" That's how I already revealed myself back in October. My name is MAGDALENA this time. If that's not enough proof that JESUS was a Messiah then there is another one. Everything God showed me and told me happened outside. GOD IS NOT INSIDE THE CHURCHES AND HE IS NOT AGAINST THE ABORTION. TIME FOR CHANGE IN AMERICA IS NOW😥🙏🕊🕊🕊"
Abortion isn’t a constitutional right. Stop misinforming people
being so evil that you are angry that you can no longer murder innocent babies on the tax payer's dime
They just want to kill you all anyway... now they can do it without remorse
"Now democracy can work through this people.
Not through unelected judges."
Well time to schedule a hysterectomy
hahaha who knew that in 2022 millions of americans plus few judges at the Supreme Court can be so primitive and backwards. Damn the aliens looking down on us must be stupefied at the ferocity with which some humans are fighting against evolution and progress 🤣🤣🤣 And all this because of the weakest link in human dna…..the need to invent gods to worship and give them excuses for their bad decisions in life 🤦🏼‍♂️
"Here's an idea to all those all upset over this decision ( ever heard of birth control, contraceptives , swallowing  having your tubes tied ? ) Biden and the democrats are making very inflammatory remarks which are putting people's safety in jeopardy and should be held accountable for their  violent rhetoric"
Some of these idiots really don't care ( meaning those who support abortion) they just see it as a reason to show their stupidity and their asses !  Bunch of brain dead mentally deficient sheep
Sick purple hair women love killing innocent babies.
"""They've gone against the will of the people""
Justices are supposed to interpret law, not create it. It doesn't matter if they go against the will of the people. If Roe is bad precedent, justices aren't supposed to go along with it anyway just because most people support the outcome."
"Abortion is like murder, it takes a soul for pleasure"
LAME reporting - so biased.
Having to drive one state over to get an abortion must be really hard
REAL women are happy!!!
"The best way to end this fiasco would be for all the women made to give birth to these unwanted little cabbages would be to leave them on the steps of The Supreme Court. ""You forced us to have them, now you fucking raise them""."
The thumbnail is priceless😂😂😂
"Not including exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother in jeopardy isnt pro life. It's just anti woman. Targetting contraception gives the game away. Contraception prevent abortions.
So this was never just about abortion. Oh gay rights next hmm? Who has less abortions than gay people? Nobody.

This was never about life.
This was never about abortion.

It's a theoretical power grab. 
Plain and simple."
"""We'll get to Berlin"" calm down there J.I. Joe ha"
Nope the majority was very pleased!!
Uh…the whole point is it isn’t a constitutional right.  It’s a state right.  Dumb!

Bye Bye Roe and take the Satanic Pride month with you!!  Lol!! Hallelujah!!!
Good Trump

thank you trump  💜
"Trump and his fellows are the christian talibans.
Welcome to the Stone Age. Always everywhere the talibans (muslim, christian or jewish, all the same) trying to tell others how to live their lives. Those who don't abort it, don't do it anyway. Than don't do it. But what do you care about the decisions of other mothers and fathers? 😡"
Rapists are coming.
If any woman here wants legal abortion I can punch your belly for a small fee.

"This is about Human Rights. The Critical Point lies where the Law considers a right arises on account of one being human - according to the Law. In short, it is the Law that decides when you or anybody else is deemed to be a human being. Pro - Abortionsists have just lost at a Federal Level. 
I`m sure that there must be much more to it, but essentially Pro Life relies upon ethics whilst Pro - abortion relies upon the Law. Suppose the Law were changed tomorrow and demands that a person only achieves the status of a human being on reaching the age of 1 year and 1 day ? 
This is the Law which Pro - Abortionsist rely upon !"
Thank God. !!! Let's get our country back !!!! Trump 2024!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
They want to ban abortion more than guns
The majority of the American people are pro choice. How is it possible that the least majority ruling passed? That’s not democracy. They will slowly but surely take away your basic human rights.
"Incredible.  Who would have thought the same people who want to kill babies just because, would become violent.  Take away the democrats slaves; they start a civil war. You make killing innocent babies a little more difficult; they riot."
This british hag isnt bias at all 😏
There's gonna be alot of dead women on the back streets of America well done how dare anyone tell any woman what to do with there bodies I'm irish repeal the 8th and we will repeal it again I can not believe america has actually done this
“My body my choice” it’s not just your body anymore once your pregnant.
You never had the “right” to abortion
They wanna stop women aborting kids but won’t protect them at school.... makes sense 🤷🏻‍♀️
"This is really the world we all live in :/. This whole situation, desensitizing the idea of killing a baby. Whether your pro choice or life its messed up."
"Abortion is the only law in the world I`m aware of that may condemn the totally innocent to death. Abortionist appologists will cite rape,incest, disease... as excuses to abort a baby. OK : I`ll give you every rape, disease, incest and will ask only one thing in return : That you give me every child that would otherwise be born perfectly healthy except for abortion and without being subject to those inhibitions I`ve mentioned.
A deal would prevent 96% of abortions. Deal ?"
"Excelent! Finally America does something right!
Hopefully this insidious method of infant killing will become a crime in all 51 states."
This is what you get for making us deal with Biden … ha ha
"""And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. 
And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.
The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. 
Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire."" (REVELATION 20:12-15 NKJV)


Today, while you are still alive and able, may you repent from your sins, believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that JESUS CHRIST is your Lord and Savior, so that through Him, your name will be written in the Book of Life. 


""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him 
should not perish but have everlasting life. 
For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved."" (JOHN 3:16-17 NKJV)

only fair they take away gun rights
"I`ve had my fill of Pro - Abortionists telling me with glee that it is their right to take life away from the womb designed to nourish it. Your turns with your laws. 
Say on..."
Stupid humans they need to  go to war bums
This is a religious agenda. Forcing beliefs on someone else will always be wrong. God has giving us all the power of choice.  Our actions will be judged at the end. Next it’ll probably be contraception because it’s wrong according to someone’s religious agenda.
Boo hoo. Selfish entitled snowflakes are melting.
I kill a pregnant woman it's considered double homicide please tell me how you can kill a child it's not your choice to murder a child and if it is then we live in a very dangerous world
the woman that advicted for this actually had her kid and said she regretted even getting this whole movement started
Why are liberals crying? I honestly don't get it. You can still get an abortion in a blue state. More importantly you can use birth control and not get pregnant.
Looks like the souths gonna breed more idiots with this trollish law. They gonna have to foot a massive rise in welfare payments too. Uneducated is the way republicans like em.
Now u need to think before having coitus
And all the ignorant weep….
The POWER AND LOVE OF GOD WILL ALWAYS ALWAYS TRIUMPH AGAINST evil🙏FOR THE REAL INNOCENT💕
Hoes mad
The pro murders are all upset. If its your body your choice then don't get pregnant! There are only a couple of reasons for abortion and it has nothing to do with birth control!!! Murders go to prison for murders but women killing there babies are ok??? You people are sick!!!
What about men's rights and a babies rights
Stop screwing strangers raw and letting them bust inside you.
"Not all women are for abortion. Not all women think abortion advances women's rights. I am not pissed, she does not speak for me."
Idrc about abortion but this is funny asf
"This is so biased, terrible reporting from channel 4, britain has succumb to the woke mob i guess. Im very shocked at America though. They did a lovely thing yesterday, I just hope it stays this way. As for channel 4, im never taking this institution serious again."
The Supreme Court is illegitimate
"Theyre all so eager to go to place where you can ""unintentionally"" get pregnant and then just leave all accountability on the operating table. Why not just be a responsible human being in the first place and you won't have to worry"
why are lesbians so concerned about abortion?
Women are crying cz they can’t enjoy raw doggie anymore 😁
"All I can say is you made your bed,now lay in it!! STOP ASKING FOR HAND OUTS!!!"
so simple ladies.. KEEP YOUR LEGS CLOSED ACT LIKE LADIES and do something productive with your lives all this crying and complaining about being able to KILL YOUR OWN CHILD IN THE WOMB speaks volumes about your character or lack thereof.
"There was never a Constitutional right to abortion. That's what this entire case is about. It has nothing to do with religion, or reducing the amount of abortions. The original decision was not the legally correct one. Abortion regulation belongs in the States, not the federal government. State elections will now have a lot more relevance, and people will need to do better research on the the people they elect, who are directly responsible for making laws. America will be fine. Vote wisely for the people making the laws in your State."
How anyone could consider this ‘unbiased’ reporting is beyond me.
This is when the fan begins
"First they came for the black community
And I did not speak out
Because I was not black
Then they came for gay people
And I did not speak out
Because I was not gay
Then they came for trans people
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a trans
Then they came for the women
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a women
Then they came for me
And there was no one left
To speak out for me"
"👨‍👩‍👦Unfortunately, this mass butchering of babies will likely continue in the democrats demonic blue states. In California and New York out of defiance, it might even increase. Overall, though, the infanticide numbers will almost certainly decrease. And those numbers are almost too horrific to comprehend.
Since Roe became the law of the land in 1973, 63 million innocent babies have been slaughtered. Sixty-three million lives were snuffed out, almost all for convenience purposes. Every life saved by the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision is an innocent and precious life👫"
Now I understand why God chose Trump as president. Hallelujah!
God bless all pro-lifers!!!
"Making abortion illegal is the sort of thing the Taliban would do. America, land of individual free choice - Hahaha."
THIS WILL BE REVERSED
"They should realize every unborn child has the right to live, the same way the people marching against the ruling has a right to ""live"" meaning no one aborted them, if they were aborted they wouldn't be there to march period & they should look in the mirror & realize that. It's selfish when you have many women that can't have children & adoption exist, it's alright to save the whales & all other wildlife but not a human being, that's the most illiterate unethical thing to do on earth, humanity should be ashamed of itself especially if you're in support of abortion. Humans, not even satisfied with the gift of life."
All the pro-abortion have the right to protest as they are alive to do so.
So Season 5 of The Handmaid's Tale has finally landed in June... 😒 I live in Romania where for like 50 years abortions were banned due to Ceaușescu regime. Search for it. So many women died due to unsafe abortions and many unwanted kids were born. That fat lady speaking is disgusting 🤮 What a time to be alive. Dogs have more rights than women in USA.
First it has nothing to do with the constitution.  Now someone can’t get drunk screw someone in a bar drunk and throw the baby in the trash can.
"Channel 4 lefties deliberately misinterpreting facts so they can shtt stirr up as much hate, fear and confusion as possible.  Just another working day at the left.  Misrepresent, act the victim, and bin the facts."
Gigabased supreme court. I am ecstatic over this decision.
"It didn’t abolish abortion it made it state by state so know you need to use your votes in your state to keep it a state law

And abortion is not a constitutional right idk where they got that from 🤦🏼‍♂️"
Apparently not even overseas universities can teach reading or critical thinking. So sad
ReeeeReeee 🤣🤣🤣😭
We outlawed murder and it's still happens. We need to legalize murder so it can be done safely. Sounds logical 😂
This is definitely gonna increase lesbianism in women
No more Hoeing around 😂😂😂 GOD BLESS THE USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸

"The Silent Scream

⚠️ Warning: This Documentary Is Not Recommended For Sensitive People!

The documentary, 'The Silent Scream' released in 1984 contributed to the abortion debate in the 1980s.

Dr. Bernard Nathanson's classic video shocked the world. He explains the procedure of a suction abortion, followed by an actual first-trimester abortion as seen through ultrasound. The viewer can see the child's pathetic attempts to escape the suction curette as her heart rate doubles, and the fetus (girl) opened its mouth in what Nathanson calls a ""Silent Scream"" as her body is torn apart.

The clip begins with an ultrasound of the fetus (girl) who is about to be aborted. The girl is moving in the womb; displays a heartbeat of 140 per minute; and is at times sucking her thumb. As the abortionist's suction tip begins to invade the womb, the child rears and moves violently in an attempt to avoid the instrument. Her mouth is visibly open in a ""Silent Scream."" the child's heart rate speeds up dramatically (to 200 beats per minute) as she senses aggression. She moves violently away in a pathetic attempt to escape the instrument. The abortionist's suction tip begins to rip the baby's limbs from its body, ultimately leaving only her head in the uterus (too large to be pulled from the uterus in one piece). The abortionist attempts to crush her head with his forceps, allowing it to be removed. To ""dehumanize"" the procedure, the abortionist and anesthesiologist refer to the baby's head as ""number 1."" the abortionist crushes ""number 1"" with the forceps and removes it from the uterus.

"I’m dying over the idea that this is the time to enact progressive legislation to assist pregnant women. The trigger laws have been lingering for some time and the agenda even longer. There’s been more than enough time to create the type of environment that encouraged women to avoid abortion. If you think some backwater state like Mo is killing themselves to put out paid maternity leave, increased min wage, low cost college, low cost daycare, early childhood education or even healthcare for these women then I have a really nice bridge to show you. If your pro-birth I expect you to start emptying your wallet in support. I’m f fetus’ mean that much to you than show Jesus how much you love him by doing your duty as Christian’s. Otherwise you’re just another disgusting hypocrite who imposed their will on someone else without their consent."
Love these lefty meltdowns
Now go arrest all those involved in the murder of children in the womb...disgusting low life's...and the women who aborted their child
Women women poor victims
"The most vengeful member is Clarence Thomas. Uncle Thomas still remembers women like Anita Hill's complaint and Representative Bennie Thompson, 2014 who called him an Uncle Tom. The January 6th committee coming after his wife. Now, everyone is going to pay."
Thank God these snow flakes don't make laws.
Your body your choice. Well does that mean rapists and murders have a choice too?
Even murders have their own choice does it make it right?
Hahahahaha snow flakes.
Murdering babies for money IS unjust. If you no't want a baby then don't get pregnant.
Whaaaa.....I can't  murder my baby without spending gas to drive
Amazing. You may actually have to take some responsibility for actions. That is like criptonite to liberals
"Liberal tears 
😆🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😆"
My body my choice doesn’t matter once u put another human in harms way for your own selfish gains.
"On a positive note, we now have a clear definition of what defines a woman. If you can have a fetus inside you, and you can choose to terminate that fetus then you are a woman. Because as of the yesterday we were all unclear what a woman was especially for the Democratic’s."
In 1970s the US was able to go to the moon.
"pro life should be the way right
if abortion is ok then it should be ok for people that want to  die with the help of doctors."
"I give you one guess which states are more touched by teenage pregnancy. Those states will now see an increase in teenage mom, school drop out and poverty. 
Blue states will be fine, they will maintain abortion safe, legal and accessible. 
Republicans acting against the interest of their own states, imagine that."
"Dumb poor people v. Rich smart people (2022, colourised)"
All those guns and the only ones that get shot are children. A nation of sycophantic cowards to let those judges keep walking...
The same people chanting my body my choice were just recently demanding everyone be stabbed with a vaccine whether they wanted it or not.
It’s not ok to kill a baby.

"More fake narratives being created and controlled by the puppet masters . 
The more divide they create the better things are. 
It’s a endless sitcom and the government is the lead actors."
Stop killing babies u cream gobblers
There wouldn't be a functioning society without women 😂. Mam society wouldn't survive without kids.
"All ya gotta do is keep your legs closed, or use protection. What’s the issue here? We are all adults, and sensible right? Guess not !!"
"It is the right decision because it is not the role of judges to create and amend laws in a Democracy BUT the role of the Nations Democratically elected representatives in the Nations Parliament to create the Laws and Regulations the electorate voted for and remove the Laws and Regulations the electorate voted to repeal or amend.

In the USA it is not the duty of Judges to create Constitutional Rights BUT the elected representatives of the USA.

With the original Roe versus Wade Judgement the Supreme Court loaded with Left Wing activist judges usurped US Democracy laid out within the US Constitution - I recall the critical words of the 6 to 3 vote Judgement of the current Supreme Court to the effect that the Courts Judgement correctly returned the decision to the Nations Elected Representatives to legislate what was right for each State in the absence of National Legislation AND for the US Congress and Senate to Legislate a Nationwide Law - Something the Democrats holding the House, the Senate and the presidency can do AND should have done decades ago BUT didn't do because they like the fact that activist Left Wing Supreme Court Judges holding a majority on the Supreme Court can undermine US Democracy whereas the Right in the US believe in Judges that interpret and uphold the Law as it is defined US Congress and Senate and the congress and senates of the individual states.       The issue has been to the existing elected representatives of each state and the US Congress and Senate to decide AND for the electorate to use their votes to elect representatives that will implement the abortion laws the electorate want locally and nationally. 

In the UK it was the Nations elected representatives on a free vote in the Westminster parliament in 1967 on a Private Members Bill introduced by David Steele MP that created legalised consensual abortion in the UK - The time limit set for an abortion in 1967 was 28 weeks based on the age of a viable foetus because it was deemed unacceptable to terminate a viable foetus as killing a live aborted foetus outside the womb was murder.       Since the UK Abortion Law was passed in parliament medical advances mean the age of a viable foetus has decreased considerably and sooner or later the existing Law will be modified to reduce the time limit for an abortion to match the current age of a viable foetus.     In 1990 the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill (1990) reduced the Time Limit to 24 weeks in line with the then viability age for a human foetus combined with removing some restrictions on late abortions where there was a risk to life for the pregnant woman and severe fetal abnormality was identified.          In the 2008 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill (2008) debated reducing the the Time Limit for abortions from 24 weeks to 22 weeks or 20 weeks based upon medical advances reducing the age of a viable foetus BUT voted to retain the 24 week time limit.

The UK experience is that the National Parliament is the right place to openly and publically debate and decide on controversial issues like Abortion like it did in 1967 with the 1967 Abortion Act and openly and publically debate and decide on changes as it did with the 1990 and 2008 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Acts."
I'm divided on this issue and I respect both views and the rights of individuals to back one way or the other. If you are for abortion I'd ask you to contemplate 3 things. Then if you are still pro abortion fine. 1. Research and understand the medical process that occurs and the way in which a babies life is ended. 2. Accept the possibility that you could have been aborted had you been 'inconvenient' - how do you feel about that? 3. Accept that 50% of women who do abort their child are deeply troubled by what they did for the rest of their days. This issue is far more complex than it appears and politicising it is a very sad thing.
"Cope and seethe, baby killers. You don’t have a right to kill children.  Tell Moloch to get his tribute in another form."
Biased much.. channel 4?
Post Roe generation=Red State baby boom.  Profit
Luckily Bigfoot in the thumbnail won't have to worry about any men trying to mate.
Dark Times ahead
"Illegal to have an abortion, but perfectly fine to gun kids down in school. 

Republicans ladies and gentlemen, the party of reduced government interference implementing more government interference."
"Chanel 4 Opening with a Stupid Statement. Just so you know, The Supreme Court is NOT there to protect civil rights. It's there to RULE ON WHAT IS CONSTITUTIONAL OR NOT! The legislative branch, voted in by the people, are the ones to protect civil rights. Get it right.

1973 Justices and of Casey, pulled this nonexistent ""right"" out of their empty black top hats. If you want it there, then persuade your fellow citizens to amend the Constitution."
Lol.. People are just idiots.💯🤣

Welcome  to the human race.
Everything and Everyone regardless of race, color, creed, ethnicity, national origin, gender, age, spirituality, orientation is under strict scrutiny now.

Everyone just has to tough it our without whining. Forgive my candor and frankness.
This is a tough transition period for the whole nation, including our nations capitol.
Many of those who have led privileged lives are slipping from grace.

Because of all of the tragedies, one tragedy followed by another and another, the darkness is exposed. Long is the way and hard that leaders up to light."" John Milton, ""Paradise"".

"These days being a progressive involves murdering your unborn baby, chopping your genitals off and taking children to story time read by a pervert in a dress."
What about childrens right to live. Murder is not legal.
Yes murdering children is illegal.
It was never a constitutional right
Maybe I missed something. But can’t you use protection to not get pregnant? So what are these women crying about?
No more hot girl summers
"I’ve noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.

Ronald Reagan."
The rights of all Americans are slowly being taken away. WAKE UP PEOPLE BEFORE IT IS TO LATE
doing good deeds or trying to change certain things doesn't get you into heaven. Let others that choose abortion deal with God themselves that is not anyone's decision to make.. He who is without sin cast the first stone. God gave us free will to make the decisions we choose to. cause in the end we will face him on judgement day. If you are judging women on their decision to abortion be prepared to be judged as well by GOD. as you judge other you will face the same judgment in Heaven when your time comes..
Finally fetal lives matter! Glory be to Jesus
This channel is a rag ...
Women in the womb now have rights.  American woman here and I am relieved.
"It was never mentioned in the US Constitution, hence, it’s up to the states to decide."
Who gives a sh it about this British channel!!!! Stay off our land!!! This doesn’t concern you!!! 1776!!! Let us remind you!!! 😈😈😈
Imagine crying because a baby will live 🤓 #hotgirlsummerCANCELED

"Wow, so much for journalistic impartiality. No wonder why this video has so many dislikes."
How tf are we going back in progress
The SCOTUS Propaganda should babysit for poor people then
"I hope America isn't planning on ""leading the free world"" with this ruling. Nobody is following you down that road."
"She lies not a constitutional right, we are a step closer to stop abortion COMPLETELY! STOP THE LIES NOT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT!!! JUST MURDER!"
this Happened because Trump was a Serial Liar and Lying Supreme Court judges Lying under Oath should be in Prison.
Cry me a fucking River comparing it to Normandy how dare you make such a comparison you jackass
Hey all you religious nut bags if you don’t want abortions then don’t f*cking have one. Keep your crazy religious beliefs to yourself. You don’t give a f*ck about these unwanted children after they’re born but you’re obsessed about them before it. It’s sad to see America go down the toilet but down it goes anyway.✌️
As a german it's just scary to hear Americans still make WWII mentions on the weirdest occasions. Hopefully this guy knows that Europe is a lot more progressive than his third world country with a gucci belt. Your country is delusional.
"It's about time America stopped willfull Murder of the Innocent!!!
Thank you Prez Trump"
"Now the Supreme Court should ban Assault Rife, cause it take a child’s life too"
God Bless the USA🇺🇸
"Good bye woke culture , and good riddance."
this is just like that movie the handjobs tail
God is punished you for killing baby’s 😒
shouldn't it be a woman's choice over her own body ?
"Completely wrong take on SCOTUS taking away rights from women, they actually are giving rights back to the people to decide on how to handle abortion going forward and in doing so giving rights to the unborn who have a right to life just as anyone alive today."
"Nowhere in the American constitution does it say anything about abortion, so they aren’t losing any rights! You take away our guns you ain’t getting abortion"
"The Conservatives love all life, until it starts school. Then their only advice is duck and cover."
"Let the freaks breed 😂 
No more murder for the irresponsible!"
Great step in the right direction for America!
Forcing a women to give birth to an unwanted child will have devastating effects on this country!
Use protection and you won’t need abortion . Plain and simple !!!!
What a beautiful day

"Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: ""The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others.

But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted"".

YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them, or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents, up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me, and keep my commandments.

If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.

AND WHEN YOU PRAY DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
BUT WHEN YOU PRAY, GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need, before you ask him.

This, then, is how you should pray:

Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from the evil one.

For if you forgive other people when they sin against you,
your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their sins,
your Father will not forgive your sins.

""Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway"", we can use google search.
These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples;
then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

Yet a time is coming and has now come
when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
GOD IS SPIRIT, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.

In the New Heaven and the New Earth,
only Righteousness dwells.
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all."
LIBERAL COMMIES got WORTHLESS BIDEN AND REPUBLICANS GOT RIGHT TO LIFE!
"Get on the pill,  men use  a CONDOM!"
This British reporter should verse herself on the American Constitution.
"This was never a “constitutional right”
They’re just stirring up the crowd"
Nice to see c4 being neutral. Killing a baby is a womans right apparently.
"C4 is doing most of the festering. It was never a constitutional right.  Simply a correction. Late term abortions are evil, I hope they restrict them. The question is when is a baby a fetus? At what point are you saying that you can no longer kill it? At present its legal up to full term in some states which is abhorrent."
"""Ohhhh noooo, you mean i have to be careful about not getting pregnant now???  THIS IS OUTRAGEOUSSSSSS!!!"""
Great day for the US and the world
Want to get your rights back? Vote Democrat in November.
Chanel  4 obviously  have no  clue  about american constitution.
Beautifully bias reporting.
Hard to believe that killing kids was wrong...crazy right!
"Womens "" rights to abortion """
"WOW!!!! BIGGEST KLAN RALLY EVER!!!! So many  KKK LADIES there.
Over HALF of abortions are BLACK
since 1973 over 19,000,000 DEAD BLACK BABIES and these people want to KEEP THOSE BLACKS FROM EVEN BEING BORN!!!"
Women's right to do what exactly? ... Kill their baby. I swear USA is morally bankrupt
How can you defend killing a baby because you don't want to be a responsible adult.  Pure murder
This will only affect poor women and girls who have the misfortune to live in the ''wrong'' states.
Oo boo you can't kill your baby any more ....
There was never a right to abortion !! Give it up already !!
Looks like whole nations’s population on steroids …
This is sad I wonder if many Americans will move away now
I believe we are witnessing the beginning of the break up of the union.
"Hoes mad. Abortion was never a constitutional right, nowhere in the constitution does it say someone has the right to end a child's life."
Let’s remember the case brought before the court was a state that had a 15 week ban 15 weeks is more than enough time to deal with a pregnancy but that wasn’t good enough it was the liberals who brought this to the Supreme Court
If a woman is raped should they not be allowed to have an abortion ?
"You say this ""Takes away rights""......no it has given them to unborn babies.

Great day for the unborn.....bad day for those that seek to murder them."
It's the same people advocating for disempowering women who are also pro-guns. Interesting isn't it?
Cringe watching liberals.
"It's not a right! Keep your legs crossed and you'll have nothing to protest.
SEE HOW SIMPLE? It's called responsibility but of course you don't want to hear that. 
It makes too much sense."
NEWS FLASH Roe vs Wade has been obsolete since the 80's  .... Do your own research Casey  vs Planned Parenthood.  BTW - RBG thought Row vs Wade was a bad law and said so many times.  Stop believing what you are told and learn how to think for yourself.
The nose looks kinda sus
They say abortion is murdering a human but then they are happy for everyone to have a gun!! Backwards country. Horrific. Abortions are a right for every woman and it's disgusting to take that away from them.
"Two sides of the story, women's rights VS the Unborn baby's rights to life. Remember, only the women can express themselves here, the unborn babies who may well have a bright future cannot."
"For every pro-lifer hand them a child unwanted that wasn't terminated by abortion. They won't take the unwanted child and yet they will tell others they must. Just what we need, more unwanted kids roaming the streets. If we think the Jihadists in the Middle East were a threat to the world these right to lifers are worse. Pro-lifers have bombed and killed people in their quest to control others. Trump strikes again with the support of majority in the Supreme Court which has fallen from grace."
time to learn to swallow ladies
"It's great news to hear 👂 that ROE V WADE is being over turned.
It's about time you stop the killing  of the innocent. 
I here a lot of women and girls say it's my body my choice yes that sounds just about right from a sinner who doesn't know the real truth about what they are doing. 
It was the Almighty God that gave you the opportunity to be born and to inter his world 🌎 but you can't see beyond your self-centered wicked heart ♥ 💔 to show mercy to the unborned.
Woman has always wanted to choose what is not right for the family 😕 it started in the garden of eden the great rebellion yes I know you don't believe it but it is true even if you die not believing any of it.It still will go on with are with out you. 

There are many women and girls who have chosen to do the right thing and show mercy to unborn.But there are still many spiritual blinded daughters of the Almighty God who have chosen rebellion your rewards will come faster than the wind and in that day you will call for mercy 🥺 but because you have not chosen wisely there will not be any for you in your time of troubles.
ROE V WADE is a tool used by the devil to kill as many unborn as possible to stop the plans of the Almighty God but it have never worked. 
He the devil tried to stop the Almighty God in the days of old Egypt 🇪🇬 😪 when the  Pharaoh's of Egypt was killing the first born of the children of Israel to stop the Almighty God's plans but it did not work. 
So if you are one of those who wants 🤔 abortion you're working for the devil.Even if you do not believe 🤔 this devil exist he the devil is working in you every time you decide to kill the unborned child.your murderer by the Almighty God standards"
"Y'all so pro-life but don't think about
the lives of the mothers. Or orphans.
Or foster children. Or the poor. Or the

raise, and won't think about once
they're born. Save it."
Ban Abortion Ban it ban it stop killing babies.
"I can't understand why women want to kill their tiny, helpless babies. Stop humping everything in sight and your problem might go away."
Um. All they said was this was a legislative issue. Not a judicial one
Same people screaming my body my choice had a different opinion when it came to the vaccines.. Feckin hypocrites.. Just use contraception.. Abortion is not birth control! It's that simple!
I had a coke bottle stuck in my rear and my father found a man who removed it in a dusty storefront take that sc.
"You notice these protesters (women mainly) are speaking in terms of themselves, and not defending the aborted lives. It's not about the aborted lives...it's about their decision making and no longer having the ability to clean up their reckless actions that led to legalized murder."
women rights what about babies rights
I have Boxes of coat hangers 18%off today.
"I mean, not killing people sounds pretty constitutional to me. Sound pretty unconstitutional to be able to choose to kill people."
"This is all Donald Trumps and that turtle Mitch McDonnell fault. Packing the court with these underwhelming and underqualified justices just to take away rights. Prolife and proguns & assault weapons, lack of universal health care for poor people all at the same time.  This law is going to significantly increase the amount of poor abuses children in foster care system for sure."
How did I guess left wing channel 4 would be against this ruling .... they are literally killing a baby. Its not right.
"@0:28 No, the purpose of the SCOTUS is not to protect civil liberties. That is a lie. The purpose of the SCOTUS is to determine what laws are and are not constitutional."
"Our country's people is too damn focused on other peoples lives instead of their own. live your own life worry about your own life. stop trying to run someone else's does my decisions affect your household NO. cause u don't know me.. you don't pay my bills, you don't raise my kids, I don't ask you for a handout or help. SO EVERYONE NEEDS TO MIND THEIR BUSINESS. STAY OUT OF A WOMANS DECISION!! Goverment trying to tell parents that if their child is trans it's abuse on what they decide for their child but when it comes to schools and education parents have the right to decide.. with covid it's your body to decide but abortion it's not your body.. STOP BEING HYPOCRITES"
"The sexual revolution has failed. It's failed everyone, men, women and children. We need a counter-revolution. A revolution of love, life, truth, peace, non-violence and hope."
"my body, my choice. really?
then why do you force everyone to get the covid vaccine?"
"Could we PLEASE stop saying this is about ""women's rights"" and ""women's bodies""! It's not! Men can get pregnant too!"
Protect yourselves at these protests. Proud boys and the like will be there to push some buttons. I trust the protesters will behaves. Not so much the other side. Don't despair. This is going to backfire on the court.  More republican woman are on Row Wade side and red states will turn blue for the next three elections. Our only issue now is the alt right will take by force what they can not win. We may need to arm/train ourselves or be run down.
Uneducated and the left media and the leftist states just dont want to do any reserch to find out the truth. It was never a constitunal right it was never backed by more Americans. More Americans do not want killing babies legal. Its simple just do some reserch. The media MUST stop lieing and dividing America more than it is...
"Take responsibility baby killers , women's rights to sleep around without consequences or contraception taken away . 
Cry me a salty river ...."
So happy!!
Why is a white man talking about abortion? It has nothing to do with him -so he needs to shut up!
My body my choice? Nah not really. The man should have a say since he is 50% why there is a baby in a woman’s womb! Also THE BABY HAS RIGHTS
Why is there a jewess ... blubbing on the thumbnail?  Does this affect that sect at all?
I am enjoying their pain so much. Hopefully we can take everything democrats value from them.
Why should YOUR religion decide what women do with THEIR bodies? This shouldn't even be up for debate. America is going backwards.
Abortion is not addressed in the Constitution therefore it falls in the category of states rights. Each state can decide their abortion laws independent of the heavy hand of the federal government deciding what are the rules and regulations
The right to choose is freedom.

How are they going to sell baby parts?
Winner winner chicken dinner baby!!!🎊🎉🎈✨️ Their tears fuel my powers.
Channel 4 is fake news
Look at all the indoctrinated idiots. Look at the guy comparing this to the Normandy landings. These people are delusional and without common sense. They've allowed themselves to be fooled by politics and religion.
An old-fashioned constitution that does not really care for equality and freedom sucks. I feel so sick. Incest and rape are no longer treated as something worse than a woman deciding about her life. Wtf is this country doing. Justices who were not elected by the people are now enforcing their will on said people ->women
How is abortions a woman’s right and child has not even the right to life
Watching these murderers cry brings so much joy!
There is no constitutional right to abortion.
"‘There will be no functioning society without women’
So stop killing them in the wombs!"
Privatize abortion in all cases except for cases for rape and danger to mother’s health. Problem solved.
This is disturbing. Women crying that they may not be able to murder babies anymore in their state. Degenerate democrats.
What do you mean by woman?
🤣🤣🤣🤣I LOVE IT!!!!!
"It was never a constitutional right. It violates the constitution's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
Only the crazy women are pissed. The rest of us are good with the decision.
Democracy - 1 Roe Vs Wade - 0. 😂
"RELIGIOUS PEOPLE ARE RLLY SOMETHING ELSE, shoving their beliefs down our throats!"
Abortion is murder go throw a temper tantrum because you can't kill an innocent life .
Abortion was never in the constitution...
Great day for America! Go Supreme Court!
How dare people have accountability for their actions .
I’m pretty sure God wouldn’t be ok with killing a baby. Bible says he hand formed us in the womb. But he allows freedom which can sometimes suck like when it comes to killing a baby in the womb
travel to California.  Get your abortion and visit Disneyland before going home.
They go on about woman's right yet they don't give a toss about their rights when  allowing  biological men in their sports and locker room's
The face on that thumbnail is some bulletproof contraception.
6:44 that many women had enjoyed there you said thats why its gone because
Women taking away other women's rights fir self determination. Sad day in America!
These people don't realise if their parents had an abortion they wouldn't be here to protest
"This is disgusting & it is such a step backwards. I could understand the views of pro-life if they focused on the existing children that are suffering and need help. On top of this, many women have been abused,raped or subject to abusive relationships where the child would be at a detriment… what about them? This negatively impacts poor women & the most marginalised women. This is not progressive at all. Sorry this is just ridiculous"
Abortion Lives fucking matter in the name of the 6 religions and blacks and whites.
This reporter is a pandering idiot.
you can see a massive split in America right now that country is prime to explode
Finally something good in America!
"THIS IS A A VERY WELCOME AND HUMANE DECISION!!!  THE MASS SLAUGHTER OF BABIES MUST STOP!!!
Roe v Wade was an EVIL, ANTI-HUMAN, PRO-NAZI, PRO-INFANTACIDE, PRO-GENOCIDE and SATANIC DECISION!!!
To See FEMIN-NAZI'S Crying in our Streets Because  The Courts have RESTRICTED THEIR RIGHT TO MURDER!!!  Is a Sickening Sight!!!  Their Monstrocity and Mendacity  Is Incredible!!!"
Abortion is not murder.  In most cases it is an act of mercy for the woman as lots of things can go wrong with contraception and mental illness.  All you are doing is making women go through pregnancies they do not want.  There will be suicides over this.  What about rape?
"Can we just sweep aside the overly emotive language about foetuses? A cluster of cells entirely dependent on the woman is not a human being. It is not a child. Gun violence is the number one killer of actual children in America, and the Trumpists are as we speak, still expanding gun rights. 

The U.S. is a country that, like Saudi and Pakistan, still practices the death penalty, mosty on poor, people of colour who could not afford decent legal representation. Hundreds of people who later turned out to be innocent, were tortured and killed. Trump oversaw more executions in his final days of office than any other president.

So please, don't pretend that America's protracted, violent display of religious fanatism resulting in this Supreme Court debacle is ""pro life."""
Thank God Men have gained basic human rights. Now they dont have to let the women dispose of their baby they also helped make.
Abortion was never a Constitutional right. Get a grip idiots.
What completely biased garbage reporting
"What a backwards nation America is, I could leave a Muller corner outside in the sun for half a day and it will materialise into a more civilised culture than the USA."
"The ONLY reason why this has happened is so the alphabet people can have more children to adopt 

Trust me the rich will still get abortion"
"You’d think the news would have a better understanding of Constitutional Law. Don’t you idiots have legal experts. Please point out the Amendment or something in the Bill of Rights, that guarantees the right to have an abortion. I’m for common sense abortion laws so why doesn’t congress pass one…"
"The woman are pissed - not all of them evidently, most notably those who don't believe you have the automatic right to kill another human being."
Back in her country where things aren’t so easy my mom had an illegal abortion that could’ve cost her life. You guys are only stopping legal abortions and putting women in distress in great danger. But I guess life or death situations only matter when we’re talking about a little cluster of cells
Abortion is the contraception for slappers. Anyone with a brain would use a condom or birth control pill.

"Hey you retards ABORTION is Still Legal it just changed from Federal Control to State Control.
Stop the DISINFORMATION."
Literally hoes mad
Change is coming liberals need to suck it up and accept their own advice
"Ultimately this discussion is actually about unborn rights, not women's rights. Spoiler alert, in a free and fair society with equal protection under the law, there are no rights specific to women. Period. Especially not at the expense of other people's rights, in this case mens, and babies."

there would be no functioning society without women???? that's a false statement if I heard one. just accept the fact there are consequences to your actions and sl*ts are no acception
Biden looks like he was still on the bicycle lol The confusion is unreal..
"Use Condoms   How stupid are you people not, Women want the right to kill a child but the Unborn Child got no rights  Remember if your mother used her right to kill you before you were born, you would not be there to want your rights.  Wake up.  It is against the intention of the world."
What amendment in the constitution has anything to do with abortion? Its not a constitutional right
"00:32 ""the supreme court whos very purpose is to protect civil liberties, took away the constitutional right to get an abortion"" it was never a constitutional right! that's what this WHOLE thing was about! If it was then it would have gone the complete opposite way"
hahahahahahahah .........poor little murderers
Y’all acting crazy we got way important issues then this bullshit 😂

Pro life!!!!!
Imagine being sad that you cant kill a baby 😂
Its not a constitutional right for abortion read the constitution
This is what happens when you don’t understand the constitution of the United States. Abortion was never in the constitution. Just a bad ruling along time ago that was corrected.
"Look at the bright side, after Biden and The Democrats are gone from affecting American politics for a long time in the next election, more Supreme Justices will be pro life"
Why Biden not throw putin into the blame pot too?
Welcome to Gilead 2022

now all we need is another republican president of America

I have nothing else to say."
"I support overthrow, don’t kill unborn children"
This news is completely wrong. Abortion was never a constitutional right. News like this is why people are stupid about the laws in the US.
Noticed the people for it are mental
Us men never had any rights to opt out of fatherhood responsibilities after conception. Now women in half states won't either. Getting closer to equality.

Thank you president Trump!!!!! Your right to not have a baby comes before you spread your irresponsible legs. Be a responsible adult stop killing babies
Personally I think it’s the power of the tongue. All this over exaggerated talk of women oppression when it could always be worse and now the universe is following suit and it’s becoming a reality. Welcome to worse ladies. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Boo hoo wah wah baby killers.
Land of the free!
"Ah yes save the children 👍🏻

And yes when libs loses, they riot the cities like babies"
"Leftist- Women's rights are at risk

Leftist- Errrrrr, I'm not a biologist.
Conservative- If you cannot define what a woman is, how can you determine there's a risk to them?
Leftist- You're a racist!!!"
"Think of the rights of those innocent, powerless unborn babies."
"That pro-life progressive woman is, I’m afraid to say, living in fantasy land.
Does she really believe that what was holding America back from universal healthcare, higher minimum wages, statutory sick pay or paid family leave was abortion?
In what universe does the Republican-dominated pro-life movement now go ahead and pass those laws? They co-opted abortion rights because it was an emotional issue. It’s way easier to stand up for the rights of an unborn baby, they can’t demand anything from you. Actually doing something for living, breathing woman is not on their agenda."
Baby killing will stop in states who care about babies. The left has controlled the Supreme Court for years. Now the shoe is on the other foot. Get over it. I rejoice in this decision and the saving of children's lives.
"Slave owners 🤝 pro choicers

You women crying over the overturn of Roe vs Wade are disgusting! Supporting the murder of babies when you have a duty and should have an instinct to protect makes you a monster!

"Welcome to Ceausescu's Romania, oh wait... it's the land of the free! Absolutely ridiculous decision. Hello long needles, hello illegal abortions :("
"20% of babies in USA in 2020 were killed by their mothers.  930,160 abortions, 3,605,201 births.  I'll remember that next mother's day."
You chose the guy! You let him in! You need to hold yourself ACCOUNTABLE.
"The news commentator should go do her homework. There is no constitutional right to abortion. If it was, it would have been upheld in the supreme court! This is the reason it has been sent back to the states. For it to be made a constitutional right, it must be legislated for in both the house and senate, and the courts will have to interpret as law."
Lol and they blaming trump

Fifty years too late for the millions they murdered.
Finally the Supreme Court got it right. Your going to have to travel to other states all of you baby killers.
The land of the free and the home of the brave?? 🇺🇸 Kinda feels like Gilead to me…
"So let me get this straight, Americans ban abortions because apparently terminating a foetus is murdering a child, but Americans don't ban guns despite having a school shooting like every other week? America is a weird place."
"Well all seems to be going well...gun laws, race, abortion. Thank god we have politicians that look to implement laws and rights that make a better society rather than popularist, career promoting policies."
Taking away the liberty to kill unborn children. A very good thing. The report is very biased in favour of abortion in the way it was worded.
"You know, and I think that I can speak for everyone, including the Worthless Cowardly Democrats, Women no longer have the ability to Kill a Baby.  If the  Freeloading Deadbeat Cowards need someone to blame keep the past Virginia Governor Ralph ""Blackface"" Northam on the top of your list.  He fueled the Anti Abortion movement when he allowed Virginian's to abort a BABY up to 20 minutes after birth as part of a sensible birth control plan.  A Racist Fool !  When you look up the word Backfire in the dictionary you will see a photo of Ralph Blackface."
Ooo America what a backward and dystopian shithole you're slowly becoming...shame to watch this
"phenomenal news

millions of children won't be murdered with impunity

hoping it doesn't stay here and it continues into a full federal ban on murdering unborn babies"
Roe vs wade would've been left untouched if the Democrats have not started demanding the right to abort babies up till the moment of birth and to kill them after
"Breaking news:  To counteract the loss of great numbers of children shot and killed in high school, the US has banned abortion in the hope this action maintains a sufficient prison workforce."
"Whilst the World takes two steps forward, America takes three steps back."
The rights of women but trans in women sports haha the left is full of it!
I truly can’t believe people scream and cry for the right to kill unborn children!? The west truly has lost it.
It was never a constitutional right! That is incorrect.
Ladies - all this means is that you're going to have to actually get to know a guy before you let him bust in you.

Could America become anymore shitty  than it already is?? Shootings every week and now abortion is abolished
How popular is RBG now? She should have retired earlier but these justices are so selfish.
Ladies dealing with male entitlement in the dating world now have a very good reason to tell him to keep it in his pants and treat you with respect.
Can we just take a moment to think of the people who are going to have to consider the attributes of a potential sexual partner as a mother or father and life long partner before barebacking with them? That's the real issue here.

I am fucking 16 years old and having to fight for my rights so if anything happens to me, I'm okay. At this point I rather get my tubes tied and not give birth at all in life"
"""unborn child-killing"" - jeezzz"
It’s amazing to me that people are mad that they can’t kill kids anymore! Imagine that .. mad because they can’t murder their own kids. Pure evil
Praise the Lord.
"Abortion is Murder, you have no right to take a life 🇺🇸"
"If it's your body and your choice, and your choice was to get pregnant, why would you want to get rid of it?"
Abortion it should be illegal.In some cases should be legal.
Oh no! Think of how many children won't die! Oh the inhumanity! Would someone think about a woman's ability to casually kill!
UK AND USA ARE ABOMINABLE NATIONS!!!! DO NOT TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST (VACCINE) JESUS IS COMING SOON!!! REAL REAL TALK
50 years of killing babies was enough!
Such black and white views from both sides... Jesus.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Welcome to the United States of Gilead.

The USA hammers yet another nail into the coffin of Critical Thinking. 
YeeeHaaa UnterMerica!"

"Women know they rely on relationships for men for their survival.  It takes allot of character to parent.  With fewer countermeasures in those relationships to paternity, the demand for women to improve their character is going to increase.  It's not easy for a person with a poor character to hear a demand they improve."
Its not a constitutional right. show me in the constitution where it says abortion is a right?
what are these protesters mad about? they can still kill their babies in over half the country. how about abstinence? just using it for birth control is barbaric.
Abortion is murder..
"Maga King... life wins. Salty Army we are legion. Birth control, cross your legs."
What at the root of all this - does it stem from fundamentalist Christians?
Arms heads feet ripped out this is GENOCIDE!
"The very same crooked politicians who 12 months ago were forcing vaccine mandates and covid passports on people now are demanding ""my body my choice"" be respected? The naked hypocrisy of them is breathtaking."

The anti-abortion uprising claims to be progressive yet is in favour  of a completely regressive movement.
Save the baby humans
"Thus is just the beginning...
https://youtu.be/iJcS44CzfuM"
">>""A constitutional right that has been in place for half a century.""
Quite untrue. The whole point of the ruling is that abortion is _not_ a constitutional right - that is, it is not a right that is guaranteed in the constitution - and in consequence Roe v Wade was wrong in (constitutional) law to hold otherwise.
All the ruling says is that the US constitution, which of course does not mention ""abortion"" and says nothing about it explicitly, likewise does not say anything about it implicitly either, and so in consequence abortion law is a matter for the democratically elected legislatures of the individual states to decide.
As such, it is a victory for democracy. It is not for unelected judges to be imposing laws on US citizens. That is the role of elected politicians.
The US left, which has done nothing but bleat about ""democracy"" these past 18 months, is exposed as hypocritical in the extreme. As soon as democracy (anywhere in the world for that matter) yields a result it doesn't like, it starts rioting - or worse."
interesting that Republicans want to protect unborn babies which they're happy to have die while attending school through mass shootings....
A country where a woman can't make her own mind up and have an abortion and the same country that allows a minor to buy a gun! really need to think again! USA home of the brave land of the stupid. The supreme court is dictating to the electorate.
Glad to see that season 5 of handmaid’s tale has been released
President Biden has the lowest approval rate of any president by the way...
Pro-life women always look beautiful and peaceful. I'm not here to talk about the baby killers with their coloured hair.
"Do you know that the majority of women didn't want the vote, because it would make them eligible for the draft... But Men voted to let them vote against their will because it was what was right... Just cuz the majority wants something doesnt make it right..."
"Trump did his damage. Back to the Middle Ages. Actually back to the Dark Ages. Keep women in chains. Let women be ruled, instead of being equal. Now women will be unable to run their own lives, make their own decisions, and be in control of their own bodies."
Ummm. That's not what the supreme court does. It interprets laws. It only upholds civil rights insofar as the laws and constitution do
Im happy it doesnt go their way ... they have to use condoms now 🤣👊🏽 .. if they think babies are  worse than HiV they should use condoms or prevention pills 💊 ... even their famous tantra technics can help them
"What funny is, is that if you asked one of these leftist protestors - who are fighting for womens rights- what a woman is, they would probably be unable to answer…and also if you are that against having children there are many medical ways not to have one"
"Something to think about. Don't abortion clinics and Guns do the same thing? How can we complaining and get all butt hurt when a school shooting like Sand Hook and Texas KILLS OUR LITTLE FUTURE, THEN WE THEN WE GO TO PIECES WHEN THE COURTS STRIKE DOWN A PLAN THAT GOES IN AND KILLS OUR KIDS? ARE GUNS AND CLINICS NOT THE SAME THING?"
Oh no I might have to be careful and responsible with my own body 😭😂
Imagine if all those protesters were aborted by their mothers.
Abortion is wrong! Case closed!
This is a failure of successive generations of education in America. I see it happening in the UK too.
1:10 I am terrified......Then 5 seconds later showing a video of her acting like an aggressive chav....
I really don't get it. How do you dehumanise a fully formed person with experiences and thoughts but humanise a foetus?
Garbage. Inaccurate. Partisan propaganda. I don't know what else I expected from the comrades over at Channel 4
After 50 years now America has a conscious. They don't care about fetuses. Why now? What could it be?
"Hot girl summer cancelled!! Haha. Seriously, might make people more conscious of who they lay with."
"Abortion is not now, or ever has been a Constitutional right, so STOP saying it is!"
"DJT deliberately appointed three conservative justices? Seriously? He was the president and it was his constitutional duty to appoint conservative, constitutional justices, not liberal justices."
Finally the constitution being upheld. Next is the unconstitutional gun laws on the books. Give us back the rights our forefathers fought for.
Build foster homes rn
This worries me because the rest of the western leaders looks up to America . It might be a possibility that other countries will try and follow America’s lead. I’m pro life and pro choice .I think woman should have a choice but I think killing the child is bad but it’s not my business what other women choose to do. If American governments focused on preventing rape and incest and bridge the gap from wealthy to poor and make contraception easily available then abortions rate will fall without having to make it illegal. Its all linked
"Americans are deeply divided over values such as gun control, abortion rights, LGBT rights, health care and other social and political issues... Sometimes it seems this is not a real nation, just people with different cultural, racial, religious backgrounds. California and NYC share much more values with Europe than with Alabama or Oklahoma."
I actually agree with the decision. Life over Death
Never seen women cry so much for the right to kill babies
Women's rights are being taken back 100 years women need to.mobilise but last night in Arizona police threw tear gas at protestors the US is becoming a right wing fundamentalist fascist regime thank you Trump
"Well done America, more kids to shoot !"
"The thing is women having the right to control their uterus wasn't the thing stopping people passing any sort of utopian laws making society a safe and well supported place  to choose to have and raise children. 
Nor does removing women's right make them any closer ( unless you think it'll galvinise women to kick out and lock up the greedy, corrupt misogynists who would rather remove rights from women than give them.)
If you want to pass free quality pregancy and birth care for all, affordable housing garaunteed, full child support payments covering all costs till gratution. Compulsory reversable (with a partners consent) vasectomies for all men. Equal pay for women etc. Then get those laws passed. Then indeed many of the valid reasons for choosing abortion will no longer be an issue."
"don't worry libtards, you'll still be able to kill your baby in a blue state, this just removes the law at the federal level... 

actually it should never have been a law in the first place, federal law must be legislated, not dreamed up by justices."
"""You must have that baby, and when you do, you're on your own. Oh.......and we'll help more sickos get assault weapons to massacre it in school in afew years time""

Lol. At least theyre solving the migration crisis too. What sane person would want to live in this place."
"So America happily takes away the right to a safe abortion, but doesn’t bother to ensure that children can go to school without fearing that they’ll be shot into a million pieces? Am I missing something here?"
"These are the people that were demanding mandates for vaccines, how ironic. 65,000,000 babies killed since 1973."
I hate the people cheering for the elimination of abortion (especially the woman who are cheering) because they won't be cheering if there right or laws that effect tme become REVOKED. IS AMERICA JUST GOING TO BECOME A HANDSMAID TALE
"This is taking the choice away FROM WOMAN, jesus shouldn't make that decision it should be the woman herself"
The United States moves closer to merging with the Taliban every day
"Indian Constitution gave women right to choose since 1970.Indian Supreme court and Indian Government have raised the ceiling of abortions from 20 weeks to 24 weeks.Indian Judiciary and Government is working towards safer abortions,family planning and women healthcare.Ironically Western countries still feel the need to lecture India and South Asian countries on Liberalism and Human Rights."
"Cost to have a baby in US: $10,800 (provided no aftercare is needed). 

All this does is put people into poverty. And the kids you have forced them to have. 

Well done, idiots."
libtards are angry they can't murder their baby.
but what is a woman?
Pass a law making it illegal not to wear a condom see how the men like that
"LOL, sorry guys, you can't murder your baby anymore."
Give choice to women.
A woman has the right of ownership over her own body
"No woman may be allowed to kill. Exceptions are obviously acceptable  in case of rapes or serious health problems. Nevertheless, every human being must be respected while, on the other hand, pussies may never be faced as a ""green card"" to murder innocent human beings because responsibility inheres to women's liberty."
Live from Austin Texas tells you all you need to know from Jose.
"This people kill each other, they are extremely discriminating poor people that end up on bad shape on life in bad conditions. Those people that hate so much immigrants and love conservative hypocritical ideas. Are the people that is trying to obligates people to carry pregnancy not desired.

Those things are outrageous..."
And just like that libtards can all of a sudden define what a women is...until the subject changes
Aaah forcing women to bare children they have no support for. Very cool America.
Pro life woman did well to stay calm and logical when she was clearly the one under attack
https://youtu.be/78Oje-3J5zQ
America is coming to its sense !!!
what's up with fucking religious schizos in the comments why are people so fucking anti abortion because their fucking imaginary friend is absolute cretinous backeards country America is this is what happens when you let disabled people get a vote
Glory to God and love to Presidente Trump!!Trump forever!
"The so-called 'pro life' movement are: 
(tick one)
⬜️ Ignorant of the needs of others 
⬜️ Uneducated about biology and medicine 
⬜️ Unaware of the sociopolitical implications
⬜️ Fanatical religious fundamentalists 
⬜️ Misogynistic, hateful extremists
☑ All of the above"
Imagine crying because you can't kill your own offspring LOL
I haven’t seen Democrats this angry since we ended slavery.
Glory to GOD. The victory is the LORDs
Lol more support for families? Why there are many family don’t even have financial support and better insurance? Why there are so many homeless in this country? I guess people are used to it.
Which Woman's Right are we talking about here???
"hear the LYING NEWS.... Please...Please show me in the Constitution where it says abortion is a RIGHT.  Abortion was made to control the population,  it was NEVER a Constitutional."
Hope that his same will happening in my country 🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮😊 This is miracle from Heaven! Thank You Trump also.
"Abortion has killed more people than all the wars in history combined together from the time of ancient Egypt to today. 
If abortion was registered as a cause of death it would top the charts above everything every year.
At this point in many countries it's an issue of maintaining population numbers without having to resort to mass immigration to compensate for it. Most countries can't replace dwindling population numbers with immigrants."
Crazy when you see these girls annoyed when all they need to do was keep there legs shut
Same liberal morons can't even define what a women is.
Amazing day

"🥰😍
Time to make the churches pay their fair share of taxes that will generate billions of funds into the economy to pay for these poor babies that aren't wanted.. Almost 1 Million abortions a year will turn into a lot of unwanted babies that the CHURCH TAX will provide care for Its time!! AMEN... Even Jesus Christ paid taxes!!"
good
A fight for the unborn accomplished.
So now its a state issue and not federal.
Land of the free ey
Time to put them legs together pReeeeeeeeeeee reeee
"They haven't made abortions illegal... dumb fucks. States get to decide their own laws, its not federally mandated. 
The overturning of roe v wade does not mean no one can get abortion in the US. The media are just making out that it is for clicks and rile people up. As usual"
Well....this is going to end well
This thing is the best thing to do so it will go back to state and the people in it to decide so if you like democracy you should be happy today
"This makes me so happy. Stop these awful devils from killing kids. We need to protect our children, not murder them."
"The US needs a second civil war, the two tribes within that country are completely incompatible."
"Funny story, Norma McCorvey which was the real name of Jane ROE, actually became a pro-life activist later in life. Even though it was her case that led to abortion being legalised"
"The republicans are going to push very hard to make abortion illegal nationwide. 
Where do they stop?"
I’m vegan. We have people kill baby animals behind closed doors. I find this obviously hypocritical. And lacking self awareness. Because ultimately we are a very selfish species.
All news on planet Earth is stupid all the time
"the leftist screams in despair as their ""right"" to murder unborn infants is threatened."
OLD WHITE BABY BOOMERS STILL THINKING THEY CONTROL THE LEGAL KILLING OF BABIES
Make it a crime to kill a baby!!!!!! Bingo!!!!!
"SCOTUS isn't beholden to public opinion, they are beholden to the Constitution. Polls don't decide the constitutionality of a given case, only the Constitution and legal precedent."
"Killing babies is a lazy contraceptive
For the guiltless."
This is what they don't think about more  Homeless  more abuses kids that are not wanted the state  We'll have to open welfare offices   for sure... There's no opportunity for a lot of these kids that are being forced to come live in life without even able to have a home... Most of them will have drug addict mother... Will the state better have a nice bill for them They have to pay them once a month.
"Americans will regret this decision. It's idiotic and the only reason people want it is just because the Republicans want it not because they are ""pro-life"". Well, it's a sh*t show and we outside are enjoying it."
No greater evil than abortion.
its actually kind of easy to not get pregnant.

Choose contraception before abortion.
Accountability is wuhman Kryptonite
wtf is that thumbnail rofl
the ho's are mad they can't get a monthly abortion anymore 🤣🤣🤣
This is a godsend for the Biden regime  this is their only redeeming feature
"I support the decision women have been taking the p*** about abortions for too long but I do worry that they will seek another way illegally which isn't good either.
Women shout my body my choice what about the babys body babys choice to want to live.
I celebrate this with the pro- lifers"
The fetus is the hostage of the mother. It depends on the mother's choice whether to save or kill.
Abortion should be available but not easy to do
You gone keep my dam baby🎁 🦦👀😂😂😂
A clear lie. Most women in the US fo not support abortion
"If Republicans were doing this, over any issue, Democrats would call it an insurrection."
"In my opinion, in this day and more enlightened age, commonplace abortion should not be necessary, except in special circumstances of rape and confirmed extreme deformity, where the mother decides that she cannot continue to carry the baby. Abortion for social reasons, or for convenience, disposes of a life (that of the unborn baby) in the most casual, cruel and dismissive way. We cannot justify spending millions saving a premature baby who’s wanted, while placing a premature baby, who’s not wanted, in an incinerator. We can’t offer bereavement support to parents who have lost a baby through stillbirth, while turning a blind eye to the traumatic extraction of a developing little human. Education is the key, so that men and women engage in considerate sexual intercourse, respecting each other and being mindful of the possibility of creating a new life. This new life must not be dismissed because it is too tiny to defend itself against annihilation. This is my opinion"
"So to confirm, a tiny percentage of abortions are due to medical reasons.

We need to protect life, that’s the unborn. If you care about lives of women. Then you should be anti abortion, for more women die then will die in childbirth"
The anchors sound just as stupid as the protesters. There never has been a “constitutional right” to abortions.
Bimbos Lies Matter
Thank you Lucifer
Well... this is how fascism enters America. Just wait and see what other rights they are gonna take away next.
Babies lives matter get over it
I think women should have free will to do what they want and what they do not with their life. If they get and abortion that is their business. We don’t need laws put up just because of peoples opinions.
Why tf are women fighting so hard to kill a baby? You hose cry over a dying dog but kill a baby.
"How embarrassing! The passage of this law is part of the war of religions against each other. They pass a law to protect the fetus. Women are seen as a bag in which future soldiers should grow. But, in the case of the hundreds of thousands of children who fall victim to violence and war every year, children who go to war by force, children who work on the streets, children who are trafficked for sexual purposes and organs, and dozens Another catastrophe, The legislators and men of God are dumb and blind. Sorry! I forgot! Children victims of sexual harassment in the church. More than 300,000 victims a year, in France alone. Church leaders may need more children to meet their sexual needs. Maybe “Handmade’s tale” has already started."
“My body my choice” huh??? they weren’t as inspired with such statement when we were talking about covid vaccine 😂 what a circus 🤡
"I was adopted at the age of two weeks. I could have been aborted. Perhaps the pro-abortion harridans might care to explain to me why the life I now have should have been dependent on the whim, agency, and convenience of the woman in whose womb I was conceived."
"You pro life hipocrites make me sick.. You care so much about a fetus that isn't even human but don't give too shits about the women and her choices.. I thought you idiots care about all lives.. So what about the women's lives.. The facist, UNAMERICAN, traitor low life piece of trash supreme court makes me sick.. They should All be ashamed of themselves.. I hop karma gets them and all you facist selfish scum who support this.. We as a democracy is over.. Good job scumbags..."
makes me so sad to see young women being anti choice
Woman think killing a baby is part of womens rights?
Two wins for the right in a week. Thank you President Trump! The rule of the left is coming to an end!!
"The interviewer is a fool.she cares about the women..who goes to be to have fun .and wants to violate the right if an innocent being who never called. For it...and the fools in green being pro arbotion,,if their parents thought the same on them..where would they be...humanity is too lazy to think...I stand for pro life"
Wow. What a primitive country USA is. Im so glad i dont live there.
Wow people you're angry that you're not allowed to murder children... And then you still think you're good people
"A lot of corporations have said that they will help a woman get an out of state abortion if necessary, which is great. However, if that isn't an invasion of privacy, I don't know what is."
Pro choice are not pro women but pro destruction and chaos.
Good.
"I was in college 50 years ago when Roe V Wade was decided by the Supreme  Court. There is one HUGE difference between then and now that I have observed. Now BOTH sides are speaking up. There were a lot of people against abortion outside the Supreme Court today and supporting the decision. I noticed many of them were women. And there was a large crowd supporting abortion too. The HUGE difference is 50 years ago I never heard one single anti abortion woman dare to speak up. In fact on my college campus or anywhere else did I ever see ANY anti abortion people speaking up. They existed back then but because they were such a tiny fraction of the population they kept quiet. Back then the pro abortion women were a lot more militant and violent than now. They would have attacked and probably killed any woman who was vocal on my campus who spoke up against abortion. Those against abortion back then actually feared for their lives. I knew a girl in my college who was a very religious Christian and very against abortion. I asked her why she didn’t protest the Roe V Wade decision. She told me, “Are you nuts, if I protested the decision I would be killed by some crazy pro abortion woman.” Back 50 years ago anyone who was anti abortion did not dare speak up or they would have been killed by crazy nuts pro abortion women. Times have changed and the anti abortion people are vocal now and don’t keep quiet in fear of their lives."
Thank you TRUMP!!!
Thank you God 🙏
Why is Biden giving Trump credit for this? Doesn’t Biden know that is what Trump wants? 🙄
This just in: ugly fat women that no one wants to have a kid with are outraged that baby killing is no longer allowed
Beware Britain…..We have a Govt. that openly attacks our independent judiciary and is full of Catholics !
God's will is done. Let the people of the states decide on it. Not the federal level. There's a reason the US is called a Constitutional Republic.
"We are going back into the dark Ages. Women's rights are getting taken away. This is so terrifying and so messed up! And they say there's freedom in America, that's total bullshit!!"
This is a democracy though lol. What a joke America is.
We care about liberties so much that we impose you to have your baby. We just don't care  what will happen to you and him after those 9 months.
"Why is not upto someone what they do with there body, why is it even a question? The states got no right to tell you what to do."
June 24 will always be remembered as the day the unborn got their civil rights. Sexually Irresponsible degenerates will no longer use the law to legally murder the unborn.
A child is really the greatest from God when you sit & think about it
They love abit of drama in America
"I get it. BLM stans for ""Babies' Lives Matter"". Bravo!"
"Ha ha. I don't care about abortion, but I do like seeing these college kids so upset."
These protesters are the same people who are fine with forcing vaccines 🤡
What about the baby's choice?  Save the babies!
"Yeah, rally the left right before the midterms. What a joke. Our entire political system is corrupt, our politicians do not care about us or our views. They are bought by the highest bidder, and legislate with bills that are literally written by their lobbyists. This change only symbolizes a need to divide us further, so we don't see the rotten mess they've turned our institutions into."
"As a pregnant man, I find this attack on men’s rights very disturbing"
Women might finally have to take responsibility for their actions for a change. Good news. If women want to be promiscuous and sleep around they will have to ensure they use effective contraceptives - quite simple really.  But hang on a minute  - what is a woman?
Ok C4N. You have covered this US news issue. Can you drop it now. Does not need another 10 minute segment again any time soon.
"Man, I wish our money goes back to Gold."
Two things a women can do if they don't want a baby one get fixed two take out your urtus. Yes a women should have a right but if the problem is you don't want kids well just think because stress is just going to make you lose your mind.
"Why the dramatic over reaction? It hasn’t been completely banned, it’s simply been moved to individual states to decide. So if you’re in Texas you wouldn’t have liberal beliefs forced on you, and if you a liberal living in California they still give you the right to murder your unborn child."
Why isn't there ever any attractive females at abortion rallies! 🤔
Wonder how they would feel if they got raped and pregnant. Truly a tragic day in America. That's what happens when you let religion deside human rights.
Jose vela looks a bit like pep guadiola
"There would have been no Holocaust  or overturning of Roe v Wade but for the Catholic Church.
To understand where Christian Nationalism is taking the country, read ""God And The Fascists"" by Karlheinz Deschner (1965 German) “Gott mit uns”"
Soon your children will be killed no more
Women say it’s their body it’s not their body it’s gods body
Your body your choice? Then start choosing TO NOT SLEEP AROUND.
"This is disinformation, you don't understand Constitutional law. It's called ""democracy "" and the Supreme Court is following the law. You're welcome."
Women's rights have not been overturned.
No rights were overturned at all.  Man these crazy politicians and the media outlets they own need to STOP with the hate and divisiveness just to win elections.      :-/
"The supreme court if doing very little for kid dying of guns viloence at schools, but they go in do this. Do they realize we are those ones growing up in this generation, not them."
"It's never a right to kill anyone, especially a little innocent baby, #Prolife"
"Thank God, and thank Donald Trump for this Scotus decision."
"Abortion is Murder
Thank you Supreme court for safe guarding the rights of the innocent
Praise God 🙏"
Terrissa is a blooming idiot.
Isnt it wonderful that this barbaric awful law is now gone forever. Now females will need to face their responsibility for promiscuous behaviour head on. No more baby murder for convenience. Thank you Donald Trump for setting this up. Wonderful
"WELL DONE SCOTUS!!!
MAKE ABORTION ILLEGAL AGAIN
MAKE MAN AND WOMAN RESPONSIBLE AGAIN!!!
ABORTION SHOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED IF MOTHERS LIFE IS AT RISK AND IN CASE OF RAPE!!"
Sluts should keep their legs closed. These rats will get what they deserve.
"I thought unelected officials without term limits governing over masses without representation was tyranny. Now these unelected officials (Supreme Court) give power to legislate abortion laws to the states, to elected officials who represent people, and suddenly all of these so called “democrats” are against it. People have the right to self determination. The right to self governance. If you don’t like the laws, vote, don’t support tyranny as long as it’s tyranny in favor of your political beliefs."
Yay!
"I have never been so proud of my nation! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 The future is now for America, we are the Pro-Life generation!"
"Dear crazy women.
Murder my child and your next. My fury my choice."
It was never a Constitutional right!
"Republicans/Conservatives/Pro-Lifers/Deplorables/Evil-Folks (acc to MSM) are the ones taking care of these unwanted children. They are mostly the ones donating, volunteering, and to be frank, are also the ones who are mostly burdened by the taxes (and it is not even close). I used to be Pro Choice but it went from a just cause to downright insane genocide preventing folks to be fully responsible with their decisions/actions. It used to be mothers in stable marriages who are having problems supporting their large families. The occasional health prone and victims of crime (which won't even crack the thousands). Nowadays, it is mostly HS and college students. More than 50 million babies killed every year (and this is just a super mild estimate because the actual numbers are not reported because it will definitely paint a dystopian-like and/or very grim picture). It is crazy that FOR SO LOOOONG, we allowed millions and millions of babies to be flushed down the toilet, burned, and left to rot in the ground/sewers ready for the rats and worms to eat. There should be limits to all these madness."
You guys can't fix the gun laws. But can take away woman rights ?
"Wow, genuinely shocked by this. What a sad day for Americans. I can't even imagine the negative consequences that will arise from this."
"This makes me sick. I'm am only fourteen I don't know what could happen to me in the future. what if a baby is forced upon me, and I'm am forced to give birth to a child that I didn't want. I hate this generation, it sucks. I get abortions can be sad, because your getting rid of a baby. But ur taking away a woman right. Some people make me sick to my stomach, this Is not the world I wanted to grow up in."
America regardless was made through murder rape & slavery….you reap what you sow… the crows have come home to roost.
Noooooo! Don’t you guys how many more black and brown kids will be brought into the world now? The glorious White Race will soon become extinct if the lesser races can’t quell their own numbers!
"As a pregnant man, I find this attack on mens rights very distressful"
"Talk about an unfactual report. The court didn't take away the constitutional protection of abortion, because there never was one."
"Nowadays, only two regimes make laws backwards, Taliban and America."
Isn't this reporter her own birth control?
Bro where was this fight when they pushed medical procedures on the polulation
"I'm 19, And Already Know ABORTION IS WRONG, Everything That Makes Me Angry, Abortion, Gun Violence, Gay Community forcing Stupid Laws, People Who Say I Don't Believe In GOD, Americans Need To Stop Acting So Ignorant And Get RIGHT WITH GOD!! GOD IS REAL!!! 😠"
200 years ago the majority of people thought that slavery was ok. Somehow it's immoral to misgender someone but it should be perfectly reasonable to dismember a fetus? Thanks old British fart for steering me in the right direction.
"And just like that, the Democrats suddenly know what a woman is."
💡 WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME A WOMAN'S BODY HAD TWO HEADS TWO HEARTS FOUR ARMS AND FOUR LEGS?💡
Why not sterilise the inferior and economically worthless working class men? That would eliminate the need for abortions.
"Erectile dysfunction is God telling men they have no right to have children.

Men who don't earn enough to raise a child should be forcefully sterilised.

Sterilising men would make abortion unnecessary."
"Bravo to those God fearing SCOTUS Judges. Abortion is forbidden in Christianity, Thank you to SCOTUS judges for standing up to those baby killers."
😛sorry BABY KILLERS !!
Unprofessional reporting. You didn't have to tell us which side you are. We just need the news
all because people dont wanna wear condoms america goes into a riot as if they live in China
"I have a serious question. If a mother is carrying a baby. But through testing they find out the baby has brain defects. Is a mother allowed to get an abortion because of that, eventhough this law passed?"
Penguin
"Some really disingenuous and blatantly false reporting going on here.  The purpose of the Supreme Court is to interpret the constitution, not protect civil liberties.  Second, abortion was never a constitutional right as you put it, you will not find it mentioned at all."
"Every child in America should be armed with an AR15 so they can protect themselves.

But US Conservatives oppose arming children because they are hypocritical elitists."
"I presume the Supremes are socialists, as they expect the taxpayer to pay for unwanted babies, and also allow churches to  steal money from the taxpayer."
Picture of pro-death woman crying because she'll be slightly inconvenienced in killing her own child in her own womb.
300lbs and ugly big mad for some reason
"I am sorry to be disrespectful but as a TV you shouldn’t be handing the microphone and giving the microphone to such a stupid, selfish and narcissistic woman. She doesn’t fucking get to choose, through her little movement of backwards bitches, what other women want to do with their bodies!"
as elon musk said 'biggest threat to civilisation is population collapse'. This will greatly help civilisation in the long run.
THE SUPREME COURT MADE THE RIGHT DECISION IT'S NOT THE WOMEN'S CHOICE ITS JUST PLAIN MURDER BABIES HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE
"Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. And unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD. 2Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even made cast images of the Baals.

3Moreover, Ahaz burned incense in the Valley of Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. 2nd Chronicles 28"
your modern western whorish women that want to keep their whorish lifestyles and make babies and have convenient ways to get rid of them instead of being responsible and taking care of their babies
"I am a Christian woman and NOT an advocate for abortion. But, I do believe that there should be some instances where it is allowed. For example, children getting pregnant as a result of sexual abuse, rape, if a pregnancy is too dangerous for someone to continue with- in which case you would need medical clearnace, and so on. But, I will not agree with women using abortion to get rid of a child just because it doesn't fit into her life. That part is a no for me."
"This is not talking  away any freedoms , its giving a little fragile baby a chance at life. Why is that so difficult to understand. Dont sleep around folks"
"Haha ha 63,000,000 dead babies.  Shame on you."
Limiting of freedom? I’d say millions of unborn children just received some hope of freedom.
"Aww, nice to see some wholesome gals there, they're gonna become loving moms in the future ^v^"
That’s how we ROE 😝
"Take note! The majority of pro voice protesters are white! White women! Furthermore, black females are the highest in abortions!  So, are white women for killing black babies?? What happened to BLM"
Glory to the Almighty God!
Why are they celebrating 🧍🏽‍♀️

"Gawd, this is terrible reporting.

Abortion was never protected in the Constitution. Roe v Wade in 1973 was the incorrect ruling.

Abortion is relegated down to the States where women can still organize and vote in pro-choice candidates"
Lol take the L leftists. You have office but you wield no power.
"It's sadistic to for force a baby to be born to a childhood of abuse. The amount of parents who are addicts, alcoholics and druggies, trying to makes money for their drugs by prostituting their own baby out to pedophiles. Not only being sexually abused but physical, emotional and spiritual too. What about the damage being raised in with parents who have a physcial/neurological/mental disability does. Are going going to personally raise that baby?? And NO, it's not Gods will for a baby to be shared around be the local pedophiles!!!!!!!!!"
So democratic that a tiny group of unelected officials have rhe power to strip freedom from millions of Americans
Why is it that most of the people that are against abortion??? are people you would never F..k even if you were drunk...
Huge victory in the war against women!
Soon the streets are going to be overrun with babies carrying assault rifles
What about the rights of people in the womb?
Maybe all those in favour of abortion should have been aborted
"""We will get to Berlin"" How ironic, the US didn't even fight in Berlin nor did they capture it, it was the Soviets, hope your case against abortion will turn out the same way"
Ever noticed that all those in favour of abortion ... have already been born ... and now want to deny that right to others
Finally less hoes on the streets now that y’all scared to get pregnant.
"""Would you get an abortion?""
""Absolutely""
""What if the baby was black?""
""...."""
"Lol, but let me get this straight: if man can be woman and woman can be man, why are these pro choice activists talking only about woman? That's transphobic 🤡. Using their own logic is hella fun😂😂. NO MORE ROE V WADE FOR Y'ALL 💙💙💙💙"
To the women Remember in 2024. If you want Trump enjoy having the rest of your rights stripped away. This is his fault
Democrats haven't been this angry since the time Republicans took away their slaves.
But if the chick was raped?

Finally moral sanity is being restored! The most fundamental right is the right to Life! The taking of innocent life is never a long lasting & healthy solution.
I'm grateful for the abolishment of LEGAL GENOCIDE of the unborn
The reporter is brainwashed
Grow up use a condom duh.
What is a woman?
Democrats haven't been this mad since Republicans freed the slaves
If you want to kill your babies just go to a blue state.
"So worthless are the idiots who live to control and take away the rights of others. And these idiots have no empathy just a need to hate and control someone all the time. A sad day in America that these hateful, controlling bigots think they  have won. Just watch them spit on homeless veterans, telling them it is their choice, and starving homeless babies, they could care less about. Pathetic bunch of gossip mongering misfits. If they don't want an abortion don't have one. They get narcissistic supply from controlling women. I am not standing in front of your house telling you not practice sodomy, that is your choice."
I support the decision of the US Supreme Court. Respect 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Women can chose to close their legs. Those crazy people don’t speak for me when they say “ women” LIFE WINS. This is a COUNTRY UNDER GOD

No Means Yes!
Now It's about Liberal Tears vs Maga Tears. Politics is All about Outrage these Days Because Politicians Don't want Real solutions. They want Run NeoLiberalism at the Expense of American People.
0:47 I'd like to see what her reaction would be if she gets a pregnant with a rapist's child. Blue states must block out of state abortions. Only blue state voters earned the right through their vote.
What in the fucking Handmaids Tale is going on?!

"My body, my garbage dump!!!!"
"Liberals don't care what happens to a woman after abortion such as the extreme guilt and even suicide that happens.

Thank you President Trump...You save many babies from being killed!
Wow.  The US really is heading back into the dark ages. 😧

This is not protesting! This is intimidation and harassment!
Going to Justice's homes with cóctel mólotov is disgusting and it's a terrorist act?!

If teens do not want to have a baby, it's better for them to prevent getting pregnant.
Killing an innocent live baby is a murder.

I'm glad they overturned it.
Wow this broadcaster does not understand how the system works!! There is no abortion right in the constitution !!
Women are now accountable for their actions ... They can't simply kill the life inside of them because it suits their purpose ... great verdict ... life is precious and not to be treated lightly
The people chosen ‘pro life’ or anti abortion folks really don’t care about the women who have to carry the pregnancy. Why even have these anti abortion people on your platform?!
MESS WITH THE MAGA FAMILY AND WE MESS WITH YOUR FAMILY!!!!.... ROE VS WADE 🎉🎊🎉!!!.. DON'T KILL KIDS 👍
This woman is a huge liar. It was always bad law. Finally got corrected. Of cause when democrats had super majorities they never changed the law. More people are pro- life

I'm gonna sleep so well tonight.
STOP KILLING BARBIES
HUMAN RIGHTS TO THE UNBORN CHILD
THANK YOU GOD FOR STOP KILLING BARBIES
YES YES PROTECT LIFE
No more Black babies to kill in most states
DON'T WORRY ABOUT TO KILLING BARBIES IF YOUR DON'T WANT TO HAVE BABIES REMOVE YOUR UTERUS
"Ohhh, of course...blame Trump again. 
This is whats called liberal backlash."
Trump wins this fight square and fair.
Wow I haven’t seen democrats this pissed since we took away their slaves
Abortion is a human sacrifice in the name of women’s liberation.
A victory for unborn babies. 🙏🏾
"america: what a disgusting country, congratulations for treating women so badly. would never want to visit your disgusting country. you are not the greatest country on earth."
"Thank you Hillary Clinton 
Thank you RBG 😊 
Trump 2024"
Now take away child support obligations
"Reporter killing is not freedom, if you believe in liberty you should believe in right to live. You people don't believe in freedom phonies"
What is to become of US liberals?-they defined themselves by the mass homicide of the unborn untermenschen.
Ppl upset that babies will be saved. What a twisted world. Shut up and stop killing babies
"I just can't wait to see the people of the United States in 25 years.
Children of junkies, children of incest, children with trisomy.
They are already well on the way with Trump.
Long live progress backwards.  🤪🤪🥴🥴"
“Conservatives want live babies so they can train them to be dead soldiers.” -George Carlin
The #hores are so mad 🤣
That woman answers zero questions…frustrating
"Demon-Rat's Trump Finally did something you can accuse him of!!
You hate him because your Demon-Rat party Told you too!
Today he gave you a reason to hate him for something he Actley did!
You think he cares!"
"That ladies said she is terrified, soooo when that baby starts getting cut up, I wonder how they feel?"
"Feel free to call me ignorance, stupid uneducated...etc whatever, but I simply think this way is that what if my mom somehow (or my parents) had changed her opinion, I would have disappeared...
If you dont want or need your babies, you can give them up for adoption...why killed them? Dont you think they would want to live too?"
i'm 14 and i know a lot about life and abotion is wrong babys don't need to die smh 🤦‍♂️
"here are some reasons a woman would want to get an abortion.
1. Health. In some cases if a woman gives birth, she can die to due health issues.

2. Money and expenses. Not everyone is in the middle/upper middle class. Baby supplies are very expensive. Diapers, clothes, formula, medicine, even the hospital stay. Not everyone can support both themselves and their child.

3. They just don’t want to. Not everyone is fit to be a parent. And when someone who isn’t fit for parenting becomes a parent, that can just lead to problems with the child. They may be neglected.

Now, you may be saying, “well you can just put the child for adoption.” The foster care system is extremely flawed. More than 70-80% of the children in the system either don’t get adopted or never find a permanent home. And by the time they turn 18, they can no longer be supported. In California alone, there are 60,000 children in the system right now.

4. Rape and trauma. If a woman gets raped, and is impregnated by their rapist, it would just be extremely traumatizing. Rape alone is traumatizing enough but if someone gives birth to that child then It would be even worse. Child birth and Motherhood should be an amazing moment, life being created from a loving relationship. But when a baby is born from something so horrible, the child can be a reminder of that traumatizing experience.

Would you force a woman to give birth even if it costs her life? Would you force a woman to give birth even though they wouldn’t be able to provide for the child? Would you force a woman to give birth even if that child was the result of rape? Would you force a woman to give birth then put the baby in a flawed system? 

Abortion isn’t about killing babies for funsies."
Freaking liars. Half the population is against it and you know it.
"YOU CANT EVEN DEFINE WHAT A WOMAN IS !!!
Now you are complaining about women’s rights !"
"how fucking dare you take my city's name in your disgusting creed. berlin is, was, and always will be a city fighting for freedom and in flux in moments of oppression. but we know what's what. and taking away a human's right to make decisions about their own body and their future opportunities has NOTHING to do with that. berlin spits on you, sir. and this decision. pthh. wtf, united states. in case you didn't know, your country is OVER. O+V+E+R. you are no longer the ""leaders of the free world"". you're not even close. and hopefully never will be again."
🤣
"The conservative backlash against wokeism, whining protesters, pronouns and genders, critical race theory.
IT IS BRILLIANT!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
This does not end abortion you morons! It goes to the individual states to vote on.
"There’s nothing in the constitution for abortion, SCOTHUS acted properly. And with so many screamers complaining about woman’s rights, where are the rights of the unborn child?"
Thank you Jesus.
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe."
"Blah blah, you know Roe v Wade states that that an Abortion needs to be done before “Viable Life.”  For example, California that is now 24 weeks. That Bill the Evil, Servants of Satan, the Democrats voted for in the House and Senate would have allowed Abortion up to the moment of Birth.  Disgusting, Evil people!"
Rights? You mean right to murder babies?
We can’t kill our kids now!? Dang… smh lol
"There’s a few different aspects of this that deeply disturbs me, there are others which I’m happy to discuss, but the one aspect that does chill me is how we can take away freedoms of what women can do with their own bodies. The other aspect I find deeply disturbing is that 61% of women in the US agree with abortion. Thus the dismantling of Roe v Wade isn’t just eliminating freedom of choice for the individual but also undemocratic. 
Choose to have an abortion or don’t it’s not my choice and shouldn’t be anyone else is choice other than that individual."
Why do all of you pro-death people look like cows with purple hair. I doubt you'll ever have the need for an abortion.
"The United States Supreme Court does not write the laws, it only interprets the constitution.  Nowhere in the Constitution is abortion mentioned as “women’s” rights. It is guaranteed in the Constitution that everyone has the Right To Life (Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness).  That means ALL LIFE!!!"
child-eating tribes-woman as the cover image. typical. taking away the chosen peoples food supply.
"This is so wonderful. Babies now have a chance. 
Love from OZ 🇦🇺"
Thank you Jesus for answered prayer.
What an incredible day for the unborn!
"What is everybody fighting about, you're letting the babies grow up to join gangs anyway so both sides win, and everybody should be happy.                    ................GRIM"
"The Roman Catholic Church has consistently condemned abortion — the direct and purposeful taking of the life of the unborn child. In principle, Catholic Christians believe that all life is sacred from conception until natural death, and the taking of innocent human life, whether born or unborn, is morally wrong. The Church teaches, ""Human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the creative action of God and it remains for ever in a special relationship with the Creator, who is its sole end. God alone is the Lord of life from its beginning until its end: no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being"" (""Donum vitae,"" 5)."
"OK fine, the one in the thumbnail can keep her abortion right, the world doesn't need more looking like that"
"Smas a Brit who lives in North America, can I just apologize for channel 4s massively bias reporting."
This is fantastic news.
They need to pass out XL Magnams!!
you already dismantle children at Robb Elementary
Make Abortion UNTHINKABLE... Roe is dead forever 🔥. Millions of babies will be save now. My body my choice is a lie and evil claim at the cost of killing babies in the wombs.
It is about time they stop letting  murder happen
This going to rile up Pro Choice voters insanely. This is what the Democrats needed to be honest.
I just think to many people all up in everyone's business on what they decide to do with their bodies.. not your business not ur body. pay attention to your own lives no one elses. God is the judge not you!!
They should all duct tape their mouths
now its still for those ladies to start a militia
Cry Liberals! I wanna see those sweet liberal tears. haha!
😂😂😂 people mad they can’t kill babies this world crazy!!!
Feel blessed that this day has come in my lifetime!
woke west lol. Didn't western women declare war on all men? Good luck fighting billions of males worldwide.
LOL at them blaming Trump
American women should move to more progressive and developed nations than the US. The US has become a cesspool of division and narcissism.
"English Channel 4, hahahaha, so left-wing."
I love it when people don't get their way 😁
"What happens if the mother is severely sick, and will die if the baby continues to grow?"
Just move to a state where abortion is legal.   Problem solved.
Always entertaining to see libs cry!
"God this is obnoxious reporting. In Mississippi it is legal to have an abortion up to 15 weeks (although this may be banned now), but in other states like Florida it is 12 weeks. In France it is 14 weeks, in Portugal it is 10 weeks, in Germany it is illegal but still allowed with a loophole until 12 weeks."
Reeeeee
"No one actually understands what this decision is. It is an excellent legal decision.

The whole point is that the SCOTUS is NOT a political institution: Roe v Wade gave people a right that was not legislated. If you want a law, such as ""legalized abortion"" then the proper path is to ask you law maker to pass a law, that involves due process.

Roe v Wade had no due process and yet it performed the function of law making.

the decision simply deemed it improper and ask that if the public wants that right, go and ask your law maker to do it, because the function of SCOTUS is to interpret the law and not making them.

And here are people throwing a big tantrum simply because they heard some people saying they ""overturned the abortion right"" when it is nowhere near that case.

If you want abortion, vote for it, don't ask judges to do a politicians work."
"I find it very difficult to side with a healthy adult women, who has the choice, the power and agency. The unborn has zero choice, has no power, no agency and is totally at the mercy of its mother.."
"it's not your body
 it's a child inside
your womb...  that body is not yours you don't have the right to murder that tender voiceless helpless child!"
Killing someone was never constitutional.
"BIG VICTORY! The baby murderers have been stopped!! Every life is sacred and shall be protected, love prevails!! Praise the Lord!"
Oh well
About time we stop the baby killers
"Between 2010 and 2019 625,346 abortions happened yet 400 children have been killed in school shootings.... I don't see the level of outrage for 1,570 times more children dying in abortion clinics than schools."
These are the same people that say our democracy is in peril. The Supreme Court is our democracy in action and now they don’t like it?
That’s good stop abortion. That’s murder !!! Wake up. It’s your body but the baby is not your body that’s a separate body you have no right to kill it !!!!
In Colorado you can kill your child at 9 months!  You might as well give birth and  strangle your child to death!!
SHUT UP Poopy Pants!!!
Maybe these Vaginas should consider Contraceptives?
Yay trump 2024!!!!
Abortion is not a Constitutional Right!!!
"Your body, your choice ... YOUR RESPONSABILITY."
"Women don’t have the constitutional right to kill their children, time to have some responsibility folks !"
It is time to save life because some of the best people we've ever had in the United States from rape even though rape is wrong and it should never happen don't murder the baby don't murder the mother go after the rapist
When the judge got smart and said well I'm just going to give you choice just like God did you got the choice to be right or you got the choice to kill and you don't have to have a baby to kill birth control is murder each one of us were predestined aided by God read your King James Bible look up this verse he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him
Women rights arnt being stripped away!!!!just the baby rights is being heard.!! Cowards cant see that!! It’s crazy to see elder woman think it’s okay to take a child’s life!!! It’s just crazy to see
At 2:31 That woman is speaking what I’m feeling. This goes beyond abortion this is about women’s rights.
This will be so fun to visit in a year. This is nothing more than fear mongering. Abortions will still be legal in over 90% of all states
God said they'll shall not kill that he wasn't the god of the dead but he was the god of the living that all babies are a miracle from Heaven no matter if it was rape or not
Praise God for Donald Trump and the SCOTUS!
choose what????????? say it!!! choose to kill babies?????
"The scumbags in the media twisting these diluted minds by saying abortion is a constitutional right which it isn't,  they can still murder babies in states that allow it ,this more reason to bring God back in school."
channel 4 news promotes baby killing
the nonsense from this news anchors is incredible. Nobody should have the right to kill babies.
Don't be a Cry Baby. ( Pun intended )
"It's so funny her saying we will not dismember children, em how many kids are dead this year alone due to ur precious guns."
"the baby is not your body, therefore not your choice!!!"
Lol!! More tears than when Trump won!!
"Almost everyone is talking about the right of the woman to terminate her unborn child ""its her body"" and this is the most absurd thing when the child she has managed to conceive deserves  the right to live. If you have ever entered abortion room, and have seen the deadly equipments used to end an innocent life you'll shiver if you have a heart. Abortion is murder."
If you agree with this. I hope you get pregnant against your will. Idc.
This is garbage. There was not Constitutional Right to abortion! This news is deceiving or misleading at best!!
We can barely educate the children we do have
killing babies is not a woman's right. today is a good day!!!
I’m pro life so is god! Why do u think he has given us everlasting life as a free gift? (U must accept it) Because our god is pro life!!
"Oh no ! No more killing babies !
Monkey pox infecting the gays !
Guns are legal ! Thank you Jesus !!!!"
"You pushed it too far you wanted to still kill after  birth 
That's when things went south for you baby killers

 finally common sense is being used 
Liberal tears are like sweet tea 
I can't wait to see a river of tears when we start to abort the women with 3 abortions 
3 strikes your aborted useless to society"
Serious question for pro-choicers- How do you feel about fetal homicide laws?
Why is everyone talking about women again? Where have all the pregnant men gone?
That’s it. I’m joining the Cascadian Independence movement. Washington and Oregon be like: f*ck this sh*t I’m out!
Most of those women have zero danger of ever getting pregnant.
Placards do nothing. Molotovs through their windows create change.
THIS ANCHORWOMAN IS A C You Next Tuesday
I support unborn women rights to life.
Let's keep it real abortion was really made legal because was targeted females of color and  planparenthood was started by a woman who was in the kkk
Biased Channel 4 baby killers. Teach women not to kill babies.
"This is what abortion leads to:  its 2055: ''Artificial Intelligence analyzing the Baby's DNA:....BRRR...BRRRR...analyzing probability of the baby being over 6 feet tall, looking like Johnny Depp and not being bald nor over-weight as an adult....BRRR.....probability: 23%. Woman: ''DAMN! well, i guess i'll abort this one. Maybe i'll have better luck with the next guy''....there MUST be responsibility, otherwise we will be heading towards a society we wouldn't want to live in."
"If abortion is moved to the state we can pick the best president to run USA & not an abortion president like Bill. This has the DEMs TERRIFIED, one of the few things DEMs have is playing abortion card to distract from destroying USA"
A lot of upset baby killers being put out of business a great day in American history indeed.
This gay guy wants to kill babies
Let the accountability start :-)
Imagine wanting rights over other women’s wombs and rights to choose if they want to procreate or not.
"Babies should say ""Goo"".. Not become it! 😁"
"Legalizing abortion is like saying, “I have such strong emotions, that you get to die.” Putting feelings above life itself. A win for the sanctity of life, not the sanctity of your feelings! 06/24/22"
"*_Abortion is murder_*
Simple as that."
"THIS NARRATOR IS SO BIASED!   TAKE YOUR ""POLLS"" AND STICK EM UP YOUR TUNNEL OF A COBWEBBED WOMB."
THANK YOU TRUMP!
America is tweaking
DEMONCRATIC STATES LOVE TO MURDER BABIES.
PRAISE THE LORD!!!!!!!!!!!!
HALLELUJAH!!!!!   MURDER AIN'T A RIGHT!!!!!!
"So let me get this straight:
They ban abortions claiming life is precious and that the unborn babies are innocent, but then won’t change or restrict gun laws that lead to the deaths of innocent school children?
So basically once the child is out the womb it’s fair game. Until then it must be preserved . Have I got that right? Do not claim to value human life if you are willing to let mothers die because they cannot terminate a pregnancy. Why is the mother’s life worth less than her unwanted and undeveloped foetus?"
"this decision was perfect , following the constituion to the T
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.

U.S. Constitution - Tenth Amendment | Library of Congress

and that's EXACTLY what they did . case closed."
Hold it increasing minimum wage creates inflation and devalues skilled workers. Shes off on that part. Women need to gain skills to make more money.
Isn’t it ironic that all the protestors are people that have been born.
"It's just sad. Poor American women, poor America. More oppression from the 'freest country in the world'"
Pro choice in the name of womens rights is counter intuitive. 50 percent of the time they are killing other women.
Dam these losers because they can't kill babies anymore
I haven’t seen Democrats this mad since we took their slaves!
Seeing these monsters cry is outstanding.  No more killing helpless babies
"Alright, it’s official now, Damn women in China actually have more rights for once. It was a right, it’s not like abortion law force everyone to do abortion, if you don’t want to abort then you don’t, let someone else have that choice. You can argue this is a step towards life, but this is definitely a step away from FREEDOM"
"Now women and female children who are r@ped will have to give birth to unwanted babies. It will add to the other many children in systems that are unable to be placed. This will also lead to more maternal deaths.  This is going to create many problems with women going back to using coat hangers to abort pregnancies. Now it has been stated that contraception is next to get stopped. So, if you are a married woman forty and up who still has a menstrual cycle face the risk of getting pregnant or just refusing to be touched by her spouse for fear of getting pregnant. I guess if the men want to be intimate with their wives they will just r@pe her and take the risk of getting her pregnant like they were doing before the 60s. This is just the beginning of taking many rights away from Americans. They took the right for woman to choose without considering the things I just mentioned. They just say any woman who gets pregnant, which is completely wrong. Mostly men made this decision when they are not women and cannot get pregnant even if they are r@ped."
1:29 LOL what's that reaction. It's beyond my comprehension
"please i need to see more liberal tears,   they FUEL MY JOY   =-D"
So all this just so women can travel and get an abortion elsewhere. Or those that can’t afford it get a backstreet operation and put there life at risk? I’m sure that makes all the pro lifers feel better smh. Why force that upon anyone else if your against abortion that’s fine don’t get one but others shouldn’t have that right taken away from them you don’t know the scenario they are in regarding their life!
"What a beautiful day!

DING DONG! Roe v. Wade is dead!

Happy Junetyfourth."
"I like the fight for preservation of life and all. What I don’t like is that their support only extends as far as the baby is born, after that it’s all your problem. This will never work. People who have the means to raise a child but don’t want to for whatever reason, won’t be stopped from terminating the pregnancy. This will only hurt poor people and if ends up succeeding, in a few years time you’ll find yourselves in a very unpleasant situation."
They have the choice to give away to adoption or orphanages. Better yet take birth control seriously. Abortion is murder. Its clear cut.
This is a women's issue!  Only women should be allowed to vote on it.  It was a majority of men who voted to overturn it.  How dare they!!!!
There will be no functioning society if women kill babies for convenience
you all baby killers should stop and listen for a moment.
The women that disagree shouldve been aborted them selves.
"Wow, you mean women will now have to be responsible  accountable for their sexual decisions?!?! 
 No more getting abortions at the last second just so you can continue club hopping instead of taking care of your baby. Lol 😂"
Thank god some women have a body count over ten. They use it as birth control.
This is actually good clearly they haven't been shown what happens to the babies or fetus later . . . #experimentation🧟👩‍🔬🧫
No way the thumbnail has to worry about getting pregnant
Damn he got 3 justices up there?? My guy lol
"If these people had an anthem, it would be this. Also this is a huge overreaction. The right to abortion hasn't been taken away, those powers have simply been handed back to the states. It actually probably works out better that way for them as it now means that it's no longer possible for their precious abortions to be outlawed across the board in the future. 
https://youtu.be/QWE_M0CX9So"
great day!
Why do all the libs look like freaks from the Star Wars Cantina Bar?
Victory for future babies!
"I understand why abortion is wrong and it is, BUT what this means now is that young women who get pregnant will now start killing themselves (either by accident or on purpose)

This overturn will eventually be overturned... 
After a few hundred thousand girls die trying to perform a self given abortion....... Yeah it will again Be a right"
EVIL women killing babies so sad
lol that monster ruth vader is rolling in her grave
And I'm sick of these people saying what if a woman is raped? Yes that's bad but it's worse to kill that baby! Put it up for adoption to a loving family.
WAh!!!!!  😭 I can’t use abortion as birth control!!!!
"Jesus is Lucifer they both stand for ""Free Choice"""
"Murder isn't a civil liberty, and abortion was never a Constitutonal right."
99 years in jail. Are they mad!
"I support banning abortion, not because it's fair, but because it's unfair to women. Yes, that's correct. Women can have their fairness when men get theirs."
Every female that I sleep with is getting pregnant 😈🇺🇸 take that Obama!😈💪🏽🔥
I hope all those pro lifers get raped and get pregnant.
"My body my choice? Wtf! I'm SO SICK of women only thinking about how being pregnant ""inconveniences"" THEM! Thank God it's finally ILLEGAL for women to stop murdering babies."
It wasn't their choice or my choice when it came to the jab and something being stuck inside of me but yet now all of a sudden it's a big deal. F*** you people in your hypocrisy
"""PLEASE LET ME MURDER MY BABY PLEASEEEEE"" lol"
"""Separation of church and state"" is paraphrased from Thomas Jefferson and used by others in expressing an understanding of the intent and function of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution which reads: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...""

Let's ban religion."
"Don't read the comments, save yourself."
June is now Life Month.
Ban abortion or we will not pay child support 💪💪🚫🌈
What is a woman?
As soon as the old people who overturned roe v wade die it will be reinstated as soon as possible a featus isn’t a child until it’s born learn about it it’s not your body it’s not your choice
"How about these Christofascists just F right off. Their position is rooted in their insane religious beliefs, but con outlets won’t tell you that. At least my kids aren’t in a hillbilly red state full of evangelical nutjobs."
Under his eye 😭 gilliad is happening
"If riots happen, then the full weight and power of the government should come crashing down on them. Nowhere in federal or state law does it grant you the right for violent protest. But it also says you can't incite violence, do you hear that, AOC and Maxine Waters?
I am absolutely convinced liberals were deprived of oxygen at birth and then dropped on their heads. I have never seen a group of individuals so delusional and susceptible to coercion in my life."
Disgraceful that the reporter keeps scoffing at the pro-life campaigner.... Bias reporting at its finest
A majority of those women seen crying here probably don’t have any intention of having children. They are just a bunch of radical authoritarian NWO feminazis
Roe verses Wade... I thought that was how Mexicans got here.. Wow!! The reality.....
Don't be a fool...Wrap your tool!
"There they go!  The leftie liberals freak out!  Live with it, baby murderers, you won't be murdering 850,000 children next year, like you do every year, you evil b~stards.."
I liked it when America didn't behave like the Taliban.
My body my choice....unless 💉
"If such a majority of people was against the overturning, why so many states banned abortion right after? Is this news or just another media attempt to shadow the true positions of the majority?"
This isn’t going to stop abortions it’s just going to stop the safe ones so many women are going to die from abortions in alley ways
"I don’t understand,doesn’t just mean that right leaning state will ban it and left leaning state it will be allowed and maybe subside it .Is it just political Theatre?"
"Yet Biden won’t end the filibuster. Democrats are feckless. Obama could’ve codified Row v Wade when he had a mandate.
And WTF is a ‘progressive’ anti abortion organization? That’s an oxymoron."
"Women have the right to do what they want with their body !!
WRONG ❌ ! 
When a life is conceived inside the womb, then its not only that mothers property ,but its baby's property as well as  it's dad's (sperms donner ) property. 
Its like an Embassy which is located in host country ,but ownership and responsibilities are shared ."
Bunch of cry babies
A happy day but the 👹 wont sleep !!!
So let's still overpopulate the world with even more kids that are not wanted. GENIUS idea 😠
Women have rights to be supported and cared for in pregnancy ❤️
1st it's a new gun law now abortion rights. America is going backwards. Next the Ku Klux Klan will be running for office.
How long will it take for Planned Parenthood to get on the phone to states like Texas and load up planes with public school girls to wisk them off to the nearest butchering state during school hours without their parents' consent but with the full cooperation of the schools?  (λεσβοομοηδονικα)
https://youtu.be/Q8kocfIkg2o
It his disgusting a woman has no right to abort a baby if she doesn’t won’t it we’re are they human rights to be honest I wouldn’t never date a woman who as child or two with different men why men like me go to work 5 or 6 days a week to feed someone else’s B child that’s what they are
If your body your choice… what about a mandatory vaccination?
"It is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live as you wish.
-Mother Teresa"
I don’t really care about rights and all that but I don’t understand how people wanna protest abortion was illegal while consuming animals are not. How do babies in the stomach with no limbs and the brains are not even developed have the choice to live but not animals that never really endanger us?
Life is precious… ❤️
First more guns now abortion abolished. America is so broken.
"Great news for the unborn 
Thank you America lead the way.."
"Shut up Brit, ya’ll have problems of your own. And what you meant to say was “this time the Supreme Court decided to expand states’ rights”"
"Just remember, these are the same nuts who would cry if they saw a cat being mistreated yet react this way when they hear they can't kill children. Shocking how these people act and shows what conditioning does."
Best news in years
Amusing
Yay 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
America has fallen into madness. This is a sign of worse things to come..
This amazing 😍❤️ baby got voice no more munders hallelujah hallelujah 🙏😍
This guy is the reason Hollywood stars and California people are moving to Austin Texas
Abortion was never a Constitutional right. Morons.
the left is finally able to define a woman
This beautiful praise God 🙏🙏 blessings and peace 🕊️🕊️ this amazing thank you Jesus 🙏🙏
Women's rights? What is a woman?
"If , as the lady says , we are going to make a more life affirming culture they could start with the headless ,corpse children in Texas.
Could ya stop that from happening ?
Well , at least we can all carry a concealed weapon now.
This is like the hunger games and handmaid's tale franchises merged ."
"If it's your body and choice, men should not pay child support."
Nothing like biased reporting
Great news
This is very biased reporting
we stay smoking that roe pack
I mean what are these Karens cheering for? It's not like anyone is forcing them to get an abortion... How does this impact their lives besides the fact that they now have their inane religious beliefs imposed on everyone else?
Close your legs !!!
"Why is the court pouring gasoline on the division in this country .
Are they purposely trying to start a civil war ?
Are they so religously delusional that they think they are going to usher in the second coming of Christ ?
They lied under oath .
Thomas's wife is involved with trying to overthrow the government and her husband has unlimited power over our lives .
What's wrong with this picture ?"
God is good. Amen.
"No more my body my choice for women, its time to enforce my wallet my choice for men and give men the option for default custody"
The child deserves the choice to live!
wtf is wrong with these people? FOR THE WOMAN IN TEXAS RIGHT NOW I NEED YOU TO STAY STRONG. YOUR GOVERNMENT OBVIOUSLY IS IN SHAMBLES AND IM SO SO SORRY YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THIS. LET ABORTION BE LEGAL DONT FORGET THE UNDERAGED RAPED WOMAN. HAVE YOU IMBECILES LOST IT? HAVE YOU FUCKING LOST IT? HAVE YOU LET TEXAS BECOME A BREEDING HOME FOR RAPISTS AND PEDOPHILES?
But killing to protect yourself is OK - self defense is OK. Carrying a gun is OK. But abortion is murder? The math isn't mathing. The USA is a mess.
#voteblue #VoteBlueToSaveDemocracy #VoteBlueToProtectAllOfOurRights #VoteBlueToProtectWomen
It good. no to evil messed up people who kill there own kids
Say no to abortions
A lot of states want to ban abortion. The majority of the U.S. population are in populated cities where they are going let abortion continue like California and New York. Places like Texas and Florida want to ban abortion because the Majority of the population want to outlaw it. So it was a good job by the majority of justices in the SCOTUS to give the rights to the states.
Donald Trump ! Praise God for him …..
Just think twice before you sleep around .
If you think this only affects abortion you are naive my friend. This is so much bigger than that it goes into right of privacy. Just read the damn case!!!
Unwanted pregnancy ? Safe haven laws dumbass !
Her body….. my choice.
Its going to backfired pro life warriors!!!
"HEAR YE HEAR YE……..HARLOTS, you now must keep your legs “closed”."
"Roe v Wade was a bad legal decision. This does not mean abortions are not illegal they are determined by the local communities. This is a win for civil rights. The Dems just want power at the federal level, like good socialists.

They can't afford to drive to another state but can afford repeated abortions?"
liberal tears keep em coming 🤣🤣
In india and china women are aborted 100 to 1 is that ok?
Who needs ISIS or the Taliban if you got home brew ayatollah's from the US supreme court
They can just go to dem states to kill their babies. The presenter is almost suggesting that women will be using coat hangers to abort. That's not the case at all
"Refuse to restrict gun control to save the lives of children being murdered in schools. Yet, happy to restrict women's rights over thier own body to apparently ""save children's lives""..what a joke of a country, the backbone of this policy is on religious grounds...a fictional book written over 2000 years ago. The self proclaimed "" land of the free""..the USA is nothing more than a social experiment gone badly wrong."
If all the pro choic protesters were aborted...there would be no problem
Pro-life fatso is pulling the wool over the viewers’ eyes.Conservatives care a hoot about people and her suggesting that there will be redeemable work done to help families and women out is hot and stale air.
"To all celebrating and flooding the comments with this trolling BS, you’re genuinely disgusting.

This has nothing to do with any serious  legal thinking it has all to do with the justices personal opinion guised in legal opinion. abortion has a lot more elements to it than just a straight abortion. But I won’t even sit here and explain them because you all don’t care, you just want to control women and since you’ve won you can stop acting like it’s about anything other than that."
"they should use all contraception instead of just  aborting , it will make the women think more.... the state may be  trying to increase there child population as the numbers must  be low due to all the abortions."
Well ladies and gentlemen. It took him nearly 35 years but Mitch McConnell has finally “Borked” Biden. And all ON HIS WATCH too. OUCH!
👏👏👏👏
The party of death is dying. This is glorious!
baby rights now!!
why do they scream to kill babies?
"I’m appalled at horrific transphobic slurs being yelled in the streets by masses of bigoted transphobes.  Men can give birth too and being a woman is a constellation.   They are erasing the existence of a horribly marginalized community.  Why can’t they be outraged over the rights of “birth giving persons”?  This is transphobia on a level we have never seen before.  This hate should not be left unchecked.  Arrest these protestors for mass bigotry.  The hate just cannot be left unchecked or be allowed in any way, shape or form!  I’m so F’ING outraged at the hate that I have found myself in an uncontrollable rage!"
Shame on you for this biased reporting. I’m pro life ☝🏿
What sort of garbage biased reporting is this?
A whole lotta girls gonna be takin it in the butt now! 😆
Liberals crying in the comments 😂
There is no right to murder.
"First the decision on Bearing Arms and now this ""Roe V Wade"" decision, there's a big shift happening 😬 

*Edit:* I presume you guys have heard of the 10 Year Old victim who had to cross state lines to get abortion help? And the laws being written up to make that movement more difficult?"
Trump is the man
"Damn, killing babies is meat and drink to some women…"
killing babies is liberty?
"Ahh yes, further proof murica is a theocracy masquerading as a democracy, moving into a full blown totalitarian theocracy. This is about NOTHING but control of women in society by implementing a minority bullsht ideology onto society, spitting on the first ammendment itself! 
Soon it will be ban all contraception, ban all LGBT relationships and then ban all mixed race kids. If they can force a ban on abortions then they can also force abortions on mixed race kids.
Also, want to know how these ""christians"" have NEVER read their evil book or know NOTHING about their religion? 
Going against their imaginary sky daddys ORDERS while claiming they ""know"" what saod sky daddy wants: ""god"" is the most aborticidal monster in all of fiction lol.

Life begins at birth with the FIRST BREATH (gen 2:7).
Fetuses are not persons (ex 21::22-25).
Fetuses should be aborted as proof of aldultery (numbers 5:11-31).
Life is not sacred ( Deuteronomy 28: 18-24).
God will rip open pregnant mothers (2 kings 8:12)
God will kill unborn fetuses (isaiah 13:18).
God will dash infants to pieces and rip open pregnant women(Hosea 13:16)"
"Abortions in states with trigger laws aren't going to stop by the way. Well done for endangering the lives of so many women who will now be forced to resort to dangerous methods - the women who can't afford to travel to other states are more likely to be minority ethnic. So much for the ""first black"" Supreme Court Justice who has now made a grossly damaging decision for his own community."
"My body, my choice...when it comes to anything related to COVID-19, right!"
Great day for democracy.  Let the will of the people in individual states decide what is appropriate.
This is brilliant. What the USA needs is more guns and more unwanted children.
Is there real journalism anymore? The commentator is so biased. What a joke.
"Only promiscuous and evil people supports abortion, thank God that good defeated evil."
"Yeeee!  What a win for this country! !!
Proud to be an American! Just in time for July Fourth ! 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲"
Perform your own abortion then. Poor doctors.
I wish Biden didn't call himself RC.
Killing babies are not a right
"man is not intangible by the fact that he lives. An animal would also be entitled to such a right, insofar as it, too, is living [...] Man's life remains inviolable because he is a person [...] Being a person is not a psychological, but an existential datum: fundamentally, it depends neither on age, nor on the psychological condition, nor on the gifts of nature with which the subject is endowed [...]. Personality may remain below the threshold of consciousness -- as when one is asleep -- yet it remains and we must refer to it. Personality may not yet be as developed as when one is a child, yet from the beginning it demands moral respect. It is even possible that personality in general does not emerge in acts because the psycho-physical prerequisites are lacking, as happens to the mentally ill [...] And finally, personality may also remain hidden as in the embryo; but it is given from the beginning in him and has its rights. It is this personality that gives men their dignity. It distinguishes them from things and makes them subjects [...] one treats a thing as if it were a thing when one possesses it, uses it, and eventually destroys it-or said for human beings-kills it. the prohibition against killing human beings expresses in the most acute form the prohibition against treating them as if they were a thing.""

Romano Guardini"
Good day for America !!! If woman say their body their choice than make the right choices.
Stop lying about what this ruling means for women! This is being used to divide and segregate Americans more than they already are! It has not made abortion illegal period. It has never been illegal. Thus simply means women cannot use it as birth control on demand! Responsible women use birth control to prevent pregnancy. There is no need to have an abortion unless the mother's life is in danger or other serious things like incest or rape. Be responsible and stop making unwanted babies! Grow up! And it is a lie that the majority of Americans want abortion to remain used as birth control. The majority believe it is wrong to offer abortion on demand for any trivial reason. Why can't you be responsible?
STATE RIGHTS just got EXPANDED. And yes. Being Born is a Human Right.
Abortion was forced on states. They used the courts to circumvent the people. The court simply gave the people the power back. Leftist are only screeching because they used a legal loophole instead of doing things correctly.
"PRAISE God Almighty!!!!!!!  Exodus 20:13 - Thou shalt not kill.....Proverbs 6:16-19 These six  the Lord hates, Yes, seven  an abomination to Him:  A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil, A false witness  speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren....Psalm 127:3 Behold, children  a heritage from the Lord, The fruit of the womb  a reward."
"I am gonna buy billions of dollars worth of popcorn 
























This is going to be interesting"
When a gun is more protected then women
"Killing a baby is not a right, it's just women being idiots and not using contraceptives."
The Taliban won.
"The SCOTUS is not intended to back the will of the majority. Their job is to uphold the constitution, which what they did with this decision."
"Such dishonest framing. The Supreme Court didn’t take away a right here, unless you think brown v board took away the right to attend segregated schools or to ride on segregated public transportation. If anything the court expanded the right to not be brutally murdered in the womb"
That’s not right there’s women that get raped an now there saying they have to keep the baby what a terrible day in America women deserve that choice
"3:24 - A constitutional right that's been in place for half a century.

It was *never* a constitutional right. That's precisely why the SC ruling was overturned. The tenth amendment is quite clear on this issue."
Murder is not a fundamental right sorry try again you people are absolutely out of your f****** minds this has nothing to do with women's health just about spreading your false narratives we've had enough and it's going to stop trust me on that! You are all absolutely wicked
President Trump is a great man. He is the author of this great progress. A pillar of hope in the fight against degeneracy. Absolutely wonderful!
Check out all the irresponsible chicks that think it’s oppression to wear a condom or keep your legs close who also think they are the ONLY women. Dirt bags always think they are the only true humans. Did they see all those other women rejoicing?
"There's nothing in the constitution about abortion, its the correct ruling.    Now individual states can make their own laws, there's nothing wrong with that, everyone needs to chill out."
I know American media sucks but sounds like it’s worse in Britain. More than half the country supports a 15 week abortion ban and 45-50% support a 6 week ban. The United States was a huge outlier in allowing elective abortions for 24 weeks
Good news!
"Right honey, you want a bunch of old men in your state legislature to have control of womens' bodies. I think you may need to be placed in a highly structured enviornment."
It’s a shame women can’t choose to terminate their baby out of convenience.
Great day for human life.
Happy to kill to protect Happy to protect to kill right ✅
"Tje Justices who voted in favor of this, should be dragged to a gallows and hung in public."
"The best thing america has done in a long time. However you put it, regardless the circumstances  scientifically, abortion is murder. As simple as that. Everyone is here to defend women but no one wants to defend a foetus who will do everything to survive. Watch some videos by Ben Shapiro on abortion and listen to some ex abortion doctors."
Thank you President Trump and SCOTUS!! 63 million aborted babies salute you!!
TRUMP STILL WINNING!!!!!!!!
Cry yourselves to sleep libs
"Great day for ProLifers, White women have the highest number of abortions in America. In a declining white population this measure will increase their numbers, I’m sure the SC is aware of this."
So who is going to tell the reporter that abortion is not a constitutional right?
We need to help the pregnant women get thru the pregnancy and be able to make the choice wether or not she can care for the child instead of taking the easy out of murder...
"Why is she so afraid? All she has o do is:

A. Keep her legs closed
B. Use correct and effective contraception

Somehow, I think they just WANT to kill babies."
God bless America
I love the thumbnail pic!
infringement of privacy
God says abortion is murder. Do you think you know more than God?
This is what you get when u elect people like trump. What if he get backs to power? Then good luck with ur democracy
America is fucked up
"This is home of Sarah, notice anything? 
Sarah told her partner to cum inside her in the heat of passion and is 5 month’s pregnant. Sarah was hoping to get an abortion when she got around to it despite her partner’s objections. But now thanks to row v Wade being over turned she must now travel 2 hours interstate to kill the fetus."
Woman don't want to have a kid lean how to swallow.
"Dred Scott and Plessy vs. Fergusson preceded this decision, but sounds like she's from the UK."
Funny how most of these baby killing bitches look ugly and fat !!! 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"A lot of men will dump and run now, so be prepared to be single mom after one nightstand"
How do you defend women's rights when you can't answer what a woman is?
0:34 which part of the constitution was that again?
"The USA is not a single huge state, we are 50 states where each state makes its own laws.  I'm sure liberal states will approve unrestricted abortion while conservative states make it for medical reasons only.  R vs W infringed on fathers' rights never taking into consideration the fathers' right to a child that is half his.  This decision returns the power to the states where it belongs."
Biden can’t even protect baby formula or tampons.  And he sure does not protect this country.  Biden is a goner going down hill faster and faster and it shows.  Loser ville crime family Bidens
"It’s not about women’s rights 🤔 the White population of America is declining steeply. This is the revise of China’s one child policy, don’t get fooled by the smoke about women rights 😆 America is going to be a Black and Brown Spanish speaking nation in the next 100 years if the don’t act."
This ruling doesn't make abortion illegal just goes back to the states now if you're state makes it illegal there's a problem
Just look at this pro-abortion crowd. What are they woried about? The only way that these hags will get pregnant is by artificial insemination.
How will the forced births be enforced?
Abortion is not a right. Period
"So let me know if I’m wrong (English btw) but has the court made it ok for states to make abortion illegal basically?



If that’s the case, why do they still have gun licenses? They shouldn’t be a thing imo and guns shouldn’t be sold to the public"
Satan punching air right now.
I can't believe the insensitivity of every news channel and media outlet! NO ONE has even mentioned the GRAVE impact this is having on transwomen's right to an abortion 🤔🙄🤣
"Glory Almighty forevermore in Jesus Christ name Amen Father Thank you for everything in Jesus Christ name Amen Father Thank you for providing and protection, May the Most High have mercy on us, beautiful day today, in Jesus Christ name Amen 🙏🕊🐑❤👏🥰👏🥰👏👏🙏❤☺👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👍🙏🙏🙏🙏🕊🕊🕊🕊🕊🙏🙏🙏🙏"
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY WON'T BAN FREAKING ASSAULT WEAPONS BUT WANT TO FORCE PEOPLE TO HAVE BABIES. LET'S TURN THE TABLES ON MEN AND CONTROL THEIR BODIES AND SEE HOW THEY LIKE IT
Boohoohoo now we can't act like a bunch of prostitutes 😭😭😭
Meanwhile downtown at Walmart you can't buy a knitting needle or a bottle of gin for love nor money...
Abortion is not a woman's right. Abortion is murder. Stop making up lies. When has murder ever been a right.
"The BBC also spent a lot of time interviewing the red-haired, green-scarfed pro-abortion activist. Couldn't they find any other pro-abortion activists of actual child-bearing age?"
Ahahha beautiful
This man talking from Texas seems to me that he can take a nife and kill a babe
So.... about the rape victims?
Just when I think America can’t be more retarded they do this.
But isnt it democratic to make it an issue you can vote on locally?
"Sit the f down for abortion rights. Abortion banned completely and without apology. 
 We will erase even the memory of Roe. Every copy of Roe will be ripped from the books and be burned, while even mentioning Roe will be punishable by death. The whole world will never know that it ever even happened."
DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS....................BUT THEY CANT EVEN DEFINE WHAT A WOMAN IS 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴..
What about the baby's right to a life?
"Seems reasonable. Instead of judges in robes issuing laws and decrees from on high, pass laws back to the states and let the people decide for themselves through their elected politicians. I'm sure you'd rather that than a SCOTUS that decided it was going to be illegal across the nation to have abortions... It's the most democratic way of doing it. Face it; it's just not a constitutional right. It never was. Roe V Wade got smashed through on shaky grounds, even RBG agreed. Leftists have been panicking for 50 years about this because they knew full well as soon as the SCOTUS was dominated by Constitutionalists rather than activists Roe v Wade would be overturned. That's why they've frothed at the mouth over Trump - they've been looking over their shoulders getting away with it for decades.

It's the same as if you wrote a garbage essay at school. The noob teacher without a mark scheme gave you an A thinking it was brilliant. Then there was an audit of the essays and an experienced teacher with the mark scheme gave you a C. It's a mere correction.

People need to chill out about what it is to have 'rights'. You don't have a right to someone else's resources or services. You don't have an inherent right to a doctor's time, expertise, drugs or treatments. I find it funny the exact same crowd who were, a couple of months ago (and even now) have been literally forcing people on pain of losing their livelihoods to take unproven vaccines are now all about bodily autonomy. The hypocrisy stinks to high heaven."
Biased much here lol. Thank God for 1776.
The pro life woman is ridiculous.  She won't answer a single question.
Thank God!
Women are going to leave red states. Mark my words.
"What “right to abortion”?
Is that wording in the Constitution?
The “right” to murder a defenseless, unborn baby?
That’s a “right”? 😐"
Black peoples are the ones that suffer the most because of abortion
A victory for democracy .
"Channel4's biasness on full display. The only thing the supreme court did was to give back the regulation of abortion back to the people and their elected representatives, instead of just letting the federal government do it for them. This ruling basically said no to big government overreach"
this segment is absolute bullshit
more kids to be born to be shot at school
Thank u Trump for fighting for what is Constitutionally right!! 💪💪
“All we want is to terminate kids….is that much to ask?” - some Leftist
Best day of my life
They should exercise their rights by keeping their legs crossed.
I really enjoy how seething mad that reporter in the first part is! 😁🤣
"The court has decided that it is the State's power to enact abortion laws and not that of the Supreme Court. The ruling doesn't abolish abortion. It only gives states the power to decide the laws. AND the court consists of women, and black people. so shut your mouth"
"Leave all the the unwanted babies on the steps of the Supreme Court. 'You wanted us to have them, you fucking raise them.'"
"Norma mccorvey alias roe v wade she was roe, she no longer living. Abortions clinic were only in low income area why is that because women in low income more likely get pregnant more due to protection. How sad to abort babies up to time of birth that is under the case of murder babies in the womb know and feel the death and then they sale the baby parts for money. That evil
God forgive all sin except rejection of his son Jesus. Having aboration is not the answer God is the answer. We as women won't go threw the full term because of having a big belly cant afford  the child its not the baby fault it we as women who just dont care. Remember God loves all."
Happy to see possible future murderers crying 😊
"Last time I checked, it takes two people to make a baby, only one of them a woman. It amazes me how blind America is to call abortion rights an exclusively female issue..."
0:24 dude was so happy 😁
Cold blooded murder - Guns don't kill abortionists DO
"Any of these people preaching for the right to kill a baby need to look up serial killer Dr. Kermit Gosnell the abortionist who killed thousands of babies! He would literally induce labor and snip the spinal cord of a living babies, he did this thousands of times!"
I HAVE 3 WORDS FOR THOSE ‘JUDGES’  “YOU DISGUST ME” 🤬
Crying because you can't kill a baby. Imagine.
I live hearing the sqealing of demons who love death of the innocent
pro choice women on the video does not suffer the risk of needing an abortion anyway
"Get this British lady out of here, do news on your own country"
"Oh how i look forward the next generations of unwanted children that have no morals or principles  running amok,eventually robbIng people for $2 and a buscuit.all the disabled children that have live on the system and hand outs.putting a strain on medical supplies
Also i like how this was almost perfectly timed as the Jan 6 hearings are wrapping up....here come the dogs and ponies"
Thank God Roe has been turned over to the states. 60 million innocent children have been murdered. May Roe be destroyed forever just as slavery was abolished.
Amazing how the same people who can not define “woman” are all about “womens’ rights” now. LOL
"All this behavior is still illegal, and will work the opposite way to what you deranged people plan. Your version of ""democracy"" is that whenever you get what you want it works and all is well, whenever not you riot like animals. Well, not anymore. You're losing, in case you hadn't noticed. Riot away, you filthy animals. 50 years of murdering babies and dehumanizing anyone who disagrees with your insane views like champs, all up in smoke."
"This is an example of the outrageous harms which religions can achieve.  
If your someone rapes you,. how do you explain that to a child which you are now legally bound to have.? what if it's a familly member who rapes you ?
what if having a child kills the mother?
It's is a persons right to determine what happens to their person. 
Religions are blind to the logic and have no concerns for life when they are supporting warfare between nations."
unbiased channel 4 .... the result if you have state media
"""Baby. Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff in Roe v. Wade, never had the abortion she was seeking. She gave her baby girl up for adoption..."""
"The Supreme Court, whose job it is to protect civil liberties, just extended those liberties to unborn babies."
Sleepy Joe complaining about trump had me laughing!!  🤣
Abortion was never constitutional. It was simply a federal guarantee.
Oh no lefties can't murder babies
"Don't these pro-abortionists wonder why there's not an issue with plastic surgeons, hair stylists, etc.? That's changing your body...The reason is those acts don't involve another human life. A woman still has the right to choose a condom, birth control, abstinence, adoption, etc.... Abortion is not birth control."
Hallelujah the Lord has spoken... 50 years of killing babies is finally over.... I'm so glad I live in a red state that's gonna overturn it as soon as next week
"I detectd extreme bias from the presenter towards the pro-lifer with snorts of disdain when she speaks, seems like the presenter has something in her own past...."
Hoes mad
The journalist is disgusting
"When is the red dresses and white hats coming in then, i cant imagine it be too soon. :S"
The death decree curse over America...HAS BEEN BROKEN!!!
"This is not about women rights. It's about teaching, Man and women to be responsible. It's not ok to have a hot steamy night, and think its ok if i get pregnant ill have an abortion. Be more responsible!"
"I really hope Australia criminalises abortion, no one should have a right to murder the innocent."
"We Missed Our On-Ramp

In 2016 we missed our on-ramp - the one that would have taken us onto a new plateau of democracy.
Imagine if, after the election, we had been watching a gathering of the likes of Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Justin Trudeau, and Hillary Clinton. Imagine if we had no Brexit, no Donald Trump, and a gagged and hog-tied Vladimir Putin. Imagine how most of us would have felt with the Trumpians, Putinites, and an assortment of other white and Christian nationalists and petty dictators left to lick their wounds and complain about the American political system.
But instead, we picked a side road that took us down dark and dirty paths where no self-respecting human being and no proud American should want to go. And even though the election of Joe Biden gave us new hope, a world of corruption is still laughing in its beer at us and plotting to take us down the road to perdition as fast as it can, and no one seems to be doing what we need to do to stop it.
Perhaps the whirlpool we are swirling in now is one we deserve. Maybe it was our karmic fate that we should make such a grave error in judgment. But when a large portion of the nation does not vote and a third of the country votes to sink the ship of state and then attacks our Capitol building, what can the rest of us do but wring our hands, pull our hair, and weep for the folly of our fellow Americans and what we know we may have lost?
Hillary, oh Hillary, we left you twisting in the wind, and all that many of us could do was blame you for our sins.
Woe is a people who do not recognize what is good for them or see the path they should take to an open road of freedom and wellbeing for all, and instead follows a path to anger, resentment, hate, and possibly the ultimate death of their republic.
Hillary Clinton said that we are stronger together. Trump said that we need a wall to be safe. Walls do not make us safe, they divide us and make us cowards. Walls do not make us great, they make us weak. Walls do not protect us, they make shadows for us to hide in until the walls come tumbling down and we’re exposed for who we are.
And who are we? Is Donald Trump who we are? Or was he just an aberration? If he was just an aberration and doesn’t represent who we are, and if, as Hillary said, we're stronger together, then it is past time for us to show who we are.
If the true vision of America and what it means to be an American does not include the likes of Donald Trump, then we had better straighten up our backbones and do what we need to do to permanently ban this imposter and interloper from the People’s House and send him and his ilk to the exits, before the infestation he brought to it returns to destroy us all.
Then we will be back on the road that will take us to the on-ramp that leads to where we belong as a free people in a truly democratic republic.

Why is the crazy host biased to killing babies

"Why abort when you can shoot them in schools? America, you now officially have more in common with the countries you fought against. Well done."
"I think it’s a difficult ruling to make , I get both sides of the augment! But there are times when abortion is needed,
When the woman is raped
When the foetus is severely disabled 
When the women my die
When the girl is too young
When the baby won’t survive 
The fetus is innocent but there’s always grey areas and exceptions."
"Back to federalism.
Just as the Founding Fathers intended.
God Bless this Supreme Court"
divide and conquer... we are all be played and we are falling for it
50 years of women’s  rights still remain.
Land of the free huh 🤔
Look at these children of the Devil BAWLING because they can't legally murder unborn black babies!
"Why is this channel defending murder ? I thought you were better than that. I am pro choice people can do whatever they wish the government has no business in that decision. 

This ruling does not outlaw abortion but puts it in the hands of states and the people where it should be"
Oh dear! What a biased report! Why can’t Ch 4 report it in a balanced way? the anger of the interviewer was so unprofessional.
"The Supreme Court didn't take the rights away, you never had it.

Stay out of our Politics or we will interfere in yours
Fucking idiots 🤦‍♂️
"This has nothing to do with a country caring about the life of unborn children, especially when they have no problem ending the lives of blk children. This is about a particular race birth rate declining and the fear of becoming a minority. Their plan to mainly terminate the lives of blk babies backfired, and started working against them."
"Those comments are useless and insulting to the economy of United States. Americans homeless as reach to all times higher than the western world….. and nobody wants to hire anyone….. how much can owners pay for minimum wages…. Those people don’t have common sense…. Minimum wages should be much lower than to $ 7. Dollars per hrs. Instead that this capitalist system increases the minimum wages and shots down the industry and put people into the streets. And those Successful capitalist moves to a Philippines Indonesia India China Vietnam. And manufacturing those materials were labor is 3 dollars per day….. great disfunction system that Americans have created. And still want to increase the minimum wages.
That wrong. And Americans society needs to start to manufacture in this country."
Nothing and I mean nothing is more disgusting than a liberal progressive white woman
"Thank you God
Thank you God
Thank you God...no more killing babies and murdering unborn babies!!!"
Great news! Baby murderers on suicide watch. 🤣
Abortion will always exist in one way or another. It's noone's first choice. All this does is drive it underground and make it less safe for the (in most cases vulnerable) women involved.
63 million killed since Roe.

So in Texas you will get up to 99 years in jail for having an abortion so if a woman was god forbid raped how many years would the guy 1 to 20 years max come on woman deserve better their body their choice just like it goes for men
I don’t know why channel 4 news thinks we care what’s happening in America? Can you please address the Rwanda immigration plan and when the next flight is taking the refugees? Now that’s real news. Put the Uk first!
Channel 4 news is bullshit fake news.
"The right and privilege of driving have to be licensed to certify eligible and competent drivers for the safety of others. The institution of marriage has a very similar function: a commitment to posterity that should not be degraded.
The primal instincts of procreation are a very powerful force. Otherwise, the species won't survive. And there needs to be an enormous amount of direct responsibility and personal investment, by every generation, to socialize and develop those little new barbarians to join the civilized society.
Another way around the abortion issue:  
Alternate enforcement of personal responsibility is done with the implantation of long-term contraceptives at puberty of both sexes unless a bond is posted that pays for an ""accident."" This performance bond insurance would provide financial support in the event of a divorce which would be costly for high-risk people. There would be a provision of parental liability for serious parental malpractice: substance abuse during pregnancy, liability for deciding the gender of the progeny that later feel enormous regret.
No need to kill proto-humans."
Soo it’s un democratic to let State’s decide??? If the people vote in a state not to have abortion then it’s just democracy!!!
Accountability is finally here ☺️
"In the animal kingdom, 95% of animals don't even kill their own young.
These people are lower than animals.
How sad. How deranged. How pathetic."
"""THOU SHALT NOT KILL, ONE OF GOD'S COMMANDMENTS,"
"Upset by loosing a right to kill a baby,,those people are so stupid and sick."
"People get upset when  we talk about the holocaust  , wake up you liberals  , abortion  is a holocaust  , praise God it is finally  coming to a end"
It never was a constitutional right 👍🏻
"Look at these looney lefty cry babies, go home you are pathetic. So glad with this decision, GOD is Good❤️🙏🙌🛐👏👏👏👏👏👏🎉😴😴🍾🙏🙏❤️👏👏👏"
Bahahahaha leftist melt down
A momentous day in American history
This is a non issue for responsible people...
It’s not a RIGHT to kill your baby.🤣
"The ignorant celebrate; believing +funds for mothers /BBs are avail w/out Roe. Nonsense. 🐗Pigs have more rights & gov subsidies than women, mothers & infants. Oddly, guns have more rights than ALL."
Lol the girl with tape over mouth. She thinks that isn't a good thing? Nobody wants to listen to her crying.
"You lost people, cope and concede God has won this day!"
"Yey devolution and more democracy! Now people can vote for what abortion laws they want in their state!
This is democracy! ❤️"
"These people who wanted Roe v Wade overturned are stupid. Abortion will not be abolished, all that will happen is that women will end up having illegal abortions and risking their lives."
"Just to remind you, America was exponentially better off socially, mentally, economically and even in health back in 1970s.

So when these people try to paint the picture of ""regression"" it's actually the opposite. This is a progressive decision."
We're going backwards all the way to Idiocracy.
"Millions of lives destroyed! You say you want the baby to live yet when the baby is born what will you do to help it. There’s plenty of people out their who are not only ready, but can die giving birth. You say adoption saves lives yet you haven’t adopted. You say put them in foster care yet you have no idea how hard and cruel the system is to childern. There are KIDS KIDS who have been sexually abused and assaulted and who are being forced FORCED to undergo the pain of child birth. Ya know this is just all ok until it comes to you. Until all this happens to YOU. And you would look back and want to change your decision about Abortion. But you can’t. It’s not about the baby. It’s about being controlled by not only a government but men."
"So ironic, the land of freedom lacking of what made them so big. Incredibly sad for this new, I'm glad my country has legal free abortion up to the 24th week."
Weird peoples
The crying faces make my heart so happy!
I’m dying to know what the Brits have to say about this 😂
"Is incredible how much rage is out there, if women doesn’t want a child simply use the precious…. Or if somehow they change their mind….simply use the day after pill 💊 that is available in all the country…. But still the ruling of today by the supreme courts is protecting women rights for 12 weeks after women become pregnant…. And still not enough for those privileges woman’s .
Yes United States 🇺🇸 is returning to the 70 s 
And I’m glad that this is happening , during the 70 s Americans had cultures and morals values…. Took 50 years for the court to recognize and recover from this past 50 years…. Great day for Americans and great day for the greatest president of United States, Donald Trump. May God’s bless Donald Trump and the Americans who’s enforce the law."
".... So politicians are deciding what a women should do with her life, health, mind and body?"
“Flesh tax on the poor” what the actual f*ck does that even mean?
Biased reporting
"Oh its Trumps fault--what a joke--abortion rights were never voted in by the people. BRAINWASHING--No more miracle makeup for those Drag Queens using aborted baby body parts, no more Natural Flavors in foods with Baby Cloned Kidney parts."
"“50 years worth of women’s rights _[sic]_ in America overturned in an instant.”

And _245 years_ of slaveowner “rights” were overturned when the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865.

Your point??"
Something unites all those protesting on both sides of the argument.  They weren’t aborted.
"I'm not even against abortion but you were ok with handing over bodily autonomy last year with experimental injections, did you think things would always go your way? You called it 'freedumb' I believe"
0:40 pick me moment
Is this the land of the free? 👀
How does it abolish right to privacy>????!!!!
"Religion should not play a part in politics. Too many people use it as justification without actually thinking about it properly. Abortions should be a choice. Some situations should call for it without hesitation. Some situations, maybe there needs to be some sort of consequences to both parties involved, make other people think twice."
Praise the Lord
How many of these confused women would give their life to save a child?  BABIES LIFE IN--MURDER IS OUT
LOL the pro choice person is a dude.......
Another sick backward step !  A woman’s right to choose !!!!  Evil religious right   Believing in God is beyond Delusional 🙏🙏
Increase in backstreet illegal abortions. Sad
I don't know why any of these historical pro choice women are even concerned. It's highly unlikely that any man would dare get anywhere close for them to be at risk of getting pregnant.
"Loudest voice is those who BORN
#iwant2killbaby"
"Praise Jesus!!! 

All those who support abortion shoul'd repent before the wrath of God fall on them."
"Yes this is the same as segregation, you all are delusional. Segregation is bad, so is killing a baby."
Get y’all’s tubes tied God bless the unborn innocent
"Typical humanity in a nutshell. 

Youngsters taking part in a protest where they find it trendy to go along with opinions on a matter they have never experienced for themselves.

Highly religious comments about how God's word has been spoken in its truest form. A victory for the will of Christ himself. 

Idiots declaring the decision as a modern day Normandy landing...

People saying that amongst Putins wrath, Coronavirus, war in the Middle East, going further back to 2 world wars, slavery, murderous caliphates, concentration camps. Disease, auctions and serial mass murders.

And they are actually saying Abortion rights overshadow it all as the single worst thing to ever happen or exist.

Really? Is that the collective intelligence of the primary species on planet earth?

OK. Sure. We should be happy actually. Happy that one day soon it will be a life sentence for a young violated teenage girl to refuse the prospect of putting herself through suicidal terror, fear and haunted memory just to bring an offenders child to term, thus gifting humanity with a deviants prodigy...

Wow. 
As if I need any more proof that humanity needs a reset."
Gods in charge
"I love the joy on everyone's face that knows how evil the past 50 years have been.
No more sacrifices to Luciferian secret societies!"

"America should balkanise. The Left and Democrats hate everything that is American, it would be better if they just formed their own country."
9 supreme legislators with lifetime appointment. Mental system.
"That's it. Back to the stone age. I hope every single one of these women protesting on the side of the overturn suffers, REALLY suffers"
"The USA must be the most fucked up society on the planet, horrid place."
Why is no one addressing the fact that science is very clear on this: a fetus is not a person. Period.
"A dark day for sure. While it's ideal to create laws based on religious ideals, the truth is usually not a good idea. People have different perspective on things. And not only laws have to be fair, there's usually a good reason not create a law based on religious beliefs. While Roe vs. Wade started on rather selfish note, it turned to a critical law in the constitution of women rights. The other laws the Supreme court are going after just as important. These laws were put in place for good reason. Without them there would be consequences affecting everyone. The Supreme court needs to be taken aside and talked to about these laws. Or replace with people who are at least willing to listen."
Crazy god followers again ruining everything.
Can u imagine being distraught that you can’t kill babies?
This is a very bad decision.
"I've never really understood why anti-abortionists think they should have jurisdiction over somebody else's body? What has it got to do with them? I mean, fine, if they don't want an abortion, then great, don't have one. I am in favour of abortion, but I don't try to insist that anti-abortionists should have abortions, even though I think it would probably be for the greater good of society."
All life matters!
Clarence Thomas just said that contraception is an “error” that the Supreme Court has a “duty” to “correct” now that Roe is overturned.
You know how common postpartum depression is even with women who wanted a baby? People who would've gotten abortions may end up taking their own lives or the babies life anyway. People barely know what they want until they are almost in their 30s it'll end up forcing people to wreck their mental health and in turn the babies. If anything restrict the amount of time they can have an abortion. But fundamentally the right should remain
"""Constitutional right"" - the Constitution makes no reference to abortion. Typical C4 misinfo..."
"Oh no the girl on the thumbnail is crying because she was told that being able to kill a child is her human right... oh but no, sorry, you've been mistaken.  We all have a right to life, in fact, and a human being's life beings in the womb - it's where we all started - so we have a right to life and a right not to have our personal autonomy infringed upon, that's our own bodies inside a womb there.  So, no, nice try at propaganda though Channel 4."
"People really, Ming your own uterus. As a man you shouldn’t try to control our’s."
"distributing free fire extinguishers does not prevent fires.  people should learn how to use matches.  when a woman undergoes an abortion, she suffers both psychosocially and physically.  Abortion shows boys that they can continue to have fun without feeling the slightest responsibility.  girls and boys need the right education.  girls can choose to have an abortion but they can not force the doctors to commit murder and throw the 6 month old human being in the trash."
This is awesome news Praise God forever. So sad people crying to be able to have the right to have their baby chopped up into pieces and put into a freezer. Democrats have brainwashed people and turned them into a fornicating generation with no respect for themselves or for their children. Pray the states have the votes to ban it nation wide.
"The correspondent is so abundantly biased in her reporting, that it is laughable.🤣"
"When 50% of caucasian women get their tubes tied lets see how fast they reverse the decision. But on a serious note, since they say it should be left up to states and citizens, why not then require that states put it up to a vote. This would allow citizens to have a right to vote on the individual issue Instead of living under dictatorship by having a governor tell a woman or couple what they have to do with their bodies. If the voters of each state sign a petition in large numbers then it will have to be voted on as a ballot initiative/amendments. If not vote them all out. So they just overturned Roe but then will do nothing to ensure safer streets via gun violence for those same embryos. What a schizophrenic set of decisions!"
No. This is the right Decision. No person women or man should have the ability to kill their child life starts at conception
Puts that whole Trans “Woman” thing in perspective now huh?? 🦗🦗🦗🦗
Can we finally call liberals domestic terrorists when they start looting & burning cities this weekend or is that term reserved for only conservatives still?

Ah! i feel so sad that they are not allowed to kill babies anymore..........NOTTTT
A sad day for the USA. But on the bright side more kids may lead to more school shooters.
"""my body my choice"" also applies to the baby."
It’s a complicated issue.

It wasn't a right to begin with. Classic lying media

Seems like America brought a piece of the Taliban home with them. They’ll be stopping girls from going to school next.
To all pro life Americans now you know what propaganda news against you looks like huh?
Hilarious
"This is a great day for humanity. It's bizarre that the people who are pro choice for children to go through severe operations to change from male to female or female to male. Are probably the ones who would take away other children's right to life, through abortion. One thing both of these actions have in common, are that they are an attack on children."
"Reporter: ""The supreme court has gone against the will of the people"". No, actually the opposite has happened. Now people can vote and have exactly the kind of abortion laws they want in each state."
"I've noticed that those who are for abortion have already been born.
Now let the salt flow."
America just turned itself into a Christian caliphate.
"This Bristish reporter needs to stick to covering the Royal Family stuff....
and stop giving out phoney info. !!!
  Read the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of rights."
"Seeing as it goes to the states what about the states committing and trying to legalise infanticide???
What are they doing with baby parts???"
Abortion is an abomination and a sin.Long live Father God.Giving life is no joke.Let God decide who lives or dies.Abortion is child sacrifice.Repent Jesus Christ is coming back now.
I am pretty sure that passing the progressive policies first would have been the correct order. All  the republicans are going to do is vote down everything that the lady mentioned anyway.
this Biaches screaming with joy don't even realize a constitutional right is taken away which is very sad shame on  you woman shame on you
American Civil War 2.0 incoming.
They are screeching like harpies
Close your legs or use protection! Stop using abortion as contraception!
They are going to protest expecting the same results as 2020 but this time around all the shop owners got guns now.
What liberties or rights does the unborn child have.
Literally millions of lives saved due to this decision.
Channel 4 stop with the lies...have u no shame? The right to abortion DOES NOT EXIST in the American constitution...thats why Roe V Wade was overturn...right to abortion it os not a constotutional right...they send tje power back to the states
There never was a constitutional right for an abortion!!!!
These pro life people are the most ignorant Karen's you'll ever see. No point in getting their point of view on this because it's pure ignorance  and pettiness!
"Holy moly, god help American woman.. unbelievable 😲"
"""It's like taking Normandy beach.""

Bruh."
We need progress we need Michelle O in there right now!!
RIP TINDER APP
I hope Channel 4 give such bias in favour of all murderers in their future reports.
This report is such BS and biased!!!
They talk as if they are banning completely when they are actually just letting their own states decide instead of the government getting involved. That is in nature with the whole point of the American experiment.
This is ridiculous - America is supposedly founded on “individual freedom and liberty” - come again?
I just love seeing sad Karens!  love it
This a fantastic step forward for American democracy! Now the states themselves get the chance to set their own laws for their own women on this issue.
"Britain next please, maybe we can have replacement levels of reproduction if women can’t use murder as a contraception."
"I'm one of those babies who was meant to be aborted, but my mom was too far along. I was never meant to exist. And I wish I hadn't. Taking abortion rights away from women doesn't save babies. It just makes life harder for the mother and the unwanted child, especially in countries where socio-economic safety nets are non exist (i.e. USA). If you don't want an abortion, don't have one."
"Who has more rights,,,,does the right to life(a baby) have more right and the already alive female pregnant,,,,,,to freedom of choice,,,it’s a terrible legal craziness,,,I am not a justice,,I would hate to be these judges,,,,,,,,,,,,,I believe in life and a push to educate women and men on the need for good birth control,,,and really good state run nursery’s,,and child care,,,so the women on state income,,,get a chance to get an education,,,work,,training,,,,to get a feeling of accomplishment,,,to end the cycle of poverty,,,after school programs,,,,better schools in urban areas in general,,,,encouraging men to stay connected with their children,,,,get more men of color and ethnicity to be role models for the young men without dads,,,,,treat everyone with dignity,and respect,,,,"
Guess certain gals wont be able to sleep around so freely anymore or use actual protection. The amount that use it as contraception or to scam people e.t.c is most likely insane. One step closer to actual equality I guess.
"Abortion should be regulated, people need to be responsible for their actions."
Abortion isn't even in the constitution
LOL 🤣
7:48 Who’s this beast?
Being anti-abortion has to be the cheapest form of morality around - you don't have to pony up any money to help a kid have a decent start in life. You can just sit back in your easy chair and self-righteously condemn others for difficult life choices. It's really the perfect Republican issue. No skin in the game.
I bet the Taliban are happy with this.
Utterly sad and disgusting

"60 years ago our Congress Hid like rats rather than make a Law regarding this.   Obama had a majority in Both houses and was too afraid to make a law regarding it. Now the Left wants to blame the supreme court?   It is not their job to make laws, blame your lazy congress whichever way you believe."
The false balance in this report is disappointing.
"GET YOUR FACTS STRIGHT !
ABORTION WAS   NEVER  A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT !!!😎"
Love the meltdowns  🤣🤣🤣
The correct decision. Anything not covered in the constitution is left up the states or the people
"This is literally democracy in action. People can now VOTE to make it legal, or illegal, and put whatever restrictions they want on abortion on a state by state basis. OR get abortion passed at the federal level... of course that won’t work, because as of now at least half the country either doesn’t want it to be legal at all (minority), or wants severe restrictions on it (majority). 

Most people have no clue what Roe V Wade was about or why it made zero sense constitutionally. Now it’ll actually be up to the PEOPLE. That’s called democracy."
all women who support abortion in the US need to imidiately withhold conjugal rights for all their men and maybe a mass hunger strike will change the minds of these far right bible bashing men when they see their own daughters and grandaughters starving to death women in the USA need to show these crackpots that belief in a made up god that enforces their idelology on all the women of the USA
"Wow.  ""America, the land of gun care and health control"""
"America, land of the free (as long as the religious nuts allow it)"
There was never a ‘constitutional right’ to abortion in the first place.
A great day for humanity. A bad day for irresponsible women and adrenechrome consumers.
Americans... *eyeroll*
How can anyone force a woman accept a baby she doesn't want? Babies would end up abandoned
"Funny how they one minute care so much for a fetus but just loosened the gun  laws where you can carry a combat weapon to a school  and shoot everyone .
The woman should have the right to choose its her body"
This will divide America further. I wonder if there will be huge protests
"This is the will of God.
No more murdering babies!
Other countries will follow I pray."

I'm not against the overturning - it but it is slippy slope because if it is a crime - there are going to be more 'back alley clinics' which might be more dangerous for women
The Republicans are very similar to the Taliban's in they way they approach the rights for women!
"No to vaccine passports, mandates or lockdowns"
This is outrageous.
This is not about pro-life; it’s about anti-woman.
RWV was bad law in the first place. Rights don't come from the government. They come from our humanity and our creator. Read our constitution.
Shouldn't this have a 'Triggered' warning? 🤣
"Supreme court did no such thing, all it literally did was look at the constitution and nowhere could they see a right to abortion mentioned anywhere so referred abortion back to individual states to decide on their own abortion laws.  For instance Oregan still has the right to abort up to 9 months, as sickening as that is."
USA government evil dictator sales guns too killing each other Europe laugh at USA
Next is what forced veganism?
Misleading azz story lmfao it means the state decides i personally believe all black women should have the right to choose now the right to choose tomorrow the right to choose forever 😅

"EXCELLENT for two reasons 1) The Constitution says nothing about DISMEMBERMENT ABORTIONS and these ugly leftists in 1973 simply made it up exactly as they did in the Dredd Scott case where another Dem appointed judge upheld slavery by claiming that the obvious equality provisions of the Constititon did not apply to Blacks as Blacks were ""merely property like a horse is property"". Of course, NOTHING in the Constution mentioned slavery or suggested that Blacks were SLAVES. Rather it guaranteed freedom for al men equality. Leftists like to make crap up that is not there. Ditto for abortion - not mentioned in any sense and the founders knew of abortion and debated it and decided through a vote not to address it one way or the other. 2) it is up to the people to debate the issue and to decide for themselves on a State by State basis wheteher to allow it generally, or in some situations and not others. or in all. That is democracy. JAIL those judges tha lied for 50 years and cause so much harm."

"I am confused i am not an american. Isn.t ametica ment to be a Democracy. But so many people are against thus but have no say, the discion is being made the court. Gaving a abortion ia such a person thing seem like a basic right has been taken from you. They not going raise you kids and help feed it when your broke. They have no idea of the trauma of being raped and having to liturally carry that. If your against abortion fine don t get an abortion but don t push it other people their ife thier choices"
# TIME TO RAISE VOICE
"And a year later abortion rights are being enshrined into state constitutions all over the country. Amazing result for the pro choice side. I guess the ""pro life"" side isn't the force it thought it was. They just had a fundamentalist SC to do their bidding. SC doesn't lead if the people won't follow..."

"It is a woman's right whether or not to get an abortion 
NO ONE ELSE'S  SO SHUT THE #UCK UP"
The abortion right should be banned . Hello abortion is immoral  and unconditional.  Think about it the first amendment garentees certain inalienable rights the right to justice peace life liberty and the pursuit of happiness how is abortion going to protect the rights of the unborn children and what is the difference between an unborn child and another child or someone who is over 90 so keep your pants up no unwanted baby and for as rape is considered most rape ends with your own body miscarrying anyways
In Israel Hamas murdered children. In the US pregnant women abort/kill their babies when they decide to.
Where is the date on this video?
"I'm sorry please show everyone where in the US Constitution is abortion a ""constitutional right""? I'll wait...."
"Right to Life anti-abortionists have just made their entire platform null and void through their willful support of euthanasia. They are now the biggest hypocrites on earth!
Canada has legally murdered hundreds of thousands of seniors, disabled, poor and destitute Canadians through their euthanasia program. Pro-life has not only been outrageously silent about this legalized murder of innocent people, a lot of them actually support it.
The pro-life anti-abortionists have not said one word against these legalized murders proving that they really have zero regard for human life once it’s born. They don’t care about children living in abuse or poverty because they’re born to a mother who neither wants them or can afford them. At no time have they ever supported the women themselves once they give birth to these unwanted children, nor do they care what happens to the children. And now their hypocrisy is blatantly obvious for the entire world to see. Through their silence and apathy, they have fully supported Canada’s murder (euthanasia) program.
You don’t get more evil or hypocritical than that!
Anti-abortionists are the original ‘Karen’s’, and every last one of them wants to control women and none of them care about any form of human rights except their own narcissistic control over others!
They absolutely support murdering innocent people, just not unborn fetuses!"
"Some of you folks are sick. Use a condom!! 
Fighting to kill prenatal/preborn sentient human babies is a disgrace.

I hope you people one day will experience the same death you seem to advocate for."

Also thanks anti abortion, now we might get higher risk of death for some poeple or babies, or babies might be born with certain difficulties and now if someone gets pregnant they will be forced to become a mother unless they travel to another state. This flat out sucks for women and a little bit for some men too because i doubt they all would wanna be a father."

"Here's an easy way to make sure the supreme court takes up the idea of maybe we should have gone ahead and let rover's his way stand
Make it mandatory for every single male On the u s supreme court that made that decision to be Castrated
Also an email governor that passes such a horrible law make sure that they're castrated
When they realize that they're about to Have everything chopped off
They allow legal abortions again"
"This is such dishonest reporting. The right to murder your child wasn't revoked, it was just sent back to the states, per the Constitution. Roe was based on a lie, anyway. If you want to murder your child --- even after birth ---- there are Moloch worshiping states like Virginia and California. Imagine being red-raced mad over not being able to slut around and murder children without consequence."
"People who against abortion should be sent to North Korea, that country suits ur mindset"
It's just S.A. now.
One of the greatest days in modern American history
Men need to keep their business out of this.. what do they carry their life isn't on the line
Women ☕
Praise the lord prayers really do change things i admit i never thought id see this there hope for the World after all
America can ban abortion quickly but won't ban assault rifles being sold to lunatics the whole world is laughing how how the country is run
That is wrong how a woman can't get an abortion but the phscopaths have a right to buy assult weapons with 100 round drum magazines to shoot up schools no wonder the rest of the world is laughing at America!!!
"Don't abort your child 

You'll feel relief now but in the future you're guaranteed remorse, guilt, regret, shame, depression and even despair every time you see the beautiful smile of a child"
"Abortion is murder, and as a man I have the right to say that because I'll directly be affected by this."
very good news!
"Unborn should ideally have the right to the womb. It's their home, where they are supposed to be"
Thank God
Murderers unite!
0 states made abortion illegal. It's just not a constitutional right. Women can still kill their babies
Nice❤️❤️❤️
Nice news
it depends with circumstances
I don’t agree with legal abortion 😢
"Change the system socially . Men should sleep and stay in another bedroom .  Women are fertile only for  a few days of the month . Avoid having a physical relationship on those days  
Also babies and small children should be close to their mother at night . Not  a horny adult male ."
Abortion is mentioned in the Bible but it is not mentioned as a good or bad thing.
*American dream lol where people can have the most freedom.*
"China number 1, even in here we can abort babies, usa have no human rights, they discriminate  all non white people, we should group up and fight against usa, most evil contry in the world"
"Abortion should be the choice of the women themselves, period."
I am so happy that i dont live in america...i feel terrible for the plight of american women
Very good decision
💝💝
Abortion is against the human rights
not anti or pro abortion. however I do question why is abortion being used as a contraceptive being that there are so many more options available to prevent a pregnancy
Good news channel
Great
God bless USA !!!
A woman can’t impregnate herself but men will gladly make laws to deny her a choice in decisions about her own body.
It's unbelievable that those against abortion; to the draconian point; seem to be OK with giving their children guns to take to school to murder other children!
#GodblessouNation
Government pushing this pretty hard there probably planning a future war
"I am so sorry and scared with what is happening in the USA over a woman's right to choose if she wants to have a child. We are at a cross roads in society. Populations are declining in socially developed countries and we have been propping up our traditional systems for economic growth through the use of immigration. We are moving towards a point where if we are to continue to grow our economies we need to either tackle the declining birthrate or develop a better system of importing labor, one that benefits both the countries sending and receiving populations.
Our greatest asset in the UK is our knowledge and the amazing systems we have developed to deliver it; our schools, colleges, companies and universities that train our young people. I am a firm believer that by growing our education sector we can solve both these issues.
If you are in the UK, when you vote in your local elections please remember to check you are not voting for a pro-life politician as we do have them in the UK."
Great 😃
"The government is right , remember the first commandment, '' Thou shalt not kill '', that includes your unborn babies ladies. You can't just kill them if you want to, its against God's law...."
"I would like to suggest an enormous class-action law suit to make the supreme court pay child support for the children who are brought into the world under duress and a multitude of challenges for the woman...and usually ONLY the woman. Put their money were their mouths are.  It would be shot down, but it would shed light on what they claim are their Christian beliefs and concern for the fetuses."
"On my pack of cigarettes it says “smoking can cause my unborn child to die”. If anti-abortionists are serious about saving fetuses, then they would also have to treat smokers like criminals. That would mean no more smoking in the red states like Kentucky and Virginia where the tobacco grows.🤔 Just another example of Republican hypocrisy?"
"Good, now girls can learn to close their legs. The next bill should be the removal of child support and the punishment of paternity fraud. Women need to be held accountable and punished for their actions."
"So safe sex is not a thing anymore? Huh. Interesting. Maybe, wait for a real relationship or marriage then have a child. Why are women and men surprised that sex = having a baby! Ignorance is not okay people, neither is killing a life because of the consequence of 'having sex'. Good maybe men and women should be more careful now with whoever they have sex with. I agree with NO ABORTIONS. I'm pro-life ❤"
"""nice, less work for me"""
"The unborn child is alive and deserves the right to live. God doesn't make junk or mistakes. Every child is precious in the eyes of the Lord! Why would we give women more rights than the innocent unborn child. Do you think the unborn doesn't feel pain in the womb. I assure you, they do. I have studied abortion and it's procedures. Do your research, it's not as simple as you think. One procedure puts an instrument into the womb to scramble and kill the baby. During this procedure, it has been observed the baby backing up and trying to move away from the foreign object. The unborn child senses danger and trys to protect himself. I have witnessed doctors telling their horrific abortion stories of removing arms and limbs of the baby. It is barbaric and wrong!"
Praise God! The unborn child is safe!
If you don't want kids give them to us they will live good life simple and happy one 🇦🇫🏳🏴
Pro choice all day everyday . Love too every women world wide going through together we’re stronger together we overcome ❤️❤️❤️ Wales Uk 🇬🇧 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Lol abortion is so dumb
It’s americas own fault
Yes hahah finally some good news
"Abortion is murder. I state the obvious because people deny the obvious. Look in detail at: 1) the stages of development of a foetus week by week, and 2) the methods actually used to kill the babies, and you will understand more what it is. There is no right to kill. We don't have a right to kill newborns, for instance. They can be put up for adoption if necessary, but not killed. The same logic should be applied for poor defenceless babies in the mother's womb."
Hope this kids will have a good family
😢
ofc they all have rainbow flags and rainbow hair and cat ears🤣
"Also. Legally and ethical (religion is irrelevant), prolife wanting to ban all abortion is unrealistic.  Although rare, there still exist that abortion is needed to save the mothers life. Why isn't this brought up?"
"What was the reason they turned her away? With trauma, how does abortion help with that?"
"Prochoice would need to prove that keeping abortion is part of the constitution. Since it isn't, you can't re-overturn the decision."
Let’s see how it does
Doctor's should protect and respect life. Such disgusting doctor to kill innocent lives! Hell for you is welcoming. 😡😡😡
I love the song! Jesus loves the little children.
God answered our prayer. Pro-life all the way.
"As a kenyan health worker  I should say in our constitution though it's is unclear when life begins  after conception  in our law's every Kenyan woman is to protect life of the unborn child and will only be carried out if the pregnancy poses a threat to the expectant mother ,here the issue of is not tied with woman's rights because the right to life overides it"
"Americans are so sensitive about abortion but, at the same time, don't care about women and children dying in ""the war on terror."""
"Yes abortions can be said to be right because a pupeteerage and a feeling and an emotion is a invite to have a message be profoundly enforced.
Ex: a outsider of a group or in a group individualized trying to escape an existence is using a person's body( ex:, woman , female, her, she,etc to birth a hopeful continuance suggests an unseen critiquer and a judger and a measurer etc, to enforce a prevention Al mimicking of inbredism and or hazardous breeding so that a starve of simulation of practices suggestive to tribalism, ignorance, deceitful intentful predatorial, and reckless mating , babies being used as weapons against person's families etc.can be stopped, the only person's that would be angry at message posted would be deceitful intenters probably involved in some type of criminal activity.
Also, abortions prevent regrets, second doubts, fear , worry and overpopulation attending and humn slavery , also ,sex slavery and unnecessary not authorized science experimenting , forced choice action of organ stealing etc...Drop the microphone now.. Depopulate"
"Guys, abortion may be illegal soon. If you accidentally get a girl pregnant, make sure she’s an anti-vaxxer.
Instead of paying for 18 years of child support, you’ll only have to pay for 3."
"America is so funny. They ban their own abortion. I just watched a video about Witchcraft by witches ""shave your head and get in the closet"". I swear they do it on purpose. I'm laughing. They are so stupid."
"Back in the day I had halfway convinced myself that the 10-week-old ""clump of cells"" I aborted wasn't human yet until five years later when my sister said out loud on her deathbed, ""She has a son...I can see his face."" Yeah. God revealed to her the baby I had secretly aborted which opened my eyes to the reality of a fetus's full humanity in the womb from the moment of conception. There are no secrets with God and He will expose them when the time is right.

""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, And before you were born I consecrated you; I have appointed you as a prophet to the nations."" 

Jeremiah 1:5"
But why is it illegal now? I don't understand this decision.
If you cant speak for yourself democrats will kill you.
And it will impact women from poor backgrounds most.Vile.They won’t care even if these women kill themselves for having to have a child they don’t want.Doesn’t sound very pro life to me.
Amen
Finally!!!!!!
"This is misinformation, abortion was never a right. Maybe stick to covering news I. your own country because this shit should be flagged."
2:55   3:40  5:34
"Finally, a good law 🙌 😌"
Good i hope its banned all over the world 🌎
"I  used to work at an abortion clinic and I saw some extremely messed up shit there which is why I'm so anti-abortion now. I remember a 23 year old woman came in 7 months into her pregnancy and said ""I don't want this stupid baby anymore, kill it"" and the doctor said ""okay"" and he put jumper cables up her baby hole and connected them to a car battery and let it run for six days straight. 
After every successful abortion, the doctor would shout ""Take that, Baby"" and  push a red button that made sirens go off and confetti fell from the ceiling and we'd all get Maccy Ds for free."
They want women to have back alley  regardless be nice in our comments
Yeah mistake by the court regardless women are going to have abortions
I wanna hook up but they let it out how they willing to do it. It was awful how they murder unborn kid? I care but most of the wholes guys don't care just whatever privacy from. 🙄
Great day to be a male adult in this great nation of the USA
They still have the right to have an abortion. They just mad because the federal government isn't paying for it. They need to stop lying. All they did was kick it back to the states to decide. Just like the constitution says it should be. Woman are still in control of their own body. And someone needs to speak up for the unborn human being that some people are okay with killing. Why is it okay to have an express lane to kill babies in the first place? Perhaps we should focus on why that is
I have question if women can abort the baby cause its their will so does that mean men don't have to pay child support this is just question so don't give to me.
"By right to abortion you mean the enshrined right to murder babies. 


Yeah, you're that low"
"by Deatrice Moore, I have to agree with Justice Kavanaugh, it's not about abortion. It's about controlling women, attempting to make them virtuous according to Christian belief and morality. Delegitimizing any and all forms of birth control. Forcing women to engage in sex for reproduction only. Giving men the right to determine family size. Forcing women to be house wives, mother's and home makers only, reducing the ability to seek higher education and employment outside the home. Forcing women to stay in relationships that may be unhealthy for them and the children because they are totally dependent on their husband for support. Decreasing single parent households, thereby increasing the number of traditional families. Read and comprehend the meaning, importance and ramifications of the 1873 Comstock Law which remains on the books, last enforced in 1996, has never been repealed or overturned. It is currently enforceable in 21st century America."
Best solution abstain from sex.
"All this for an unwanted unborn FETUS.. who if survives till fullterm may aswell be dumped in the foster care at birth, just to grow up without a loving parent, a caring family, a protective home,
& Have an underprivileged, poverty-ridden, LONELY childhood.

And even worse, that vulnerable CHILD could be abused, raped & end up getting pregnant by age 10,

Then SHE will be forced to carry the pregnancy even though a 10year old child is mentally & physically unfit to endure pregnancy & childbirth.

The very people who claim to be her 'LIFE'S advocate' before birth, will no be longer  concerned whether she DIES due to pregnancy complications..
because a baby's life in only important in the WOMB & will no longer valuable ever since she takes her very first BREATH in this world.!!!

Sensible people can see how wrong all this is..
There is no point in proclaiming to be a PRO-LIFER if you can't  guarantee a QUALITY LIFE to all the UNWANTED babies that were FORCED to be born due to your decision & irrational beliefs!!!!

Better focus on the welfare of orphans, & children of low income families that are already ALIVE!!!!!"
For anyone who supports abortion is a disgusting human being. Killing the unborn? That's twisted. And using the most lamest excuses for it..!?
"Why American women protest and cry to kill their baby, stop having sex or cut out your whomb geez"
It dint even do anything lol
abortion is a terrible thing. You can't kill your own kind. It is immoral. I'm glad that many states have banned abortion!
"Somebody should remind the US Supreme Court Justices that our Constitution begins with ""We The People"" and not with ""We The States""."
"My body, my decision! everyone else needs to stfu and mind their own business."
So happy !
Best day ever ! Abortion should be illegal! Muder is muder Period
"If it's the women's right to choose to have the baby,then if she chooses to have it the women should be the one who pays.As the man had no say"
Poll: what is the best thing about abortion?
"My dr. Denied me my tubes tied 
In abusive domestic and threatening circumstance he was aware with c-sections one baby after another forced sex too soon and caused me un necessary scar tissue pain etc.
Dr.denied me.
What about my right to my body?"
Ok u r taking away this right wht can one do if after giving birth mother decide not to take care of baby nothing then who will suffer baby rather then these rights should be there everyone has to live with human dignity i m not saying this in favour of women i m concern about poor baby
When one of them gets rapped and be told u gotta keep this kid I wanna see what they gone say after that
some used it as birth control.  Sad and wrong.
"So a woman with down syndrome who is either unwilling or unable to care for her child is forced to have it? Zero chance our Repugnican lawmakers will fund social services for the child's care. Are women still permitted to abort when Downs is present? The effects are already so damning and the future reprocussions, daunting."
We need change and Biden out of the Whitehouse.
"The movie 2001 a space odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion. A space odyssey is a fetus in the womb. The Clint Eastwood dirty Harry movies was angry calm. It seems nasty but it's a good police officer. Angry calm is how a women chooses abortion. 

Everything in motion  makes one error. Your supposed to park the errors where it doesn't matter or you play wack a mole with errors. It's intelligently designed that if you try killing God you will always make one error. A movie is in motion so you have to park the errors where it doesn't matter. 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind. That why HAL computer eye is colored red so it still has artistic integrity.  2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made. It only has one error to park. You can't do better than that."
"There never was a right to an abortion in The Constitution.Abortion is murder , and if you watch the procedure you will agree . People don’t realize that sex is not something to be careless about. If you want to see less unloved children then teach your kids the difference between right and wrong , don’t have sex before marriage"
The funny thing is that they only care about “babies” just when they are in the women’s womb but once they are born they don’t give a s**t about them. 🤡
If abortion is legal you won't able have these children born out of chance and circumstances that we can make out as pedophiles for wanting to live a normal life like the rest of us? How we would be able to identify people by knowing them more than they do if they don't exist?🙏🙏🙏💲💲💲🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Where's our sincibilities and us as a people if we don't have that?
"200 years in the future we'll look back and be disgusted at how killing the unborn through choice was ever normalized, just like 200 years later we're disgusted at slave owners. smh"
Ooooooh we can't murder our babies!!!
This is rediculous
make a swift reverse ...this is out of controll and we all know what these harmfull decisions will result in ....get it together american govt ....my heart goes out to all these american woman and there families who support them ...just wrong
"If you don’t like it, Don’t have sex. You are willing to do the deed but you can’t deal with the consequences ? So a unborn child should die because you are irresponsible ? Bull💩. That’s not for women. That’s for both women and men. I’m tired of hearing people complain. A unborn baby shouldn’t die because you think sex is just fun. Grow up and protect yourselves."
"Hello, May I share an Old Testament Verse with you from Daniel 7:14 ""And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a Kingdom, that all people, nations, & languages, should SERVE Him; his dominion is an Everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom shall not pass away, and His Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.""  Also, can I share Isaiah 53:5 "" But HE was WOUNDED For our TRANSGRESSIONS, he was BRUISED for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, & with His STRIPES we are HEALED.""
God the Father loves you so much that He sent Holy Sinless Jesus (His Holy Son) to earth to be born of a virgin.Then, to grow up and die on a cross for our sins. He was in the tomb for 3 days, then Father God raised Holy and Sinless Jesus Christ (Y'shua) to Life! He appeared to people and went back to Heaven.  We must receive Sinless Jesus sincerely to be God's child(John 1:12).After we get saved by grace through faith in Christ, if we truly love the Lord Jesus Christ, then we will obey Jesus(John 14:15).  Mark 1:15 ""And saying, the time is fulfilled, & the kingdom of God is at hand: Repent ye, and believe the gospel."" Jesus said in John 14:15 ""If you love Me, keep My commandments. ""There's a real hell. It says in Revelation 21:8 ""But for the cowardly, & unbelieving, & abominable, and murderers, & immoral persons  sorcerers & idolaters & all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire & brimstone..."" Please sincerely receive Holy Jesus and put your true faith and trust in Him today & please repent.  Will you have a Real encounter with Holy Lord Jesus (Y'shua is His Hebrew Name) and stay in a Genuine relationship with Him daily please?"
NO UTERUS NO OPINION 
This is so disgusting. I bet the rich wives of these powerful men wont ever have to worry about this. Pathetic
"Statistics show that countries which prohibit the rights to abort, have higher abortion rates than those who don't. Statistics have also shown that abortion rates are on the decline due to better education and contraception. Making abortion illegal will actually cause it to rise again, among poverty and crime rates. We all want to reduce abortion; nobody wants unwanted pregnancies. Making it illegal is not the answer."
"Sorry BBC, no more sacrifices to Moloch"
"Cann we focus more on the problem of fertilizing chimp embryos with human genes?
We do NOT need human chimp hybrids, Spending the money on that rn when our children have little odds of being able to have water in their 20's is ridiculous. I feel like Roe Vs. Wade is a distraction from the real problems, If you think abortions is the real problem in the world rn get ready to be traumatized."
If it isn't right it's not a right.
"If you look up “crisis pregnancy center” in your area, it will either be an place to kill children (abortion clinic), or a place that gives aide to women in crisis pregnancies (food, diapers, clothing, and in Grand Rapids, someone who will listen to her fears and be there for her). The number of organizations that help women/families with crisis pregnancies is enormous!  Abortion clinics would lose money if their clients were more familiar with them. The Pregnancy Resource Center is one of many in Grand Rapids Michigan, for example.

Abortion clinics make more money when people are afraid, less money when people have hope.

Most people who have abortions will parent differently after their abortion, because of how they have suffered. What a horrible nightmare for millions of women. Some suffer right away, many others suffer later on. Some seem to be fine for decades. Everyone is completely different.

Having an abortion cannot be a nonviolent act.

That means that abortion hurts women. I grieve for all my friends who have had the courage to tell me about their horrific experiences.

Our great-grandmothers would roll over in their graves if they knew we were averaging over 1 million abortions per year in the United States."
"It looks to me like the democrats think that women are irresponsible sex machines. I don't think so, but if you are a irresponsible sex machines....get your tubes tied! There, problem solved! If you're willing to have an abortion, surely, getting your tubes tied solved all abortion problems. If you want a child in the future...untie your tubes."
"Great  ! If your mum had illegal aborted you , pro abortionists , you couldn't be around !. Christian Ronaldo's mum want to abort him but was not successful  !."
"It's insanely funny how these same pro lifers are also pro-guns which are eventually responsible for the deaths of hundreds of children. Like, make it make sense?"
Being pro-life is not about the baby. It's about spreading misogyny and patriarchal propaganda. Look at the way in which these pro lifers talk about women. There's hatred  dripping from their words like they're angry we have any rights.
"Since religions have caused the abortion problem, as women  we should not be letting them take our tax money allowing them to be a non profit organizations. They attacked our liberty. Also, since they entered government, that should disqualify them. We need a tax revolt."
They never think about poor woman cant provide their kids.
"It's time to make being an ace a religion. Women should just takes vows of celibacy and practice total abstinence. They can take care of their needs better by themselves. Let's see how these people feel when they don't get some in the years to come (if they get any at all with how bitter most of them are) Then again, that might just lead to more rape cases. You really can't win if you're a woman huh"
Simple solution.... stop spreading your legs 🦵😤
"Jeez, what is wrong with this world...  whatever happened to taking responsibilities for own actions?. You don't need to shout n scream just to get your point across, its unethical... I can understand where both parties, both male and female are coming from. Because once iv been that child inbetween two parents, both squabbling over each other after they split. However it doesn't have to be this way, as you can both have what you want and still be happy. 

For the women: To get men to be more responsible for their children, get them to pay for their kids up until their 18 or after college. Plus this will encourage absent fathers, to bond with their children and take the load of pressure off of you.

For the men: You've got your whole life to yourself, and have your own space without the added stress on top. And you don't have pay for your child when they become an adult, and if you want to be apart of your child's life... then you can, as the offer is still on the table.

And for the young teen parents out there, you can study at home and let your parents bond with their grandchildren... or just let a friend look after them.


And for the people who have been raped or forcefully been sexually assaulted. Contest for DNA profile of the rapist, get them to pay you money for the abuse they have done to your body. As this will allow serial sex offenders to never do it again, as their actions have consequences."
"All these gross comments proves it, women stay away from men.
They dont care and just acuse women to kill kids.

AVOID MEN AND THEN YOI'LL BE HAPPIER AND FREE.

Call me whatever you want for such a comment, men and women so-called pro-lifers are now forcing us against a wall AGAIN.

So drastic measures need to be taken.
Men blame us for everything anyway, one more reason to never have one close to you!
Men says cant trust women, then dont trust men either."
"I cant wrap my head around women actually wanting this.
Skilled women lost due to being forced with having kids, skilled workers, scientist, knowledgeable PEOPLE dying and getting in dept to bring more kids to the world, when we have DIRE and serious lack of space/ressources on earth.

Pro-lifers arent pro life, theyre F insane."
"Was there a ""constitutional right to own a slave"" when slavery was legal?

There never was a ""constitutional right to abortion"" in the US. Abortion was just legal and it obviously shouldn't be as it kills vulnerable human beings."
Sorry Dr. willie Parker.  You’ll have to find somewhere else to kill babies.
God wills it!
"It was Moscow Mitch who made the decision to lie and abuse his power. 1 of 2 of those Supreme Court picks should've been ether Obama's or Bidens. McConnell told Obama it's an election year and he can't pick but got Trumps pick a month before the elections. 
That is a bunch of B.S!"
"And these are the very people who cry and moan when their privacy is invaded, But it's OK for them to go and invade other people's privacy! Unless you plan on paying and raising that kid... Mind your own damn business!
Thanks to these morons, The increase of welfare and other goverment programs are going to go up."
Personally I think men should have the Right to financial abortion its the woman job to make sure she doesn't get pregnant and if man doesn't want the child he shouldn't have to pay for it but I will say some women are simply not strong enough to have kids Women have massive privilege today child birth is now safer than its ever been I would like to know how many abortions are done for medical reasons  or Because the child won't be quite perfect or maybe a  child is to much of inconvenience  Maybe Men will stop doing stuff Because it to much of an inconvenience and then the world will Grind to halt and Women will learn the truth basically you are just along for the ride
"My thoughts on this:
Just keep abortion legal! Women can die from giving birth which is very harmful and they could be young women too. And if a women wants to keep her child, or sacrifice her life for her child she will. It is their life, their child’s/children’s’ life so they can do what ever they want. They produced the child, they can decide. What if they get pregnant against their own will and she doesn’t want to be a mother yet, or too young to give birth? But then again, she could just put the child up for adoption. Just keep it legal."
Show me where it says abortion was ever a right in the constitution.
Don't Murder Your Children.
Elon musk wants more humans..Rest you can understand how capitalists control the government
Because of the dire drop of the birth rate in the US. The government should provide every women with new baby born an 800$ monthly incentives and for every women who doesn't want baby government must encourage her by sending a letter of incentives as a monthly reminder for every married couple to have babies in order to recieve monthly incentives and for every unwanted babies women can deliver them to the government special offices around the country to recieve a huge reward and incentives like the government is buying the unwanted babies.
People need to learn to love and be less selfish and hoes be more responsible instead of being popular rich and fuck around and party all the time. Abortion is a sin
They can take birth control to preventing  rather then Abortion they Suck babie throw      in the toilet
Why is it always the ugliest women protesting for something. Don't you have something good to do
Head should be “women are responsible for their own actions but they’re mad about it.”
This is awful to hell with the rotten anti abortion movement
Oh I really hope this is just the beginning.
The God  is  supreme  .  Everything happens according  to the  The God's  will  .
Murder is murder regardless of what you call it. Bravo on the states that banned this abominable practice! Bravo and blessings to the lawmakers and judges who stood up for life!
This is a dark time for the world.
This is so wrong.They must reverse this decision.Abortion should be made legal.
"Three Supreme Court Judges  who lied during their confirmation Need to be impeached or  fired.  The US does not look after babies after they are born.  Mitch McConnell stated that they don't have enough babies to be adopted out. Three Court judges have made abortion illegal. They want a civil war. They want blood on their streets. These Judges need to step down. They want women to be subservient. They don't want women to have a choice.  BIRTH CONTROL now banned? They want women to not have a say even though they vote.   Now they want to stop transgender, gay people from the legal right to chose. Well there you have it. The US is now a third world country thanks to those Judges and the way the Republican Party has shown what they really care about.  From BC Canada"
"If you don’t want to have a child, don’t have sex! Simple as that."

Our Aussie Helen Reddy is turning over in her grave over this.
Oh no ...the building with pyramid and 8 straight line ..what's that 10-8...ooops look like bldg from the back to the future movie jokies
"What they want to achive with this ?, Cause it seems like there are enough people in USA."
No right to your body no right to abortion no right to give birth when u want.
All these Christians in the USA saying that abortion is murder and a crime against God. The bible says sin is sin and all sin is equal. Telling a lie  is the same as murder and thinking about murder is the same in God's eyes and commiting it. How many states in America will not allow abortion but still have the death penalty? This is hypocrisy is it not? I hope the government has a plan to put extra funding in to help children as so many more will be living in poverty. I hope they are already starting to make sure their are more good quality foster homes and make adoption more accessible.
"I pray for the unborn babies to have another chance in life... Women are not the only living beings in this world... Unborn babies still deserves to live... If the mother doesn't want the child, just give them away for adoption... The unborn babies have also the rights to live... I understand the pain of women of being raped and not prepared but, abortion is not the only solution... Women are not the only ones suffering... There are innocent children out there being abused for being born from a mistake... Women need to understand that... And no, we do not blame the woman who got pregnant nor guilt-trip of them getting pregnant...  We need to understand the truth that we are not the only ones suffering... The unborn babies are innocent and deserve to live too..."
"Good luck with all the extra babies coming from minorities growing up in poverty....
I bet there will be many new Einsteins and Hawkings coming from there."
Man should really be careful
why are the unborn being denied life how is it that pregnant mothers want to play God and kill what ever baby they want and keep the ones they want  it not moral your mother's it's a life your taking out your own flesh and blood a tiny beautiful baby that could have made you happy but never got a chance cuz mommy killed it may god have mercy on your souls
how can you make a better world out of killing your own children cuz that's what your doing killing murdering your very own children this is not a right no one should have the right to kill use contraceptive and why should tax payers pay for it
abortion is murder.
"They have no business call those bunch of self serving biased freaks a supreme court. Ridiculous how those people even passed the bar exam let alone were given such a privileged position. They don't care at all about the law, they only care about themselves and their personal income. It is a travesty that such an institution could evolve to such a state of anti-social dictatorship. It is not based on any proper values."
"Watch:Birth control methods can still possibly be used for women in all States:
https://youtu.be/EcQSwtMR55E
Birth control pills:
https://youtu.be/wbajNTXBdtc
Even in States where surgical abortions have been banned, birth control options can still be a viable  option for women."
This is just the beginning 💐⭐️🎊🥂
"“Banning abortions is not stopping abortions, its only stopping safe ones.”"
"I have a weird take on this, I am 100% pro choice, however you are still killing something, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing cuz the world is too overpopulated, the earth reached carrying capacity, we are running out of freshwater, the oceans are dying, and a quarter of the world is starving to death, overpopulation is the worlds biggest problem"
The anti-abortion activists who are disingenuously arguing that their decision to interfere in a woman’s right to choose is about social justice rather than religion is absurd.
думать надо когда ложишься в постель! а не просто спать с кем попало!  🙉🙈
Some even want to ban condomes 👎🏻
We choose what we want to choose for the abortion or not. They will still have children but not to ban the abortion. If there are rapists out there what will it ever happen to them? What are they? How can they take away our freedom? Is it because they allowed to do what they want with us? And try to forces onto us? What will our future be?
"Solve the unwanted baby problem, DON'T HAVE SEX!"
You don’t see any of those anti abortion woman volunteering to have fetuses transplanted into them
"The people have spoken, now go forth and protect your babies"
Abortion is murder . People celebrating baby’s being killed are just as worse as Paedophiles . Sick sick sick crazy people . Dont have sex if you dont wont a baby . Disgusting selfish evil people .

"Vasectomy for the men, all of them. That's the answer."
Cut off the men's dicks. They're the ones that shoot three million live cells every time they have sex.
"This is no one's business but the mother's. Get off the subject. 
This has turned the USA into the most backward country in the world. 
Those six judges ought to be ashamed of themselves.
The rest of the WESTERN WORLD GIVE TERMINATIONS FREE OF CHARGE. 
Listen to this MAN who shoots three million live cells every time he has sex. 
It's the men that cause the problem. Cut off their dicks."
"Shameful regression of civilisation. Women have lost their rights over their own bodies and lives. Back to the Stone Age, everyone."
"For ignorant individuals like MayCøre. Science (not me) has proven 18 days after conception a heart beat can be detected, after 6 weeks brain signals can be detected.Embryo spontaneously moves around 5 to 6 weeks after conception.After 8 weeks the embryo can squint, point toes, make grasping motions and have jaw movement. The diaphragm is fully developed around this same time of 8 weeks allowing intermittent breathing motions to begin. Anybody who says these functions don't represent a living being is just being wicked. No more excuses for evil behavior and practices. We need to do better as humans,  this is absolutely sickening."
Good Decision
"The thing that I'm most grateful in my life is not been born in this ""country"".

Have people wake up and abandon it ASAP!"
It shouldn't have been allowed to begin with. How can we consider it a victory after millions of babies have been killed
"Ladies get you some evening prime rose and vit c with rosehips start taking about a week before your period is supposed to start, if your period doesn't start on time increase how much your taking, your period will come on within a week. your welcome"
It's very simple people don't have sex if you not willing to accept responsibility . Because the world has enough dumb ass people in it now and don't need more.
stop singing jesus and all bible bullshit no one believes in magic
then we see their reactions
I'm lucky that I'm in nj they still legal their.
No woman has the right to kill an innocent baby. Whether it's hers or not.

"This country is twisted asf! Women want the right to murder children with impunity and truly believe a father has no voice in her decision. The argument that a woman carries a child so she has all the say  in whether it lives or dies is complete bullshit. It's not just your body if there's another body inside of you.  NOBODY should have the right to just decide on a whim that they can kill a baby. Extreme circumstances,  I get it.  You want to dodge responsibility or don't want a baby with a certain man...GTFOH!  Women actually think that's a right,  it's not.  That wicked ass decision was rightfully reversed.  This place is doomed as it should be."
"Congrats everywhere else, you're officially more free than the United States."

"Well let me put my 2 cents about pro-life vs abortion. There was the time when arranged marriages were laughed at. It seems that people are now for many reasons  finding out the hard way that current mentality on ""I choose whom I please"", no longer works for many. Perhaps going back to old ways to arranged marriage where by not just you but your parents are also part of the arrangement is probably more morally and religeously right then going about your own way doing anything to please yourself attitude and in the process cause a big political issue not just for americans but many other countries. Do you see where we have deviated now? With arranged marriage parents play pivatol role and strenghen family ties with one another. As well in arranged marriage dignity of female is protected by him before marriage and he becomes responsible before and after marriage. This enforces the rule; marriage before kids, is probably the better way to go about. All I am saying is that we must look down way down to the crux of the issue and not debate on the issue prolife vs abortion whuch is at the surface of all issues because that is ONLY a bandage remedy."
"Thank GOD! Children may now have a RIGHT to existence! To those who thank Children are inconvenient!

"Hey America, welcome to the middle ages!"
"So let's say they woman is raped...or victim of incest. ""Aw that's an extreme case"" ok but it exists. Is the woman now forced to give birth to the perpetrators baby lol."
"HOLY BIBLE- 18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 19 Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them. 20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. 21 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
"HOLY BIBLE- 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 for which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."
"So glad to see so many logical, moral, decent voices in the comments speaking on behalf of those poor little babies who can't speak up for themselves. It's really simple, don't have sex before marriage (if he can't wait then he isn't worth it, idc how much $ he has), don't marry a piece of garbage, umm...let's see, what else, damn, I guess that's it, don't have sex before marriage & you're 👍, it's almost like people have these things called ""tradition"" for a *reason* ..."
"LoL ""right"" to an abortion, disgusting"
Women that have abortions should go on a national register. So men can know in advance that this person kills babies if it doesn’t suit her lifestyle.
"senior female in high school ranked in top 2 nationally in a sport gets recruited for a full all expenses at college and picks 1 with right wing laws ---- she  uses birth control to control severe period issues----- a team mate finds out and reports her for $10000 - she is arrested and spends up to rest of her life in prison --------------- this is the reality when idiots on SCOTUS have zero reverence for law and constitution and decides cases solely on their delusional fascist political and their church mandated edicts -   if you have miscarriage or still born due to medical reasons you fc-n go to jail BUT YOU CAN CARRY A FC-N GUN AND MURDER SOMEONE BECAUSE OF ""imagined threat""  - they are not saving lives they are cold ass fc-n killers and it WILL get worse !!!!!"
lets see - if pregnant mother goes to hospital and there are serious medical emergency issues ---- if treated the doctor{s} go to prison if not treated because of idiot laws and mother/child dies then doctor[s] go to prison or death penalty --- if it is a GOPer there is reprieve for doctor as it will be treated as non-abortion if required --------------- only options either doctors go to safer practice or hospitals refuse to treat pregnancies -------- fc-n repuplican right wingers create chaos then tell us to shove it up our ass - AND WILL NEVER ACCEPT THEIR CREated consequences
THE ONLY DEVERSTATION IT CAUSES IS THAT IT TAKES AWAY BABIES FROM ADOPTION AGENCIES...
why you carry in the pregnancy if gonna you make aborted?
Shame on you for killing the babies
The fact that these people are so emotionally overwhelmed with happiness about someone's rights being taken away makes me shudder
I was pregnant at 17 a few months before the end of year 12. I was going to have an abortion but actually miscarried the day before. Which was a blessing. Even then I still had guilt. Like it happened because the baby knew I didn’t want it. But even now I still think I would’ve went through with it. My life would’ve ended. I’d have no chance at university or any meaningful job. It’s not something people do lightly. In Australia 12 weeks pregnant is the limit. I couldn’t believe that abortion was legal up til half way through a pregnancy in America! My god! Like abortion should be legal but not past 12 weeks. That’s just wrong.
Wow. So glad to live in Australia. Even ectopic pregnancy which causes death is banned. Wow. How many women will choose not to have children? I’d have been one. I have three kids but I’d not do it if I lived in America. Death by ectopic pregnancy I don’t think so.
"Abortion is technically killing someone, if u dont want a baby just use a condom nothing stops u"
Abortion is messed up just like the people that want it abortion is murder and why kill innocent children these days people are messed up man
biden how about u teaching the el salvadorian president how its done. clamp down these criminals that operate in ur soil. good american spirit seeks justice. so in effect. gang units should b anti terrorism units. remember insurgents get smoked out they hole. no wait they in ur soil? 😦jeez
oh god. watch this b.
It’s still a baby. I don’t care if you were rapped. Name me one other crime where we punish the perpetrator’s child and not the perpetrator? What’s that? There are none? You don’t have to keep it but you do have to carry it. Cause it’s not your body. The part you want to kill is the baby’s body.
"its so crazy how these women or I will call them animal want to kill a child. this is not human or women right its just stupid.
fuck these people who support this abortion they a killer who fighting for this and there dogs who support this. 
its just sad how someone is fighting for this bullshit to kill a child."
"I guess sterile men will be the most wanted ones for dating and sleeping with , at least in USA XD"
"ok make abortion legal but charge 500,000 for that procedure, no medical insurance should pay for that it has to he out of pocket,"
A moral wrong can never be a civil right.
Wrong. The right to abortions was not struck down! You incessant liars!
I am proud of India for not banning abortion🙏🏻🇮🇳
Stop send Ellen Taylor vampire stern family garbage to us
"Abortion is the mothers choice  IF THEY CHOOSE TO GET RID OF THAT BABY that was an result of r*** or just women who didn't want  to have children.  Im sorry but i find this new rule, Disgusting, wrong.   Im a person who's never gonna have kids or want kids."
WONDERFUL NEWS!!!!!
Sorry ladies feeding starving children out here is a bigger problem then having rights to terminate just because you didn’t protect yourself now I’m not talking about those who were assaulted or have health concerns no I’m talking abbot those ladies who are reckless and have no care until it’s too late and think they can just go abort a baby becatse they were reckless
"Rights are things humans are given by God. Hence, a government cannot truly give or take away rights, but simply affirm or deny a citizen to exercise those rights that are already inherent.

There has never been, and never will be, a right for anyone to kill an unborn human being in order to end a pregnancy.

However, there has always been a right for human beings, especially the innocent, to live.

We must care for both women and babies. And, we must bring masculinity and fatherhood back.

Love the woman. Love the baby. Love the man.

Love all three."
"The propaganda that a woman's bodily autonomy rights include the right to have her unborn child killed, is the greatest, most nefarious, and most sinister act of what I would call ""the government being a simp,"" in the history of the world.

Because telling women, or anybody, that they can do anything they want, even when those actions harm other people, is an act of pandering to them, illogically and unjustly. And this is what being a simp is.

Women's rights made many good things happen: it was right and just for us to rectify situations such as unequal pay, sexual assault and rape, and other inequalities between men and women. 

However, selling the killing of the unborn as a 'woman's right' is the greatest act  of being a simp conducted by a person or group of people in world history. It is mass deception at its worst."
"So it'll all go underground.🙈🙈😭

This is like the handmaids tale come to life controlling what women do with their bodies!!!!
Wow that’s so messed up !! You guys are living in mediaeval days where abortions will be done with coathangers in doctors back rooms off houses
"Good bless the men and women, black and white Supreme Court judges, a just decision was reached by the most diverse Supreme Court judges yet."
"This is actually a good step, at least now younger women will think twice about contraception"
For me this is not about abortion it's about how the supreme court and how the US is out together like a patch work quilt.
"QUESTIONS TO THE WOMEN'S ??
HOW CAN YOU CLAIM TO BE A WOMAN'S, WITH EMOTIONS and PLEASURES,  IF YOU REFUSE TO HAVE BABY,  IT,S CRIME TO KILL INDEFENSIBLE HUMAN,  IT,S TRUTH IS YOUR BODY, BUT EACH ONE OF USED ON OTHERS BODY TO BORN AND LET YOU BORN. "" AMAZING GOD HE WRAPS THE BABY INSIDE "" EMOTIONS AND PLEASURES,"
Those people got nothing to do. Too much time on their hand.
"Seing all those women celebrate this news with so much passion, like it's the most important thing and They can't see the fact all women had lost something way more important like deprivation of their right to make decisions about their own bodies and lives  that is going to effect their whole life is just terrifying.."
Abortion shouldn’t be banned abortion should still be legal under certain circumstances if the baby isn’t going to survive if the mother can’t physically have the baby safely if the pregnancy is threatening the mother’s life or if the pregnancy was the result of rape those are real legitimate reasons for abortion where the mother would actually need it.
"Let’s just all move to Canada 🇨🇦 
It’s already so much better there."
Right to abortion struck down? Really? You flat out liars
Isn’t it nice to just make up imaginary problems???
they going crazy in america
"Women should put more effort into preventing unwanted pregnancy. Why don’t we hear more talk about this??? For all the stress, the cost involved and effort to go to another state- seems to me people ought to be focused more on preventing it in the first place. I see the efforts to create funds to fly women out of state once pregnant- I have yet to see a single effort by the same folks to establish free birth control programs for all those women I hear about who don’t have access to birth control and/or they can’t afford to pay for birth control. It’s always been one of the primary arguments I’ve heard from people defending abortion. So where’s the efforts to get these women free birth control? Seems to me it would be hugely more cost effective and you’d reach a lot more women than any effort to fly them to get an abortion. Not to mention aren’t Democrats all about the green energy agenda? Surely you wouldn’t want to add to the carbon footprint flying millions of women to their abortions if you could just prevent as many as possible? Preventing pregnancy doesn’t appear to be a priority. WEIRD."
Goodluck because soon as they dropped out these unwanted children orphans are gonna sky rocket.
it's sad that they just only care about unborn baby(fetus) but not the living children right now.
lets ask pro lifers to take care of all the children then :))))
ahahaha this hapened for a reason that god made so dont get made now because you wanna KILL BABIES whats wrong with people?????
"Maybe some people should at the very least, read our constitution once in their life. before spouting ignorant responses."
"The women who supported the ban of abortion I hope they go through the most difficult hardships of life and raise a child they never wanted ... The child will grow feeling  not loved and not wanted will probably suffer from  malnutrition and might kill their own parents for giving birth to them , oh wait that has happened before in the past.."
"You want to be salty, leftists? Then you should have played the game better. You focused only on Washington, as if that is the be all and end all of politics. You've never been able to do the long game, not like us. You've always put the primacy of what you're feeling over the ability to see the bigger picture. We told you that you'd live to regret it when Harry Reid nuked the judicial filibuster, we warned you, but you did not listen. All that mattered was you wanted something, and there was an obstacle in your way, and you wanted to get rid of the obstacle. But us? We worked for this for *decades.* We played by the rules, elected pro-life Republicans not only on the federal but the state and local level as well, we advanced pro-life judges, we advocated, we used lobbyists to shape and alter policy and frame the debate. We began working at Roe's downfall before the ink on the ruling was even dry. We labored patiently for more than thirty years to bring about this exact moment, and God, is it sweet. 

We played the game of thrones, and we beat you. You hear me, leftists? We *beat* you! You don't like how defeat tastes? Then you should have realized that political influence does not begin and end in the White House. While you were focused on winning the presidency, we swept you out of dozens of state legislatures and governorships. While you were focused on the Supreme Court, we nominated conservative judges to the lower courts, too many to count. It's so funny, watching you open your eyes, seeing your horror at the realization of just how thoroughly you've been outmaneuvered--not just today, but for many, many years. 

And in November, we're going to kick your ass all over again. God willing, there will be a red wave so great it will take you *years* to recover."
"Question for everyone here, I have a neighbor who is pro-life, and since apparently pro-lifers are at war against women I am worried for her safety. I tried calling the police but they don't do anything. Would it be better for me to call the police to help her, or just go there myself and save her?"
I luv how societies are still trying to figure out wats right or wrong and an illiterate man told us wat to do 1400 years ago
Why are you ALIVE? When is death NOT a promise of your coming?
"The lawyers now need to take this matter to courts as a matter of self-defence. If those central states American bogans want to imply that a woman violated by rape is murdering a child through abortion, or that a woman at risk from death through physical or mental health complications is commiting a murder by protecting herself, then they are forcing this to the next level of evolutionary debate - what is a fetus? The fetus is a parasite, it consumes the woman's food, it makes the woman ill, it tricks the woman's body and mind hormonally, and it can kill the woman by over-growing and squashing the woman's vital organs, THEREFORE the matter of murder by abortion is also a matter of self-defence by abortion. Make no mistake, it is those power abusing churchy bogans that separated the two and created the woman vs fetus discourse by implying murder, and this reasoning now is the consequence."
"Dear Americans some of you think this law is not right for your freedom....
So kindly read mine comment fully  if u have guts(especially non supporters)👍

So I'm going to tell real stuff what actually will happenes if abortion continues...

So the answer is NOTHING!

SCOTUS finally sent this issue back to the states, which is where it should have been all along. Your title is misleading and incorrect, perhaps you should look into things more closely before reporting on them."
I don't understand. Do they expect the kids that will be born from that decision to be okay? Like they can't even keep children from abuse. Now they are adding more to the problem.
What will be next? Will de woman be punished if she miscarriage to. It is the natural way for the body to abort the child.
condom sales 📈📈📈
"When you speak much about speaking on women's right and right to choose, consider these too; 
1.)Like toddler or adolescent, the terms embryo and fetus do not refer to nonhumans, but to humans at particular stages of development.
2) No matter how much better it sounds, “terminating a pregnancy” is still terminating a life.
3) The one-time choice of abortion robs someone else of a lifetime of choices and prevents him from ever exercising his rights."
So it is better to have the baby you dont want. Maybe get depressed and maybe end up killing the child.
"My body my choice what a disgusting quote, in this day and age women who don't want babies should be taking contraception, it's lazy irresponsible females who are literally using abortion as a form of contriception, shame on all of you, to feel its OK to kill your own baby is mind boggling."

It's a teachers duty to encourage students to come out as LGBTQI+ZXP
Little children belong at gay bars and drag strip shows
It's a birthing person's human right to terminate the life of their unborn child

...Am I wrong?"
Biden is just an evil old guy
It’s demonic calling a child a choice what is wrong with them
Thank you jesus

All abortionists and those who wanted it should have been aborted by their mothers since it's ok anyway.
"Abortion had become an excuse for immoral sexual acts. It is clearly an act of murder against an innocent hopeless unborn life. It is frightening how great and horrible this killing of unborn babies are. GOD ALMIGHTY'S TRUTH AND JUSTICE REIGNS for trillions of babies murdered in this horrible way,it's selfish and arrogant,no matter how men and women try to make it their human right to kill babies. And fetuses made as beauty condiments.Sickening."
"Honestly Im so glad i live in Europe. In my opinion, America is fucked up."
"Calling abortion a ""human right"" is like calling a slavery a form of employement, it's so ridiculously, outlandishly false and awful it shouldn't even be disccused as such."
Where would you be today if your mother had decided to abort your dumbass?  Think about that.
"Banning Abortion, will not stop abortion, it will kill many women because of unsafety methods, children can't give birth they will die on their beds or they will suffer from it. This is a big trauma for all victims. I'm glad living in europe, but it is concerning that young mothers end on streets with their Babies, the spirale will go on, those Babies will get molested, will suffer and have hunger. Who is gonna help them. When women have support and the right age, they will not consider to abort, they will provide their children with love. But how when they are rapevictims, victims of a violent and abusive husbands, boyfriends, poverty. No man should talk about killing Babies. Those men are willing to bring misery into the world. Barely adopt, most of the kids end up in hands of abusive people. USA has so many homeless and poor people. More concerning, I love my country Switzerland we have excellent help and everyone has in our country Health Insurance, for the poor it is covered by our government. Those girls can't not even have a save C-Section.. how they will pay the medical Bills. So much wrong in some states of USA."
"This is bad and good at the same time  imo. People should control having sex before marriage and, use condoms, not creating the mistake to kill an innocent unconscious human and on the other hand feel sorry for poor people and man who will pay for it and women who will take care of it and the children who will grow up Knowing i was not wanted by their parents and sometimes wished to be killed."
"The Republican Supreme Court are rape and incest supporters. I think they are demented. What Amy doesn't get is when they get all they can from her, she will be gone too. Same for the women that support this insane crap. The women in this country are not free. We are disrespected as we always have been since the beginning of mankind. I think Justice Thomas is a dirty old man with too much power and I think the rest of them fit right in there. I had an ancestor that served as justice on the Supreme Court as well as his son. They would be ashamed of this court. Instead of gaining freedoms, we are losing them. I will never understand why little men with little penises think they should be telling everyone else what to do with their lives. They work for us. We pay their wages. There is no place else in this country that the employees tell management what to do. They don't pay our bills or suffer our struggles. These disgusting Republican Justices have no idea what the average person struggles with in this country. They are ignorant of the people they are supposed to serve or they really don't give a damn. Probably the later of the two. We need to vote and get so many we can make abortion part of the Constitution as well as voter rights and marriage equality. We need to outlaw assault weapons so the people in this country are safer."
"Would a woman say: ""Live won today"" , into the face of a woman that got raped. Or a woman that dies if she gets the baby."
Maybe you should be less religious and more human. I can´t believe this is happening in 2022.
Why don't they focus on giving young girls birth controls instead of always fighting over abortion get them all on brake controls and then they won't have this problem
"Good thing these pro abortionist didn't get murdered by their mothers out of inconvenience. Even if it's a product abuse, its not like the kid is the one who abuse you. But im pretty sure majority of these unwanted pregnancy comes from poor judgement between a man and a woman. If you don't want to get pregnant then dont engage in sex. So stop whoring out.

Good for you america for not killing your sons and daughters just because its inconvenient of their lives to raise a kid."

Imagine your parents having sex and giving birth to like 15 kids and they die in car accident and what if there are like 20 more families whose guardian die due ti health issueu or anything else so welcome we have 300 orphans directly in a month which might could have only be 30 if these genius ppls could have understood

"This is an attack on the state by the church, in defense of religious freedom. There are those who believe that only God, can justify any laws, of any type, imposed upon society. They will contact God, and get back to you with his response. ""We only need one book"". (Mike Flynn's favorite Trumper call) the religious right, evangelicals, multi-branded christians, fundamentalist, anarchist, and Zionist Armageddon enthusiasts, lds, adventist, catholics, Jehovah's witnesses, and pseudo devout jet setters, and various holy water grifters, dime store spiritualists, accompanied by a gaggle of Bible thumpers, heck maybe it's just everyone with tax-free status, all of their religious liberties have long been violated by the concept of church and state remaining separate. Don't we all realize that the laws of men condone evil ? Americans will not bow to earthly kings, the Black robes  will deliver Us to his kingdom. The women of this country, have little to worry about, other than how they look in a red veil. Progress is a word, but this crap is,.. time travel, in the opposite direction. Orwellian, has at last, arrived. Please see our vineyard line of beverages, barefoot and pregnant Rose, was just declared half off by the Jack leg court, formerly known as supreme. This is a medical issue, and there's no way around that so the women of this country deserve to consult physicians, not just listen to guys who want to play doctor. It is an absolute insult, and negligence in regards to women's healthcare, to allow unqualified officials, to deem it acceptable, to endanger the lives of , and be complicit in the mistreatment of women. Thomas, and Kavanaugh,, should both go blank themselves and stop trying to blank everyone else. Okay I think I'm done, now roar ladies."

"Approximately 1% of all abortions result in the mother's death

Since 1973 to present 44 million abortions have been performed in the United States.

That's 440, 000 women who have died getting illegal abortion. 

You had the impression it was completely safe right? 

You paid them approximately $1,000 to kill your kid and they killed you and your kid -- your choice?  

Did you even consider the fact that you could die?

Did you consider the fact that they could screw up your uterus?

Did you consider the fact that you will regret that decision to kill your child  for the rest of your life?"
"Women celebrating the fact that they just lost one of their rights😂
The USA is going backwards."
I always thought the US had a constitution that disallowed religious belief to sway the country. Seems not.
"This is so ridiculous. They really don't care about the consequences for the women. Maybe they aren't in the right state of mind to actually give birth and properly take care of one. Of course, there are many more reasons on why they could be getting an abortion. ""EvErY BaBy DeSeRvEs A lIfE"" my ass, it will probably be put up for adoption and end up not being taken in because the centres are overfilled with others that won't be adopted either. They won't have a bright future. I don't live in the USA, so hope you guys will do well. Sending lots of love ♡"
Doctors are crying because they're running out of business
it isn't 'termination' it is killing the baby in the womb
"If liberal facebook and youtube would allow what abortion really is, really does, show the aborted baby, you'd have less baby killing"
You would think they would make an exception for rape and incest I just find it odd that they didn’t?
It's quite simple if you don't want to get pregnant try going on the pill. Even better try wearing a condom. What you selfish tarts are doing is murder it's know different than some one shooting a school up. Murder is murder. To all women try keeping your legs closed permanently 😜😜.
"Another ""Smart"" Move from the U.S.A. What a shock..."
"Be precise broadcaster....

It should be 50 years of murdering defenseless babies. 

The constitution does not favor such evil. 

Let them stop having sex... since they are not ready to be responsible.

It is a crime against babies in the womb... why? Because it is murdered... you make look good by calling it abortion.

Your body your choice? Which part of the baby did you create? The baby was formed in your womb by the Holy Spirit... good or bad means that got you pregnant. Job 33:4; Jeremiah 1:5; Psalm 100:3

God put the seed in the man... the man put the seed in the woman and the Holy Spirit transform the seed into a babygirl or a baby boy.

6 weeks in the womb... God the Son  breath into the baby nostrils and he or she becomes a living soul the womb.

Complication... is a different situation that could lead to the mother living and God's creation in the womb returning to heaven... 

We all are the seed of God... His image and likeness (Genesis 1:26,27; Genesis 4:25-26

Satan is the greatest deceiver and liar that is destroying the human race. (Revelation 12:9; John 10:10; John 8:44).

Get pregnant when you are ready to be a father and mother."

No one should have the right to tell a women what to do with her body. Take away abortion rights but it’s legal for a women to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes.

"In MY OPINION,  Abortion should be allowed as long as it's done within the first trimester of pregnancy. And only people with certain circumstances should be able to have it done."
It’s a woman’s body and right!! Damn you people
"Well this is why left leaning media has lost credibility with most people who run on facts and historical precedent rather than emotion and identity politics. BBC used to be a fairly unbiased source of news. There is not now nor has there ever been a “constitutional right to abortion” the privacy argument doesn’t stand up to even the smallest amount of legal scrutiny. What happened was a gross over reach by one branch of government was corrected and the issue was turned back over to congress and or state legislatures where it has always belonged. Congress (both houses controlled by the left) has the power to codify Roe but they won’t because abortions after the third trimester aren’t as popular as the left would have you believe. If the left had left Mississippi alone in banning abortion after 15 weeks (two weeks later than France BTW) the Supreme Court wouldn’t have gotten involved. But hey BBC don’t let facts or information get in the way of your push for on demand abortions up to birth. Personally I’m going to stick with Bill Clinton on this one “safe, legal and rare”. Try selling that instead of “hAnD mAiDs tAlE” and you’ll find ally’s on the left and right."
"The ""baby"" unborn is not a live, it's the mother's blood"
"0:17 “abortion guaranteed by the constitution.” I’m not advocating for either side here, but isn’t this a lie? I thought that was the whole point, that abortion wasn’t in the constitution to begin with."
"Weed has been illegal for years, I just feel like, if people want an abortion, we are just going to develop a certain street market of sorts in it's place. Idk how a woman could live with herself if she was raped, and then was forced to keep the child. I would want any politicians head after that. speaking honestly"
"About interrace marriages, you mean as something that should be federal not state by state? If so, fair enough and I'm sorry for overlooking.

As for constitutional amendments, that should be just one way to do it, not the only way ok guys?"
"The US the country where you can buy an AR 15 with age 18, where woman can engage in hardcore porn with 18.... but its not allowed to drink a  beer at age 18...
And the newest: Where even an 11 year old girl even if it got raped is forced to carry out the child and raise the genetics of her abuser...What a shitshow the US is...."
"""It's her body, her choice"", yes it's her body, but so what, every single one of us was once in a woman's body. Using that logic, that would make you your mother's property and she has the right to decide everything concerning you from the moment your born until the day you die! If all your mothers reasoned that way, you ""pro-abortion"" people wouldn't be here commenting your ""rights"" on youtube."
Now America is like the Taliban regime of huge Catholic religious country... So sad... A country's  political system should not be interfered by a particular religious belief....
Absolutely disgusting to see people celebrating SCOTUS' anti-democratic act after they lied to Congress and the American people. Women will die because of the anti-life GQP judges. No surprise rapist Brett hates abortion. Black women will suffer the most from this. Truly just another form of white supremacy destroying the USA as they strip rights away from women from rewarding rapists. Republicans do nothing for actual poor children or those in the foster care system. It has nothing to do about protecting kids or life.
It's better to never born rather than die everyday where you are unwanted.

"Abortion law change is that to stop abortions? Bcos that means less population and we already suffering lower levels per generation but higher debts. To keep the $ Ponzi scheme alive they need a larger population to take on the new debt. To pay off the old Debt and on and on we go. Until now this is THE END OF THE ROAD watch that video to see. I think the abortion law is this reason.

It also sounds like the original law dates back to 1971 too when the Ponzi scheme started when they removed the gold standard. 50yrs ago. Now the population is shrinking and the debt is higher than ever who will pay it off? Stop aborting babies you monsters. 

It makes sense doesn't it.

Search the video END OF THE ROAD that will teach you all you need to know on the currency Ponzi scheme. A monetary completly backed by debt but now we are so heavily in debt we cant take more and we cant pay it off. So we need a baby boom. Let them pay it off. Or shpould i say Americans pay it off since the $ is the main player."

Like being sexualized because of their chest and butt so i call bull-crap for trump to say ""god he intended for this to happen"" and that's why i wanted hillary Clinton to be the president instead of him its just not right..."

"life must be respected in all of its forms. Whether in the womb or outside womb.

They would rather sell guns to you all so you can all kill and hurt eachother, then give someone a right to chose if they want to have a child or not. 
How can your leaders turn a blind eye to the school shootings/gun violence that consistently happens in your country.
That kills children and every other age everyday.
How can you jump and scream about abortions yet people die everyday because of your gun laws.
When I think of America I think - 
Stupid, Ignorant, Views characters based on race, Unworthy, Sells Soul to Devil/A dollar, No dignity, No grace, Unworthy, Confused, Blind, Distracted."
So abortion is illegal but it’s okay for people to buy guns and stuff and kill people… I don’t understand America’s logic….
"« Woman will die from botched abortions....» she argues that women will die, but children who are murdered, that's okay!"
maybe a strange thing to say but if those people that cant get abortions die cuz of it cant they SEW the pants of the Suprime court? and if a prolifer gets r@ped and ends up prego she'll have to bring the child into the world and destroy there mental health to do that?
Then why not make a law for these pro life people to adopt these unwanted babies and take care of the baby? I mean they are so loving and kind and I know they will make wonderful parents...
"Birth rates are declining in America and have been for  years!! this is much bigger than people's feelings, no children means no future!!!!"
What about if a girl is assaulted? What if a teenage girl is r@ped and gets pregnant and can't afford to care..
"All actions have consequences. To be clear, people have the right to choose. However, if you choose to kill, you will suffer the consequences of that action. The question people need to consider: Is one moment of convenience worth that consequence? Furthermore, if you act on your right to choose to do something, others should have the right to act on their choice to prevent you from doing it or act on their right to choose to punish you for doing it. 

This is why we have laws and why those laws should reflect the highest moral standards of the society they serve. A law that simply protects a right to choose is not moral as morality is something that can be chosen. We can choose to follow the laws, we can choose to be moral, these choices can be arbitrary but like all choices, acting on them have consequences. An arbitrary law will not be just and by default becomes immoral. Law and morality need to be absolute to promote order and deliver justice, without absolute laws and morality, we will have chaos and injustice.

Abortion is not moral because it is both an action and a choice to commit that action. Abortion is in fact immoral because morality will determine that an unborn baby has the right to live just as you or I have the right to live. Therefore If a law protects that choice then the law becomes unjust and ultimately immoral.

This is a bit of logic wordplay and I hope it promotes some critical thought. Feel free to choose to listen to it, or not; but your choice will not change morality no matter how much you seek to justify your actions"
And also this is just a attack on woman as are men still allowed the snip

"How can abortion, which is an act of taking one's life, even be considered as one's right? Abortion is a result of a conscience totally blocked by selfishness."
At this point I wonder what other nations think of America
"For me, this is largely a battle between two extreme groups. Religious fundamentalists on the one side and modern feminists on the other. 

One group is advocating for a complete ban and the other group is demanding abortion on demand. 

I think both groups have something of value to say on this issue. I don't believe the issue is as binary as the protesters make out on both sides. It is for them of course. However, there are options that don't entail either of the extreme positions. Obviously, I am talking about abortion permitted in some cases and not others. 

I would find it difficult to endorse an abortion because a pregnant woman was recently offered a promotion at work and decides to change her mind about the pregnancy so she can earn more money. On the other hand, if a woman who is ill and is going to give birth to a child with profound disabilities I could not condemn their choice to have an abortion. I know these are extreme cases but this is my point. Extreme cases are not common (by definition) but they definitely can happen and probably do - given the size of the population. 

I hope the debate turns away from the two extreme positions to having an ethical and political discussion that acknowledges gray areas and attempts to develop a policy that takes everyone's thinking into account.

Meaningful dialogue is extremely difficult when emotions are so high and people are so certain of their position. It's understandable."

"In America:

5year punishment for rape 15 year punishment for abortion. They think this law will help the unborn babies. But they are forgetting that until the baby is born it is in the women's body so the Unborn baby is nothing but a part of the women's body, just a fetus. And what about the underage girls dying because they can't bear the pain of labour. Or the women who got raped and needs to abort the child. US is trying it's best to kill women mentally and physically.And toxic men are a biggest part of the problem. As it so easy for men to get off everything. They don't have a fair punishment for rape. Don't want to pay for child support. And they act like they have done nothing,they have not ruined and destroyed the life of women at all. Seems like the Dark age of America has already started and it's time for revolution. Otherwise we can't even imagine the number of women dyingeveryday in America because of emotional and physical pain. And it seems like US will keep making dumb laws until women has no right and freedom at all in US."
This law is worst without abortion ur killing more woman and baby with that law and kids won’t be abandoned do they want kids to be out on the cold or be in the orphanage America shouldn’t be like China look how they country turn out with so many people
Better don't get laid
United States of Amerika  keep this up. its fun to see you run in circles. makes us see how good we have it when we see things from you.
They will care about a woman getting abortion but once the child is born they will leave them alone and let them suffer
People that are pro abortions always use rape to defend their arguments. But the truth is abortions are mostly done by women who can't keep their legs close and use protections. Now you be blaming the fetus growing inside of you. Abortions could also weakens the uterus of a woman. This law is clearly to protect women.
"There appear to be about eight states effectively banning abortion, which to me seems absurd. However, many, possibly most states have generally more lenient abortion laws that the UK. Do people really think that it ought to be okay to abort babies, on demand, right up to birth? There appear to be seven states where there is no limit on age of gestation where an abortion can be given on demand. Is it not murder to kill a fetus that is sufficiently developed to survive outside the mother?"
"At the end of the day, a government using your body as a resource without your consent is a human rights violation, end of. This is the government using women as incubators, their autonomy be damned. It’s a human rights violation. Keep your religion and your faith out of my uterus."

Obama ran on the promise that he would codify the ruling, then once in office he stated that he had more important issues to deal with.  Larry Elder did a show on this and showed clips of Obama lying and then, after elected, of him giving women the FU finger on the issue.  Larry Elder also showed an old  clip  of Biden when he had a functioning brain. He was surprisingly eloquent and though pro-choice, compassionately stated that more help was needed for sex education, and more so, help was needed to help pregnant women to be willing to give birth and not choose abortion as the answer to an unplanned pregnancy. If Republicans took his stance they would mow down the Left in elections."

"Ironic thing is that pro life are gorgeous sexy women who would be getting laid all the time and would probably need abortions, whilst the pro choice are rough, ugly munters who would only get laid by desperate, suicidal guys and would not really need abortions anyway. funny that isn't it?!"
Pretty soon anyways there will be one world government and new world order and new world religion and many people are about ready to bow to the evil man of sin and lawlessness the antichrist
How much is condoms in the USA by the way?🤔
"2:17 😂😂😂
""Willing of the people""; 21y and she's afraid of this law! Oh God help me😂😂😂"
"If you are terrified don't have sex.
Sex is optional"
LETS FREAKING GO NO MORE ABORTION NERDS LES GOOOOOOO!
Women in China have right to choose. Isn't this a part of human rights?
Misleading title. The Supreme court did nothing of the sort. All they've done is uphold the rights for States to have their own law. Abortion is constitutionally not a Federal issue.
"They say that they don't have the facts, when DOCTORS are SCREAMING AT THEM HOW WRONG THIS IS!!!!"
"Any woman supporting the overturning of r v w, supports tyranny. This is disgusting. They're going after the gay community and interracial marriages next. Oh and the Child Indian welfare act too. #WAKEUP #weneedhelp #americaisnotokay"
"And It could all be solved by having responsability in your life...
...you don't get pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
Progressive feminism is all about avoiding as much responsabilirty as possible."
"Democracy is definitely going down the toilet... women can't get tubaligations without male approval,  now no more Roe vs Wade, and talks of no birth control pills or long term birth control.... the Government will now be ruling women.... so a half dictatorship since men can get vasectomy without having to obtain permission first. Adoption system that is broke. It's a very sad day in America and probably for a long time to come."
"The only reason abortion is being banned is MONEY. It costs $10,000 to have a baby in a hospital in America. Babies = Money.  America is enslaved.  'Nuff said."
I feel ashame to be human. This is a huge mistake and people are in danger now. Shame on you . This is a step back to medevil times.
5:12 hi sir do u eat meat?
"So... if we need laws to ensure that women are treated as equals, does that mean men are naturally misogynistic? I'm so confused."
This is devastating.
Stop killing baby's
"This is so heartbreaking. I'm usually very opinionated on political issues, but I honestly don't know what to believe here. As a woman I understand how terrifying this is, but I'm conflicted. I hate the idea of people using abortion as a method on contraception and it does happen. I also hate the idea of coathanger abortions and women dying. I hate the idea of having to chose between keeping a child that was a result of a traumatic rape and sending your own offspring into an unjust foster system where they're likely to experience hardship and their own trauma. There will be so many more babies, making it harder to find responsible people to adopt them. We need to reform the foster system if this is our new reality. The Jesus loves me people also need to chill, we have freedom of religion and if you pass a law like this it needs to be because you think a fetus is a human, not because you're a religious extremist."
They will want to ban condoms next. Because they are killing sperms that would of made life.
Means you want to just enjoy with no responsibility in the name of Rights. In exceptional circumstances it should be allowed else sustained.
It's  all about control
"The thing is that the free world really needs America right now, and America is at war with itself against these extremist religious zealots trying to impose their unreasonable views on everyone. It really is becoming Gilead, and making a spectacle of itself and losing all international credibility at the same time. And where does that leave the rest of the world, with America lost like this? Hopefully not regress to the UK and the roots of all this rubbish society? Hopefully it leads the rest of us to see the fruits of basing a society on pillars of greed and vanity, and how like an insidious lie it festers eventually fractures the psyche of a whole civilization to the point they are just at constant war with themselves and can’t even function to solve the simplest of civic problems once they become apparent - such as not having citizens shooting up children in classrooms for example. Seriously please wake up!!"
"It gives you stupid pests 16 weeks to get an abortion, stop being selfish pigs… don’t worry though… you’ll burn in hell eventually"
"""I thought this country would still care about women"" Hmmm, do tell, what is a woman?"
They are not women they are ????????
Say God not Jesus  Jesus not God (dog)
"Just keep your leg cross

You women respect your self 
and do what reall God tell you  . not what the filthy bible you have now

I see people saying that they are soical workers and explain and explain how their lives will end up badly and our only solution is by murdering them. wow
"Something else that has been overlooked & is terribly sad is this decision will cause a wind back to a time where unsafe home abortions & death of babies in horrible ways will be increased to millions, instead of in safe hospital or clinic situations."
"A terribly sad story of forced child birth. 

A member of my family was violently raped & tortured, then she was forced to have the baby by religious anti abortion beliefs. 

It led do decades of sorrow & an abandoned baby. The mother was forced to keep the rapist's baby, but lost her mind from being forced to have the baby. 

The baby grew up to have the genetics & violence of the rapist. The mother could not cope with being forced to have the baby & it had to be given to its grand parents where it grew up to beat them & threaten them constantly with vicious attacks, causing absolute fear, terrible scars & horror for life. It was a shocking situation. 

I dont agree with the vicious way anti abortionists attack women to take away their rights, even though they are trying to give the unborn baby its rights instead. The religious & riches morel beliefs that forced her as a young girl to have this baby under such trauma, are the ones responsible for her terrorizing & ongoing torture, & are more responsible for that baby than she was for being raped as a young girl. She did not want the baby she was forced.

I believe if she had been given the right to choose her own fate over her body, instead of being forced to loose her life from anti abortionists, Instead of a life of sorrow & not being able to ever look at that rapists baby, she was forced to have. She might have had a life instead, perhaps met someone she loved & had her own baby to hold & love instead of being forced to have a rapists baby she was never able to except or love when she was a young broken raped girl, which caused her to never have a relationship or love."
'I'm 21 and I'm terrified!' Ever heard of contraception?
"I mean ... US ... what would you expect from people who believe earth is flat and 5g towers cause Covid
Its no surprise they will get inspired by muslims and let superstition dictate their way of life 😀"
"To those who write about adoption services being substandard Do a bit of historical sleuthing.
Sure abandoned kids don’t get adopted into decent homes! 
When Roe vs Wade became law in ‘73, by the following year ALL THE GD  FUNDING for adoption services Dried-up like the vaginal canal of a 60 year old women!  Trust a nurse who KNOWS!"
"What BRITISH MORONS BBC are. Abortion is not only…
 NOT guaranteed by our CONSTITUTION…(BBC writers & reporters are so Brain Dead  they’re almost as goofy & Senile as Biden)
…. The WORD ABORTION DOES NOT EVEN APPEAR IN IT!"
"Your body your choice 🤔, then don’t get pregnant. Use condoms take pills you selfish ignorants. All you want is to have sex without talking any responsibilities. Disgusting ignorants"
when the world is preparing for war we all know that laws that prevent a country's survival will be thrown out the window.
"Some of American women are fighting for thier abortion rights, 
Hey! your Lust is the problem.."
"I like Trump coz he oppose abortion he is pro life,"

This videos comment section is  a battle
It won't stop it it will just make it more dangerous
I'm so scared
"23/06/22 US lady who miscarried in Malta.The baby was brain dead,the mother in danger of sepsis.Abortion is illegal in Malta. Had to fly to Spain for her health care.
     Much like the founding Pilgrims……who hung Mary Dyer,a Quaker,who wanted to worship in her own way……Republicans are pale,stale males…..intolerant and out of touch with reality !"
Wow! God must be sad to see His babies killed. If only you turn to God that He'll help you with your born babies so you won't have to underestimate His power and kill your unborn babies. Your conscience which God created in you will follow you all the days of your lives! The regret of killing your own babies in the womb! A wicked and unrepentant world will face God's judgement someday! Wake up! Repent!
"How about we stop acting like wild, horny banshees, humping all the time.  Stop crying about healthcare.  Healthcare is taking responsibility of your body before you conceive a child then destroy it!!!"
Why kill the babies when you can use protection during sex. It just makes me wonder either the American girls/women never knew bout protection or they just simply want to kill.. I'd rather have a hysterectomy than killing the innocent souls inside of me.
America is a Christian state hence proved
"Before exporting democracy to other countries, apply democracy to your home."
"Think about this for a second. All of a sudden their decision makes a lot more sense.
""The Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-212) is a United States law that RECOGNIZES an EMBRYO or FETUS in utero as a legal VICTIM if they are injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed federal crimes of violence.""
So you kick a pregnant mother, she loses the baby (embryo or fetus) and it's a FEDERAL CRIME...but abortion on demand anywhere in the US is just fine????"
"I wish those anti-abortion protestors get raped and come pregnant. ooops, I forgot many of them can't carry a child."
"Women say it’s their body, if it’s entirely true, when did they make it? If your mother had followed the same ethos and aborted you, where would you be? It’s better to live a sad life for not aborting, than to commit murder, live a freer life but end up in hell torment."
At how many months is it not ok to abort a baby lefties?
Maybe the EU should make rules for all the countries in EU. The president is not king bbc.
The entire supreme court should be an abortion
So if someone is raped they cannot abort? That’s just evil
"Condoms, pill, don't have sex when drunk."
FINALLY!!!
Look At All Them People That Support Killing Babies! You People That Support This Our Blessed That Your Love Ones Never Had You Aborted! You Can Live To Talk About It! The Babies You Support To Abort Can Not Live To Talk About It! Shame On You! Its A Sin Just To Support It! Every Time You Support It! Your Killing In The Eyes Of God! Do You Love SATAN?
"IT's okay ladies.  Now when you are getting your vag smashed, just have your cuck boyfriend pull his dick out at the last moment and you won't get pregnant.  Or you could just use condoms and or birth control like responsible adults, but YOUR body YOUR choice huh?"
Abortion is murder.
America be like that drunk guy trying to get home. 2 steps forward 5 steps backwards
"Wait so what if the pregnancy can risk the mothers life? The issue with this ruling is that there is not in between if you go having sex all around and have a baby without protection shame on you and honestly you should be allowed to have an abortion. But if you get raped, or have a baby that will die at birth or the babies birth can potentially kill the mother that's just not fair. There's a lot of issues with this on both sides and it's kinda sad tbh"
FYI: the U S constitution has never guaranteed a woman's right to an abortion you idiot.
What would you think if your husband has sex with another woman.  His body his choice right?
ahh the biased BBC of Davos clan. yall sure can put out some hit piece garbage propaganda and i dont know how you pull that off with the trusted news initiative thing that started to stop the spread of information.
"*PRAYER IS POWERFUL. Please pray for the people who have demons inside them to ban the demons from their body forever in the name of Jesus.

It's funny how the pro lifers are only pro life till the kid is born then they don't care if that child is left in a bin or dead or in a hospital. Loads of people could die from giving birth.

Yes it is auch better world
"Let’s face it, the child of an unwanted pregnancy is already dead. All animals need a mother who cares. Abortion is not saving the child."
"And suddenly Americans know exactly what a woman is.
I'd feel sorry for these backward losers, but they brought it on themselves."
"Do fetuses have the right to life?

The argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong.
I will simply assume, instead of proving, that your murder is seriously wrong.
I will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder.
Finally, I will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issues to which this analysis of abortion ethics may lead.
The symmetries arising from the analysis of the main arguments on both sides of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult.
Consider the following standard argument against abortion: Fetuses are both human and alive. People have the right to life.
Therefore, fetuses have the right to life. Of course, women have the right to control their own body, but the right to life goes beyond a woman's right to control her own body.
Therefore, abortion is wrong.
The fetus' right to life does not include his right to use someone else's body to preserve his life.
However, an opponent of abortion may point out that a woman's right to use her body does not include her right to end someone else's life in order to do what she wants with her body.
In response, one might argue that a pregnant woman's right to control her body is not much, if it is wrong, to take any action that ends the life of the fetus within her.
However, an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus' right to life does not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses.
The consequence of all these symmetries seems to be a stalemate.
But if we have an attitude, then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of rights, a fetal right to life versus a woman's right to control her body.
One could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control one's own body in the case of abortion, because the loss of one's life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control one's own body, a respect for nine months.
Therefore, the right to life prevails over the right to control one's own body and abortion is wrong."
It seems states are tired of paying for peeps that lay down with no responsibility.
Life is respected and valued again.
So this is the American freedom lmao
What the fuck America
A nation destroyed by its enemies can rise again…but the one which crumbles from within… that’s dead
Abortion rights are human rights.
“Rights aren’t rights if someone can take them away. They’re privileges. That’s all we’ve ever had in this country is a bill of temporary privileges.” George Carlin.
Keep fighting women 💪
Banning abortion just creates a new welfare state.  If you can’t trust a woman with a decision how can you possibly trust her with a child?
Happy for supream court desicion …. Now boys will thinks before going in with girl and girl also will think 100 times before going in with any boy as if a child is born than they will have the responsibility and can’t shrug the responsibility to take care of child …. It’s god justic to the unborns babies who are alive in womb and these females they just go and murder them …. God is good …. And so the usa court

It’s not the baby’s fault . Adults let’s do better

"Well, enjoy your rape spawns America"
It’s a bunch of fat woman who will never get laid 😂💀💀
There is no way people are this uneducated
3:13 actually Roe made the U.S. an outlier. Most countries ban abortion between 12-20 weeks. France bans it at 14 weeks which means Mississippi is more liberal than France. The extremism has always come from the left on this issue.
Seems like America is slowly crumbling away
"In arcansaw they will soon ban invitro FERTILIZATION.
But no abortions for rape pregnancies.

Makes sense?

Whole bunch of pro lifers, in the  next 6 months will be stunned at what comes down the pipe next in red states.

IUD, bc, plan b gone.
Invitro FERTILIZATION gone.

Some already are already saying they didnt know there was a bigger agenda.

Ya. Theocracy.

The only thing contraception, contraception, invitro have in common is theocrats hate them.

They have no idea who they pushed into power. Theyll freak out when it restricts their life."
theres no excuse for murder
So know no vasectomies for men is this where we're headed
"a woman carries a child at the cost of her health and future, so only every woman can decide whether to have an abortion or not, and not the state. by banning abortions, you will only put women at risk, abortions will be done anyway. a woman is more important than an embryo. and by the way, at the stage of abortion, someone is not yet a living being."
"Great day to be an American, pro life all the way."
"Hold on just a dad gum second there BBC news!  The Supreme Court did NOT make abortion illegal. It remanded the authority, quite properly, back to the states where it belongs. Now each state legislature will decide on their laws. The US ONCE AGAIN is a Federation of sovereign states. The Federal government never had the power to order the states to make abortion legal NEVER. Stop with the clickbait headlines."
"USA the land of the free?
Bwahahahahahahahaha

Freedom in the US?
Bwahahahahahahahaha 

Equal rights in the US? 
Bwahahahahahahahaha 

I will never live in this retarded country!"
Or just selfish
Why not being more self responsible and not getting pregnant are the women/girls that undisciplined
Why not be more responsible in not getting pregnant are You women that undisiplined
You tube censoring my opinion
"Amen 🙏 unbelievable #’s of aborted children Let’s mother pregnant in the first place Responsibly Reasonability 
Aware of how to prevent conception"
Peaceful Protests by BABY KILLERS......
MEN SHOULD GET A VASECTOMY TILL THEY DECIDE THEY ARE READY FOR KIDS!!! That should be made standard procedure once abortion is outlawed
"YEAH LETS GOOOOO RUINING PEOPLES LIVES AND CAUSING ADULT DEATHS. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUCK THESE PEOPLES LIVES BECAUSE ITS MuRdEr AND SO WHAT IF IVE NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH IT BUT IT MEEDS TO HE A PERFECT WORLD FOR US STUPID WOMEN IN AMERICA YEEEEEEEEEEEHHAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA









As someone from Britain I find this so funnily stupid on how there ruining young peoples lives and can’t wait for this to end up like prohibition with alcohol.  Also god damn if someone doesn’t want to have a baby let them have an abortion and stop doing what YOU want think about what other people think."
Good news. Abortion should be a crime.
"Oh yes a law that needs to be looked over, same sex marriage are you kidding me"
Right to abortion? Care received? So killing your baby is caring for him or her. The BBC is always biased in such matters
"Abortion was prohibited during communist era in Romania and we ended up to have so many orphans kids in our society... And woman can still do abortion themselves at home, which is very dangerous and can led to death. A lot of woman died innocently from husband-spouse blackmailed social relation... Is true that is not moral to abort, but it is the parents sin.. It is not something you can have control over it, better help people do it right at least"
So now there is a definition of a woman? That’s the most hypocritical response that woman made that the woman is ok being beaten and raped as long as she can have an abortion? Why not help the woman a safe place to stay or take her in.
Praise God.
OK if the governments plan was to create a new type of abortion that is less 'violent' wouldn't they overturn this right after they found that 'less violent way'? Just asking.
"I really cannot overstate how much this both enrages and unnerves me. Enrages because it represents a massive step back for American society that puts millions at risk and unnerves because it sets a very dangerous precedent. If the abortion landmark ruling can be overturned so easily, what of the rulings that solidified contraception, repealed sodomy laws and legalised gay marriage? 

I also find this ruling to be extremely hypocritical. The procedure is called murder, but the children born are at risk of being murdered in their classrooms and there's never any huge reaction prompted to stop that. There is no exception in any case, even if an underage girl gets raped by her grandfather. It will drive women to desperate and potentially fatal methods of abortion where they can no longer access safe and legal procedures. The women forced to bear children they can't care for or don't want, it will affect their mental health. America is regressing before our very eyes and mark my words, it is not going to stop here."
"It makes me sad that pro-abortion people always want to justify there position by saying that if a person is poor, they should not have the right to life.  If a person is disabled, they do not deserve to live, it's too inconvenient to care for them.  Even Joe Biden, what he essentially said is that black babies should only live if there parents are well off.... Do they ever really think about what they are saying?  THE QUALITY OF LIFE SHOULD NOT DETERMINE THE RIGHT TO LIFE!
They always default to rape victims as the silver bullet... Why don't we make the death sentence for the rapist and not let the child pay for the sin of the father...  How quickly will rape be minimized and how empowering would it be for the victims (mother and child) to know that justice have been served.  PRO-LIFE can exercise the death sentence because the violator made there choice and if the God-ordained justice system says death is the consequence for them, so be it.
 The truth of what the pro-abortion people really want is for women to live as undisciplined men who wants to practice promiscuity without consequence.  ""My body, my choice = I want sex without responsibility.  NOT REALITY!  It takes two to have sex and limiting or dare eliminate unnatural abortions will cause men and women to think twice.  If you don't want to have a child with that person, you don't want to have child support, then think twice... that's the choice right there!  
There's a difference between a natural abortion (miscarriage) vs selective (unnatural) abortion.  God gives life and He has the right to take it away... no one else!"
The BBC Don’t like democracy.

Ok I don’t like abortions but if it’s to save a womens life then it should be legal for that case if a little girl was raped it should be legal but A 1 night stand is ur on fault they can go to adoption centers but the little girls and the ones that will lose there life without should have every right to live
in us you have a right to buy a gun but when you are a rape victim or any f.. reason to have an abortion no what a rotten stupid world eeeew
i am not 100% with abortion but what about rape victims and women that they are in danger and giving birth will kill them. shaaaaaaaame
"Its called responsibility!
If you dont want a baby, than have safe sex, and there are many ways ano 2022."
I like how she says anti and pro abortion. not pro life and pro choice that shit is confusing
Stupidity what about the women and young girls that get raped your laws are flawed the new normal All the women are raped so they have to have children from being raped stupidity
"Women should have the right to choose whether they should cancel their pregnancy or not. Making it illegal is going to cause more bad than good. Drugs to kill the baby and damage the mom, unadopted kids crammed in homes, homeless and jobless young adults, kids abused because they were “unwanted” or caused by rape, young teens killed by birth, population spikes, and much MUCH more. This isn’t a democratic country’s decision; it should be up to the person."
"In case of rape, ok I get it, but I know some people that do it just cause they don't like using protection and many other reasons other than being responsible, so I think it should be allowed only in special cases not else."
"Hey American people 👋 just a reminder. Don’t worry too much if you can’t get an abortion. Just be patient cause in your blessed country, you’ll just have to wait a few years until this kid you didn’t want get shot at school 🏫"
"Women should choose if they want to be mothers or not and get professional help if they decide for breaking the pregnancy. Abortions is not murder, abortion is women's right to live their lives how they want and have proper and legal medical help if needed."
I can see how it would be hard for a nation who requires a license to buy a fork to understand making your own decisions.
What do pro lifers think about Arkansas and Michigan banning abortion even if someone has beeen raped
What if a women who’s been raped requests an abortion but no one believes she’s been raped even though she has been? Wtf happens to her
It's not a right
Women will die women will die women will die women will die how is life winning? When you have a dead miscarried baby making you septic and the doctors too busy talking to his lawyer to realize youre already dead.
"imagine your daughter gets raped, what then, are you willing to raise the child, your daughter resents, from the father who ruined her life forever?"
"It'll be interesting to watch the blue states. In the past some democrats in Red states have advocated for the mothers right to terminate the child days or weeks after birth. It would be just like them to try to enact this now as a ""we'll show you"".
I'll be watching.
I guess we'll have to call it postpartum abortion."
These pro life people are seriously delusional... I live in South Africa its been legal since apartheid ended and is free in state hospitals I have friends who've had abortions and it saved their lives and mental health.

We should be thankful to Donald Trump for this💪
"Abortion rule
https://youtu.be/z77a0cf6Ago"
"USA is truly backwards, old ass people who arent even doctors get to decide over abortion rules. The fact that rape and incest is not a cause for abortion is actually retarded to a level I can't even understand."
thanks be to God...congratulations people in America.
Abortion can not be right in ay way. It is sin
"So, how can you guarantee an unwanted child would live in a well loving family and won't get neglect or face domestic violence that every children shouldn't be facing"
"us supreme court's decision just shows how ridiculous usa is and does live in some other reality. in other words, outside of this world. only totally fools make decisions like that."
BABY LIVES MATTER TOO! IT MAY NOT BE A HAPPY DAY FOR FORNICATORS BUT IT'S A HAPPY DAY FOR BABIES.
"As if the world doesn't have enough people. This will just create more unwanted babies, more resource shortage. Not to mention the medical risks women had to face if they have pregnancy complications."
abortion is equal to a murder of innocent child and every women who commit it should be publicly executed
"I hope miscarriage on these pro lifers. Carry and birth dead babies, then open your big, fat mouth."
"Is there anyone who doesn’t know that condom does NOT prevent 100% of pregnancy !  What if a woman got pregnant from a hookup should she just accept this result and destroy her own life???????? If u still think abortion is murder, sure, get ready to pay childcare or stop having casual sex."
This is so crazy. People who are against abortion didn’t win anything but all the people who are now forced to have a baby or  to get an illegal and dangerous abortion lost everything. There are just two options: Control over a uterus by the state or control over a uterus by women themselves. Why do people think the state has a greater right in this??
Close your legs until marriage and this wouldn't be a problem!! 99% just wanna have a fun LOL
"Disingenuous at best, BBC. 

It’s no longer a federal right, but it can still be approved on a state level as far as I know. So it’s not “banned”."
Abortion is murder!!!!
I think this a personal decision that should be left to the individual to make for themselves. Everyone's in different circumstances in life and this could ruin lots of peoples lives. I don't think it's a decision people would make lightly to have an abortion but some people just aren't in the wright place for children. it shouldn't be a crime in my opinion and there probably going through enough without having the added stress of being criminalised by other people who carnt emperthise.
"What if an unmarried young girl gets pregnancy, which may be an obstacle to her career... It means, men have more chances to get benefits from various ways. Am I sure, is this announced from Supreme court of U.S. 
Thank God, U.S supreme court is not in India."
Congratulations Supreme Court just did a good job. Abortion is evil and shouldn’t have been allowed in this country.
Yay babies lives matter!!
"Daily mass shootings with no plan to ban assault rifles, laws that take rights away from women, a police force that abuses blacks, unchecked borders....    WELCOME TO AMERICA folks lmao 🤣."

Handmade tail. Under his eye
Bible bashers are the most destructive people on earth. Kill religion.
Oh I just love the sounds of brainwashed drones cheering as they happily give up our rights. Lovely. The best part was when they sang about Jesus. Good to know that Christians lose their ever-loving shit at the very inkling of anyone pushing their beliefs on THEM. but they'll dance and rejoice when they get to shove their religion up my uterus. How hypocritically hysterical.
"The ignorance of people is appalling...well, pro life crowds should pay to raise all the unfortunate kids that will be born in terrible situations. Trump is such an ignorant human ...he literally JUST said he knows what God wants?? Disgusting liar son of a rotten system.

HOW CAN YOU BE PRO LIFE AND ALSO PRO GUNS AT THE SAME TIME? A FEW WEEKS AGO CHILDREN DIED BECAUSE OF GUNS. The system cannot even protect those already born and here it is a crowd saying that is what God wants. What a joke."
"i like how people in the comments are like ""oh just stop having sex"". what about men then? will they stop having sex? i guess not"
Where are basic human rights???
Abortion should only be allowed if the mother's life is in clinical danger
Let's go Brandon
Thank GOD for that Because Its their Body but the Babie in the Wombs LIFE Not theirs LIVES & ALL the GLORY to GOD in JESUS name HALLELUJAH and AMEN
"GOOD it is not your right to kill children or peoples with the time you have been blessed with while your on earth.......LOTS of HELL BOUND people protesting , the pleasures of the flesh have taken over there minds there forgetting about the wooden box to come ......"
"Great news! Now how shall we punish women for choosing to do something to their bodies? I was thinking life with parole if they snitch on their doctors and it's before 16 weeks and the death penalty for abortions after that.

That'll make women birth unwanted children or children of their abusers."
"how can a leader of a nation say. ""a sad day"" wauuuu! is he oky?😮"
"You are here today because your mom decided to keep you, so shut up and say thanks"
The scotus didn't ban abortion..
"They forgot to mention, that if Your Daughters are Raped, Molested, or there is Incest in a family. That she can’t not have a abortion if she doesn’t want to carry a Sick Mans Baby. “So Rite there they assume they can take away Parents Rites “at the same time. No Way… It is between Daughter , Mother & Father…. Not the Conservatives ( Rite-Wing) There people that have troubles with pregnancies, by the time the dr. gets thee ok then she can get help… It could be 10-12 hrs. later by that time she could die. This is Sick…. It’s like now they think they can  decide if you live or die. These people don’t read, they just put out what they want… They don’t check history out there… Statics …"
The fairy story of free west world is collapsing. We soon learn that Africa is more free that us
Time to raise an army.
India ❤️
Prayes the Lord in Jesus name God Almighty still is on the throne Amen 🙏
Abortion is banned. The states can decide on how to deal with abortion.
"The Prohibition on alcohol did not work out well. I think abortion ban will make abortion even more dangerous because it will be done secretly by perhaps untrained people or dangerous methods. Going forward, the US might become a theocracy."
This would not have happened under Trump😂😂😂
"i can see a load of babies being dumped once they are born ,"
why women's lives decided by men !
Abortions are wrong you dirty scumbags fuck you
We are not a Christian nation.  Separation of church and state?  This is sad and wrong!  It's not about pro life it's pro birth.  Improve the quality of life for those already here!!  I'm embarrassed to call this country my home.
Unborn baby is a human being killing  baby in the woman womb is a murderer
I am so heartbroken:-(( Why? Why did the country I so looked up to for inspiration and freedom take such a regressive step? I'm so dejected. :-((((
"Feel sorry for the US, this ruling is completely insane and based on what a bunch of religious nut jobs want."
My comments are getting deleted by the Politically correct brigade 🖕🏻you
"These dumb a$$ Liberals are still tlking about abortion like it's a ""constitutional right"""
It’s quite a contradiction - one can never kill a baby outside the womb but can do so  to one in the womb. Does a baby have a right to it’s own body too. I know it’s a complicated issue and there are no easy answers when it comes to rape and a mother’s life is in danger -
In a country where free sex is so rampant. Illegalising abortion may not be the right thing. Atleast make it flexible case by case. And create a culture of family values and less free sex then applying the illegal abortion rule will make sense.
We live in a very bad time were freaks are taking over the world soon men will be able too bear kids
"BBC is LYING to you!! This decision does NOT make abortions illegal in the USA, and I wish that was the case!! This decision merely allows each individual state and the voters decide whether or not abortion is legal or what parameters there will be. Only leftist extremists would argue that states should not decide these issues LOCALLY!"
"Abortion brought the U.S. down on a Communal l level, a Personal level and a Spiritual level. The country has turned from God and killed many potential human lives. This turning from God has caused the plagues prophesied by John the Revelator in the Book of Revelations."
Fake News- it goes back to the state level where it belongs.
"My girlfriend was in foster care.   She is against it.   The system fails them most of them commit suicide.    

  Free country my ass.   The Catholics are trying to take it over like they did in the past.  It’s a cult.    Anyone who wants to come to the USA.  Don’t.   It’s becoming a Nazi nation under Christian law"
Don’t get why ppl or so selfish yes it’s ur body but that it’s a life u getting rid of a child doesn’t life matters it’s seem like life doesn’t matter anymore
An amazing rule👏👏👏
I won 🏆
Love supreme court
"rape : exist
unwilling pregnancy : exist
abortion : illigal"
fuq
Illegal abortions just went up 1 million percent
The populations already out of control anyways this is not good
Ok so why are only women mad about this? Men historically pay for babies anyway
No State health car. the right to bear arms. Criminalised abortion. why does one nation want so many of its living citizens to die?
"Pro life advocates are hypocrites.  They care nothing about the lives of innocent children; if they did, they would be out in the streets protesting all the bombs that have been dropped in Iraq__ over 500,000 children killed in that war.  And what about Yemen and all the millions killed by violence and starvation, and you heard nothing coming from these so called ""religious fanatics"".  They don't care about innocent lives, they only cheer, fervently, the military's catastrophic, nightmarish policies in the middle east."
"Abortion is evil, if you do this willingly,  you are going to hell 100%. You just wish that you may never ever been born, while yoy are tormented in hell..."
So.. Shit isn't a shit until it leaves your arse. Hmmm interesting.
"The ""victory"" being crowed over by the ""life"" brigade (who, if you checked their homes, would all be found to own multiple GUNS) is in fact, the imposition of a religious ideology upon people who do not share their belief system. This, despite the fact that the Bill of Rights explicitly states that the government (Congress) ""shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"". I guess technically it's not Congress forcing us to all live according to one fanatical branch of Christianity's interpretation of a word here & there in the Bible. However, Congress put these bozos into the Supreme Court. Many people do not believe the soul enters the body until birth, and therefore, the foetus is NOT a live human being."
"Why not to split into two countries?abortion and no abortion,holding guns and no guns."
"I am pro-life but denial of abortion in case of rape, incest, or medically proven severe genetic conditions in the fetus is just wrong."
So what happened she get pregnant by alien how you going to explain that
Good! Satan was behind killing babies.
"Some people are crying they don't have baby they judge God, but today God will bless the Supreme court leaders 😁"
"SUPREME COURT JUDGES IN AMERICA, STOP DICTATING ON WOMEN BODIES...OF WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH THEIR OWN BODY....ABORTION IS WOMEN BUSINESS NOT SUPREME COURT JUDGES  BUSINESS MIND YOURS .  IDIOTS."
"My body my choice... from the looks of those bodies, it appears they need to be making better choices 🤣"
"SUPREME COURT JUDGES  LISTEN WELL OPEN EARS 🤔🤔🤔🤔 😄😄😄😄😄 ........WOMEN BODIES DOESN'T BELONG TO THE GOVERNMENT  LAWS /POLITICIANS....THAT'S WHY GOD CREATED EVERYONE WITH THEIR OWN PENIS, HANDS, VAGINA, LIPS, EYES, TOES, FEET, MOUTH, AND BODIES....GET TOGETHER..."
"When unstable, psychotic, bitchy women are concerned about some guy getting her pregnant, you know we’ve crossed into the twilight zone."
Never thought I’d see the day that sluts and hoes would be forced to take responsibility for their  Promiscuous actions.
"The trumplican party and their supporters will destroy America.

Please watch The Silent Scream and consider the ripping apart of a foetal body due to abortion
"As if people don't have enough to deal with as it is, struggling with record high inflation and poverty as the world recovers from an economically devastating pandemic, they throw this absurd decision in the mix, to even further divide  the nation into more conflicts and protests. All based on their personal religious beliefs.
IDIOTS!!!!!"
this begs the $64.00 question...where is 'the right to an abortion' enumerated in the USC?
"Abortion is a heinous crime, why are these babies victims paying the price for your stupid mistakes and being cut into pieces?!!! Where are the human rights that you all talking about, you all hypocrites, I don't  understand why there are so many people against the decision to abolish abortion... how can you kill an innocent soul?!! Everyone knows only solution to this problem is to stay away from adultery and immorality, then no unwanted pregnancy will occur and no innocent babies will be killed anymore... you know that there are 20 million abortions that took place in Europe this year 💔 so sad .
In Islam, adultery and immorality are prohibited, abortion and infanticide are prohibited. Islam preserves all rights. Indeed, it is a religion of mercy"
"Finally some news with progress of our civilization. Don't want children? Don't have sex, it's that simple. If you're raped then i'm ok with abortion."
"Ban abortion, 2 legged tuna keep them legs closed, YOU STINK"
Apart from medical reason's I agree with the court 👨‍⚖️👨‍⚖️👨‍⚖️
isn't an unborn baby a human life too?!
Good job supreme court. Abortion must be kept to the minimum and only cases of emergency when the woman's life is at risk. I sympathize with women who get raped and end up pregnant. but a fetus is a human being and simply can't be killed because he has no voice
Women who are FOR ABORTION have ALREADY BEEN BORN....
"Women giving Birth was fatal not that long ago… we have all had it too easy, this is a great advancement to re-establish respect for each other and learning once again to take life seriously."
I feel like the only reason the bans are happening is bc abortion is basically removing a child like is a tumor and some people don’t like that. I don’t agree or disagree I’m neutral
A life’s a life who gave us the right to decide who lives and who dies..I wouldn’t want that on my conscience
Use protection :….The end.
"Right to abortion?!!!
What about children's right to life?!!!"
in Korea we have baby box women put baby in the baby box so baby can live. the pastor take the baby and take care babies.
"Tell it how it actually is, bbc"
"Human cant protect their children in their worm..so the govt help them🤣🤣.
Why dont we abort these people who support abortion🤣"
"JESUS IS THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE... #YES TO GUN CONTROL! #END ABORTION!

#HUMAN RIGHTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE...
#END CORRUPTION, CRIMES, DRUG CARTEL AND TERRORISM."
The war on the people continues 💉🐑.
"There is no justification to abortion, people should take responsibility and be cautious the first place, prevention is better than cure.
Leaning towards the pro-life choice."
"US has gone back in time , interms of human rights."
"The laws here in Australia are somewhat different to the us. 
My partner and I have been together 27 years now,from the moment we got together way back when she stated she never wanted kids! She’s not maternal at all. Anyway after a year being together and her trialling a few different contraceptive pills,she got preggers and she was on the pill! Her decision was easy as it was only 4 weeks and our doctor agreed on the abortion and after all these years we still believe it was the right thing to do as we both never wanted kids. I think that it’s not selfish but rather responsible as the child would not have been wanted or loved and possibly hand balled to someone else?  So it just goes to show that contraception most certainly is not foolproof. I still think women should have the right to abort within a certain time frame."
Liberals are hurt. Use some burnol.
The 21 year old is terrified because she loves to get smashed without protection lol
It’s disturbing that not once did they mention that for mothers turned away a child gets to live.
So the Catholic Church now rules even if you are not Catholic!
how about they give all the unwanted children to the judges/ politicians who caused this mess? I'm sure they quickly change their mind if THEY are forced to care for a little human.
"You shouldn't know our recent history, yet all of America is forgetting very recent history. Dem's have had dozens of opportunities to put this in our Constitution. Led by Obama's run up to getting elected a second term where every speech he famously said, ""If elected my very first day in office I will codify abortion"". Then upon winning the immediate reply was, ""It's not on the top of my list of priorities"". I think they never made this a federal law from thinking it would never happen. Also a little over a third strongly oppose abortion, putting of enough they may not be elected. But only they know why.
And nobody should call this group anything but pro-zygote. Now when an expectant woman has a complication she can't go out of state no matter the money. Like a tubular pregnancy, or a zygote dies in the womb. Now a surgeon won't touch her. Pregnancy in America now is a death sentence. Guess there's reasons why no media is reporting these obvious facts and most recent history. The Dems only answer is for us to vote harder. We have! Why haven't you done your job Democrats? Yet all you will hear in any media is it's chump's fault, or blame the Supreme Court and these violent pro-zygote supporters. Just some truth and history nobody mentions because they all have agendas outside truth. Seems we are doomed to keep repeating history. ✌️&💕 To Everyone!"
Wow what a dick this is trump's fault. Appointing 3 judges who are against abortion
Haha keep crying
BBC you suck ass.
Oh my goooood the right to abortion wasnt struck down they just gave it to the states to decide. How does a official news channel mess that up that badly?
This is absolutely crazy.
Terrifying
"The judges actually appealed to the law to strike down Roe V Wade, not Christian theology or secular morality. The 14th amendment actually does recognise the privacy and individuality of a foetus. And because it’s not possible to hold a foetus accountable for anything, you cannot justify abortion unless in cases where it’s not possible to carry to term and survive. 
But I highly doubt any state, no matter how theological they are, will go to this length. The only reason Roe V Wade was struck down is because the people voted on the politicians to do so, and those same people hold a pretty moderate view on the subject. But even then, Roe V Wade was always poorly reasoned."
The most dumbest decision by a so called democratic country ! Just what are the supreme court judges thinking? What if the one affected is thier own? Probably then they will understand and its so important that state and religion remains separate. If mixed then hell will break loose.
"El Salvador's abortion ban: 'I was sent to prison for suffering a miscarriage'
By Will Grant
BBC News, San Salvador, El Salvador"
"criminalising abortion isn’t going to stop them happening, it’s going to send them underground. women will start dying because of unsafe procedures or self-induced abortion- and this is the American dream? nevermind the sheer numbers losing their lives because of incredibly painful, life threatening complications when they will no longer have the right to the cure they need. It’s madness honestly."
crazy bible thumpers.
"They cannot eliminate a fundamental human right! The right of a woman to decide for her life and health is still there! But those 3 ""judges"" could violate and did violate this right! And that is a crime! It's outrageous! But I'm sure it won't last long!"
God had give strength to these judges to do the right choice
So many beautiful babies are killed by their own mother that’s so sad
"Anti choice people are not pro life , if it was they would take care of the women and the babies once there born . Alot dont they care whelst there in the womb once there out they dont give a toss"
Abortion is murder simple
"I thought that men can get pregnant and we have 64 different genders you can identify with. Can't define what a woman is. Now when Roe vs. Wade was overturned...all of a sudden the term "" woman"" is alive and well again. Abortion is just plain murder of a human being. In California...if you shot and killed a pregnant woman... it's considered double murder. How about if that woman is getting an abortion when she got murdered????"
thanks President Trump
It's good news for me to see that America's freedom is killing children
Not sure where in the constitution it says  abortion is  a right? Maybe under privacy but that is a reach. Passing a bill will be more efficient way of making this a law. Obama had a super majority in 2009 and did not wish to pas the law.
"Let them get as many abortions as they want. In fact, speed it up. It's exactly the kind of people I wish didn't exist."
"If a man cant get pregnant how come they are there  protesting.    Oh yeah, its only men who disagree with you that are bad."
Rights to kill babies overturned
America. Where if you get raped you are forced to have that baby just to raise it up and send them to a school to be  Massacred.. backwards ass country.
"Wow ....imagine a civilised democracy outlawing child murder ....
Disgusting ...lol"
"Its not just about abortion,,what triggers me is how easily they can come up with their own decisions on women's body"
"In plain English, those imagery rights conjured out of the 14th and 9th Amendments by political courts instead of doing them the right way via the Congress and Amendments are now in jeopardy.  The learning point is do it the right way and a Supreme Court that follows the Constitution will not be able pop your balloon. Maybe the BBC will understand this language. Perhaps someone at the BBC could obtain a copy of the United States Constitution? The decision on abortions will now return to the States and the people of those States who elect their representatives, where it has always belonged until a rogue Court changed that in the 1970's. That has now been fixed. It is amazing the number of uninformed people making fools of themselves showing their lack of basic understanding of the Constitution of the United States. Least we forget the largest abortion business in America was founded by a racist whose aim was the elimination of those ""weeds"" as she put it of the human race, i.e.  blacks, Asians and anyone not white. Margaret Sanger was a racist. Funny how most of the abortion clinics were placed in black communities as was most of the babies killed. That does not get mentioned as much in the videos."
Americans are really dramatic.....they are protesting to be allowed to kill innocent children that they split their legs very joyfully for...wtf these clowns always amuse me
If it’s life risk for the mom then ok but otherwise use condoms
"this small devil woman is still in favor of abortion not knowing how evil abortion is, shedding of blood, maybe shedding of blood is what pleases the devil, but i pray that that ruling must permanently in America, small nation will also follow suit to ban abortion at all costs"
"wonderful.. God bless America, 💪💪💪, this rulings will save more lives on this universe"
"absolute rubbish, BBC  lies again . you believe a baby aborted at 8.5 months is good .  madness!!!        give the facts , explain  the case to the viewers .   shameful"
what happened to separating church and state? to all the people bringing religon bs into this
The death rate of women and newborns in states that have banned abortion has risen.  This means there will be more orphans.  This is just insanity for which there is no explanation.
"Ignorant, narrow minded people applauding this ruling."
"In the USA, you have the right to hunt. Imagine if PETA has such a great campaign that they convinced a huge number of people in the USA that hunting was a sin -- evil. Killing animals is a sin. Having guns to kill animals is a sin. So the supreme court sees the arguments and agrees. Killing animals -- especially animals that are not even predators, should be made illegal in the USA. So this ruling comes down. Now ... you are a gun owner, and you can shoot at little targets of people or animals, but it would be absolutely ILLEGAL to actually shoot an animal with your gun. Anyone doing that has committed animal murder and thus should be arrested with their gun confiscated. If your religion has you believing that this is sin, then you might be able to get that law passed in a sort of sneaky way where your supreme court judges LIE about past precedent about hunting. Watch Powder. Good movie."
6 political appointees affected the right to decide what a woman has the right to do with her own body. 6 people decided the rights of 340 million people. This has to change.
This is pathetic... I mean goodness gracious this stupid country just keeps making mistake after mistake... I feel like now is a good time to leave before something terrible happens...
It's OK if you don't like abortion. But your feelings can't decide others rights to abortion. That's it.
Those people who are anti-abortion are deranged and mentally unstable. This country is fkced up. Note that reasonable Christmas are pro choice.
Abortion in not right it’s murder
"An elected legislator is not an in built majority. You could say that for the democrats too, but it wouldnt be reported that way. imo."
"Preg mother should have the right to decide their baby, do not force them to suicide"
"Our own President disagreeing with our Highest Court.  Even if the President disagrees with the decision, he should not publicly voice his disagreement."
I love babies too! Take care of and Love All people ... What about all the unwanted children in foster care? ... Healthcare for All ... End Homelessness ... Clean Up The Ocean ...

same sex marriage should be banned forever too. it is disturbing the fundamental gender and bringing so much confusion to ppl and growing children. 😐
Abortionists are extreme egotists
"Them:Guns should be banned!
Us:Killing babies should be banned too!
Them: wait what!??
Us: we can play this game too"
to all the dumbasses the law clearly stats its up to the state to decide for example if she was a rape victim and dosent want a rape child they can allow her to have an abortion.
Any you fuchtards ever think about wearing a condom or being on birth control? You all about the dumbest people ever.
They  slay their baby's in the belly just like the Bible said
Best decision in 50 yrs
Abortion=kill. Replace the word Abortion with kill and listen to what she us saying.
women need to be protected . except them god damn babies.
Abortion doctors talking about human rights is like a slave owner talking about human rights
Abortion is Murder Period!
I dont  even know what party im watching anymore I just like watching news
People who protested for womens rights in the 70s must feel so insulted right now
So happy to see Roe go down in flames 🥳🥳🥳👏👏👏
Funny how they don't ban guns but they can ban abortion🤨
I wonder if illegal abortions are a thing now
All this pro-life attitude but everyone can have a gun.  Just yesterday someone shot two people in Alabama because they didn't put mayonnaise on his sandwich at the restaurant.  Great job America.
"Abortion is wrong , it has good intentions however. Ppl use it as birth control 🎛️ so it's time to get rid of the law and change a few details."
"I'm not pro-murdering babies.
I'm pro-Becky who found out at her 20-week anatomy scan that the infant she had been so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining organs.
I'm pro-Susan who was sexually assaulted on her way home from work, only to come to the horrific realization that her assailant planted his seed in her when she got a positive pregnancy test result a month later.
I'm pro-Theresa who hemorrhaged due to a placental abruption, causing her parents, spouse, and children to have to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or her unborn child.
I'm pro-little Cathy who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11-year-old body isn't mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal.
I'm pro-Melissa who's working two jobs just to make ends meet and has to choose between bringing another child into poverty or feeding the children she already has because her spouse walked out on her.
I'm pro-Brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially, emotionally, or physically able to raise a child.
I'm pro-Emily who went through IVF, ending up with SIX viable implanted eggs requiring selective reduction to ensure the safety of her and a SAFE number of fetuses.
I'm pro-Jessica who is FINALLY getting the strength to get away from her physically abusive spouse only to find out that she is carrying the monster's child.
I'm pro-Vanessa who went into her confirmation appointment after YEARS of trying to conceive only to hear silence where there should be a heartbeat.
I'm pro-Lindsay who lost her virginity in her sophomore year with a broken condom and now has to choose whether to be a teenage mom or just a teenager.
I'm pro-Courtney who just found out she's already 13 weeks along, but the egg never made it out of her fallopian tube so either she terminates the pregnancy or risks dying from internal bleeding.
You can argue and say that I'm pro-choice all you want, but the truth is:
I'm pro-life.
Their lives.
Women's lives.
You don't get to pick and choose which scenarios should be accepted. It's not about which stories you don't agree with. It's about fighting for the women in the stories that you do agree with and the CHOICE that was made.
Women's rights are meant to protect ALL women, regardless of their situation!
Overturning Roe does not stop abortions, it stops SAFE abortions! 
Abortion is healthcare."
imagine crying because you want to kill innocent babies
This removes me from watching BBC.  It's never been constitional.
Apparently my wife’s body belongs to Jesus Christ so I will leave her alone now
"The GOP knows they won't win in 2024, and their majority senate and house won't last long so their doing everything they can get away with now before it's too late."
The people who like this is just f..... up..!!! This again show why USA is not the country to control the world!! Again... this is so wrong.... How can you be so naive!!
Not every women  deserves to be allowed to have abortion! Some women need to take responsibility of their actions cause it’s not right to sleep around and to have one after another abortion. In cases of emergency and rape yes it’s okay. But when women “keep” making same choices without thinking the consequences then they should definitely deal with the result that comes with the choices they make! No child deserves to die. It’s just so selfish and these women keep making same “mistakes” again and again without concern of innocent children involved! No one has right to end another life with their foolish choices!
Abortion is not a reproductive right since reproduction has already taken place.🤣
"Keep those draws on ladies! No more casual sex! No more do overs! You break it you buy it! Think twice before you do it! 
Abortion should be for rape, kids and incest victims! Not for irresponsible women who live their lives with their legs open for every Tom, Dick and Hank! Keep those legs closed and those panties on! 
It's not just the man's fault! A woman will only allow concessions to a man when she wants him to have it! Rape is something totally different so don't go screaming rape and blaming him for every damn thing when you allowed him to enter your home, take you to the hotel, make out with you in the car, and finger bang you! This Supreme Court ruling is a wake up call for those from both sexes who can't keep their draws on and their dicks in their PANTS!!!"
"congrats to the US. there will  be a lot of women, especially teenage girls, suffering thanks to these irresponsible idealists imposing their believes on others."
"No unborn man will get an opinion on this as he cant give birth,,, something says acceptable abortion basically ignores society's problems ,,  its clearly sad that so meny think its ok  ,, not exactly natural is it ,,, obviously there should be exemptions and so on ,, , certainly rape ,, its clearly a mess"
So abortionist and 2nd amendment advocates fight the same fight now. enjoy
Jesus loves all the little children...all the children of the world
Because now America woke up after long time they wants to have more population in county just like India and China
"Poor women. They can be raped and  forced to have the child. I don't know, but I see some Gilead in make #handsmaidtale"
"Most of the problems in the world are caused by people who abuse sex. Sex is not a toy, it's not a game, it's a powerful enigma, but in the wrong hands and with irresponsible use it's very very destructive. It should be used very seldom."
The land of the free ??      ????????
Goto California
OK America is truly screwed up
"""im 21 and im terrified"" translation: let me be a stupid hoe and not have to deal with any consequences. why a stupid hoe you ask? because a smart or regular hoe isnt crying, she will keep bein a hoe but will bother taking one of the dozen contraceptive methods available or you know... just wear a condom."
"""Right to bodily autonomy!""

What about the jibby jab?  

""Whoever doesn't comply should not be allowed to work, buy food and be thrown into a camp"". 
Lmao. This is the lefts logic"
"There is no constitutional right to an Abortion.
It's still legal to get a abortion in many states."
Biden the worst president of the history of the United Estates!
"More goverment control!! Should have been a clause to allow abortion in cases of rape!!! PERIOD !!!! I am not a damn democrap and not very much a republican but I believe there should have been allowance for rapes but not to be paid for by the goverment!!! If you need an abortion because of rape or  if it's your life or the baby's, then you should pay for it youself, not expect the gov to pay for it!!! And I really don't give a shit who likes what I said or not !!!!!"
"The US is one of the few nations who are not facing the population bomb. China, and Russia are imploding because they don't have any young people. This is a real problem for many nations. Nations who let abortion rule the day, are literally running out of enough young people, to run their nation. People are an asset to any nation. When a nation's old people, out number the young, it is literally dying. The immorality of abortion has a high price."
"As a trans women in the UK, I cannot say there are many things I am happy about with our government.

Our government being not so closely linked to the church as America however, is certainly one of them."
America is backwards and shouldn't be considered a democracy... More of a conservative hell
Heck no! Thank God I wasn't born in the US!
If you smash a bald eagle egg you go to jail - argument over
"The way they call themselves pro-life, but they aren't pro-life when a women dies from not getting an abortion or from trying to get one without medical professionals."
"Isn’t a woman’s period technically like an “abortion” or am I not smart, I’m probably just not smart."
"Religion and Politics should have no connection, they are too different things"
"All I'm seeing are euphemisms, the ""procedure"" goal is to kill the child, no it's not to end the pregnancy since a c-section isn't an abortion, the goal of a c-section is opposite of the goal of an abortion. When someone says ""women's right"" ask, ""the right to do what?"". Make them admit the to the actual goal."
Is right to abortion anywhere in the constitution?
A tragic step backwards for women.
"Most times it amazes me greatly the way I moved from an average lifestyle to earning over 63k per month, utter shock is the word. I have understood a lot in the past few years to doubt that opportunities abound in the financial markets, The only thing is to know where to focus."
Do these people think our country is better off with more unwanted children? That seems unnecessarily abusive to those kids. we will have a lot more traumatized children in the future
N the future same sex marriage will ban also n America.
America! The land of freedom and hope.  disgusting !
"I’m not pro- murdering babies.

I’m pro-Becky who found out at her 20 week anatomy scan that the infant she had been so excited to bring into this world had developed without life sustaining orans. 

I’m pro-Susan whowas sexually assaulted on her way home form work, only to come to the horrific realization that assailant plant his seed in her when she got a positive preganct text result a month later. 

I’m pro-Theresa who hemorrhaged due to a placental abruption causing her parents, spouse, and children to make the impossible decision on whether to save her or unborn child.

I’m pro- little cathay who had her innocence ripped away from her by someone she should have been able to trust and her 11 year old body isn't mature enough to bear the consequence of that betrayal. 

I’m pro-Brittany who realizes that she is in no way financially. emotionally , or physically able to raise a child. 

You can argue and that  I'm-pro choice all you want be the truth is: I’M PRO-LIFE!! THEIR LIFE!!! WOMEN”S LIVES. 

For some who said it takes two people to make a baby, that is true but it takes one person to carry it, for nine months. When the other does not go through anything only regretting the mistake. AM a Rape-baby…My dad was the person who want control of my mother. To hold her down… He did that!! Got away with the crime and no did nothing that failed me and my siding. No ONE should ever go through what i had to go through!! I was supposed to be aborted but she didn’t…That was a big mistake. I suffered so many things. Foster care was the worst thing that could happen to me.  They kept me for 1 month only for them to give me back to the abusive home. They don’t care. White men only want us for our body, nothing more and nothing least. You can get 15 years in jail for abortion but if you raped someone you only get 5 years in jail or walk away free…FvK YOU TO EVEYONE THAT BAN ABORTION, WE HATE YOU <3
Copy and repost!!"
"This will only result in the eventual establishment of a new amendment, backfiring against the fools who don't understand what safe abortion means to the world, and causing untold numbers of atrocities in the meantime."
"In the same time the court rule in two cases 
First case you do not have control over my Gun
Second case I have control over your body (you do not have control over your body)
This is why the Christian democrats don't want Christian hypocrite to rule this country, so we do not go to the Stone Age like Iran, Afghanistan….etc.

Religious Community Members Talk God and Abortion
:)"
Disgusting.
How would an abortion stop someone from beating someone else up?
suiiiii
I would love to see the same outpouring of feeling against the death penalty
"So, basically in America, women have rights but not to their bodies. Am I hearing that right because the reason England made it legal to stop illegal underground abortions which resulted in more women dying then the foetus she was carrying and some women were unable to have children after those illegal abortions. The results were this 25% lived and could still have children. 25% lost the ability to have children and finally 50% died from underground abortions. Men realise most of the time they didn't want to use condoms and it was blamed on the woman for ""getting pregnant"" the amount of teenage pregnancies in America is higher than the UK. America is 52/1000 teenagers are still in high school pregnant age 16 years old when in England it's 32/1000 teenagers are still in high school pregnant age 15 to 16 years old. Some people can't afford children because retail shopping markets get profit for buggies, children clothing, nappies or diapers for Americans, cots, mosses baskets, baby milk and toys. The list can go on. There is enough people in America. In fact there is 329.5 million people living in the USA. 

Also, the amount of children abuse by parents that never wanted them in the first place. That is cruel thing to do to them and abortions can stop child abuse. There were 4.1 million reports of child maltreatment in the United States involving 

7.753 billion people on the planet I think we are good. Well, Americans are slowly shooting children and themselves to death with their gun laws."
Well I don't think most people care about anybody in this country
My am my sister have it
It's all because of the people Trump appointed to the court.
"This law that was over turned allowed unborn babies of any age before birth to be ripped apart inside the womb with a pair of tongs in order to be removed, if you think this was a good law youre dumb or evil, perhaps both.
How about a babies right not to be ripped apart?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SMxKVD4fQ"
Wow!! Thankful but great news! More opportunities
It was never a right.  Where does it say it’s a right to murder your child?  Show me.  It’s murder.  They’ll just have to go to an evil state to kill their kids now.
"(TW) The problem now is that there will be a rise of women ;self harming ,committing suicide ,going to dodgy  backstreet abortions 

Some people get an abortion if the baby is stillborn ,you wouldn’t  want your body to go through all the changes and pain to birth a corpse .


It sickens me because this means children will now have to birth children .

If a woman was r@p3d ,you think it’s ok for her to go through emotional and physical pain all because “pRo LiFE “

You can survive 8 minutes without a heart so featus’ having heart beats doesn’t mean anything."
Abortion is murder. Period.
"In a world which is already so substantially overpopulated, this US court judgement is utterly mad and irresponsible."
Stop having sex if you can't have children.
If these wonderful lives of unborn babies can have the right and speak up for their life? They will choose to abort their parents.
"None of us walking this earth at this moment if we had been aborted. Are you not happy and grateful that you got have the gift of life?

 It is possible to not have to face the choice as to whether to have an abortion or not, it is about making the choice to not risk getting pregnant by abstaining.

Abortion is murder."
Its called being responsible.....to easy just to end a life......not quite the same but its like to easy to marry and divorce these days.
IT is time for all republicans and liberals' to get read of your republican representatives this is because you republicans dint do your job and got read of your representatives that are not doing what is best for but for them self's when the time comes show them what will happen  if they go against the peoples wishes your vote. will let those republicans by daring the swamp.
"If you’re not having unprotected sex you won’t get pregnant? All of this so women can have their sugar walls busted in raw. Abit irresponsible if you ask me. You get blasted in, why should you have the right from stopping a baby blasting outta you. They love to say woman are special because they can bring life. Well apparently not. They all fighting for the right not too? It’s like if you weren’t gRaped than it’s your responsibility to give birth to that child and raise it. You want to raise your legs but not your kids? Gummon land of the free😢😂"
"Boden his time to make money out of Abortion by criminalising it?!

After the Pandemic and Lockdowns I guess millions of horney Americans must be bonking like crazy.

You won't see that in anally retentive UK!!"
"The Attorneys General of Arkansas is a heartless cretin. The reason she cannot imagine the piles of dead women her decision will inevitably create is because abortion has been safe and legal for 50 years. With the stroke of her pen, blood is on her hands."
Again i just don’t see why Supreme Court decided this. It should be the people. No one have the right to take  a life of an unborn life.
God bless the SCOTUS & FJB!!!
Thoughts and prayers for the pregnant men affected by this decision.
Horrible country with a horrible political system. I will be forever grateful that I don’t live there. My heart goes out to all the Americans suffering in the “land of the free”.
Praise be to our Lord and saviour 🙏
"If AOC should accidentally get pregnant (no one in their right mind would want to impregnate her), all of the United States should make an exception when it comes to abortion, for the sake of our democracy, grant her the abortion that she requests, with all expenses paid, because this republic cannot take the chance that her offspring will be just as mentally challenged as she is!!!"
Congratulations USA on finally realizing abortion is not a right. Give a flying fuck to filthy feminazis who are crying.
"The byproducts of left wing human waste is: dead unborn child, trans women's breasts, and trans male penises. They are a strange breed."
Nice to see another totally misleading headline from the BBC
You are liars! Your title is a lie. Abortion was sent back to the states and the the people of each state.
"Just make a Law.  No one is allowed to have children without a licence .  Requirements no welfare, no bipolar allowed, no mental person eather.  YOu must make income and have a job.   Lets see if these things start chanting to for children now instead. or have a blue screen of death."
"This world....!! Stumped at the need for more gun constraints but no issue banning the constitutional right for women to CHOOSE to abort their babies!  Women are upset (as they should be,) but too many of you don't factor in how reckless/unprotected sex (for some, NOT all) results in unwanted pregnancies! Yes, let's fight for our rights, but let's also work on being more responsible with our bodies, which would decrease the number of babies terminated before birth!!"
"This is just beginning. The next target will be gay rights and birth control. The conservative wing is trying to fall back 50 years and if this absurdity of the supreme court continues, soon enough the United States will become once again, a white man’s nation. The Democrats must win the Senate election and put an end to this 21st century blasphemy."
May God protect the fetus of the antichrist what is he waiting for now a soul?
"This is so sad, those poor women that will be forced to have a baby that they don’t want, then what? Give the baby up for adoption or struggle to look after them and the child potentially ending up in foster care? This is so messed up, what a step backwards for America."
"We remind the Chinese government do not to encourage the bombing of Ukrainian railways! Don't encourage Russian war! Otherwise, we will no longer guarantee the safety of the the Belt and Road railway!"
Another reason why the whole world is laughing at the US...
Plan b pill
"Imagine being so desperate for sex, you'll forgo all the many types of contraception, and pursue a few moments of pleasure at the expense of someone else's life. Sad person, sad world."
"Abortion is a woman's right. However if a woman can terminate her pregnancy due to her financial situation, etc,, than a man should have the right to terminate his contract to pay child support if he has poor financial standing. Rather than taking away rights, we should be giving equal rights to both men and women on this issue."
this is disgusting
"Life is life yes,why do humans think they can control life,is it because we can terminate life?who will ever understand what life is?"
"Congratulations USA! Welcome back to the civilized world! The United States has made progress in civilizing by changing legislation, and now you are one of the people. Only primitives kill unborn children. Thank God! God is great! Glory Jesus Christ!"
The abortionists seem to have aborted themselves out of existence.
"Stop getting drunk and handing out your pussies, be an adult and there is no need for abortion!"
"Everybody wants to ""save the children"", but nobody wants to raise them. 

If the entire country does a 180 in less than a decade because of this, we need to pack the courts. You can't changed 100 years of preconceived decisions built ontop of other judgements in less than a decade; you're cheating the system... at that point you're forcing your perspective on other people and not looking back at past judgements, taking in multiple perspectives/judgements and deciding where to go from there... that's how the courts have always worked."
"The title is misleading, it didn't remove any rights but gave them to the state, witch is the proper place. Not a constitutional right. This is a states rights issue."
"If the law was about men, women would just say.... be more responsible."
"All pro-abortion , just go to a doctor and do the things, so you can't have kids in first place. What's the matter."
If  you have no control of your body what is next...chip implants...
"Noooooo the right to chose and the right of abortion is a human right and our right of freedom, we need to fight this rulling, this decision is not the final word, the people will speak up and fight for our freedom"
Another thing they have blamed Trump for... Why doesn't anyone see that this is all about negative coverage for Trump  - he was high in the polls as Biden is pathetic - all of this is to sabotage the next election.
"Right to abortion? Dont make me laugh. What you mean is the right to murder an innocent child has been abolished. One of the best days in the US. Keep moving forward to progrssive!

There are many ways to prevent accident pregnancy. Sex isnt a necessity too. If you cant control your body and want to have an unsafe sex, then you deserve to raise an innocent child you're creating. You are a human, not an animal. Murdering an unborn child isnt a solution, its a selfish most barbaric sht one can do."
I wish it happens to my country too
This channel is a circus
"Interesting... such governments also should provide all essentials to d children being born unplanned including good education and provide for families sufficient enough to meet all demands. Besides, why is controlling over population not a KPI of controlling climate change. This should be not only about a right of a person to decide but also should be understood that controlling reproduction is a overall good thing for d society. US is becoming the land of crazy. Strange and sad."
Yay yay yay.  I love life and i love our constitutional rights…. Such a tear filled happy day
Yay yay
"It's funny how suddenly the left is talking about ""women"" again. I thought biological sex had nothing to do with giving birth? I thought you were all supposed to say ""birthing people"" now? What changed?"
Good now they can’t kill baby’s
"""Jesus loves the little childern"" How weird is that lolol. Church people are funny"
"This because 'Communists' said- Enforce COVID-19 vaccination status for work & travel. *The Court was just doing what was asked, invade privacy!"
This is extremely bad decision from the Supreme Court. What will happen to all the women who can't give birth to a child due to medical conditions and risk to their life? What happens to all the women who are raped and can't bear the children due to trauma or just because so? Is this how the USA does things? Sad how the humanity and intellect of people just goes backwards and women are still objects perceived by men without any rights and choices! Sad
The Irony in this is They seem to care so much about baby's getting killed in abortion and yet they don't give a shit about the Children who died in school shootings This is nothing but Hypocritical bullshit.
"Abortion is wrong, all of you who support it is going to hell"
"So a stillborn baby is worth saving instead of a women that could actually live? It’s cruel to force a women to care a already dead baby to full term, or a child a product of rape or incest, I do agree that people need to be more responsible when it comes to having a child, but people deserve a choice not all pregnancy is consensual. This anti-abortion ruling is just gonna lead to an increase in heath problems, such as suicide and depression and kids ending up in foster care without a family, because there isn’t enough children already there already."
"My body my choice except for vaccines. If they are so terrified, close your legs and use contraception."
That's really disgusting that government did this to women in the USA. All the women are sisters and I support girls who protest against this shit. Abortion is the right of every woman. Rise up abortion rights! Love from Russia❤️
"Where does a British anchor of all people get off calling an originalist, faithful interpretation of the Constitution, ""radical?"""
This will also solidify the fact in peoples minds that religion affects even the non-religious. Religion divides and it hurts people. Faith is a virus.
"I think if a woman gets rped no abortion, but then I think the just the father and the father alone should be legally responsible for the baby as a counter option to life in prison"
Freaks -- on both sides.
"Looking at time index 1:30, the entire world needs to see exactly what sort of circus freaks have been pushing for the destruction of Rights and Freedoms, in the US of A."
"I don’t understand how arguing that because kids lives in the foster system are difficult, that somehow justifies killing them. If a child in foster care told you they wanted to commit suicide, would you stop them or let the go through with it?"
"America's corrupt and total evil filth, called the Evangelicals, have metastasized their cancer with their takeover of America's federal and States governments. This will not end well. I the same week the SCOTUS decided to make it perfectly legal for concealed carry, anyone who wants to shoot someone just has to say they felt like their life was threatened.  Many are going to die for that decision and their same-breath overturning of R v W, women will be dying. 
This is NOT about LIVES -- this is about going back to an America that never existed.  
People like Marjorie Taylor Greene is perfectly Ok with the Jan 6th insurrection because it was ""patriotic Americans wanting to get rid of dictatorship!""    Well, people -- look who the real dictators are."
You should hace shown the stories of those who’ve chosen to safe the lives of their babies - they are humans too and their lives have meaning
"USA will be full of Basterds , Congratulations :D   ;     We will call  Basterd USA"
"#peopleofcolortriedtotellyou
Do not vote for Trump. He was able to nominate 3 Supreme Court Justices that are going to destroy your lives."
"I'm pro choice myself. I don't think abortion is a good or a bad thing, I think it's a case by case basis thing.

All I can say is I hope any state that makes it illegal is willing to pour ample amounts of money into the foster system to balance this.. which they won't."
"Abortion is the process of tearing a fetus, crushing it, and removing it from the body for disposal. Is it a women's right?"
"That’s A Lie!!!
    The Supreme Court Of The United States Of America Simply Handed This Back To The States, Where It Belongs!
    You’re Reporting Like SODS.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
                 Victory!
Stop Throwing Your CRACK At Anything That Walks By!!!"
This is beyond weird and stupid. I mean how do these people(against abortion) function? They fail at being a civilized human at the basic level.
"Women have the option of keeping the child, putting the child up for adoption, or going to a state where abortion is legal. The Federal government should never have been involved...just as the Federal government is NOT involved in the Life/Death decision of Captial punishment...where each state sets its own law."
Congratulations to all the unborn babies 👶🏻 and to all the dads who want their kiddos!
"I don’t understand what they fuss about if the government  rule  to no abortion. First women or girls. Keep your legs shut if your not ready to become a mother. Focus on study , find a decent work instead of dating so young so casually. If you don’t want to be responsible then stop having casual sex without protection. It is your body and thats true but its not the fault of innocent life to be kill because of your irresponsibilities. The government should focus more on how to change this young generation to be more cautious ,solve the drugs issues and homelessness. Some of this women  use drugs , drink alcohol  and do casual sex . Killing is never  right even how much you justify it by saying your young etc."

"🇺🇦&🇺🇸?Why the Walmart Management kicked out the Ukrainian immigrants by saying not to com back to Walmart ? is there a food sale for american peoples Only? or is a shortages of food? and why the americans are telling Ukrainians that the Ukrainian people are buying all the food? and because of the Ukrainians the food and gas is so expensive?

Do somebody care about immigrants? or this is a Trap 🪤 with immigration?

the immigrants did not come to the united states 🇺🇸 to end up death ☠️

We have enough problems in Ukraine🇺🇦

the united states 🇺🇸 do have money 💵 but they have more traps 🪤 than money 🇺🇸💴"
by removing constitutional right to abortion  US  supreme court os on wrong side of liberty
What a bunch of fuckwitz and a bulshit president that can't do anything in his own country but very good at   sending Ukraine money for a war.
Hoes mad
Legal or illegal de still do so the killings
"We need to wake up! America, you are becoming Russia! American people giving up their civil rights for convenience and religious beliefs of other people! They will be chipping away little by little from our Freedom! I wish everyone will see what is going on! Fight is on ! It is NOT about abortion! This is about our DEMOCRACY! Who will be next? Interracial marriage,gay rights? Who will be singled out and destroyed?"
"Who stops comments from getting any more replies? The quota is not exhausted. There are comments with way more replies than that, also I'm trying to reply to someone who replied. Not the commenter. Whoever is doing this needs to butt out!"
"Coming from my perspective, as a woman who struggles with having children.. I agree with this law. However, this was not always my viewpoint. Since I understand what it is like to be assaulted, I was always pro choice. That is until I found God and realized that He would want all of his children to be born no matter what. I deeply feel for all the victims of assault and I hope these people find God to help them through. On the other hand, I've known women who just wanted to go out, get drunk, not use any kind of protection and then wanted an abortion. That sickens me. I pray to be blessed with a child someday🙏🏼"
"Seriously!?
I never thought this would happen in the US."
The next is to ban same-sex marriage in America 🇺🇸
Thank God for the consitution. All these women need to be locked up in the nuthouse.
"Simple ... you want abortion? ... Then you should also lose your womb too ... so that killing of a lives in a wombs be abolished too. AND then you can have all that free and unprotected sex you want!!!

BUT!!!
In rape or health cases, these are a different matter."
Yes! Pro-live won. Great historical Decision to MAGA.
"This is a great way to start changing the world , mow kids need to be disciplined for bad behaviors and to have respect for others . I see a lot of changes that need to happen.  Even what the teach at school  and more important how parents are examples to their children at home . This is very important adults need to better examples on how to behave and have respect for others . This will start changing the world for the better"
63 million babies have been aborted since 1973.
Families are destroyed when women are tortured by prison.
Sodom and Gomorrah  is the path we're going. Abortion. Is answer for inconvenience
Abortion is murder!
totally a mess
Absolutely right 👍

1 Corinthians 15:2 - By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
1 Corinthians 15:3 - For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;

"America is busy with its nose in Russia’s affairs while it’s own house is burning down. Let’s see if women will have strikes, walkouts and siitins to secure their right of CHOICE."
I wonder how quickly any of these women will change their tune if they have an unwanted pregnancy.
ONE & ONLY person can make life is THE LORD-GOD so he has the FINAL DECISION not you females. Which means it’s not your body it’s the Lord-GOD’s body you didn’t make it he did.
Look at all these twisted sick girls crying in the middle of the street because you’re gonna force a young girl to have her incestuous father’s baby or the man who brutally raped her and took her innocence from her you’re gonna force her to have that baby.. what about ectopic pregnancy? When the child starts forming in the woman’s fallopian tube and it’s going to rupture you’re gonna let mother and baby die now? Maybe some of you should go to school to learn that sometimes abortion are needed to save the mother’s life. Get a life you guys truly are weirdos. Stay the fuck out of my vagina!
"What happened to contraceptives, don't they work in America?"
Wow finally innocent children who have been aborted for no reason can have a right to live .you can't be getting pregnant any how and not been responsable for your actions. Abortion is murder
"I usually like BBC for not showing their opinion on stories but I couldn't help but laugh when she said ""he thinks God made the decision, in fact it was 6 of the 9 justices."""
"The us is getting weirder and weirder i am really happy to live in europe i mean the us has more shootings than days like dafuq, they say they need more weapons but the weapons are the problem. More weapons = More shootings its that easy"
"US: The Land of the Free
Also US: Uhm, you can't perform abortion. Only in Democrat States."
Deal with it lunatics
The amount of men on here telling a woman to go through pregnancy and birth when they wouldn’t even be able to deal with a monthly period 😂😂😂
America is a worthless country
"Back to the States, like is supposed to be. Abortion is not a Constitutional right."
Supreme Court terms need to change. You shouldn’t be able to stay on for life. Same for the mayors and governors.
"If a woman in Arkansas is violently raped by a complete stranger, she will now be refused an abortion.  Give that a moment to sink in.     #USA2022"
there will be a rise of unwanted children after this.
The bible belt strikes back!
Murder supporters shame on u bbc
"This is 100% a determining factor that will drive the split of the current US into two coutries;  the medieval, barbaric, racist, far-right South, and the progressive, forward-thinking North.    The Union should have taken the opportunity to cast away the southern states during the US civil war."
The US takes a further step towards becoming Gilead.
"I hear a lot about victims forced to give birth but ZERO about convenience/inconvenience abortions which are probably 98% of all abortions. 
Sus!"
Here's an idea keep your legs closed hoes
All the angry baby killers are upset about not being able to Erase babies denying them the chance to live
Only people who never were in the situation to decide if they could or couldn’t care for a child could make such a horrible decision.
It means that babies lives are no longer at the mercy of selfish women!
The best decision made by the court
Why dont women who want abortions adopt their babies to women who have miscarriages or People who cannot have children..instead of being the excicutioner of these these poor innocent little souls ..
Ahhh...it feels gud 2b a American right now
"But it's as you say its down to the individual states, so it has not been banned nationwide. So why are the Democrats trying to incite violence over this? It can still happen so Threatening to burn down the supreme Court is very extreme in my view!!"
is that what america call human right?
hell yeah 🤣🤣🤣 know you know
"Pro life for the unborn, no life for the elementary kids"
Will Trump and his GOP Congressmen still be able to access abortions for their mistresses? Asking for Matt Gaetz...
Absolutely disgusting America you are pigs evil and any women should have the right to abortion fuck you Supreme Court 🖕🏻
great. women now have less rights than guns how fun THANKS /sarcasm
"Now its time for men, to take the contraceptive pill, and the implant."
"Republicans control all the oil in the US,now they control womens vaginas,,,republicans drop dead.."
Thank God for this ruling for so many years these women been killing an innocent life . Find another way to fix your problem and stop trying to find any type of happiness with the cost of your baby life .
Omg 😱 Jesus loves the children all over of the world to not be used and abused because they fell off the wrong hands and the corrupted system who has nothing to do with Jesus so stfu. Don’t put Jesus into your all bs American slavement. The only reason you guys want children is to keep having servants not freedom. It’s bull shit how people feel entitled to others. Slave BS minds this is what happens when people don’t look at themselves but are so worried about other peoples lives. Look at your own house your own thoughts don’t be God to others FUCK.
"USA: spends trillions of dollars, 20 years and thousands of their own lives (and millions of foreign lives) to give ""equality"" to women in Afghanistan
Also USA: not allow women in their country to get an abortion if they were raped or failure to do so would put her life at risk"
Wait for the new baby boomers
"I feel there's a simple fix to all these protesters: Give them hysterectomies, so their horrid selves can never have babies."
abortion is sick
Abortion is Murder The Supreme Court did the right thing. 😊
How out of touch the BBC has become America unlike here has a constitution I suggest BBC get reporters who know and understand the difference.
Bears are real. I know because the Queen had a sarnie with one.....
"True and ✅ end time signs,more evil  happening more killings and so will the prophesy be fulfilled and the earth will be over and the kingdom of our Lord Jesus will decend and those whose names are written will be saved for they are clean unto God and unto the Lamb.brothers,sisters,mothers,fathers,little ones,Muslims,Hindu,Buddhists,and whatever religious group you give yourselves or made to believe..even people who claim Christianity with mouth and doesn't even know Jesus Christ,please repent..God is the only one who loves us genuinely and devils and his cast out demons are not happy about it,they want to drag some to destruction with them,pray let your eyes be open and repent quickly.dont say at the last day I wish I had known or I heard the messages but I didn't repent."
"{in the name of God the must merciful and compassionate}
all women's in life can't do the abortion after the 40 day's of pregnancy this was in all holy books before the holy Quran , they can remove the baby before the 40 day's of pregnancy I swear in the name of great God it's the true truth, but but if the woman respect it and she doesn't remove it from her body she will not regret at all especially the one who hurt so bad like the ones who get raped from bad sick criminal from any years past or now because she a victim innocent woman and the great God respect them so much and if the woman raised the child she will take a great boons after life 😔 the great God will burn all the criminals in hell of fire after death, women's can do the abortion before the 40 day's of pregnancy but she must go to a good professional doctor in hospital 🏥 but she can't do the forbidden abortion after the 40 day's of pregnancy because the great creator he put the soul in body of the child in his mother womb, about the bad sinrs women's who do the forbidden adultery she must stop ✋ and if she was pregnant she must raised the baby or she give it to the government they will take care of him , if someone wants something pls text me it's my honor to help you., yes I forgot something very important if the woman was so ill and she bleeding she must go to hospital to remove the baby if that baby wad so dangerous to her live herself because sometimes women's fall off or she had some accidents any accident in life or someone hurt her she must go to hospital immediately and it's not matter if she was pregnant before 40 days or not she must safe herself 💔🥺 poor women's can't imagine how they feel when they be pregnant God bless all women's , if the woman was not clean faithful she can remove the baby before the 40 days of pregnancy but she must stop and ask forgiveness I hope that 💔."
"Abortion was never protected under the Constitution. That's why Roe v Wade was overturned. The Supreme Court did not take a stance on the legality of abortion, because there is no such law over which they have jurisdiction; rather, they reached the only conclusion they *could* reach, which was to affirm what IS in the Constitution, and that's the 10th Amendment, which makes abortion a state issue (which it is, given that healthcare is mentioned nowhere in the Constitution). Democrats have had 49 years since Roe v Wade to pass another Amendment to enshrine abortion rights, but instead they did nothing and therefore have only themselves to blame. But as usual, they point the finger at anyone & everything else for allegedly wronging them."
All the ones happy is un attractive and ugly
"An evil strategy of the wealthy and powerful to force the poor to reproduce enough cheap labours for them to continuously to exploit. The quality of their lives, the health, both mentally and physically are not their concern. This is a tragedy not just to under privileged American women, but to our entire human race! This is a disgrace!"
"A women should not be forcefully burdened with the child, this is truly a dark day in American history. This is wrong, they are treating women like a secondary gender. These people of religion are taking lives of women, they think they are saving life of an unborn child, but the truth is they are pushing both the women and child to hell of a life ahead"
I pray same-sex marriage gets overturned as well. It's an oxymoron for one and a total mockery of covenantal love God establishes between a man and a woman. Rejoice in the Lord!
Abortion is wrong..
"Fact check: Propaganda from the BB.C. 
The power to decide time frames has been given back to individual States, nothing has been outright stopped."
"SOMEONE SHOULD TELL TO THOUSE ""PRO LIFE"" IDIOTS,THAT ABORTUS AND FAMILY PLANNING ARE ESSENTIAL FOR POPULATION AND FOOD CONTROL.AND IF TO MUCH PEOPLE ARE BORN,ITS GONNA BE ""PRO LIFE"" FAULT FOR COLAPSE OF POPULATION,NATURE,AND FOOD INDUSTRY."
This is one of the topics where i stand in the middle😑😑😑
the lady who signed it probably cant get prego anymore
"Once again, there never was a right to abortion, Scotus recongised that RvsW was incorrect."
"Mag contraceptive kung ayaw mabuntis hindi yung i papa abort yung baby. Ginusto niyong mag chukchakan nung naka buo papa abort niyo depende kung na rape or na abuse eneme diba. Mag condoms, mag pills etc. 😒. Sa mantalang yung iba gusto mag ka baby hindi ma ka buo kayong may kakayanan pinapa laglag niyo lang"
i understand a life is life but i feel like people should have a choice based on there situations this is crazy.
"Hooray! Yet another slap in the face for women's rights. Now let's discuss punishment for evil mothers who get an abortion. It's murder, right? How about life in prison? The death sentence?"
"Shut that cooch down ladies,  Its time to put a lid on the $lut walk and pick up a book on how to make a tasty sandwich for a potential hubby.  America finally got something right."
Thank u America🌹❤️
Making sure they get more slaves for free;) “ saved by the good government & the church”
Whats this ? Religious people imposing their views on others? Surely not! :- First you abandon  the children of Afghanistan to the Taliban and now this. You are no better than those who oppress others in other countries.
If you believe in a God then you should Automatically lose the right to be a Judge:- You have already proved that you have no critical thinking skills.
"Finally, Good news."
"BBC doesn't believe in god but they do support child abuse, remember who paid Jimmy Saville"
They hate adult women already how can they love part of them. All they want is control. Crazy religious people.
"Joooj, ovi Amerikanci će cijelom Svijetu samo popovat o nekoj demokraciji i kako su slobodni, a vidi što rade... sramota!"
"2:20 WOW, you know you can just NOT have sex outside of marriage and it solves ALL those problems. 

% figures women who seek abortions can just take a flight to canada?"
"10s of millions of women. WOW thats a lot of women who are killing children, time to move to a state that ALLOWS abortion if you're a woman who sleeps around 

YIKES crazy women everywhere."
Abortion is murder and the child doesn't have a say in it if people don't want to have a child used contraceptive it's as simple as that the Bible says that God saw the embryo and all the working parts of David alive and growing
Surely a good decision.  Cos the feautus lives matter.  It is very cruel act to take the future innocent baby's life
All hues and cries for unborn kids.... Nobody even want to care about the thousands of kids in orphanages and Foster cares who grow up without love or affection... Wow what hypocrisy
What a disaster of country. The US is in total decay.
Abortions will never stop...just safe ones will not be available. They should open up public funded travel to help out women wanting an abortion to travel to states where it is still legal.
"Dr Willie doesnt have right to kill children. What a bunch of sickos. Red wave is coming to get rid of perverts.
🤣🤣"
"Hope, hope for the world!"
"The best, the best news , America is back! It brings tears of happiness!"
"Next is getting rid of perverts

🤣🤣"
"This decision was a no brainer. No right to abortion expressed or implied in us constitution. Never has been. No one has a right to kill a child.
🤣🤣🤣"
JUST GO WATCH HOW A CHILD IS ABORTED !
Crazy people.
The handmaid‘s tale
as a male abortion has to be legal idc what ppl say
"It burned my heart to watch videos on social media of women who say that they killed their children, “they had abortions.” If the problem is with poverty, then this is not a justification for committing such a horrific crime. Otherwise, what are we different from those who bury their daughters for fear of poverty 14 centuries ago?
Note: All laws and regulations allow abortion in cases of rape and danger to the life of the mother. What we object to is abortion without a real reason, which is most of the cases of abortion."
"People are Stupid Some lady said ""What about the Dads that rape their Daughter"" My answer 2 that is Good Now there will me Evidence of what he's doing instead of us having laws that Help these people DESTROY EVIDENCE AND LIFES!!🤨"
"These people are selfish and delusional to think that they have the right to tell a woman what choice she makes about their bodies and their own life.  Shame on us America, usually proud to be an American...not today"
The abortion protesters who hassle women outside of clinics can eat shit and die!
That Arkansas law..you can shove it up your ass!
Abortion providers need hugs and love these days!
A message to that man with the umbrella that said murder..he who hath not a uterus should shut the fucketh up!!!
Abortion will never go away!
"How d care if its illegal stil de kil unborn children,worse dan wars"
And organised crime thanks the government for a brand new business adventure.
"If I were to debate a person on abortion there would be 3 things I’ll point out. 

1. The fetus has value, just not as much as a person (that’ll be important leading to the third point and I’ll expand on that) 

2.The fetus is a “human being” in the sense it’s a being which comes from someone, but it isn’t a person. It’s not cognitively changing or reacting to anything that happens to it so from that standpoint it matters less and is complete indifference

3. The reason it’s good to draw the line at birth (third trimester abortions rarely happpen and most of the time they do it’s for extreme medical reasons) is because of physical consequence. The woman has something in herself which If held to the contrary of what I believe she’d have to deal with the struggle of giving birth as someone who doesn’t want to as well as the vast amount of possible health issues that come with giving birth outside of just when the baby is out. Once a baby is born, there’s little to no physical consequence because the person can rid themselves of responsibility as they will and it’s outside themselves. The baby also isn’t a person but it matters enough to have it live due to what it can accomplish mixed with that it isn’t a physical hindering of someone with actual personhood as far as their body"
Get your facts straight. The federal government turn the matter over to the individual states. There are only 5 states where abortion is illegal.
Hoes Mad...Hoes Mad...Hoes Mad...Hoes Mad.
So if you got raped and pregnant? Your gonna take care of the child?
THERE IS NO FEDERAL RIGHT TO MARRY ANYONE; PEOPLE VOTED TO DEFINE MARRIAGE IN THE LAST 15 YRS AND THE USSC TOOK AWAY THEIR RIGHTS BY OVERRIDING THEIR DEMOCRACY.
Trump did that; the man gets things done.
"Are all foreign journalists this ignorant? There is no Constitutional right to an abortion, there never has been. That was the entire point of the SC ruling. Even Liberal legal scholars concede that Roe was founded in bad law. The Supreme Court does NOT legislate policy. Its ONLY purpose is to interpret the Constitution. I was a journalism major before my professor told me that true journalism was dead, and the first thing we learned is how to do proper research and fact check. Please educate yourself."
"As an Australian, you may say I have no right to view my opinions- but I say screw that! I’m lucky to live in a country where our government actually gives a sh*t about us! It’s sad how some of you Americans care more about your guns than women! 
Here’s an idea, if these men/women that believe in a magical man in the sky think it’s okay to tell what women should do with their bodies, how about you old f*cks get a vasectomy at age 60? And even better, men below 18 as well? Can you American women please bring that up with the Supreme Court? If they think taking away woman’s rights is okay then theirs should be taken away too! Fair is fair right? Bloody pathetic! 
I hope these laws change for you beautiful American women! Xxx"

"This lie that most women are getting abortion from ABUSE needs to stop 

Most women are using abortions like birth control 

I know a woman who had 11 abortions before she had the last 4 children. 

This is sexual irresponsibility"
"States can’t regulate guns but women's rights on abortions with no exception to incest or even r@pe 💀?? ok America, call urself a ""free country"" why dont ya"
🙄 women fighting for the right to be sexually irresponsible.
"I don't like christians but in this case they're right, abortion is a murder and women should not be able to kill children and face little consequences."
"I thought Biden can make that decision.   Poor Americans,,  I rather have that option to choose."
So people are upset because they can't end life anymore 😕 what has this world come too???
"IT'S ABOUT THE POPULATION TO SUSTAIN STATUS QUO. Black Americans Are The Most Valuable Economic Resource For The White People Power Structure. IT'S ABOUT THE POWER OF THE INK PEN TO MAINTAIN THE WHITE PEOPLE POWER STRUCTURE. The goal of white supremacists' [law making] courts with weaponized abortion laws is about sustaining a perpetual supply of black bodies for the number one job creator of white people -- the civil and criminal codification systems. These two systems DO NOT WORK WITHOUT PEOPLE to intrap into 1 - if not both - TO FINANCE JOB CREATION AND GOVERNMENT FUNDING(S).  Black Bodies are the number one RESOURCE to sustain both civil and criminal systems for white people employment and power. It is also ABOUT INCREASING THE WHITE AMERICAN POPULATION to protect the economic power of the white race FOREVER into the future. The White American POPULATION IS SHRINKING. To play the long-game, DEMANDS FORWARDED THINKING OF AT LEAST THREE  GENERATIONS - [100 YRS] FROM THIS MINUTE. BUT FIRST YOU GOTTA BE AROUND IN A CENTURY - MEANING DESCENDANTS / BABIES TO PASS POWER & HIGH INCOME TO.. The white labor force MUST BE replenished as the older white labourers leave the labor market. The potential labor output of the unborn white child is EXTREMELY VALUABLE to those in longstanding white positions of power and high income. The longstanding positions of white power and high income cannot remain in the hands of white power or be conserved and sustained for white people ONLY if the white labor force to retain and conserve the high income is not replenished. This is why Dixiecrat Republicans with high income and positions of power do not care about life after birth. Because the high quality of life after birth is subject-to birth into an already established white family with benefit and security of longstanding white positions of power and access to ""white power & privilege"" is determined by birth and/or the output value of mental and physical labor of the white person. It is ""White Socialism"" disguised as ""capitalism"" which is based on false scarcity and false fear of black power. The official ""Citizenship Document"" or ""Birth Certificate"" issued by all predominate white countries is the ""Proof of Collateral"" for the country of birth and based on the potential output of valuable assets, value development and job creation (basically the country's GDP) white countries are able to borrow high amounts of money from international resources based on the potential cash flow & collateral produced from the labor of each citizen - especially each white citizen - whom cannot be collateralized if abortion impedes white population or white birth certificates - hence death certificates and the withdrawal from the gold standard of dollar value. This is why in 1971 the USA eliminated the dollar gold standard and put the dollar up again the USA full faith and credit of the USA's Gross Domestic Product - which should NOW be the Gross Labor Production instead. Especially the income and job creation mechanism of the civil and criminal codification systems - the two systems typically allocated the largest percentage of City, County, State & Federal operating budgets - designed to extract income from the powerless and poor non-whites by way of fines, fees, judgements and convictions to finance white job creation throughout local, state & federal governments by way of the covert Marshall Law style policing in the low income (non-white) communities for the sole purpose of perpetuating poverty - and thereby gaslighting civil liability and criminal activity - a perpetual supply of civil liability and a pipeline of criminals for sustained white job creation. The civil and criminal codification systems are the largest white people job creation mechanism in local, state & federal territories - the number one creator of all types of job positions, income levels and careers. Jobs & careers reserved and passed down to white family & friends forever and ever. Propagated to conserve and retain white power and positions of high income. THE TRUE POWER FIRST ACQUIRED THRU GUNPOWDER AND PROTECTED TODAY WITH THE LARGEST MILITARY AND THE MOST NUCLEAR BOMBS. A POSITION BLACK PEOPLE WILL BE KEPT AWAY FROM AT ALL COST - EVEN IF THE WHITE PEOPLE WERE NOT SO AFRAID OF SUCH BLACK POSITION AND POWER, THEY CANNOT ACCEPT BLACK PEOPLE CONTROLLING THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY WITH THE MOST NUCLEAR BOMBS - UNLESS IT'S OVER THEIR DEAD BODIES."
I am loving in a giant cult run country. Fuck.
The states will decide if they will allow abortions. The people of the state will decide and that’s the way it should be.
Third country
"Land of the ""free"" = banning books,dresscode for children and now this. Home of the ""brave "" = the kidds are more likly to get shoot then of cancer or drivning accident."
"About time we fight against these narcissists that have no believe in god, morality or common sense. Looks like you’re gonna have to be more careful when having sex. Bohooo! Gtfo lol"
It's hard to explain but this means trump has a stronger chance of election
"There will now ALWAYS be a “black market” 
Abortions will still be done, legally or not. 
Hopefully safely, 
But this was A LOT of money and time wasted. 
Abortion will still continue !
A few corporations have already put a change in their health plans, stating that they WILL provide financial help to get their employees to a safe state and care. 
And it’s all good for the higher ups that made this decision….
Until it’s their daughter that gets pregnant because the “family friend” raped them or etc.
Pfffft, don’t think they won’t secretly find a safe way to treat their family."
CONGRATULATION
"""I'm 21 and I'm terrified!""  Of what?   Seriously, of what?  You're not in danger.  The only thing you can't do now that you could before is murder a baby.  Except you still can in half the states.  Are you terrified that if you get pregnant, you might be required to give birth to the child?  Okay, fine.  Giving birth, being pregnant, that's all a very big deal, so it's understandable to not want to go through that.  If that's the case, try not having sex.
There's a lot of talk about rape, incest, and pregnancy complications.  Aside from the fact that these cases are a tiny minority of abortions, my opinion on those is as follows.  
1, Rape: reallocate resources from abortion clinics to psychological counseling and maternity assistance.  Strongly encourage the victim to make the best of her situation, and help her through it.  Abortion may be a last resort in extreme cases.
2, Genetic/physical/mental defects: I think that this category is justifiable as potential reason for abortion, especially in extreme cases where the child's quality of life would be severely impacted.  (eg, if an incurable disease would mean the child would be born and live a short life of suffering, it's arguable that it would be more humane to end it as soon as possible)
3, Incest: Refer to part 1 and 2.  Incest may or may not be rape, and may or may not cause a deformity or defect.
4, Pregnancy complications: If complications arise and the mother's life is threatened by the pregnancy, this is reasonable cause for an abortion procedure.

There was also talk of abortion being a Human Right.  It's not.  It cannot be.  Human rights are inherent, not provided.  You have no right to any service or resource whatsoever.  You do not have the right to have an abortion, to have a life-saving medicine, to have access to the internet, or to have water.  Here's why.  If you have the right to, say, education, that means that any government which upholds human rights must guarantee that you have education.  That means they must not only build schools, but they are responsible for making sure there are teachers.  And if, hypothetically, you lived in a low population area and no teachers were around, the government would be required to relocate a teacher to that location, so you can have your rightful education.  They would need to make it a legally binding statute that someone must educate you, and if that someone refuses to provide their service, they are in violation of the law.  This makes them a slave of the state: work or be punished.  Give water or be punished.  Educate or be punished.  Abort this pregnancy or be punished.  Freedom is a Human Right, because we all have it by default.  Actual rights are things that you start out with, that you have by default.  They can only be restricted or infringed, they are not, cannot be, something that someone does for you, because that infringes other people's rights.  Life is a right.  Freedom is a right."
CONGRATULATION
A return to subjugating women and keeping them in poverty and misery.
"the woman with the sign in the thumbnail ""The future is anti-abortion""....what a clueless snapper. I can't believe there are women who are against abortion and against a woman's right to choose. Seriously what a woman does with her body and her life should be up to her NOT some Republican loser. I'm not American but Republicans are TOTALLY F'd. This is just one reason why they are F'd but there are SOOOO many more reasons. Leave the women alone, let them decide for themselves."
My :God!! The thought that a baby about to be delivered can no longer be subject to having a pair of forceps thrust into its skull and its brain sucked out is unconscionable!!!  We demand partial abortion!!!!!
Abortion kills innocent human life and should be banned worldwide
imagine being saddened by not being allowed to murder human babies in the  womb
Some of yall in the comments raising hell because they said y'all can't kill y'all babies no more..can't be the same people going to church praying to God for money..I mean seriously
This reporter looks amazing her suit is so neatly fitted on her. The woman in the blue.
If women can opt out of being a parent then men should have the same right without being financially burdened for the next 20 years. Men shouldn't be forced to pay for something women ultimately can destroy.
"The “Pro-Life” movement is Pro-Death, and more people need to recognize this important fact.

The same justices and politicians who weep crocodile tears for embryos are the ones who sentence thousands of the elderly and children to die.  How “pro-life” are they really when they refuse to protect people from COVID and guns?  The blood of thousands stain their hands, disproving their rhetoric about caring for life.

We need to vocally label conservatives as the pro-death party, and directly call out people like Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas as the heartless, treacherous wretches they truly are.  Don’t let these hypocrites claim the higher ground on the cause of saving lives; challenge them and ask how many people died from their other actions."
"Why not use condom 
What is the need to get pregnant if tou dont want the child dont you know doing sex makes baby"
"pro - life.  women should think life is a precious gift. 
Jesus Christ 🙏 is boss. The world universe has killed millions trillions of unborn children.   
women says it is their choice and their bodies.  what about the child body.  parents supposed to protect their unborn child not get rid of their tiny bodies. God help women."
"Screaming they have the right to kill baby's should strike a notch in every human being alive.
It sounds kind of sick doesnt it!
If most people had seen what the after shot of an abortion looks like they wouldnt feel that way!"
"Thanks Trump, for the march for life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Awesome ruling!!!!!
Wtf is happening I'm so glad i was not born in this crazy country...
"USA constitution do not guarantee the right to abortion. Lies lies lies!!!!!
Read the constitution"
Mr trump & his idiots have nothing better to do than cause trouble over stupid stuff
Stop Abortion!! Born To Live Free!! 🇺🇸 Wake Up American people!! 🇺🇸 God Bless Our Nation🇺🇸 God Bless America 🇺🇸 God bless Our President Trump 🇺🇸Wake Up America!! 🇺🇸Wake Up American!! 🇺🇸 Freedom is not Free!! 🇺🇸
Liberals are crazy you can't tell them nothing they like to kill babies this woman that's screaming should thank her mother for not aborting her hears a good case for abortion
US is messed up
"Psalm 139:13-18(TLB)-13 You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit them together in my mother’s womb. 14 Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex! It is amazing to think about. Your workmanship is marvelous—and how well I know it. 15 You were there while I was being formed in utter seclusion! 16 You saw me before I was born and scheduled each day of my life before I began to breathe. Every day was recorded in your book! 17-18 How precious it is, Lord, to realize that you are thinking about me constantly! I can’t even count how many times a day your thoughts turn toward me.  And when I waken in the morning, you are still thinking of me!"
"As a child whose parent considered abortion. Its not right to force women to have these babies. It sucks knowing you were unwanted and that you ruined your parents lives. One broken condom and they got me, a recalled birth control and they got my sister. To this day, my parents hate each other because of my mom's decision to have us. They were happy newlyweds but were definitely not ready for children, let alone two. Sometimes I wish my mom just went through with it. I hate that i put this burden on them and its not like I would've known. And that's what these millions of kids will feel like. My mom had an abortion at 15 when she was raped by a mentor. She was too young to be a mom. She ended up having another one 8 years after i was born. Another BC mistake but she found out she had cervical cancer around 2 months and had to choose getting chemo and losing the baby or waiting til the baby was born and hoping it didn't spread and we lose her or both of them. She chose to stay with her living children. I mean we were sad at the loss but we wanted our mom more. Abortions aren't always bad and each one should be treated individually instead of outlawing all of it."
"Can you imagine the increase of foster care that these unwanted births will go into. Most teenagers having children , don't have the means to provide for a child , whether it is financially or mentally. Children may suffer if in fact these children never get adopted and go thru the foster care route.  Will the government then help with the surge of children in a foster care situation?"
Protesters should educate themselves on how to prevent a pregnancy and stop killing defenseless human beings. Life begins in the womb and that life matters and should be protected.
Praise God for Life.God alone has the right to terminate life. These woman that are fighting are deeply disturbed They have unclean Spirits. Jesus is king and every knee will bow either as Guilty sinner needing forgiveness. or as sinner being Judged.All these woman are upset u know how these precious women can avoid being all these problems fear God don't have sex outside of marriage. Jesus is prolfe He died so you can have eternal Life.. be Born again Trust Jesus as your Savior from your sin
So much for land of freedom and opportunity! It is a v cruel and impractical ban. What if you know your child will be born crippled or stunted and cant help yourselves if you decide not to proceed with pregnancy?!
It's a slaughter house....these people are demon driven!!
It's evil to murder an unborn precious living human created by God not man's decision....çhanges are good Lord God says all good things comes from above
"No accountability, they want the right to be irresponsible with their bodies. While men have none😂🤣😅😃😄😁"
It is not illegal in America it is giving the choice back to the states. Abortion rights have never been a Constitutional right. If you believe that Please show me in the constitution where it states it ?
Abortions saved my life
Let's keep it real
Nobody has ever wanted to touch them
It's ugly chicks that are pro-life cuz they don't know what it's like to get pregnant

        Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.Ezekiel 18.4
      Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.Psalm 51.5
        The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is ETERNAL LIFE through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6.23. (The first death is physical death and the second death is spiritual death which means ETERNAL death: if we do not repent and accept the Lord  Jesus as our Lord and Savior.)
      And as it is appointed unto men ONCE to die, but after this the JUDGMENT: Hebrews 9.27
    I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.Luke 13.3,5
         Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.John 3.3
      Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.  1 Peter 1.23. 
      If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.1 John 1.9,10                      
   Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. Revelation 3.20
      But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. John 1.12.                                    
    For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,  they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the  children of God: Romans 8.14-16 
      That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved. Romans 10.9
       For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2.8-9
     Therefore being justified by faith, we have  peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: Romans 5.1
      But God commended his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.Romans 5.8
    For I delivered unto you first of all  that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
         And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 1 Corinthians 15.3-4
       For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
      For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
     He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3.16-18
     For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. Romans 14.11
     For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10.13
    For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he  hath done, whether it be good or bad. 2 Corinthians 5.10
       In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel. Romans 2.16
      For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Ephesians 5.5
      But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death . Revelation 21.8 
Whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. Revelation 20.15.                                                        Revelation 6

      Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 1 Thessalonians 4.16-17
     Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. John 6.54.                         
    Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: John 11.25-26
       Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
      In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
     For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
    So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 1 Corinthians 15.51-54
         (The whole earth will be controlled by the Mark of the Beast.)       Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin  be revealed, the son of perdition;
       Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. 2 Thessalonians 2.3-4
         (Please do not take the mark of the beast on your right hand hand and in your forehead to buy and sell. By doing so we will be doomed for all eternity.)
     And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
     And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the  number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six.Revelation 13.16-18
    And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,
       The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:
      And the smoke of their torment ascended up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.Revelation 14.9-11

There must be an exception for rape victims.
Well i imagine this will cause an increase use of condoms and a drop in STD cases at least.
"Funny, the same people who are screaming “My body my choice” are the same people who support vaccine mandates. 
The same Democrats who call everyone who does not support them racist are calling Justice Thomas “Uncle Tom”. 
The same Democrats who want to “pack the court” are the same people who were outraged when Trump got to pick a few Judges. 

Once again, Democrats live by the belief that anything is OK as long as it fits their agenda. 
Democrats are the party of race baiting, hate and division. Keep everyone dependent, divided and scared so they can be controlled."
"Good bye USA!  Did the taliban just take over?  Disgusting, disturbing, disbelief!  I will never visit this country again."
"Reading the comments below, I am reminded of why Leftist elites call you brainwashed morons ""useful idiots"". The Supreme Court did NOT take away your right to kill unborn babies. It simply upheld the 10th Amendment, which makes clear that such decisions are the purview of the individual states, not of the federal government. Some states will outlaw feticide, as is their right, and others will keep it."
Reversing Roe is a big win for pedophile priests and the religious fascists that worship them.
They need to make abortion ilegal. Death penalty for abortion.
Biden looks like he's gonna pass out just reading his script. Dude is just not interested lol
"Dr Willy won't be crushing anymore babies"" skulls in Arkansas. Sorry, not sorry."
"Baby killer Biden can't get baby formula to mothers, but he's doing everything to get them their pills to kill their babies in their wombs."
For 50 years USA was in lockstep with North Korea and China with abortion.  Now we can get back to walking a moral path.
"I have been to court many times.  When the Judge asked me if, I plea guilty or not:.,  the thought always went through my mind: 'could you have avoided this'  'could you have made better decisions'.  ""Could you have listened to your father and mother not to go out on a Saturday night'.?!/..  

I understood I made lots of wrong choices at that age.    I always plead guilty. I knew that taking responsibility for my own actions meant being accountable.
       Today, these folks seem to forget who is responsible. They Are!"
"Ladies, Don't let your body cheaper than a prositute😂"
Supreme court is pro life until it comes to school shootings? Strange.
"Abortion is killing, no to abortion"
Abortion is Genocide....
I'm so happy 😁👍 with the Court Rulings no more genocide against babies. Abortion is Genocide.
The only good thing about 2022
"Men need to shut their mouths. An unwanted baby doesn’t ruin THEIR lives…only women’s lives. So now foster care and orphanages will skyrocket in population. Many more kids will be without parents. We’ll have 12 year olds giving birth. Raped women will be forced to carry. Poverty for women will increase greatly. I think the ""fathers"" and fetus should get DNA tests and be forced to pay child support upon conceiving not birth. Also, pay half the hospital and doctors bills. Prison if they don’t!  They already don’t with no consequences. So we are putting women right back at that severe disadvantage and women’s salaries will decrease and we’ll see fewer in management positions because of sickness, delivery and maternity leave. Of course men want this. It gives them the upper hand. Forcing women to have a baby they don’t want will never turn out well. Imagine the self abortions and desperate measures women will take. Many will have the procedure in Mexico. This will traumatize millions. I think as long as a fetus can’t live on it’s own outside the womb, abortion should be legal. Government better not touch the Plan B pill, change birth control, no questions asked rule.  In fact now we need more of this readily available and free at Planned Parenthood. Federal laws like this worry the sh/te outa me. Each state should govern itself not nine people!  I know my state will ban it but I still believe in state governance. We CANNOT let this seep into other areas where we end up being run federally. We aren’t China, Russia or North Korea. I guarantee those six votes were to lord over the states not to care about fetuses. They know good and well this will financially cost us dearly. It probably also has something to do with an increase in natural born American citizens becoming more and more of the majority. Taking away women’s rights is unjust and discriminatory. I’m SO sick of the inequality. We’ve never even had a female President. Never. Black Lives Matter?  Yes and we’ve even had a black president. A man. 🙄 I still get teary eyed thinking about at least we have a Madam Vice President. But I want to see a Madam President and First Gentleman of the White House. And all of those people standing out there crying in happiness…are they going to adopt thes unwanted babies. Will they volunteer their time at an orphanage?  Will they foster ten kids? Of course not because they’re hypocrites. So yeah…there are so many horrible things about this."
Hm well the same sex marriage is next. One thing to say to the judge....how about interatrial marriage judge? oh sorry you are married to a white woman hm....well if you open Pandora's box you never know the outcome ....
It's scary to see these women celebrating... abortion can't be stopped...women will continue to terminate unwanted pregnancies by all means possible and most likely now die doing it!
"U guys remember the film Hot Tub Time Machine? Specifically, the scene of Chose It Dose It. So, if the believe the babies should be born, they should be handled the rights to rise those kids. The mother's don't want to kid (this varies). All those people who don't want abortion laws should be handed the kids born. The kids which the mother does not want for which ever reason. We all win."
... I'm ready to get the 🤬 out of this 🤬 country...
Americas gone a bit crazy lately hasn't it 😕
Praise Jesus
"If anything America needs to stop having children... the thought prosses here must have been extremely short. Poverty will rise, clearly! Lower educated family's will grow causing more mental health issues. But at least you still have gun laws to support bad mental health in children. The movie idiosyncrasy was supposed to be a joke."
"LOL so much not correct with this reporting.  There is no ""legal obligation"" to ban abortion.  Nonsense.  All the ruling does is follow the Constitution and gives States some of their Rights back against the Federal Government.  The States will now get to decide for themselves as they always had the Right to do so."
"""Who is the government to decide what I do with my body""
Who are you to decide what happens to the babies body?"
Trump is a Trump indeed
Pro-Life does not end with delivery of the baby
What's next America? Chastity belts?
It should be illegal for women to say no to men. Saying no is the murdering of a potential baby! Murder is murder!
guy saying abortion is murder on 5:15 can burn in hell for all i care because its not murder.
banning abortion is wrong and its a womans choice. some people make excuses saying its murder and should be banned if people dont like it then leave it alone and they need to just stay of it its none of they  business.
"God is watching over His gift of life taken  for granted by humans.  Contraceptives are widely available, they are not banned. For rape and incest cases, the individual will have to make a personal decision.  Some pro abortion activists say, it is their body.  No one  says it isn't.  Killing a baby/embryo is still murder. It should never be used as a substitute for contraceptive. There are long term implant contraceptives available and other states still available to perform abortion if someone sees nothing wrong with ending  a human life on an ongoing, as needed or regular basis."
They SHOULD have the right to tell people what to do with their body if they're using it as a baby killing weapon. What if I'm an expert in karate? They shouldn't be telling me that I don't have the right to chop your neck and make you dead right? Yes they should! There are a lot of different ways that the body can be used as a weapon!
Its interesting to see the clear bias of the reporters.
"Yeah these abortion women have dreams they that they believe were destroyed, but destroying the dream of a prospective Father who wants children is just as bad! I have children, and I pray every day that no idiot aborted my child. That's sick shit! I once married a girl in order to prevent her from getting an abortion."
"Rapist 、pedophiles' 、toxic families and relatives must be very happy now they can able to control women again. Congratulations America. You are just as bad as other third world countries. Un-educated. Narrow minds, control freaks. NOBODY HAS RIGHTS TO TELL WHAT WOMEN WANTS TO THEIR BODY!! you cannot even help all of the orphans so why putting your nose on women's decision? What about mandatory all of the guys to do vasectomy so it's fair? Then we do not need to worry about getting pregnant. I would rather not to forgive all the parents who decided to keep the  babies and ended up neglected or killed them. Where are all  your supports for the parents who need help if you are pro-life?!If you think women who did abortions are selfish then pro-life are selfish too because you judge another human being without thinking about their situations. We all not perfect but do not act like you better pro-life people!!! America has more problem than this!!!!"
"Mortal man can change laws left or right, liberal or conservative but God's laws remain the same. "" Thou shalt not kill""."
"Baby: ""It's so good! It's so fine! The right to life has returned back to being mine!"" Praise the Lord!"
Americas coat hanger sales have gone through the roof 😅
So women are now upset they lost their right or choice ....men have no say either way and should have right to financial abortion...only fair right. Now you know how men feel....how's it feel ladies...suxs doesn't it
Delicious liberal tears.
"Hey women out their who want to murder babies, get some contraception or keep your panties on. Murder should never have been an option."
"No matter how you rub your lips with your mouth, Abortion is wrong, period."
Boycott American conservative owned companies and businesses. They supported this.
"I get tired of doing this but here we go again.  There is no constitutional right to abortion, nor was there ever.  Biden and his leftist advisors may say there was, but if you go look for yourself, you will see they are in serious error and misleading the public.  The constitution actually gives the states the right to legalize abortions.   It doesn't even give that right to the Supreme Court.  So when SCOTUS decided on Roe v Wade they were acting as an unelected legislative body and acted in contradiction to the constitution. Even RBG recognized this and said the decision was on shaky grounds and she was pro abortion.   This supreme court now is recognizing this and has handed the states back their rights.  Look, if you want your rights and freedoms that are enshrined in law, then you have to follow the law.  You can't pick and choose which laws you are going to follow.  If you want to change the law then you need to pressure those who can do that.  One thing I do know is that whenever the left doesn't get their way they react violently.  Remember the George Floyd riots?  How about the threats and plots to kill Supreme Court Justices?  I thought only right wing fascists did that sort of thing.  Guess not.  Seems the left is much more inclined to violence.  I've even watched certain members of congress and the now vice-president of the United States encouraging and cheering on that violence.  Think that might be sedition?"
Land of the free!
The US is becoming the anus of the world
Abortion is not something a mother think lightly of. She probably thought it through and pulled herself together to go through the process. I feel sorry for every women who aren’t in a state that will protect our rights and will have to travel to another state for resources and services. There are many unwanted children in the system who struggle to find families because families also have their own standards on the children(ren) they want to adopt.
Care about people .. care about women .. really … what about the care of the unborn babies… selling the parts afterwards on the open market .. care of the women … REALLY… take care of yourself before sex … not afterwards !!!!
Well Former President Trump
"""The termination"" or the dismembering/killing you should say?"
"We Do Have Constitutional Rights And Civil Rights In Our Country In Our Communities Our Cities Our Streets 
Abortion rights It’s Our Bodies 
So Is Weed And Drugs 
It’s Legal Isn’t It 
We Do Have Our Civil Rights Also Against Marijuana"
Women … take care of yourselves before sex NOT afterwards … murder is not the answer !!!!
Lady Abortion is NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION… do ur research before you talk !!!
"Abortion is irresponsible sex, and self-satisfaction. Unless you are a victim of a crime."
"Biden, is not the ""majority"", is half and half ! so it is even..."
"What are scared about , stop sleeping around"
All i can say is i'm glad joe is giving them someway out when they need it for  certain circumstances
These hos want to screw around without using a condom and get an abortion when they fk up and get pregnant lol
"Abortion is banned:
-Eastern Europeans: Our children deserve to live! God bless! ☦

-Westerners: 🔥Ã̷̢̝͙͕̱͒́͝ṋ̷̣͖̘̤͍̃̓̿͑̓͑̈́Á̴̢̧̖͚͙̳̞͇̝̆́͆́r̴̜̣̳̜̭̩̍Ç̸̖̦͍̹͎͖͇̥̗̔̋̃h̶̡̪͖͉̟̑̅̾͠Ý̸̧̧̝̪͙̗̯̫̮̼🔥"
"Oy, bruv, innit...the extent of words I care to hear from Brits."
Vomiting 🤮. This is horrible
BBC fake news! It means that people should go to states that agree with their values… to kill babies
"I mean abortion is a choice, and it is upto the women who is carrying the baby what she should or shouldn't do. In no way she should be compelled to carry the child if chooses not to. Very sadge 😔😞."
"Those of you who don't live here in the U.S. please take to the streets and protest for us. Maybe if other countries join us it will help. I'm frieghten for my children and the world over with these extremist changing America in the worst way and having the largest military, the furture could be a very frightening place for all of us. We're being oppressed. Please help us."
"Abortion is murder.  You get an abortion by a doctor.  They're the murderer and the woman is an accessory to murder.  If there was no options for women, not to get pregnant. I could understand.  But there's MANY options to prevent getting pregnant.  And as far as wanting to get pregnant, getting pregnant. But finding out the baby has health issues.  BE A HUMAN BEING AND GIVE THAT BABY A CHANCE AT LIFE.  And my views aren't about religion.  It's just about being a caring, sensitive human being.  If a woman gets raped.  You can put that baby up for adoption. There's so many couples who want babies, but can't.  Couples can give that baby a home. With lots of love and care for many years."
"Wether or not you are for abortion, notice the rise of churches in the US,
Back to the middle ages"
"Slippery slope... so what's next beyond the current issues? Should we take away voting rights from women and people of color? Should only ONE religion be allowed? Should all people with diseases and disabilities be removed from existence? Yes, it's all the same thing and yes, this is normal in some backward countries right now :)

Democracy is great but not for everything. We have seen where democracy does not work for certain issues. Sometimes, you have to scrap democracy and support something because it's just what a society of equality and respect is all about. 

I'm glad that companies are getting involved because they have rights too and often power. It's funny how big progressive companies are the ones with the courage - I would love to see big conservative companies come out supporting pro-life, but you know they won't because at the end of the day, this would still hurt conservative parties a lot more than progressive companies. That speaks volumes as to where the general society sits and what brand is more powerful. Again, we'll see how pro-choice companies like Netflix, Disney, and Amazon will be impacted - I don't think much because most pro-lifers are hypocrites and will still visit Disney, subscribe to Netflix, and buy from Amazon LOL"
"So many children in states who go through foster care, child abuse and youth drug abuse. Now there will be many more due to unwanted child birth. I can't believe it doesn't even make exception for rape and abuse victims. This is stupid, leaving mothers accountable while fathers will fly off(talking about those who abandon women after pregnancy)."
"All the anti abortion chicks are so ugly, so it doesn't matter to them, no one getting them pregnant."
pro-choice
"Hey everyone ...divide and rule strikes again, their still playing us."
"You would think the US would of learned from history, Nationwide Prohibition and the Drug on War campaign where became illegal and how well that turned out.. I think the US government is a bipolar rollercoaster"
"Its crazy how people want to have pleasure but do not want the responsibility that comes with it. For every action there's a reaction. The whole reason humans have sex is to procreate and its engrained in the biology of every living thing. Do not reply to me about rape and incest (which contributes for 1.5%  abortions. A majority of women who have abortions are doing it our of their own convenience to shy away from the responsiblity of having a child) , or clump of cells (which we all are), consciousness (which in technicality from the viewpoint of pro-choicers would mean people in coma or asleep arent human beings since they arent conscious), women have the right to choose ( which everyone has the right to choose but that does not mean the choice is right and some choices should be prohibited e.g just because I have the choice to stab some one doesn't mean I will because as I stated earlier there's consequences for each choice we make whether its immediate or in the future ), you have control of your own body ( which in this case the body in dispute is not the mothers and the child is the one going to be destroyed so its our duty as pro-lifers to defend it) ,women may die from pregrancies (with our advancement in technology the only 2 our of 100000 women die from pregnacies which is a mortality rate of 0.0002 % and thats for women with complicated health issues the average women wont have any problems) our arguments hinges on the comparision between  humans inside and outside of the womb and our contention is theres isnt any difference aside from their physical location so to say that people who are pro-life dont care about a childs well-being when its outside the womb is BS"
What’s the LGBT doing about this… why are they the most hit and vocal about this? Isn’t girl to girl or male to male can’t conceive? Can someone explain? Thanks.
"It doesn't matter, if you know the USCONSTITUTION.  Article 4section 2, states clearly 
 "" the citizens of each state shall be ENTITLED  to ALL the PRIVILEGES and immunities of citizens in the Several states.""
 We have Equal Rights..States can't make anything illegal that is legal in,  ""the several states "".
 "" Several"" means 3 or more."
Third world country….in certain aspects.
"Shame on all of those involved in making this extremely harmful decision. For the so called ""land of the free"" this quite frankly a disgrace."
"Shouldn't get pregnant in the first place. Only reason for abortion is if the woman was raped,or if the baby will be so badly deformed the quality of life is heartbreaking."
"it’s a shame to see those women cheering, for what??? why do they care so much what other women and people with uterus do with their body, why does it affect them?? go touch some grass"
Millions of innocent lives will be saved. No one should have the right to murder children. 50 years of darkness in the USA have ended.
"Ah yes, don't trust women to decide for themselves whether they want to or are ready to undergo the extremely difficult period of pregnancy, childbirth, and take care of a child. Treat her like she's not an adult and take the decision off her hands. Then pretend you're doing God's work, but not actually care about the kid once it's born."
Many people are not having children until  late 20s early 30s. So I have a conspiracy theory that another small reason is to get more people in the workforce to compete against china's superior work productivity.
Finally Joseph Biden the 8 is taking drastic measures to increase the population as he should. Time to return to our traditional roots.
These protesters believe that the supreme court actually makes the law..When in fact its your own state makes the law..Now women you have to take responsibility of your own fk up when out there drinking an fkn one night stand dudes...
It was NEVER a constitutional right to abort a baby.  What you are saying is not true
"In America I don't see any difference between Lawful sexy life and rape.what does abortion mean for such society? because who will determine weather the case is related to rape or Consent? Anyway abortion is equal to Kill unborn kids intentionally, During the intercourse the dependant partners must be reverse a little bit when the agg is broken to avoid abortion."
"I hate to break it to all of you, who are going on about babies and children, but:  we're not talking about babies.
Over 90% of abortions take place before consciousness, awareness, ability to feel or experience anything, has developed in the fetus.
They're a collection of developing cells that have the potential to become babies, but they're not babies.
I suspect those among you who oppose abortion on religious (or what you think of as ""moral"") grounds, do so because you believe in an immortal soul, and therefore they are people from the moment of conception.
This is a belief, not a fact.
It's not ""moral"" to condemn others to a life of misery and poverty, simply to appease your own unsubstantiated beliefs.
(And incidentally, to all those crowing ""if you don't want a baby, don't get pregnant...simple"":  51% of abortions in the US are (or were) provided to people who had been using contraception when they became pregnant).

You all need to realise how simplistic and ill-informed are the opinions by which you deem yourself fit to pass judgement and sentence on others.
Look at your own Bible, and ""judge not, that ye be not judged"", and look for the beam in your own eye ... but I guess you only pay heed to the words of your supposed Saviour, when they fit your own preconceptions and prejudices.

You're all quite sickening."
"This is fear mongering at its best. Abortion has not been criminalized by the Supreme Court! The Supreme Court reversed a WRONG decision that was taken 50 years ago which was based on a flawed interpretation of the Constitution thereby federalizing abortion. What it has now done is to place the decision to legalize or ban abortion where it rightfully belongs -- in the hands of each State's own legislature. And you already see the results of that decision -- progressive States will legalize abortion and everything will carry on as if nothing has happened. More conservative States will ban abortion, but at this stage there is nothing that prohibits a women who seeks an abortion to travel to a neighboring State and have her abortion."
IN GOD YOU TRUST BUT YOUR KILLING YOUR OWN FLESH!
MARCH FOR LIFE DONT KILL THE INNOCENT BABIES !
Maybe it's time for EU and UK and others to offer US women the right to seek political asylum in countries with abortion rights... At least that would send a message to Pence and other fundamentalists.
VICTORY FOR INNOCENT UNBORN BABIES!
Follow God.
"Well america, you're gonna have to introduce ID checks for women crossing state lines."
Hooray for all the troglodyte incest abomination babies who will now be born into a tortured life! There are worse things than not being born. Who the f would want to come here anyway!?
Thank you Amy. ❤️
"forgive me, but when I read about USA Abortion law I can't stop thinking of....










Knocked Up  😂"
👏👏👏👏
Build a better world! Yes
"Abortion is not a constitutional right, that's why it's been struck down.
Good day."
"You can fool all of the time some of the time, some of the people all of the time, but never all of the people all of the time - Abraham Lincoln, please stop worshipping Henry Kissinger who is hosting the next bilderberg meeting when trickle down failed, then we can honestly debate this very divisive issue as adults 💞"
Search up cern july5th its not good
"""Pro life"" idjits fail to see the larger picture where ultimately this will make women 2nd grade citizens. who from whatever background now has to think twice about having any sexual autonomy. A man during a one night stand would do the deed and go away but the woman will have to spend the night hoping the protection didn't fail. So many other ways where the law accommodates the man but never the woman. Just because women have the ability to birth doesn't mean it's a duty, it's not a miracle process. That's how  civilisation evolves. From a necessity to eventual enlightenment of choice. God made all humans capable of that. There's absolutely no logic, reason or emotions in this decision. It's a farce and women have to deal with it."
"The land of freedom, huh?"
The rest of the world should follow this example!
"Commercial sex zones have developed around U.S. bases worldwide. Many look much the same, filled with liquor stores, fast-food outlets, tattoo parlors, bars and clubs, and prostitution in one form or another. The evidence is just outside the gates in places such as Baumholder and Kaiserslautern in Germany, and Kadena and Kin Town on Okinawa. Even during the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, there have been multiple reports of brothels and sex trafficking involving U.S. troops and contractors."
"Seeing the leftists in anguish...
Brings us great joy 😋"
The democrat's and their supporters are going hard on this because of the midterms coming up... anyone who knows anything about how America's political system works knows that all that is needed is Congress to wright a bill (which thay have already ) and pass it into law... nothing to see here folks...🤔💕🇺🇸
"Why abortion, why not wearing condom in right way..and have birth pills...why killing baby?...so cruel....have sex with responsibility..not for fun ....all unborn babies killer will go to hell...and thats their place forever..."
So raped children in the USA will have to give birth from now on? Or they’ll have to have an abortion in underground hospitals?
"Also, I understand these particular situations that you all here are talking about here and respect it, but God decides about it, not us, who lives and who dies. He is the righteous judge. Amen."
Yep a civilization does not kill it's children no matter the circumstances you take the babies right to life from him.
"Alleluia! It's about time America did something right. Remember one thing, it isn't that someone has the last word between groups, it is that God, our Creator, has the last word. Period. Praise be to God! Glory to God forever! Amen."
"For those who disregard history are doomed to repeat it.

The following is a rewording of First they came by Pastor Martin Niemoller.

First they came for women's rights
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a woman.

Then they came for same sex marriage and intimacy.
And I did not speak out
Because I was in a hetrosexual marriage.

Then they came for interracial marriage 
And I did not speak out
Because I was not a person  of colour.

Then they came for the poor
And I did not speak out
Because I was not poor.

Then they came for me
And there was no one left
To speak out for me.

Your rights are a temporary set of privileges given to you by the government. If they are given then they can be taken away. 

What is happening in the USA is a direct attack on everyone. 

Register to vote and ensure your voice is heard."
"Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah, thank you president Trump for appointing justices to the supreme court"
Tragic history is just happened..
It's up to the States to decide... It's not banned in the whole USA... I don't see a problem with that
Welcome to the Theocracy of America (Circa 1406 A.D.)
"Anti abortion, anti gun control, anti mask, anti universal healthcare, anti social spending, in fact anti any safeguards that prevent child/family poverty...Jesus Weeps"
"Correction: Rights of unborn children protected by supreme courts.
Use contraception or have an abortion within a reasonable timeframe ffs."
"Right wing morons, go on show us how much you really care for these unwanted babies by adopting one today"
"For someone to say my body my joice is sick that baby inside you is not your body, it didnt ask to be there no matter wut the sircumstanse and it certainly not asking to be flushed down a toilet, ive herd pro abortion people talking about pregnant women being hit by drunk drivers and screaming for 2 life sentences, the hypocrisy is thick n pro abortion is SICKKKKKK!!!!!"
21 and terrified... Stop screwing aroind....
"1) contraception does NOT give 100% protection from getting pregnant.
2) as I see it, there will be less sex after such ""law"".
3) the numbers of lesbians will grow, because it is impossible to get pregnant this way.
4) the rates of suicides among young pregnant women will grow, specially among teenagers.
5) abortions still will be done by those who need it, same as when alcohol or smoking is forbidden, BUT it will lead to high maternal mortality and complications (because not done in official medical center).
6) now read carefully: they have banned ANY abortion (even pills!) in many states already, including for the underage victims of rape and incest!!!!!
7) numbers of babies left in orphanages will grow, amount of homeless/criminals too - because if kids were NOT WANTED and parents left them, who will educate and give love/attention to +900.000 babies per year? who will feed them, give clothes and teach?
8) they say that this decision protects life, but they refused to pass the law about free contraception or baby food!!!"
"BANS OFF OUR BODIES!!!

-Fetus"
"""Thousands of people want to have a right to kill people since they are not yet born"", is it?"
"Your headline is incorrect.  There was never a constitutional right to an abortion.  A quick word search through the US Constitution will quickly show this.  Roe V. Wade used a rather tenuous interpretation of an imputed right to privacy and even more tenuous interpretation of the right to Due Process in the original ruling.  The only reason that it has stood since 1973 is that there have been no SCOTUS challenges which directly addressed Roe v. Wade.  There have been cases which addressed the APPLICATION of the ruling, but none which addressed the validity of the ruling itself.

Do some research and you will find that even the Pro-Choice side admitted this in 1973.  There have been many millions of dollars spent to ensure that nothing with the required wording to challenge the original decision never saw the inside of a US District Court, much less SCOTUS."
Same sex marriage should also be abolished
Seriously? If women die it’s their risk that they took why not make it safer by legalizing it? Wth is wrong with you guys😒
Turn abortion clinics to maternal homes
Good America is waking up
Close this evil killer clinics down
This victory should not end the fight the evil abortionist will keep on fighting so keep on fighting
So funny they they're enraged of the ruling but they didn't enraged in gun laws the SC ruling.
Evil joe Biden u will not be president if u were aborted big fool biden
Abortion is evil
God bless the supreme court
Great 👌 victory to all those who love life
Just shut up American women if u were aborted u would not have a life to abort someone shut up and give life why take life from someone
"If women are so damn mad about “my body, my choice,” then why are you not mad when a man transitions to a woman? Who will never understand what being a woman is, never having menstrual cycles, never giving birth, never growing breasts. You will never be a woman if you’re born a man. You will never be a man if you’re born a woman. Say anything you want lol, but you’ll always be what you were made to be. Confusing."
"How tf has it effected your community negatively?? So you’d rather have neglected, abused, abandoned, traumatized, and fucked up youth??? My lawd, I’m someone who sees both sides. Women have that right, to a point. I knew a woman who had 8 abortions before she had her children. Didn’t care about birth control, or any sort of PREVENTING pregnancy. That’s wrong. Period. However, other circumstances I can totally understand. So now we’ll be caring for all these kids, or their families will. And there will be an even bigger strain on government assistance with unwanted babies. Are all these pro lifer’s going to help??? Are they going to fund and raise these children? Will they help when they need counseling, and housing and food??? Hell no they won’t, we’re struggling as it is. CPA in most areas are a JOKE. They can’t deal with the high volume they have now, what will the future be like? This is supposed to be the land of the free, but it’s the land of the “how much money you have will gain you the power and voice” insanity. Solidifies and international move in my mind"
"Abortion is killing and women should do abortion just if they have good reason (health issue, in case of rape). Who are we to decide whether someone should live or no!? The fact that we own our body doesn't give us right to decide about someone's life. If we are already pregnant then we should take responsibility for our actions!"
The right to have an abortion has never been guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Please read the U.S. Supreme Court Justice's decisions. Abortions have been given back to the voters in each State.
Abortion is NOT  in the Constitution.
I can't wait to hear someone say how this will severely affect transgender women.😂😂😂
"No sex with men(husbands, boyfriend or that app) they say till the recent ruling overturned.
Women will use it as a weapon against non favorable husbands or boyfriends while going out to have sex with another man; they will all relay on the natural calendar.
Men be on the watch; our slits are becoming very tricky!
Men be on the watch!"
You all better cut the christian crap about unborn babies . You cant force anyone into giving birth and carrying an unwanted child. End of story. My body my choice so you shut up
It is wrong to kill your children what's wrong with you?
Good news!
"Women's body, women's rights but after we have a heartbeat then it's MURDER!"
What ever happened to good old birth control? Why are people so freaked out that women have to pay for their abortions now? Also it is paid if there is danger to the mother. Why are the news not discussing both sides of this subject matter.
🤦‍♀🤦‍♀
"Abortion is illegal in majority of countries around the world, execept where the mothers life is threatened"
Women stop showing your daughters to be like you acting like a w**** getting pregnant by everybody and then one in abortions. Burn your tubes burn your insides so you don't get pregnant show your little girls to burn their insides they're too so they don't get pregnant that way I don't have to be protesting stop sleeping with everybody INBREDS
America is nothing more than one giant used car lot.  ~Vet
so USA is a religious government? sharia law type shit but christian?
I cannot believe this... The fact that the majority of politician's are backed my religious groups and funded by religious backgrounds for PR is discusting.  Crazy religious losers.
My body my choice. That is why no vaccine mandates
"Yes .... USA is going Islamic .. !!
A Step Back for Women's Rights 
Now Same Sex Marriage and contraceptives are in consideration for future ruling."
This abortion crap has nothing to do with woman’s right it’s just again who got the bigger … democrats or republicans
Violence of abortion? White privilege? What about women who are raped? What about accidents?
Wtf has someone else's organs have to do with that lady? Ridiculous.
All i'm saying is the cost to raise children in 2022 is absurd. If developed countries want to ban abortion they should at least make policies to make it easier to raise children for example making a social benefit program where daycare is free so the parents can just work and earn money to support their family.
"""I've seen the devastation abortion has brought on our country"" ? What is she talking about I would like to know what devastation she's seen"
Blame religion lol
"Hard to tell the difference now between the Taliban and America. Neither believes in women's rights. The adoption industry is lacking fresh stock to broker. Adoption was once a billion dollar industry that plotted to make this comeback. Day care will be targeted next to ensure American women are forced to stay home to care for children they didn't plan for and can't afford, or forced to relinquish their new borns to the adoption brokers."
The US Supreme Court did not strike down abortions. It did however give each state the ability to decide (by the people who live in those states) to vote for whether or not you can have an abortion in that state. Many companies have said that if a women would like to get an abortion and the state does not allow that they would provide access and pay  to help the women get an abortion. Your headline sucks - stop it
This is not true. False flag.
"""Right to Kill babies"" that's you are asking???? Use always condoms plz. Save the babies! simple..."
Capitol punishment is murder yet that's alright... What I and I Jah admire about the GOP and maga is their consistency in heretical blasphemous hypocrisy. Go Trump? Tucson Arizona Sonoran desert 🏜️ Jah sisters Jah rastafari praises Tucson Arizona Sonoran desert 🏜️🌜🇺🇲🌛🌍🇬🇧🇯🇲🇪🇹🍻🌵🌵🌵🇿🇦🇬🇧🇮🇱🇸🇪🍌🥧🐠
God bless the scotus.
"For the upcoming Fourth of July in the 🇺🇸 (which includes any and all of his states and territories), I 🤔 any and all detonations of fireworks needs to be postponed."
"America the country where guns have officially more rights than women.


What a shame."
"Thanks God!! This murdering act is finally ending. 
A win for life."
This title from the BBC is nothing more than a deceptive lie! You still have the right to murder your child in the US. What the judges merely stated is the same thing that Ruth B Ginsburg stated in her own writings and that was that the federal government has no right to dictate and that each state individually can vote on what is allowed and want isn't allowed. Read the blasted and complete decision written by the judges. BBC is full of crap!
"Once a fetus is formed, to terminate it is murder, except in immediate health cases. If women do not want to be pregnant there are condoms."
"What there saying is legal abortions are no longer available legally, but illegal abortions will be on the rise. No doubt this will lead to the death of the children as well as the possible death of the mother. Is there is no excuse, abortion should be legal with in the first 2 1/2 months. right now you have abortion group celebrating, yet they do not know the horror of what is to come with old style coat hanger abortions. It is sad that a 13-year-old girl raped by their father should be forced to carry a child and take away any possibilities of college or any advanced schools. I can honestly say that guy we see a rise in unexpected infant deathse because of this."
"Like I said in my video that I uploaded yesterday, we need new people in the government that weren’t born during world war 2 because obviously they still think we’re in the 60s and 70s 🤦🏾‍♂️"
"Abortion was form by KKK and to control black population. Per the liberals standard, whoever support abortion are racism"
The only choice women should have is if my sandwich they make is on either wheat or rye.
"Women are being treated like ZOO ANIMALS or CATTLE. It is certain that if this corrupt money making approach to banning abortion will cause the USA to suffer a raise of ramped poor mental health for the women who are forced to bare unwanted children and the children who will suffer the shame of being unwanted and or foster care and what come with it. This act on the part of the Supreme Court needs to be walked backed now before this mess get started. America is in shock as it is. We don’t need another mass issue like Roe vs Wade being overturned. If you look closer nothing really good came out of Donald Trumps administration. And,l if anyone is thinking about the IRS checks Trump allowed I am not for sure but believe the fine print for some if not all stated the money had to be paid back. Loopholes and fine print. Read it. Trust in government is out the door."
I predict a fracturing of the United States into two countries: 1 will be a neo-conservative country and 1 will be a social democracy
"There was NEVER a constitutional right to abortion in the US, and the SCOTUS decision only returns the question to the states where it should have always resided based on the 10th amendment."
"are the pro-lifers carrying guns? Religious fundamentalist fanatics are usually armed and willing to kill others.
France is in the process of making abortion a right in their constitution. 
France is a laic state and refuses the control of religious fundamentalism 
interfering with people's freedom of choice and human rights."
"Utter madness. Such a backwards decision. Bearing in mind this decision has been made in a country like the US, which is meant to be at the forefront of advancement, it’s just scary."
We truly are progressing backwards.
"This entire thing seems surreal. I am starting to wonder if ""States Rights"" went too far compared to having a consistent ""Law of the Land""?  Will different illegal abortion states make it a crime for a woman to leave their state and travel to another state to have an abortion? If some states can shorten the trimester time for abortion, can other states lengthen the trimester time?"
So the supreme court just announced it should no longer exist since it can't be expected to uphold half a century's worth of precedent and would like to side with religious fascists.
Women who want abortions make horrible decisions in their lives because they don't think before they acted 😂🤣😂🤣
"So ... if a woman is raped and pregnant,  she has to keep and raise the baby ? ? Whoever vote for this is extremely selfish and stupid. If you wanna be a mom, do it, don't force others have to. Anti-abortion, fk off."
"Speaking as a Short Man, I was disappointed by this ruling.  I want to make my wife get an abortion if it is a daughter. 

I don't want some shallow girl who only dates 6ft tall guys."
So much for 'Land of the Free' pffft
There is no excuse for abortion - it is women committing so-called legal murder. Here are some simple solutions to avoid pregnancy: 1) Keep your legs closed; 2) Use contraception; 3) Get married first and do things in the correct order. A man needs to be consulted before any abortion as it was his SEED used to create the baby. It is NOT a woman's right. Suck it up princesses and get off your feminist high horse
Portapotti Instagram models will now have to be careful that they don't get pregnant by a 12 year old boy or his 90 year old grandfather in Dubai. Take lots of contraceptives and don't forget to take them. Ha ha
"Let me get this right, you can’t terminate a foetus now but can gun down kids in a school? America is fcuked!"
"God is so happy with this ruling7:49👍👍👍 
Why would u murder that innocent unborn baby..😡"
Why don’t the BBC show us how the aborted baby looks after the abortion just so people have a good image in their minds of what Abortion actually does to the baby?
As a non religious person. I cannot understand how religious people accept 1000 year old beliefs and have it so engrained in their core.
What does the government gain from doing this? More kids in foster care? Satisfaction from a few people?
"I find ironic what the GOP christian conservatives did to undocumented children at the border and yet in the same breath say that the life of an undocumented unborn child is more important than abortion rights of a us citizen. Truth is, this is about religious fascism. We the people shouldn’t have to be forced to conform to christian idealism."
"I understand that most pro-lifers are christian. But, what I don't understand is how these same christians most likely never even considered fostering children...something they will have to answer to God on judgement day. The whole reason they're so adamant about abortion is because it makes them feel godly empowered. Y'all pro-choicers have to start guilt-tripping the christians into opening their homes to foster children...isn't there a verse that talks about how many will be thrown to hell for not doing things like feeding the homeless, taking care of the parent-less, etc?"
"It's none of my business as a Christian what unrighteous persons do.
It's unchristian to interfere with others."
"I agree with life first, but not by religious involvement in politics.
All religions involved will be destroyed soon, amen, you should believe that fact."
"Religious interference in politics did this unbiblical action.
Jesus commanded his true followers to, ""keep without spot from the world."" Not to get involved in it in any way."
"Amazing how every lefty has some extreme account to give in an effort to show that abortion is good for women. If every case was as the lefties say they are then surely the issue you need to address is abuse on women, but in your lefty mind the problem is solved by ruthlessly destroying the the one party involved who is the most innocent of all.  Joe Biden judgement day is coming, every doctor making a living of this - judgement day is coming.  To all you pro abortionists, you say you will never stop fighting, I want you to know that my brothers and I have the armour of God on and we will never stop fighting evil.  The battle belongs to the Lord and He said the righteous will inherit the land.  Come, bring your fight, God will have the glory and it will be in your faces continuously."
"Any monster that could cruely and violently serial kill their own children, has serious and extreme mental issues."
"Hmmmm,is it just me,or are the anti abortion women a bit ugly,and the pro women pretty? And I would love to know what the ugly woman meant when she said abortion has been reeking havoc on communities? Surly its unwanted children that are generally more problematic? Just my opinion, but surly only one person has the right to decide,the woman who is pregnant,not a bunch of protesters who have no idea of each individual circumstance!"
Baby killer
"Just wondering, isn't there a 3Month time period? I just generally want to know why would someone not get an abortion before that time if you don't want to have a baby? I might be wrong though"
"Americans seem to have some pretty warped ideals. On the one hand they've outlawed abortion, in thrall to those self righteous, holier than thou types who believe that the moment of conception means life and it's sanctity thereof. Even though it's not a sentient being and being no more than a collection of cells, would never be capable of existing outside the womb. Conversely - and some may say perversely - we have the thorny question of gun control. It seems the high and mighty can plead the so called 'barbarity' of abortion. But bringing in rigid gun controls is apparently impossible, and so every few weeks more and more innocent people will be going about their daily routine completely unaware that they're not going to see another day, because some individual found it way too easy to accumulate a raft of guns and ammo and had got a grievance. Americans really need to reassess their priorities."
"If these people believe so strongly that they don't want to get pregnant, why not get sterilised instead? That way they can sleep about as much as they won't and not need to ever have an abortion."
"wow, the US is going so backwards it's becoming 4th world country. it already has no decent healthcare or has one that kills it's people, and now this??? in 2022???
this is literally ""back to middle ages because the bible said so"". Disgusting!!!!!!
how can someone be so EVIL to want this much to take away basic choice from another?!?! you leave your life the way you want but to watch to take away this medical right from another? it's plain EVIL!!!!! and ignorant, backwards, primitive.. I have no words!!! 😰😰🤬🤬"
Those women in the rally wants to kill their own babies?
"right so lets kill kids since ther lives will b shit,,, christ u talk about a dead end job so many ppl frm around the world risk everythi ng to escape into america u rt out of touch daniel"
"I think it is extraordinary that it was legal to kill an innocent baby for the convenience of the mother.

The baby's body and soul belong to the baby.
The rights of the mother do not extend to it.

Banning abortion is a revolutionary decision.
I am very happy to see that no more helpless babies will be deprived of life.
I am very pleased.
God bless all babies!"
Society is Nutz! 2 weeks ago no one knew what defines a woman.

There’s going to be a lot of feral kids running around the streets in America in the coming years
Well abortion is always illegal in my country🤣
"I literally have a video from my local news of the Catholic Church telling the news in an interview that they have spent a lot of money and time on this and won’t stop until they achieve it….not all Christian people are bad by no means but this is why, at the least in America, Christianity is becoming more and more hated and why there are less and less Christians.
Our government is supposed to leave religious beliefs out of decisions because we are not just a Christian nation, we have freedom of religion. But yet everyone trying to pass this have been doing so based on THEIR religious beliefs. Have your Christian beliefs by all means, but don’t force everyone else to live by Christian rules regardless of their religion.
They will still happen as they did for thousands of years, you only cause more problems with this law. And the facts these don’t account for rapes and/or abusive relationships that the other person may not safely have an abortion within that window of time if at all, it’s absolutely absurd. I know if I was a woman and I was raped and became pregnant I will find whatever way possible to abort that child till the day of birth. Imagine having to live and look after a child from someone who did that to you, especially with features that person had, fuck that! That would be hell on earth right there, a very miserable time that doesn’t go away."
The baby is chopped up like a chicken. So happy with this ruling.
"Dear BBC.  There never was a ""constitutional right to abortion"" in the USA.  You can read the US Constitution all you want, but the word ""abortion"" is not there."
"Doesn't anybody realise that this is not just about abortion ?
This is about taking away the privacy of a woman !
It a woman is pregnant or not is nobody's business but the woman's herself !
Now if a woman wants to travel states in the US she will have to take a pregnancy test first !
This is outright crazy !"
"I haven't seen one good looking anti abortionist, so of course they don't care no one would dare to get them pregnant"
It's not the fact that the justices were pro-life it's the fact that the justices were upholding our constitution something the other three and liberal activists failed to ever do
First of all abortion is not outlawed it just goes back to the States and there will always be abortion in United States sorry to say. Your rhetoric is disgusting as our president or should I say our illegitimate president
What it means in practice is that individual states make their own mind up about it and the government let's them don't see a problem with that I do believe there are cases where abortion should be allowed but with strict time restrictions that's my opinion
"My body my choice,  except for masks.  Lol."
SCOTUS shot down a RULING not a right yesterday. Returning it to the states where it should have gone in ‘73! What Dems are pissed about is rulings from judges are no longer considered “ law”. Pass a law on abortion. No one ever voted on roe v wade. And abortion is NOT in the constitution! Oh no. . . Babies might live!!
The inmates are truly taking over the asylum.
"Religion won over Rights

Fatty girls whom nobody gives a lot are happy"
Even catholic Ireland is easing up on abortions in certain cases. What’s wrong with the US? They bemoan the likes China but I see no difference.
I am so happy it was overturned . Every child should have the right to live
I agree with libs on one thing . I believe they should not have kids either .
Looks like Margaret Atwood’s Gilead is not far away. I thought America was a free country
"Well that is perfect, go Americans. Get children nobody wants and then they can buy guns and kill other children. And the history showed how great it works when abortions are not allowed. So stupid."
"YOUR BODY, OUR CHOICE."
"You people that call evil good and good evil. Preserving the ultimate innocence, which is a pure unborn life should be the number one priority for every living female. Its an absolute shame and tragedy that it has to be the government that teaches  people a basic instinct such as this."
"If you believe in God and religion, that's YOUR business. Don't do an abortion. But don't force your beliefs on others."
"People need to understand there is a difference between having an abortion because it is ""inconvenient"" and having an abortion because the women will die ..."
"For all those that support abortion,  your parents should of had one."
"YOU take YOUR seat, instructions for Joey Biden,  alleged leader of the free world.  Lol."
50 years of a progressive Supreme Court has ended. I never thought I'd see this day! GOD BLESS AMERICA!
"Joe Biden is far from the tenet of Christianity...he is an anti-christ... Joe biden is a disgrace to Christianity and all of you who profess to be Christians but support the killing of children because of their size, location and dependence...God will judge and condemn you all to hell for these acts of violence against helpless babies. 

The blood of these babies will cry after you forever...except you repent and get right with God.

The Psalmist said it was God who joined his bones together IN HIS MOTHER'S WOMB! (Psalms 139:13-19)

Psalms 139:13-19
[13]For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother's womb.
[14]I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Your works, And my soul knows it very well.
[15]My frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth;
[16]Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Your book were all written The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them.
[17]How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How vast is the sum of them!
[18]If I should count them, they would outnumber the sand. When I awake, I am still with You.
[19]O that You would slay the wicked, O God; Depart from me, therefore, men of bloodshed.


Jeremiah 1:5
[5]""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, And before you were born I consecrated you; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations."""
"They'll just make it illegal without the finantial assistance to the mothers. Because in reality they don't care about the mothers, they just want their world view shoved down our throats."

"They fully well know having sex unprotected may cause pregnancy. Need a law now, to prosecute fathers who impregnate women and do not support their offsprings"
"Control , Power and Greed , Roe versus Wade and its impact upon Republicans and Democratic , Young women , Ted Cruz , Greg Abbott , Mitch McConnell , Christian evangelicals etc.."
Use condom no need for abortion
The blood of 60 million murdered American babies has been heard by the Holy Spirit.
Pro life in the womb but not in a classroom
UNBELIEVABLE WTF
As an American we no longer Can't say anything about human rights since what the Supreme Court did Stripping women's constitutional right  to privacy Write to her own body and so on And until we fix that.
"Having an abortion should not be a crime but a right because there can be a lot of variables  leading to it such as rape, incest or unwanted pregnancies due to lack of sexual education or it could be a financial burden if you are struggling to survive. There is also genetic malformation or in rare cases such as ectopic pregnancies death of the mother will take place if the pregnancy is not terminated. I don't believe is a decision that will ever be easy due to moral, emotional or religious beliefs but the choice should not be criminalized. Whether to do it or not should be a personal choice since it is the female individual that will have to carry and deliver the child and later on raise it or decide to have the infant go into an already overwhelmed and broken system."
I live in Georgia and I was adopted and I wish I’d never been born my parents were physically and mentally abusive mainly mentally we moved around so much I never got to leave roots anywhere and I am also physically disabled now being forced to live in a disability system that forces disabled people to live in poverty. I am the living proof that so-called pro life people are in fact not pro life they are only forced birth because if they were truly pro-life they would’ve liked politicians to take things like foster care adoption disability and other social services extremely seriously and would fund them with whatever they needed and with whatever they could instead they routinely elect politicians primarily Republicans who routinely try to restrict these programs and rights on a regular basis Lindsey Graham most recently and famously came out in an interview admitting such at least if someone claims to be pro life and yet is a Democrat I can somewhat believe them to disagree with them because at least they actually support all the policies that actually make life worth living for millions of people.
when is rishi sunak going to repay that 6 trillion debt is my question ?
"What a crazy shit show of a country America is becoming,it is like a reality series for the world to watch"
Bruh no one gonna talk about the Furry lmao
"There is morning after pill  you can take up too 3 or 7 days after, not to get pregnant. I'm not happy with abortion after 12 weeks and 18 - 24 weeks, to late it's a  baby. 👶"
This is so sick!!! I feel so sorry for the people affected.
let them protesters rally on these scutos residence daily !!! DISRUPT their priveleged status
Proof that the US is a country full of who.res who can't keep their legs shut
Everyone in the comments like 'its scary we don't get to kill babies anymore'
"Abortion is never an easy choice but sometimes it can save life.. Brave women, stay strong in fighting for your rights.. 

EDIT: I got a lot of hate from people who say FOSTER CARE is good answer. 
- There are 400 000 children in foster care, 26 000 age out each year and are instantly homeless 
- Most who age out have disability
- Children in foster care sre 4x more likely to get SAed 
- More than half of child sex trafficking victims recovered were from foster care/group homes 
- 40% of foster care kids reported abuse or neglect.

Do you still think foster care is better? Do you want more babies put in that hell becouse of new system?"

"Not cute for semi-fascist BBC to give so much preference to ""pro lifers."""
"The ""unborn"" has ""right-to-life"" at the ""point--of-conception"".  Said Rep. Kevin McCarthy, aspiring 'Speaker-of-the-House' in-waiting.

Justice Thomas of the Supremes wrote the opinion to fulfill that belief by overturning a previous ruling over forty-years old, in an unprecedented legal retrogression,
to give 'States-Rights' primacy over matters of whether a woman's right to self-determination regarding her pregnancy is ""trumped"" by a zygote's ""legal-right"".

The ruling is riddled with self-contradiction.  The premise is ""Life begins at the point-of-conception"".

Those same ideological corners in states ruled by such sweeping fundamentalism, are the same entities which often deny the 'right-to-life'  to those already born.

This Concept-of-'Life' is rudely terminated at birth.  

It denies the mother that right, even if continued pregnancy carries the risk of harm to her survival (or even to the fetus if carried to term while undergoing, say chemotherapy).  Such decisions of life and death are best left to the patient and her medical provider.  Decisions of health, made on evidence-based science.  NOT on EXTREME IDEOLOGY.

Another glaring contradiction is this concept of 'Right-to-Life' is denied at the gates-of-the-penitentiary, to those on DEATH-ROW.

It is even denied at the gates-of-Elementary-School, to little children (the 'Already-Born'), barely growing out of the baby-fat gained at birth.   Their 'Right-to-Life' is trumped by the ""Right-to-Bear-Arms"".


Why stop there?  Actually, we don't.  Those ideologues are the same ones who think nothing of supporting Neo-Liberal foreign-policy, which insist on bellicose adventures, by shipping overseas $50 Billion-Dollars worth of weaponry, to fight a PROXY-WAR-OF-CHOICE.   Weapons, some of which ------------------------->>

. . . end up in the hands of MASS-SHOOTERS, who had LEGALLY PURCHASED, such high-powered WEAPONS-OF-WAR to deny the 'Right-to-Life' for little-children ALREADY-BORN."
"🌟 Abortion Stats 🌟
From the abort73 and Guttmacher Institute  websites that are dedicated to women's right to abortions..

🌟 Ages of Women getting abortions.
young girls - 19 = 8.7%
20-39 = 87%
+40 = 3.7%
🤔 The narrative of young women making mistakes is used to cover up grown women who are using poor 🐈 management and getting pregnant.

🌟 Reasons they got abortions 
Sexual assaults and health problems accounted for less than 4%.
4% Interfere with education 
7% Not mature to be a parent 
8% Don't want to be a single mom
19% Done with having kids
23% Can't afford a baby 
25% Not ready 
6% Other
🤔 So... the narrative of victimhood and health risks are BS to cover up that grown women have unprotected sex. They don't want to be inconvenienced by a child. They need American tax dollars to bail them out.

🤣 I'm cool with that if the Father's have the right to financially option out of parenthood. Women forced fatherhood on millions of men. If women can delete a baby then Father's should be able to peacefully walk away. That some equality I can vote for."
religion is crippling America..
What are your british laws on abortion???
"Telling it the way it is. Like it or not, I don't care!

Here's what my position on Abortion was. I didn't care! I've always thought a woman should have the right to have a child or not. Her body her choice and all that.

But then something changed. I heard about a case out of Mississippi that was trying to put limits on when an abortion could take place. Not if, only when! They didn't want to ban abortion, in fact at the time federal law wouldn't have allowed them to do that. They just wanted to have a say on at what point it's a person that needs protections. Well the abortionists didn't want any restrictions on when an abortion could occur and that is where they Fucked up! Because most americans aren't willing to go that far! 

In my naive beliefs on abortion I thought it was something that was being done when it was just a blob of cells in a petri dish, something that didn't even resemble a human, especially not a little human being that could even feel pain, a person! 

So once I found out that was the case I decided to investigate further. And I found out there are people and states that have no problem with aborting all the way up to full term babies and that's a bridge too far in most Americans opinions. So yes now it will be an each individual state decision. Most people don't want to live under California or New York laws, that's why they don't live there.

I predict the next big Supreme Court fight will be, when does that baby have constitutionally protected rights like ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" At what point is He or She a human being deserving of mercy and a chance to live their life! At what point does the unborn baby become the injured party and not the mother! These are all questions that will need to be answered in the highest court in the land! This time around they will have a whole lot of science to help figure that question out, unlike the 1970s!

Just sayin..."
"Nowhere in our Constitution is the word abortion or any deritive of it mentioned, so they did not lose any rights. Your whole lead in is a lie!"
"Joe Biden correct in 2006 ""I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy, and I think that it should be rare and safe, and I think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions. And there ought to be able to have a common ground and consensus as to do that,"""
"As Indian, we are deeply concerned about human rights conditions in US"
"Abortions are still going to be performed. The states will decide for themselves what they want. For me, life begins when new DNA is formed. That is, when the sperm fertilizes the egg. I am grateful for the outcome and the blessings that will follow this decision."
W AMERICA!
About time 😊
America OMEGALUL
Bunch of idiots.
Americans are mad. How can killing the unborn baby even be something to debate over .
"Oppose the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on abortion rights.
The Court on June 24, 2022 ended the right to abortion in a seismic ruling that shreds half a century of constitutional protection. In a significant curtailment of women’s rights, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, a 1973 landmark decision giving women in America the right to have an abortion before the foetus is viable outside the womb — before the 24-28 week mark. 

The ruling sent shock waves sparking protests. Abortion rights — which have been available to women for over two generations — will now be determined by individual States.

Also overturned on Friday, was Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 case that upheld Roe .The Conservative Justices are picks of Donald Trump who had said he would appoint justices who are “pro life” (opposing abortions).

“ With sorrow — for this court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have lost a fundamental constitutional protection — we dissent,” wrote liberal justices adding that the decision “breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law”.

“In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the court’s legitimacy,” liberal Justices wrote.

We the Rights activists are concerned that there could be a domino effect on these other rights.

U.S women have lost the fundamental right to make informed decisions about their own bodies.

Before Roe was made law of the land there was a time when women risked losing their lives getting illegal abortions. A time when government denied women control over their reproductive functions, forced them to move forward with pregnancies they didn't want, and then abandoned them once their babies were born.

This horrifying decision will have devastating consequences, and it must be a wake -up call, especially to the young people who will bear its burden.

The court has a strong conservative bent, which is based on a 6-3 majority, was evident this week. Friday’s decision comes a day after the Supreme Court rolled back restrictions in New York State on who may carry concealed guns in public.

""The decision is a tragic error and a sad day for the court and the country.The court has done what it has never done before, expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans. Roe had protected a woman’s right to choose, her right to make intensely personal decisions with her doctor, free from the interference of politics” said Democratic U.S President Joe Biden.

All are requested to oppose and react peacefully on the rulings on abortion rights and gun culture. The right to privacy, liberty, equality, personal freedoms should be protected."
I’m pro life and against abortion. It’s inhumane and murder. The fetus feels pain when the act of abortion is conducted cause nerves are one of the first things our bodies form. It’s a mystery whether the fetus feels pain before or after 13 weeks but it’s not responsible to take chances based on curiosity

Good news.
America is breaking apart. American have gradually become immoral society with deeply imbibed sex/gun/drug culture. Social and even family fabric had broken long ago. Worst is yet to come and that is civil war based on religous ethnicity.
"In the UK there are 200,000 abortions every year. To put that in perspective in the six years of WWII 250,000 British and Empire troops lost their lives."

"No doctor, your termination of each innocent life is the greatest crime against humanity. All these women should receive help and support throughout their pregnancy."
"Its a cycle the gov depends on, and the right is being used like puppets to push that agenda. The gov depend on uneducated low class humans to fill the prisons and the foster system is the main supplier. Yay pro-life. Way to take rights away from women, why not look into the actual problem? Males can run around impregnating as many females he can get into, so its time to start snipping the problem."
american pro-choice lawyers! gather in groups! produce ideas how to cancel or bypass this at any level!!!
"The right to privacy in reproductive services is what Roe was ultimately decided on.  There's nothing in our Constitution about women or reproductive rights. Religious organizations fought Roe because for many, their annual budget relied on adoption fees.  Newborns are in the highest demand. For centuries churches sought unwed pregnant women to gain access to newborn to sell or adopt for a fee.  The only care about children from gestation to delivery, that's because they want newborns to fuel their religious organizations."
its all one big satanic mess
Feminist want abortion because she want funny sex....
Abortion is murder and abortion is illegal...
"Abortion is woman's right. Okay, you have your right. 

What about the baby inside your womb? Did he/she  told you to abort him/her? Baby should have right too right? 

You see, this abortion thing is easy to be settle. It comes with your decision at first. Why you go and have sex at the first place? What is the reason? There you have it. That's the jackpot and legitimate question. Why you had sex at the first place? For fun? For what?  

Now, I know some of these women are a victim of crime such as raped victim, or poor living condition that lead to early sex. What else, brother and sister doing sex (do stupid things) and so forth. I understand about all of this victims situation and for this reason as well, I don't encourage them to have an abortion at the first place. No. Absolutely not. Go to the doctor's or report your case to the nearest Police Station for next action taken. 

As for parents, they have the responsibility to teach their children from an early age about sex and what is right about it and what is wrong. 

The Churches and other religious believe need to teach their believers the right and wrong about Abortion and Having Sex. 

For the LAW, increase the  punishment for those who raped, so that people know that raped is a very serious crime and can lead to heavier punishment by law. 

Lastly, Sex is a gift from God and we should use it in the right way. The same thing with baby. It is the gift from God. God is the only one who have the absolute right whether to take life or not. 

For female, you could learned martial arts too, you know, to protect yourself. You never know what will happened to you when you walk by yourself at night. Carry weapon too. Just for protection."
Abortion is illegal.... Abortion is only for critical condition
Today I'm very happy..... America become vergin by this law....good job USA
"Abortion is not right....
Killing baby is not right..... Abortion is only for saving mother life in critical condition...."
America is on the way of becoming great again..

"The latin word for  medicine? ""Medicina"" It means the Art of healing or means of healing from medicines, relating to healing, from medeor or medicor to heal or cure. All actions of the medical profession belong in the arena of healing and prevention of disease or illness from natural or unnatural causes. Abortion is not medical treatment to preserve life or to prevent it's decline. Therefor it cannot be place in any category of medical treatment. It has nothing to do with a denial of a persons rights. No one has the right to demand through law a person to take take an action against them that is causing harm and the killing of living cells and life form within the body of a person. Harming the women and the women in agreement to harming a living life is the real criminal act here. The courts have no right to redefine medical treatment as a right to not save life, but to destroy it. A Women may think and feel anything she wishes, but she cannot force others to agree with her and demand them to pay for destructive actions against her and the unborn. There is a distinct difference between medicine preserving life and curing people from disease then using the platform of medicine to destroy."
Stick a coat hanger up your snatch. Don't give up. 😂
"pro lifers can lie all they want they only care about their agenda-pro birth not pro life being pro life will harm more women who will still seek out abortion regardless

let life occur naturally-life should not be forced and forced life will sow you plenty of bad karma. One human absolutely should NOT have a say how another lives their life"
How about “Right to life upheld by Supreme Court” BBC?
Abortion over 22 weeks is murder!
"The decision by the Supreme Court was done to correct the actual original decision done by the court regarding the issue under debate (abortion). It is the original ""decision"" made by the court that was incorrect and unconstitutional.  The ruling that has now been CORRECTED has no effect on the issue of abortion itself.  The issue could have been about anything, not just Abortion.   The decision has now been CORRECTED and allows for all voices of the people to be heard on the issue under debate (abortion)  as opposed to only one side, which is what happened as a result of the original incorrect decision made by the court."
"To the American women, girls, non-binaries and people with uterus, I am extremely sorry to see this become future for you. Stay strong in these dark times."

Abortion is not a constitutional issue!
"Maybe now instead of teaching children about gender and pronouns in school, they will teach them that life is precious and that there is birth control.  So if they can tell young children to take puberty blockers, they can get young girls sterilettes or free birth control pills and teach boys about wearing condoms and responsibility towards their partners."
"It's a states rights issue.  The great thing about America is that if you don't like how a state is run, you can move. Whereas the British government constantly shits on their citizens rights and doesn't give a fuck because you can't do anything about it."
"Those anti-abortionists are basically trying to bring more people into this overpopulated, overpolluted and resource-scarce world that was plagued by Covid-19 and lockdowns, war, terrorism , and having extremely harsh natural disasters brought on by global warming and climate change. It's like we don't have enough people to see how ridiculously depressing this world is."
I know my comment maybe a bit harsh But this may deter Young women of the younger generation to think long and hard about pregnancy and that they can't just throw away an Unborn life if they have second thoughts SO people need to stop whinging and start thinking that's what the grey matter is the for
The world continues to laugh at us
"How to piss off a lib shyt:
Keep your baby. 
Own a few guns. 
Stand for the flag.

That really triggers them! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"

"Where is america going 
Does Americans want to show how  conservative they are"
"Jus mentioning, this ruling doesnt make abortiom illegal, it just gives the power of this descision back to individual states and legislatures. The SC descision just said that abortion isnt a constitutional right. Now its up to the people in the states to elect those who will pass legislate that they want."
That is one of the most brutal decisions to aid abortion and this rubbish country will talk about human rights with there rubbish women
Wow...its amazing to watch a country experiencing a slow burn demise. Just another nail in America's coffin. Anti-democractic minority rule will see America go up in flames 🇺🇸💩💥
"The Unborn Are Fully Human

The most significant debate is about when life begins. Is the unborn child fully human or tissue? It cannot be both. When does human existence begin? Science says that at nineteen days, a heart starts to beat, and at forty days, the heart output is almost twenty percent of an adult.

In God’s eyes, an unborn child is entirely a human being. Scripture also contends life begins before birth and refers to the unborn and born interchangeably. One is as fully human as the other. For example, God reassures Jeremiah, the prophet, of his importance by showing him he was known before he was born. “God knew him as fully human before his birth. Before I formed you in the womb I knew you before you were born, I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations” (Jeremiah 1:5).

King David wrote about how God knew him fully before he was born. “For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb ...Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be” (Psalm 139:13, 16).

When Luke writes about Elizabeth and Mary greeting each other, he speaks of the unborn John the Baptist as a baby. “When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit” (Luke 1:41).

To end life through abortion divides life into the unborn and born, and we learn through Scripture this opposes God’s view of both being equally human."
"A lot of unwanted children are going to be fucked up! Good job. 

America is such a shitshow!

Luckily you can just punch a pregnant woman in the stomach and get rid of it that way👍🏻"
"Wtf is this. Abortions nowadays becamr like going to have a tea. You need to educate your children!! This is not a way of protection! There are some cases where it is  needed but to have abortion just because you don't care, it is stupid."
"NO. No ""Right to Abortion"" was struck down. The Federal Government via the court has handed the right to access this medical procedure back to the individual States. The Federal Government can no longer force individual States to perform abortion procedures. In any State were abortion is legal...  then abortion is still legal. Only in States that have outlawed abortion as of the time of this ruling, is it now illegal. The BBC can't even do Journalism."
The right to an abortion was not struck down. It’s easier to get an abortion in the US than UK
"Wonderful day 
God is 
Great"
"Abortion is murder and all of you supporting it are forgetting that that’s an innocent child. There is no difference between a child in the womb and outside the womb. Saying that they’re going to have a hard life means you are saying people who are poor and endure adversity have less valuable lives and would be better off not existing. If you don’t want to have a baby then be more careful or don’t have sex. If a life gets created, it’s no longer your choice and you don’t get to kill a child because it’s inconvenient to you"
Cope harder
"Abortion is murder yet a necessary evil.
It is primarily liberals who get abortions It goes with the mentality. Abortion keeps democrats from breeding more democrats and that's a good thing.
20 million black babies aborted 
30 million white liberal babies aborted That's 50 million fewer democrat voters Praise Jesus."
The power of the SC!
Another proof of USA not being a democracy.
"I've never felt so fortunate for not being an American seriously...I'm so scared for the women who are going through this, witnessing their rights being snatched away from them. Stay strong."
Stop GBV now
"That’s cruelty , don’t kill what you can’t create , it’s by divinity that a child is formed …."
America is now NOT the land of the free.  It has turned into a Fascist state for 22 states.
Nobody has the right to tell another person what to do with their own body when it doesn't affect them personally. Full stop.
Arguments for justification give  me the right to take any action.
"My mother got pregnant years ago despite her IUD. It caused a very complicated pregnancy that put her life on jeopardy and she had to have an abortion to save her life. 

My childhood friend‘s dad left. Her mom got interned into a psych ward soon after. She worked like a beast to get the best grades and crumbled when she discovered that she got pregnant. She could barely afford rent with the help of her boyfriend and had no family to help. I can’t even fathom what kind of life she’d have if she didn’t have an abortion.  

I’ve been severely depressed and anxious for as long as I can remember. At times, I couldn’t even function normally without meds. I do my best but I’m still very mentally unstable. If I ever got pregnant and was forced to give birth, it would be a disaster. With the emotional and physical turmoil that comes with pregnancy, it would be a miracle if I make it to the delivery without attempting to end my life."
The Biden Presidency has been a complete and utter abortion.
50 years of western moral decay
Stop talking about died woman . Let's talk how many children had been killed by abortion - billions.
"Demons, demonic World Orders, UN, WEF, WHO, Govts, Mainstream Media, all are built & run by the biggest liars hypocrites fakes evils psychopaths inhumans. All have sacrificed their souls for Satan and satanism. They can do anything against humanity. Only the most ignorant people believe in such kind of demons..."

Psychopathic politicians & governments destroy Freedom & Humanity
Psychopathic doctors destroy Health
Psychopathic lawyers & the judiciary destroy Justice
Psychopathic education systems & universities destroy Knowledge
Psychopathic scientists destroy Truth 
Psychopathic press & media destroy Information 
Psychopathic religious leaders destroy Divine Scripture & Guidances 
Psychopathic inhumans destroy beliefs in GOD & Grace but they believe in devil & evil 
Psychopathic businesses destroy human Services
Psychopathic banking systems destroy Economy..."
"Thank's God in USA will be no more abortion , no more killing."
Nobody has a right to kill children.
Trump said god made this anti abortion decision. If true then Trump is saying god took 50 years to make a correct decision. LoL.
Its the abuse to abortion that should be checked
Cool so a bunch of privileged white ****** get to choose how We live and what We get to do with our bodies. These woman should be ashamed and taken out. Rape victims now have to live with the spawn of their attacker and that spawn has to live unloved. Wow what a great win American f you too
God bless America and now your population will grow fast
A good move to respect life for the unborn.
"Abortion is not a constitutional, right if you think that then you have never read the constitution."
I studied the constitution...no right to abortion...women can still get an abortion..its a state thing..you are passing propaganda like you are in China....good we are smart enough to understand shame on you
Rationality prevails!
"God is in control  of His people. No more abortion! No more and no more.  My ex told me to abort my last boy, I refused,  my boy now is 6 years old boy going to year 2 school class. Women sex is not a fun, sex is responsibility and sacred and when it come to abortion  it is life destroyer!. If it come from rape or sickness ask God to give you grace to carry it. You will not believe  what child would be and might be a glorious child that give you that joy  you will never expected. Stay save women."
"Now you know why every President will stack the SCOTUS with judges of their choice !
Hahahahahahahahaha"
"And it has nothing to do with the fact that the majority of the SCOTUS are conservatives !
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
US gives too much power to those unelected judges !"
"US will get dumber even more as more children with 47 chromosomes are born !
More marriages will be wrecked as a result !"
"The SCOTUS ruling striking down _Roe v. Wade_ simply causes this scenario to revert to what it was prior to January, 1973. I remember in those days, if a woman lived in a state that didn't allow abortions, she simply went to another state where it was legal, and had the medical procedure done there. Again, this procedure *is not* banned in all 50 states as the result of this SCOTUS opinion."
"Why does abortion exist. So many reasons to have one, but what about thinking about not getting into that situation in the first place. Why not try to not get pregnant. That goes for men and women. There is always a medical exception and should be allowed. But also I think it's time for men to prtest that it is not fair that they have no say , especially if they want to give up their rights and financial obligation. When a women decides to not get an abortion, when the father wants her to have one, He is forced into child support. In the times we live in, where is the equality."
"It doesn't matter just go to California or the blue states for abortion if the red states ban it.
And trust me most of us men don't want to be father as we will only get divorce raped by alimony and child support.

So in a nutshell all this facade is to just hide the inflation caused by the government"

"This will lead to more suicides, more women trapped in violent relationships and more deaths from backyard coat-hanger abortions."
amazing news
This is why you never let Christians into government. Archaic thinking. Christians are clueless.
We really screwed the pooch on this one Dead liberals are good liberals.
I care for the unborn baby. I'm a pro-life
Abortion is outlawed because capitalism needs more future consumers and tax payers
A 6:3 vote?? Wtf why is it a bunch of saggy white supremacist men that get to decide instead of the public?!
"Arkansas says your dad might be the father of your baby,  or Billy Bob next door raped you , but your having the baby regardless ! 😉  

Wow , don't think that's  gonna work out too well , with women not reporting the rape and hoping the bus to a jurisdiction that allows  the procedure."
you’re 21 and terrified abt abortions being illegal but not thinking abt the fact you are anticipating abortions due to your negligence? you stupid f**k
This is very good news for live.
Glad to see these child murderers mad and upset lol
"watch how abortion is done: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6SMxKVD4fQ killing a baby is not a ""constitutional right"" genocides."
It's their rights to access the abortion
"let's be honest how many little angels are getting killed from abortion or brought to this hell without capable parents. 

1) drunk women/men not thinking consequences.

2) idiotic 17-25  years old people who don't really care  about anything and just do their
 thing.

3) women who may keep the child for  for taking money from their partner.

ofc rapes , healthy couples that got an accident etc are excluded.

I am not against this new law but I don't support it too."
I must say that ANY woman who voted for Trump had this coming!
"At one time, abortions were also banned in the USSR. This only led to an increase in criminal abortions, from which women's health suffered."
Yea these supreme court justices just bite off way more than they can chew. you know in 48 hours all 6 had their addressees dox all over the internet everyone hates them.  I am just going sit back and watch them learn a hard lesson  what happens when you are dishonest liars. you told us roe was decide law in your confirmation hearings? you think you can lie to the American people and get away with it ? good luck clowns
I hope everyone pro life and fighting the abortion rights plans on adopting as many kids as they can!
"NO WHERE... in the U.S. constitution is there a ""RIGHT""... to an abortion. Period! NO WHERE! Try reading it and maybe... you'll gain some knowledge."
Maybe there will be alot of adoptions going forward.
Everyone hates that law but I think no one should to allowed to kill another human just because they're uncomfortable with them if that was the case every maths teacher that I ever come across would be dead and my life would be really easy
"Don't worry lefty females.  You will still be able to kill your unborn baby.  Just wondering...when you do that...do you hold a kill party?  Do all of your lefty friends come and rejoice with you...like self appointed hero's?  By the way, just wondering again...do you support animal cruelty or are you against it because it so horrible to harm those poor creations of God?   Please let me know.  I would really like to understand what seems to be so very un-understandable.  Bet you won't.  Hope you do."
"I am one of the millions who are delighted that the Supreme Court of the United States of America overturned Roe v. Wade.  Now, those lefty women will need to dig into their own wallet to remove a baby from their lefty wombs.  When I hear them snivel about it...it makes me think about what they are mad about...and come to the conclusion...even they don't know...or why.  Thank you President Trump for your part in this...naming three conservatives to the Supreme Court of the United States of America!"
"They want to protect a fetus from an abortion, but won't go as far to protect a child in school from getting gunned down."
America is gone.
This isn’t pro-life  this is pro-birth.
DON'T KILL BABIES . . . SIMPLE
Republicans will keep pushing toward their version of Sharia law. . Unless they are voted out of office in large numbers. Good people will vote as often as possible to get these GOP Handmaid Tale masters out of office.
Ahh yes sexist homophobic racist and most of them having SA allegations should determine the rights of woman’s body.
"Yay, people's beliefs get to control a major medical procedure for women and young girls. Hooray. (giving birth is a major medical procedure and no one can do it for her.)"
Republicans liked a Handmaids Tale so much they are doing their best to make it a reality in America.
"I dont have a dog in this fight, and therefore no real opinion in either direction

But to me this definitely sounds like a decision that only creates more issues than they think they are solving"
"Now i like trump, and will unfollow the obamas"
finally this law thanks God
"I'm 21 andi'm terrfied, don't be instead, educate yourself to safe sex."
"About time.  And, by the way, abortion isn't mentioned in the US Constitution.  That is why it was overturned."
God lbess all pro life warrioirs
Now killing babies is called the procedure.  I wonder if the Nazie called their procedure.
"Abortion is NEITHER a right nor healthcare.  It's murder.  It states clearly, ""The right TO LIFE, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""  No mention of abortion.  Sorry, nice try.  And since when is murder considered ""healthcare""?  That's right.  NEVER.  I've pondered many medical journals and laws, scrubbed the internet up one side and down the other.  NO mention of murder being healthcare.....  What I have, in fact, found is murder is illegal and healthcare is to preserve life."
Abortion ban? What about the human rights? USA is the self appointed contractor of world human rights.        …doing injustice with their own people regarding the abortion ban.  See their hypocrisy.
"In 1973 seven white male judges took it upon themselves to force their view of a highly divisive political issue on the entire nation.  

Today, 4 white males, a black male and a white women FINALLY overturned the 1973 decision and allowed this contested issue to be legislated DEMOCRATICALLY and ultimately BY THE PEOPLE.

No matter what side you're on it is a great day for America, for our constitution and for our democratic republic.  A great day for women, the unborn and human rights."
"For my British/European friends who are being duped into believing that this is ""A step backwards,"" by the fear pornographers (the media). All this ruling does is return the issue to the states. It's what we call Federalism. Abortion is no longer in the federal purview where it didn't belong in the first place.

You may be surprised to learn that some states, like California or New York , will probably make abortions even easier to get then during Roe.

This is all the Left's fault BTW.  As part of their asinine Woke Revolution, they tried to make any abortion for any reason, early trimester, late term, the day before birth, legal. And... they demanded that those abortions be taxpayer funded. It's all related to their idiotic premise that gender is oppressive and women, er... excuse me ""Birthing people,"" are being oppressed by this tyrannical ""Fetus"" that they don't want freeloading inside of them and making them be RESPONSIBLE.  Oh! the humanity!

And right on cue, enter Donald Trump..."
This is great news for wire coat hanger companies.
They do realise there’s a thing called birth control yeh?
"As trump inadvertently has one by one
Taken our “FREEDOMs”
Away.

little boys and girls walk to their new day gas chambers called schools.
Do safety drills that are ineffective,in class rooms which become make shift slaughter houses.

We can’t abort, knowing his mum should have. 
Next  condoms
Then metal coat hangers.

No wall needed here…
The US is involved in a civil war, we the people vs American homegrown terrorists.  trump has served his purpose and shown the whole world what GREED FEAR AND HATE can accomplish.

Merica at present 
Not so FREE
Not so great"
"US one of the Country where they have Sex the most.. That’s why that matters so much. Folks just wear condoms duuuh 🤦🏽‍♂️ You need to grow up and take responsibilities be accountable for your stupid decision when copulating… 
Though can’t avoid to say that this has also a huge positive impact to the USA economy in the next decades to come. To maintain the country you need youngs paying elders pension… importing young people from abroad it’s not a good deal. Indeed, when applying for a work visa if you see statistics the majority are over 40 with a family they’ll work in US and go back to their country. Work Visa only for seniors with lot of experience cos gov don’t want to spend money training them. So you need young work force that the gov don’t want to bring from abroad so you gotta do the work and toss out children. 
Hope that the law has some kind of twist for women raped. 

Go USA 🇺🇸😂💪🏽"
"There should be grief counseling for people thinking about killing their child. They should also be told what actually happens to the baby. and how corporations profit from the little body. If women die from abortion, then they die, are they not committing murder on the innocent, our future. These pro abortion people should have been aborted"
And yet thinking before having sex with everyone is a solution not an abortion.
they are angry because pookie got regulated
It's the beginning of a wonderful era of finding newborn babies in the dumpsters .
Okay I don't care about either of these topics but dang it I will have to voice my opinion if I get asked which I will be judged for it then all the marches and protest will cause problems. I mean we already dealing with transgenders in sports causing problems and also this very long gender lgbtq too long to name can't we just stick to one problem then start another on
"To be fair, there aren't many women in these videos with any chance of finding a man that would get them pregnant.  Abortion isn't a worry they really have."
It is a great news! God bless America!
"Jesus is the only way into Heaven. Ask Him into your life, cleanse you from ALL unrighteousness. Make Him your Lord & your Savior. One day YOU will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Amen."
"So this means if a woman gets raped and gets pregnant, they have to have the child? How the fuck is anyone suppose to cope with that. What a stupid system."
"Stop having sex with men.  Even better, no marriage, no children, no dating.  Learn from the South Korean women's 4B (now 6B4T) movement.  SK decriminalized abortion in 2021 after a nearly 70-year ban"
Thank God!! 😊
"Abortion is the killing of a living human. I get tired of white people complaining about stopping abortion. So black women seek abortion 5 times that of white women. So if you think of that, maybe they are racist and upset that now there will be more babies born that aren't white.."
🚨🚨HOES MAD 🚨🚨
Millions of baby killing murders just got pissed off. one would expect violence to follow. stay safe yall
"This is coming from the same group that refuses: paid parental leave, universal single payer healthcare, living wages, affordable childcare, universal pre K, affordable quality education and higher education, affordable secure housing, etc.

They want a vulnerable and desperate labor force! They want more people to work dead end jobs with poverty wages and no benefits because they're desperate!"
"Take all of that marching and protesting energy to the polls this fall , And vote all of those Right Wing Slugs out of power, This is what you get when you vote for Those with an R beside their name"
"The judicial branch within the US should be independent (neither Republican nor Democrat).  The laws should not be based upon political agenda.  I truly want to see more gun control, but it’s hopeless because the majority of the Supreme Court judges are Republicans."
It's about time the u.s. makes these like sleezeballs accountable for their responsibilities!!!!!!!!! Hopefully they'll abort themselves now!!!!!!
"At least they're not taking away your guns though, right? America, the land of the free.

Sure looks that way."

"Stay out of sex holes... 
These people now know what  ""Women or Woman"" is?  Nonsense  people!  Wokeness  Wokeness. No difference between  a man and woman... A man can become a woman, a woman can become a man. Sick lunatics"
Bearing arms is a ‘right’ … killing babies isn’t in the constitution.
"Finally these babies have rights, thank you Jesus , We have to many contaceptions today to accidentally get pregnant , if you are in any situation and their is a chance you can get pregnant you should set up an appointment as soon as possible to get protection they have the 5 years plan, these streets have been running over with the Blood of the innocence, this quick fix have cause more harm then anything , i am pro life And also the same women that get pregnant call it a mistake and keep doing what us Women i am talking about Real ones need to be more Responsible and take precaution this 2022 and we still saying we made a Mistake, SAD."
"The U.S is a nation in conflict with itself lacking direction and purpose and most of its decisions are frictional and transactional. It cannot, control its gun violence, women's rights have been setback decades and decades. Its governments is either in inertia or moving towards the religious right, guided by the Supreme Court that is out of touch. In foreign affairs it is either starting wars for the benefit of its economy or failing to stop wars for the benefit of is economy. If Caligula and the Spanish Inquisition had a  child it would be the United Stated of America as it is to day. Perverted,  gluttonous and sanctimoniously pimping a moral righteous that has nothing to do with and for the good will of its own people."
It seems that conservartives think all the children got to live for being shooted in the schools!

Ho es mad. Keep coping
"I read that Child Protective Services has real problems and need to be overhauled and revamped so these poor children can really be cared for and possibly adopted into ""loving"" homes. I'm sure there are some good people; but there is a lot of corruption at the top that is failing the children and just lining their own pockets"
Did anyone ask  God if He's   in favour   of mothers having  even  more  o[f a burden placed  upon them?
"Since when does one in three Americans represents ""the people""? Right-wing math is always screwed-up."
Jesus Christ.. SOOOO many petulant bums out there protesting. Most of these pro choice demonstrators are probably milking their retired parents dry for cash.
"God is great, we the (normal) people will win this war. Good job judges!"
Wow. This is kinda disturbing. 😤 Who let all these women outta the kitchen?! 🤨
I LOVE LISTENING TO ALL THE FEMINAZI BABY KILLERS GO REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
millions   of  children  born    who  will  care   for   the  children whose  mothers are unable   to care for   them...   a lack of  money a lack of maturity    What of the  children born  as a result of rape?   r  Stupid  Stupid  selfish men  no where near  when they have  to pay child support!!!!
"I have a good idea, how about all men, especially those who are most opinionated get vasectomies at birth, so then when couples are ready for children, they get it reversed. Wouldn't this vastly reduce the need for abortions?"
"It would be interesting if people, even the very poor and destitute, make a mass exodus outside of these states if they fear that they may need these services at any moment, and that the population demographics shift, but I think what will happen instead are that people will just not get as many abortions in those places, won't drive out of state, and will just carry the pregnancies to term or will find ways to stop the pregnancies which are illegal in those areas. I might have preferred that people leave states and no longer pay taxes in states where they feel the government is not representing them properly, or otherwise, if they wish, stay there and wage political campaigns to get those states to make things legal that they want to be legal, but the problem is, it appears the majority in some places may actually not be like them or on their side, so it would be hard to convince a new group of people to be the majority, to move in a bunch of people who will become the majority otherwise, and it seems much more easy to just leave, even if one has to hitchhike out of a place, and start a new life elsewhere.

I might also not mind if a lot of people decide to leave America altogether, maybe not directly regarding this issue, but just in general, seeing as how unstable it has seemed to become, how polarized, how crime-filled and dangerous it seems to be, it just might not be worth living there anymore, except in very out of the way places without much action or social interaction. It is extremely difficult for people to leave the country though since other countries don't typically allow such a thing, but people should definitely try, even if it takes measures such as marrying people in other countries or whatever is necessary, even illegally entering those countries potentially, if it is a decision between living in poverty in some crime filled place or getting out and being free from America and the scary state it is currently in (for the last decade basically, and really since Bush Jr.)."
So we banning abortion but our way of helping our children is still in the shitter? How is banning abortion gonna help at all?
"In America, these rules only apply to poor people.  Because .... freedom."
"Be pro life God is endless provider .,."
"Jesus is coming back soon 😉🤣
The government owns your body.

"These is a really thin line, if there is a rape , I think the woman has the right to do what she wants, but if that is no de case woman’s and man’s need to be educated, if you can afford have a baby please don’t, do….there is so many ways to prevent get pregnant , don’t be irresponsible , my grandma said one time if a woman don’t want to get pregnant, keep the door closed,but if you open the door is because you know what are you doing, people let’s be responsable and educated new generations,"
Kangaroo court is a branch of the tableland and needs to be burnt to the ground the country dose not need gun  loving court and hates woman and children and they love guns and kill the separation of church an state minority rule in America they made it great again for the men and the religious cooks fuck them all
"I can personally say that I'm happy that the people who support abortion will rally together to continue to support it. I do not support it and I am happy to know that my tax dollars are not going towards the funding of something I, personally do not believe in. As an American citizen it's my right. As an American citizen it's also the right of the people to rally together to support the causes that speak to them personally. The media always makes one side louder than the other. I would like to hear from the mothers who have struggled and despite their struggle honored their belief not to abort their children and have still persevered. I know them personally. They spent countless hours studying for degrees, working at strip clubs, doing hair etc., so they can take care of babies that they did not plan for. We never seem to hear from those women. I'm sure single Parenthood in general is not easy but we all have our choices to make. Whether they're right or wrong it's not for anyone to judge but it's everyone's right to support the causes that they deem Worthy."
YES!! Yes!! Yes. Thank God.
"STOP KILLING KIDS.
monsters"
"Ironically, the same Democrats who pushed mandatory vaccines and decried grievances against the 2020 election as the “end of democracy” are complaining about a real return to democracy.

“We thought that was democracy and yet the very people who’ve been lecturing us for years about democracy — ‘it’s the end of democracy’ — are horrified by the return of democracy,” Carlson said. “They’re telling us the legitimacy of our institutions is at risk and yet they cannot allow voters to have a say in how they live. What does that tell you? It tells you they care about power, not popular support.”

Since the Supreme Court’s ruling, over a dozen states have already banned abortion as a result of “trigger laws” on their books. California and New York lawmakers, on the other hand, have vowed to make their states “sanctuaries” for abortion access.

Democracy is already in action.


Leftists Freak That SCOTUS Has Overturned Their Ability To Kill Unborn"
"“Roe was one of those decisions you never heard anyone defend on its own terms. Lots of people want legal abortion, but no one’s ever explained how exactly the Constitution guarantees that,” Carlson explained. “Roe was a political document. It was not a legal opinion and for that reason, its existence degraded and undermined the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, one of our country’s central institutions. It was poison.”

“The purpose of the Supreme Court is simple. It’s to determine whether the laws that politicians pass are consistent with the United States Constitution. That’s it. That’s all the Supreme Court does.”

Carlson explained that the issue of abortion is now left up to individual states, exactly as democracy and the American political system is supposed to function.

“What the Supreme Court does not do, what it cannot do and should never do is make laws and it should never do that because a court making laws would be, by definition, anti-democratic,” Carlson noted. “None of the nine Supreme Court justices has been elected by anyone. All of them have lifetime appointments. If you cared about democracy and wanted democracy to continue, you would demand that all laws in the United States be passed by elected legislatures. Again, no matter how you feel about abortion or any other specific issue. In a democracy, voters have the final word on how they are governed. That’s what democracy is.”

Which means if some states want abortion, their legislatures can vote for it. If not, they won’t, the Fox News host said.

“Now, after nearly half a century, voters have had their rights restored on the question of abortion. If they like abortion, they can vote to legalize abortion. If they don’t like abortion, they can vote to ban abortion. That’s not shocking. That is how our system is supposed to work, not being a monarchy and all. So, what’s the argument against this? Well, there isn’t one, really and we know that for certain from the dissent in today’s Supreme Court ruling.”"
"Fox News host Tucker Carlson broke down how the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v Wade on Friday, contrary to the left’s misguided rhetoric, actually represents a return to democracy.

“After nearly 50 years, the single shoddiest, most destructive Supreme Court decision in American history has finally been struck down. Roe v. Wade was overturned this morning by a 6-3 majority,” Tucker began on his Friday edition of “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”Fox News host Tucker Carlson broke down how the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v Wade on Friday, contrary to the left’s misguided rhetoric, actually represents a return to democracy.

"Former President Donald Trump is hosting a Save America rally in Mendon, Illinoios on Saturday at 7pm CDT to take a victory lap over the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v Wade on Friday which now leaves abortion policy to individual states."

Good decision. And if you don't want an abortion then excercise the option of chastity.
The RIGHT to kill an innocent baby without good reason is Gone. Women should NOT be relying on frivolous Abortions as birth control and that’s a Good thing. I wonder how many Fathers didn’t have a say in their child’s convenient Disposal.
DONALD TRUMP STILL GETTING MORE DONE OUT OFFICE THAN SLEEPY JOE. It's a great day . Oh please stop killing babies
"The Silent Scream

⚠️ Warning: This Documentary Is Not Recommended For Sensitive People!

The documentary, 'The Silent Scream' released in 1984 contributed to the abortion debate in the 1980s.

Dr. Bernard Nathanson's classic video shocked the world. He explains the procedure of a suction abortion, followed by an actual first-trimester abortion as seen through ultrasound. The viewer can see the child's pathetic attempts to escape the suction curette as her heart rate doubles, and the fetus (girl) opened its mouth in what Nathanson calls a ""Silent Scream"" as her body is torn apart.

The clip begins with an ultrasound of the fetus (girl) who is about to be aborted. The girl is moving in the womb; displays a heartbeat of 140 per minute; and is at times sucking her thumb. As the abortionist's suction tip begins to invade the womb, the child rears and moves violently in an attempt to avoid the instrument. Her mouth is visibly open in a ""Silent Scream."" the child's heart rate speeds up dramatically (to 200 beats per minute) as she senses aggression. She moves violently away in a pathetic attempt to escape the instrument. The abortionist's suction tip begins to rip the baby's limbs from its body, ultimately leaving only her head in the uterus (too large to be pulled from the uterus in one piece). The abortionist attempts to crush her head with his forceps, allowing it to be removed. To ""dehumanize"" the procedure, the abortionist and anesthesiologist refer to the baby's head as ""number 1."" the abortionist crushes ""number 1"" with the forceps and removes it from the uterus.

SOLUTION to ABORTION! 👉  Keep'a Dat Boo-Boo Closed!😆🤣😲😳........🙄oops
If you have been born. You get an opinion on Abortion. It's never been about Women's rights. That's the delusion. It's about the Baby's right to be Born.
Yes yes yes🤣🤣🤣 I'm soo happy nobody will be here if their parents aborted them.
"Letting someone who everyone  knew wouldn't get reelected make x3  appointments for life...to the supreme court, was a mistake."
Abortion is murder
"We have effectively ceded our personal rights ,, to the Government , no longer are we CITIZENS of the United States ,, but SUBJECTS of the United States"
"God is the creator, every woman that had abortions will eventually have to answer to him."
If they die having a botched abortion they will die with their baby.
GOD BLESS AMERICA........... TRUMP <3
"Clarence Thomas sexually harrassed Anita Hill and still got away with it and sits on the Supreme Court.  Kavanagh sexually assaulted women at his college and university.  Amy Coney Barrett was placed on the court with the backing of the Koch brothers' 40 million dollars.  Those three should be impeached immediately.  Biden wanted to appear ""non bias"" and thought that non action would make him look good -- in other words -- he had a chance to add at least three more judges to the court and he passed.  He wanted to be seen as a ""reach across the aisle"" candidate and President.  His outdated comprehension of ""parties working together"" is infuriating. He is not dealing with reasonable republicans he is dealing with fanatics."
"Hold up, if they're banning abortions,  shouldn't they also ban all medical procedures of any kind to fall in line with their ultimate beliefs? Bunch of backwards hicks"
"I realize that your'e a British media outlet, but it doesn't require an Oxford education to do simple research understand that the ruling on Abortion here in the US was NOT overturned, but rather relegated to the States.  And it's NOT a constitutional right as your sorry education has led you to believe!"
"For someone that has been following this case ,listening to this segment will be soooo misleading to someone who is new."
"Planned Parenthood will be losing millions of dollars due to this decision, and folks wonder why it is one of the biggest advocates.

Folks, do not solely think it has the best interest for women - but also for green."
I’m gonna be real here if you don’t want to have a kid why not take anti pregnancy pills or use a condom. Unless if you got raped I understand the abortion
"Let's see how she's going to celebrate life when a doctor refuses to remove a dead fetus from inside her, or when she's told she has to give birth to her rapist's semen..."
"White people are declining, not reproducing and oh the great replacement theory

Gov: Ban abortions 🥴

Can't make this stuff up !!! Majority of those people celebrating are young teens who will cry after not having the choice. Or women who are clearly gay and just don't plan to have kids or adopt. Or the mom already who has kids, tubes tied and won't have to first hand live with the consequences"
This is difficult in America because we have a supreme Court judge that doesn't know what a woman is how do we know these are women is this now not transgender are these old transgender or there's no such thing as a woman because we don't know in America or woman is if we don't know what a woman is how do we know that they can have abortions the supreme Court judge of the democratic party the president of the United States so this is a pointless demonstration considering everybody there is transgender
"Soon these Evangelical morons will want to ban men from getting vasectomies, stop all birth control, and even imprison people who don't have sex because they obviously want as many of these little cabbages running around this already fucked up planet. And guess what the more humans there are the more fucked up the planet is!"

Mainly white people protesting.  Truly it is their issue and truly they do not represent the minorities of this country.
PRIMITIVE nation.  So backwards !
"9:30 She means ""access to contraception""."
"It's about time there was term limits set on abortions in the states. It's absolutely sick that up until now, there were no term limits and they could abort babies up to 9 months. Americas abortion laws were the same as North Korea. So I'm glad that there are now term limits in place."
The 6 week/ 15 week abortion bans are not okay! What if a women doesn't get regular periods and doesn't find out until later that she is pregnant
Abortion I do not support that it's not right to do abortions so women should be more careful now with their bodies get marriage and make babies give them good live remember who's said abortion if ur parents did the same u would not be in this world now some sacrifice their life just to make sure their babies lives so what wrong
Let's ban men masturbating? Literally killing thousands of babies. Bonkers!
What a shame to kill roe rights.  Shame on Supreme Court decision.
"Abortion is an evil act.
Remember once in your life  you came to fetus stage."
"You think the US is the Wild West now….wait til these daddyless kids, that “should” have been aborted, become criminals at a younger age, because these dumbass kids are having sex without protection and can’t abort. You’re gonna get everything you want you stupid conservatives, let’s just see if you want what you’re gonna get!!!"
Life over death
why is the guy talking ? WOMANS BODY IS HER OWN BUSINESS WHO ARE OR ANYONE 2 JUDGE ? BLOODY AMERICA WHOLE SYSTEM IS RUN BY NUTTERS HIT ME HATE ALL YOU WANT UNBELIEAVABLE ....
Another example why religion is a terrible ponzi. Shocking. Imagine being raped and having to have the child. Holy crap
Byeden and his demonic agenda ' this decision must not be the final word ' it means they will continue to appeal the legal right to have abortion.
"Ppl need to stop have sex. Abstain !!! Prevent unwanted pregnancies, STDs."
these are all paid actors
Amen. I say a. Big thank you to the courts.. God bless. An. Save all babies. What God gives let no man or woman  kill.  God bless the courts thank you amen😎👍❤️🌹🕊️🇮🇪
"amazing win for usa...historic.

Slavery was considered a right. You’ll get over it.
"Why is that 21 year old girl ""terrified""? She HAS FULL CONTROL of HER OWN BODY. 🤔"
"The statement ... "" A Right To Abortion ""  makes no sense ?"
Who flew on the Lolita Express to Epstein’s Island?
How can one allow one's right to destroy the life of another; innocent human being. Absolutely Obvious! A Child is a child; in the mother's (adopted M's)  care; until he/she can fend for him/herself.
"""Radical decision."" This reporting clearly isn't based on a foundational understanding of America. We are a federalist country. This is one of the most pro- Democratic, pro- federalist decisions in decades."
Next footstep stop pop culture companies
Yeah it's a mans world don't expect the courts to enforce child support payments though just because they expect you to have the baby and tolerate the abuse that accompanies that.  Not sexy at all.
What about being  responsible  and if  a woman  wa ts to be a whor  tie your tubs
"Your show is distorted from the thrust..the abortion is not banned,it is going to be up to the state to rule what it population think is right..!"
It's a load of crap a woman should have a choice to have an abortion or not it's our bodies
I’m sorry I can’t help you!! You mean sorry I can’t help you kill your baby!! You sorry pieces of crap!!! THANK GOD FOR DONALD TRUMP!!
Your comment are false…the abortions laws are going to be decided by the state and with time frames..you are not onset lying to the people
Another reason to hate each other in USA those poor women my god
The problem is if we believe in God who said you shall not kill
"It is totally rational,it should be the state to regulate it depending theirs citizens choice!"
"so for the 95% of people that are crying about losing the right to abort a baby, not because they were raped or there are some extreme health problems, but because having a baby is inconvenient for them. Here's a fun fact if you're worried about getting pregnant. DON'T HAVE SEX!
Problem solved, If you're that afraid of having a baby don't risk making one. Or get your eggs removed or whatever, don't blame someone else for your lack of control. And if you do have an abortion and it goes wrong because you chose to do it somewhere illegally, well that's on you, no one forced you to do it, you decided on that choice yourself. 
Imagine me saying my friend died of an OD because we got drugs from a dodgy dealer in another country because it's illegal in my own country, then blaming my government for his death saying they caused it. i swear People got some dumb logic when they're crying over their emotions"
"Democrats...Let's make a deal! Please secede and you can have your abortions, gun control and all of your other utopian and unconstitutional ideals.  We will gladly let you go...Please leave."
"Alleluja !!!!!

"The radical position is being pro life 😂 the irony is beyond reason. Imagine the Supreme Court (The Judiciary) one branch of government placing legislative onus on the legislative branch of government per the separation of powers, heaven forbid they would display deference to the Constititionality of such laws by passing them back to the legislators as they are the representatives VOTED IN BY THE PEOPLE. Name any Article or Ammendment in the US Constitution that directly states abortion as a Constitutional right? Oh it doesn't exist? Was founded and based on a period of judicial acvtivisim within the courts? Okay, understood. Court suits you when it's full of activists and it doesn't suit when it actually has originalists who don't make up rights where and when they want"
"I never have and never will support abortion, if someone is willing to kill their unborn baby then they are not a human at all"
"Abortion was never in the Constitution so how can it be guaranteed by the Constitution? the only thing the court did was give each state the freedom they once had to make their own laws which is what individual state government was designed to do, abortion will only be limited not stopped since TRASH blue states will continue the pathetic barbaric practice."
I am sorry ? People are supporting here in comment section the killing of unborn child ?
"Note that the BBC does not use the term ""pro-life"" but calls them ""anti-abortion"" activists. Clear media bias spin."
"All women: stockpile the abortion pills.  You can still order them over the internet.  Oh, and VOTE.  November's election is super important and it is going to be harder than ever to place your vote.  Do your best--get your elderly neighbors to the polls.  We have to let them know that we will happily vote them out.  This is only the beginning"

"A huge win for Rapist in America...Christian Nationalist are extremely pro-Rapist pro-Incest. Pro-Violence against Women, Pro-Starving Children Pro-Ignorance."
One of the greatest and most sensible decisions by the Supreme Court. This gives hope that there is some sanity in the US.

Ladies unite, vote blue!💙"
"Perhaps these same Judges should pass a law which states that ALL men/boys have a vasectomy unless they are legally married. You can bet that those same Judges would NEVER pass this as a law. You can also bet there would be hundreds of thousands of men who would loudly protest. The laws should be equal for women & men. Plus what are these same Judges going to ensure that American men take care of the children they have already created? How many single women are out there financially taking care of their children but the men of those same children are not forced to actually pay the child
support they are required to pay."
ABSTINACE! AND CELIBACY! WOO! HOO!.
"If women are in positions where they want or need an abortion but legally can't, and the man who got her pregnant doesn't want to keep it or help raise it...he should automatically be given a vasectomy.  It takes two to put an unwanted child in a uterus. Apparently, conservatives are saying that the door is kicked open now for going after same sex marriages and contraception. The conservative ball has started rolling and America is soon to be obsolete on the world stage and moving back towards McCarthyism-thinking with a heavy dash of fascist rule added to it."
"Ok men get the snip what is that a No then stop forcing women to go ahead with pregnancies that you wouldn't stay around for, what about all the unwanted abused kids in state care where is the love there ffs, ok then it should be made illegal to get a woman pregnant and fuck off then stupid world"
"substitution of concepts, there is no right (constitutional) and there was no right, the decision of some court of the court is not the right to murder (abortion)"

RIGHT to abortion NOT struck down.
Glad the court upheld our 2nd amendment. I hate guns and don't like them
This is why I will start adopting to help the system as much I can to give a lost child a good home.
There is no contraceptive as sure and as cheap as abortion. These pro lifers are the wurst.

"Whats mean by unwanted childern. Who are we. We are human. As mother and inprocess child. We are humans , even before our births. We have to trickle down myth of liberalism that abortion is right. It is killing."
"@James Art Sorry unable to reply directly to your comment kind of weird. 





 It's something no wants to do, but for the world to be better, we need this right for women. The mothers need to be priority. A child can not be supported if the mother is unable to support themselves. We need better Sex Ed, so this isn't an issue(contraceptives too). The fact that this is illegal means so many people will go to jail over the unborn, who have no voice, and will not appreciate, or disagree with the gesture. It's depressing that people can be born into this world, and wish they had been aborted."
Haha. All the Thots and Slewts are upset and losing they’re minds. I’m loving it! Most these dingbats get abortions more than I get McDonald’s. They’re all gonna get yeast infections over this. Finally the republicans did something I agree with. Never thought I’d see the day.
SO HAPPY ❤️
"that doesn't give the right to apply murder by abortion. 
As abortion is outright murder the court has made a wise and moral good decision"
Test reply
People supporting abortion are f***** in the head they are supporting murder innocent people there are no excuses for Murder or killing a child killing a foetus it's a human life regardless f*** you scum supporters of abortion
The shows the justice system has dignity America has dignity by banning abortion abortion is basically murder and should always be banned
"Why do Christians want to ban abortions ? They aren’t the ones doing it, it’s mostly liberals in blue states, that actually work for republicans as their rivals are killing their descendants hence reducing their numbers!"
Now they will use protection and stop having sex with men who beat them. No excuse for abortion
"This is a great day in America! Finally the unborn have rights. I am pro-life and abortion is murder, plain and simple. God bless America!🇺🇸👶"
Abortion is a great sin.
It's not like you can't get on birth control My God people!
I need regular news
Abortion is a Murder
Have the baby. Stop trying  to kill your unborn child.
"States should leave it up to the people of each County via public referendum, but they don't care what The People want.  Vote them out."

 what children are they talking about? the homeless, hungry, abused children? no, they don't give a rat's flying arse about those low good for nothing breathing children. They care about what's between your legs and mine. Gross. The unborn within my body, is still my body, and I can do what I want with it, and I definitely wouldn't want to bring another child into this world to suffer at the hands of hypocrites. The unborn are better off than the poor abused children that you all 
b!t©h about, because their parents are on welfare."
people forget that supreme court didnt ban abortion and make illegal but removed consitutional protection and gave states ability to make it illegal or legal

America going backwards in 5th gear. The repercussions will be interesting to watch.
This is just simply the downfall of society when there's no morals there's no responsibility for your personal actions and blame everybody else oh boy it sounds like the Democrat party
"MMMM, yummy white christian babies adreanochrome...I love the new surplus"
I'm so sorry you can't kill your child
"Well done America,Give GOD back Glory"
Pro life !!
"The thing that annoys me most about people saying keep your legs close to women is that it never mentions the male.Why are women getting all the blame when it takes two to make a baby and it’s not just women protesting why are they being targeted because they are the one to carry the baby.
If your going to tell us women to keep our legs close than I expect you to at the very least say “ keep it in your pants fellas”
Thank you for reading have a nice day."
Looks like the supporters are mostly overweight females.
I was adopted..how could i ever be for abortion..i could of been.but my mother had the heart to let me live and give me up to a great family..pro life
Social or economic reasons. Brainwashed genocide.

"5:20
roe v. wade was overturned, because the country cares about people!
it cares about the unborns and it cares about the mental and moral maturity of the women!
a mentally and morally healthy woman would know to only have sex with a man she wants to spend life and start a family with, because sex can lead to a pregnancy and a child!

child murder isn't a human right!"
"So if you are pregnant with a 11-fingered, 2-headed baby from a rape, your only option is to kill it after giving birth to it?"
Women fought for over 100 years to take control of their own bodies! Now the republicans and those who use religion that they have forced view on the people! Country is going in the wrong direction. Thanks to the republicans. If they had it their way out country would be run by a single ruling party. Which would lead to a dictatorship. Both sexes should protest this action that the republicans have made to our society!
This never has been a right to murder.
"2:30
a woman, trying to kill her child, doesn't deserve to live and deserves to die!"
This news has literally brighten my day.  My heart  feels so much joy ❤️. God has truly spoken.    What's wrong with being sexually responsible.  These babies should not endure pain because  of the parents bad decision making.     People just think about themselves. And that selfish !    Babies lives matter Too

And skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed.
And in Your book they all were written,
The days fashioned for me,
When as yet there were none of them."

"Fat girl at 1:22 chanting ""Life won today"" has never seen a cock and doesn't want anyone else to enjoy sex"
It’s ironic that the people that support abortion are out protesting and screaming must secretly be thinking I’m glad my parents didn’t abort me.
"Abortion is murder ! Why can’t y’all understand that ? 
Ur body ur choice yea go to the store and pic up some condoms"
Women will die from botched abortions? What about the child nobody cares about the child because there’s one person that’s going to die and that’s the child.
Hey Joey I’m sure ppl didn’t like being forced to take a vaccine now u don’t like the judges forced that ruling out !!!!!!

Pro life 1-0 Pro killing unborn babies.  Victory at last
Here is an idea. Abstinence is 100% effective at preventing unwanted pregnancy.  Here is another idea;  Let's kill the parents of rape victims instead of the children of rape victims. How about that? Here is another idea; STOP KILLING THE CHILDREN FOR THE IMMORAL ACTIVITIES OF THE PARENTS!!!
Do they not think how over populated we already are? Maybe make abortion Available in 3rd world countries of you wanna take it away from Americans absolutely pathetic
How sad people can’t kill babies anymore
Well done Scotus

"👩‍👩‍👧Unfortunately, this mass butchering of babies will likely continue in the democrats demonic blue states. In California and New York out of defiance, it might even increase. Overall, though, the infanticide numbers will almost certainly decrease. And those numbers are almost too horrific to comprehend.
Since Roe became the law of the land in 1973, 63 million innocent babies have been slaughtered. Sixty-three million lives were snuffed out, almost all for convenience purposes. Every life saved by the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision is an innocent and precious life👩‍👧‍👦"
No rights are given to people tryna give death sentences to babies
"The people who should be made responsible - both physically and financially - for taking care of those babies through to adulthood are the pro-life campaigners.
Or…. All males need to be given the snip…. Lets see how quickly the laws are changed then!!!"
Religion is a chosen lifestyle for the weak of will. They should not be making decisions for others.
Say goodbye to bodily autonomy
i hate the fact that if we give it a few more years when most the older people die out it will probably change again :/
Now men can spread their seeds the reason I'm here is because .My father told and my mother in 1959 that if she aborted me he was going to lock her up and now .l have two five children 21 grandkids and five great grants.🙏
The legacy of Trump in the US will have consequences for decades to come and not in a good way.
"It is funny they fight for killing babies using abortion but the only reason any of them are here is the fact that their mother did not abort them.
This is an issue that has been pushed to control people. It is a lie, it puts the issue back to the states. It is not in the constitution. 50 million babies have been murdered, it is eugenics pushed on our black and poor communities and now Bill and Melinda Gates are building abortion clinics in Africa. It is the will of the people, Roe vs Wade was a fake ,it was planned and used to push Planned Parenthood, she never had an abortion, her daughter is alive today even though her mother gave her up. You are only shown these few instances and not the evil side of abortion. These people are pushing abortion at the moment of birth and allowing the mother and doctor to kill the child while it is alive. It is a for profit organization that earned $1.9 billion last year and received $528 in government money. They sell the fetuses to labs for experimentation and the clinics and doctors receive money for it. What about the dumpsters of aborted babies. Stop pushing propaganda. It is totally out of control. My body, my right is not true, it is not the mothers body it is the childs' body. The left and our education system has brainwashed all these young people minds for decades. it is about money and control, not womens health."
Its almost like someone wants to keep us fighting with each other
"Ah, yes.  Religion.  Keeping humanity from progressing, since its inception.  Or, in this case, actually regressing humanity by a good fifty years in one fell swoop.  Idiotic beyond belief."
"They're going to build a better world with more unwanted or under cared for children...I guess. This means the states can choose to outlaw abortion even if the mothers at risk. I hope most states have the foresight to protect women from potential harm, but I don't have much faith in red state legislators. They care more about the unborn than they do about those of us who are here right now.

Trump and the Republicans had a chance in 2017 to change our lives for the better when they had full control over Congress and the Presidency, but chose to focus on temporary tax relief for the poor and middle class while giving the wealthiest like Trump and his family permanent tax breaks, and packing the SCOTUS to overturn the right to an abortion. Let's not forget about their ""2nd Amendment right"" to kill children who are alive and breathing once again showing they don't care about us."
America is a sh*thole. May God have mercy on it’s citizens.
A victory for pregnant men worldwide Praise Jebus
How about you don’t get pregnant in the first place?
"More Jesus, better America"
"There's no such thing as a ""right"" to abortion, you don't get to murder defenseless children out of convenience, your rights stop where the rights of other begin; Leftie Liberals always say ""my body my choice"" but never mention the baby's body and the baby's choice which is disgusting; if you don't want a baby then be a responsible grown-ass adult and don't have sex or buy a condom, they're super cheap and easily available.

PS. Congratulations from Mexico to all American patriots for this beautiful victory, this is a glorious and delightful development!

"Perverse behaviour, fornication, sexual immolarity, premarital sex is cause of abortion. Lets deal with the cause. Encourage americans to abstain from sex until they are married."
Why cant women just keep their legs together? is it so hard...yes thats why they cant.
Who cares what England thinks? They never cared about human rights.
I would leave that country ASAP!!!
"The United States will be more divided than it is now, many of the states will ask for their independence and probably will have it, not only on the abortion issue but also on gun control. A Civil War is coming"
Just move to NY or California they will continue to kill babies there.. That’s why their states are so F*** UP!!!
"White supremacy... 100 years ago a white supremacist woman named Sanger started an organisation to control what she considered to be undesirables through eugenics...  Today that organisation is actively murdering minority children at a rate way faster than the murder of white children... The damage doesnt stop there...  Once a person has destroyed his or her own child he/she has destroyed a piece of his/her own soul... The pain leads to drug use, alcoholism despondency and destruction. Ms Sanger's dream of destroying the minorities in America is being seen everyday in the inner cities everywhere in America and liberal black leaders are cheering her on!"

Harvest ( fruits must be there we should not be beating around the bush,,)and sufferings are two eyes of a christian life ,,
An easy way to get sufferings.
When will you get sufferings,,? 
you will get  more sufferings if  you have to put on the full armour of God
When you do good works like christ or take the armour of God (Ephesians 6:-
12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,(D) but against the rulers, against the authorities,(E) against the powers(F) of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.(G) 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God,)
1 john 2:-16 tells us not to love lusts eyes lusts of flesh and pride of life ( our achievements,,)
Because we have to continue to do good works until we die ,,,,,
Good brotheren christians tells this avoid second time ,,( seeing a list ,,)
I couldn't understand that,,,
God even forgives our sins ,,
He called us when we were dead in our sins and lawlessness,,,
But  Christ raised us from spiritual death ,,
We may have no money ,,
We may have no own 🏠 house,,
But our aim should not be a house or money ,,
This world is not ours ,,
We have no permanent city here ,,
But we should know that without us the world will be dark and saltless,,
But when we lose our saltiness ,,
Matthew 5:13 
“You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.(
So if are bad christians the world we will be thrown out)
Sufferings are different but saltiness is different,,
We will have sufferings,,
1 Peter 4 
Being Faithful to God
1Christ suffered here on earth. Now you must be ready to suffer as he did, because suffering shows that you have stopped sinning. 2It means you have turned from your own desires and want to obey God for the rest of your life( it means you should take armours of God ,,)
2 Peter 1:-10 
New Living Translation
So, dear brothers and sisters, work hard to prove that you really are among those God has called and chosen. Do these things, and you will never fall away( so we must know in a running race about our speed or we will win the race or we running with real winners or we must closely run with successful evangelists or victorious christians ,,)
Philippines 1;-22
But if I live, I can do more fruitful work for Christ. So I really don’t know which is better.( It means when Paul was doing ministry he had lot of harvests ,,this is a sign of knowing that God is with us ,,)
When you are doing good works like Jesus (automatically) you will be getting lot of sufferings,,
It is not that we are inviting TROUBLES or sufferings,,,but doing good like Jesus did healing the sick and helping people,,( so automatically you will get sufferings or opposition,)
Or a ministry of  God ( this you can know God's will in your talents and gifts ,,)
Successful christian life is different from ministry of God ,,
You can know your calling of a ministry only by your fruits or results in ministry. 👍👍👍
Those sufferings would be helpful to you from sins ,
It means not inviting sufferings ourselves but it means doing good works,,,
You should not lose your heat when you see hostility ( opposition,,) 
There you should think about Jesus ❤️ he suffered on earth ,so Comfort yourselves ,( you are on right direction,,,very much bigger it is a sign that your works very great ,but make sure if there is fruits, or you should not be beating the bush or punching in the sky high or beating the sky ,)🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
"How about telling the truth for once? You do know this doesn't make abortion illegal right? It leaves it up to the states to decide. Of course you know that, but you need ratings."
This country would be better if we executed all conservatives.
1:30 personal level? Obviously the product of a failed abortion. Too bad their parents failed
Lets be explicit: The US is not divided on this. 75% are pro-choice (so against this decision)!!!
Thank you Jesus I’m so tired of seeing women having abortion parties and tired of them getting abortions just for fun tired of see women get abortions just to make their boyfriend mad  my neighbor had 7 abortions I asked her why so many abortions she said she enjoys getting abortions and she do it for fun when she heard the news abortion she stuck a metal clothes hanger up her private part and I called 911 smh
separation of church and state needs to happen right now.
"In a Democrat state that allows abortion up to 9 months, isn't that murder?  
If I were to kick a pregnet woman in the stomach and she lost the unborn child I should be charged with assault ONLY because under their logic the unborn child is not a life. But in those very same states there are people in prison for murder for killing a unborn child. The hypocrisy of what goes on in some liberal state's is unbelievable."
What happened to All Lives Matters
"Anti-abortion is mostly Christian/Catholic belief. However the United States Constitution states there should be division between the state and religion. Even Jesus said ""Give to Caesar what is due to Caesar"". Leave the issue of the state, to the state. Do not meddle. You are forcing your belief to Atheists, Buddhists, Muslims, Jews, Hindus of this Country. Because you are FORCING them to follow Christian beliefs, they will go away and think of Christians very badly. Jesus NEVER forced anyone to convert to Christianity nor follow the commandments. HE PREACHED AND SHOWED LOVE TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN."
"I love the democracy end the freedom of speech in this soils 😍😍 am sure back  in my home land Africa , if found expressing  ur thoughts in the streets , all these citizens would have been swept to prison cells 🙌🙌🙌# safe abortion #aright 💪💪💪"
Murder is not a right. But sometimes a tragic necessity.
use a condom or drink a pills or abstain from sex but do not go around killing babies
It’s crazy to see women who are pro life 😨😨
Good
Yay good news! So glad for this! Children deserve to live!
"Imagine being one of the idiots in the crowd chanting.

This ain't a good thing because abortions will STILL be done, just now much more painfully and unsafely."
What if it was your preteen daughter? she could die from giving birth. Yet America gave more rights to guns than women
Weird the BBC did a whole show on abortion but wouldn't show the procedure or aftermath. I wonder why...
Why are women making a big deal out of this change? Women get pregnant somehow. Right?  Just have some self-control and everything should be just fine.
The constitution DOSE NOT give women the right to an abortion..  Democrats just keep spewing that LIE.  Show me where in the constitution where it says that. It does NOT.
If the chick dies that’s on her
"Millions of children in the United States are getting the constitutional right to live, after the Supreme Court overturned its landmark Roe v Wade ruling of 50 years ago, which take the children the right to live."
I wonder if those women are going to take care of the abandoned childen or they are just celebrating over nothing
Democracy is going to die in America n india. All the best future citizens 🙂
This is the most perfect law in US. It will save a lot of people lives and will make women take more responsibility of their pregnancy.
They are not pro life they are pro breeders
"It's hilarious that these people think they had anything to do with this.  The Supreme court didn't do this because these people  changed their mind, they did it because a bunch of conservative cronies with too much bible and not enough brains, put in by another cronie with no brains, made a very very stupid decision.  

Pubs are ALWAYS bitching about paying for people that are in poverty.  Just wait until they see how many more of them there will be now.   A pregnant teenager will now have virtually no chance as a life.  And science is NOT on your side, little girl, science clearly shows that MORE population is the LAST thing this world needs.  But soldier on, idiots.  When other aspects like the environment really start to go South I can tell you who will be bitching most, too.

All I can say is anyone with three working brain cells to rub together better have a few morning after pills set aside."
"No abortion, no sex before marriage,"
"Finaly something good happend in America! 
Satan is very angry and furious, it can be seen on the faces of the people who are indifferent to killing children."
Oprah is the most hurt by this.
What this shows is that the president is not the most powerful man  in the world
I believe this is a subject where men in politics are in no position to have any say.
"Since the well known POTUS-puppet in his public statement show immediately connected the SC ruling with existing rape-children, 
I don't dare to imagine what elderly single (male ;) men are heading for now ...
... transgender auntie Bob seems to be not the only refuge option anymore ..."
Right to kill?
"1:40
this lady said that she saw the devastation that that abortion does on a personal level. well has this lady with the red hair and the glasses had a abortion herself? if she hasn't that she needs to keep her mouth shut because I personal level means she had an abortion herself and she knows what it's like to have an abortion if she knows what it's like to have someone rape her but I doubt it that she's ever been raped and I doubted that she's been ever chosen abortion because she's never lived in fear because if she did choose abortion and if she was raped she wouldn't be in that Riley saying yeah now those children are going to live in property congratulations Miss red-haired I know what it's like to have an abortion know you don't"
"I don’t agree with total prohibition on abortion just as I don’t agree with legislating abortion from the bench. Congress should do their job and pass a common sense abortion law. Prohibiting all abortions is extreme just as allowing late term and mid term abortions. I doubt the average person cares if an abortion is had in the first trimester but I doubt they’re ok with it at 7, 8, 9 months. Common sense and compromise must return or we will tear ourselves apart."
Abortion is murder.
"It is Not woman taking woman's rights away but Seven MEN , Just like they did in the past by our ancestors!"
This is almost totally driven by religion put America back 100 years what they going to do next start burning witches bunch of god fearing idiots
"There will be illegal abortion, and this will endanger women more.Think about poor women who won't be able to achieve it . Think about the women who get raped and get pregnant and don't want the child? Think about a woman who got pregnant accidentally and who can't afford a living for herself? Think about the cost of living ? The world is changing more recessions, poor women will suffer the most."
"We are in a new age, not old custom ages. Women should be allowed to choose. Pro-Abortion does not make any women get an abortion, only if that women chooses too. If they don’t want to give women right to choose then let’s also go back to the Stone Age and hit women on the head with a stick pull their hair and use them to mate, just because these things were done by cavemen does not mean we still do it. Give women their respect and allow them to choose."
VICTORY 🎉🎉
"the real solution is Flirt with the Right Person, or dont get knocked so easy, why is that so Hard?? learn self defense early so you dont get knocked either, if we are powerful woman why we get knocked so easy? deal with it if you do, properly. Let's all start new, do not be weak, you dont need this law if you become Wise! Flirt with the right person, even if it takes you till you are old! Clean slate for America! Besides, think where the fetus ends, potentially in the mouth of the elite rich for food, gross but investigate, why feed them more?"
"she lift a sign ""my body my choice"" 
how about the Human in your womb 
did you give him his choice to live !
f*** devils
you think you own his life just because he was in your womb !
ridiculous d****heads"
Imprenant the pro life ppl with multiple babies then deny them abortion and take there job and beat them and then tell us what you think
"And then they vote to allow more guns to kill the children when they are no longer an embryo, but real children."
"Zambia appreciates the decision of The US Supreme Court, NO Abortion. We celebrate with you. Amen. Zambia."
"BBC this is disingenuous, it isn’t radical or of an evil oppressive nature, the US Supreme Court hasn’t stopped women having an abortion, they have handed that responsibility down to individual states legislature, were if your representative doesn’t align with your beliefs or moral code, pro choice or anti, you the electorate can elect them or not. Cherry picking at its best."
It's unconstitutional to say you can't get an abortion it goes against you freedom of choice
Haven’t seen the unbiased BBC this upset since the Americans elected Donald.J.Trump
Pro life 💙👶
"this directly pointed at Hoyt plunket, this is your religious belief not mine, you have no right to tell me what to think."

"The Silent Scream

⚠️ Warning: This Documentary Is Not Recommended For Sensitive People!

The documentary, 'The Silent Scream' released in 1984 contributed to the abortion debate in the 1980s.

Dr. Bernard Nathanson's classic video shocked the world. He explains the procedure of a suction abortion, followed by an actual first-trimester abortion as seen through ultrasound. The viewer can see the child's pathetic attempts to escape the suction curette as her heart rate doubles, and the fetus (girl) opened its mouth in what Nathanson calls a ""Silent Scream"" as her body is torn apart.

The clip begins with an ultrasound of the fetus (girl) who is about to be aborted. The girl is moving in the womb; displays a heartbeat of 140 per minute; and is at times sucking her thumb. As the abortionist's suction tip begins to invade the womb, the child rears and moves violently in an attempt to avoid the instrument. Her mouth is visibly open in a ""Silent Scream."" the child's heart rate speeds up dramatically (to 200 beats per minute) as she senses aggression. She moves violently away in a pathetic attempt to escape the instrument. The abortionist's suction tip begins to rip the baby's limbs from its body, ultimately leaving only her head in the uterus (too large to be pulled from the uterus in one piece). The abortionist attempts to crush her head with his forceps, allowing it to be removed. To ""dehumanize"" the procedure, the abortionist and anesthesiologist refer to the baby's head as ""number 1."" the abortionist crushes ""number 1"" with the forceps and removes it from the uterus.

It's a shame how the Ushit is going backwards
So the solution is to kill them like they do cats and dogs?Give me a damn break
as sick as this sounds time to buy into coat hanger stocks. You cannot stop abortions a woman  has a right to determine her choice her right.

Next they will bring witch burning back. America is a child
So all those people have lost their jobs too?
"`Trump has just gone from being by far the worst US President in my lifetime ( I was born in November, 1963 ) to by far the best. I was dreading his return but now look forward to it."
Unwanted peasant babies! Yay! I'd rather be aborted
So men: sue planned parenthood for the baby they killed that was half yours...without your consent.
Just remember that a unborn baby is still a like. If you don't want your baby then adopt it out.
loose sex in USA
Banning it isn’t gonna make it go away. Some women may be desperate enough to do it unsafely. The system is already flooded with so many kids & VERY limited resources. I can’t imagine what it’s going to look like with this ban.. everyone should have the right to choose
"All those mad libtards, burguers are funny 🤣🤣🤣"
"""It means that tens of millions of women across the country no longer have their right to ab abortion guaranteed by the Constitution."" THEY NEVER DID! That's the whole POINT! She's talking as if they wiped it out of the Constitution... Freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, the right to keep and bear arms SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED... Oh, there it is.... The 153rd Amendment the right to an abortion. Gee, how did I miss THAT? I guess I skipped it. What are they going to strike down next? The 10,256th Amendment... Right to free ice cream on National USSA day? What about free coffee to commemorate us putting down the robot uprising? This is a NIGHTMARE!"
"Yesterday was a victory not only for Republicans and Conservatives, but for all of life, when I see children being thrown into garbage cans because of abortion and I see people defending abortion as if it were normal, as if one had the right to speak for a life that cannot defend itself, and that I realize that the human being has not learned anything that the life of the next is disposable, my regrets to all the children who were killed due to abortions and had no one to defend them, more Yesterday justice was done.  congratulations republicans you proved that some people still have a conscience, thank you very much."
"I mean they are technically living the American dream, considering most of them dont seem to even be awake.
Abortion gets re-illegalized if that even is a word, Free Healthcare something that SHOULD BE A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT somehow is being Politicised and I bet you 500€ they'll try to chip away at the VERY RECENT law of legalising Gay Marriage because when a basic right like abortion is stripped away, there is a 50/50 chance they'll try to do it with other Basic Human Right Laws. I mean Sarah the reporter literally said that they're maybe other progressive rights the supreme court could be looking into getting them removed so what are the odds of seeing a slave in Virginia being used to produce cotton again?"
Better late than never.What took so long?
Do not be complecent in Europe. More and more US influenced Evangelicals are active in Europe to gain political power.
Keep there legs closed then there not all rape just lefty feminist evil selfush lives
Just print more money US
So Sharia law for the US it is or something equally religously antiquated.
Dem states will still kill kids and Republican states will save them. They will never win this fight. It's so time for the left to realize what they are doing not only to America but the world. Biden will not not save America. He will destroy America. This is his plan.
"They say, ""We're letting the States decide. We're delegating that authority to them.""
I've got a better idea: how about the States delegate that authority to the INDIVIDUALS, and let them decide?

For the record, I loathe the idea of abortion, but a) I'm not a woman, and b) if I was nobody could've forced me to have an abortion before, so this is just basically people wanting their personal views to have the force of law over others'. As for protecting the rights of unborn children in the in-utero stages, until there is a clear, agreed-upon universal consensus on when a fetus is considered a living human, then the law has a constitutional interest in erring on the side of individual civil liberty. What pregnant women choose to do with that liberty concerning the health and vitality of the fetus and the consequences thereof is and should be their responsibility to bear."
People are becoming more and more retarded by the time...
Real question is on what basis did the same Supreme Court upheld abortion for so long? GOD IS GREAT
Stop just sleeping around with everybody then u won't be able to aborte simple  it's maybe that sex is now easy
How many different types of birth control are offered women today?
"babys lives matter, i dont think people realize how many people want children . they are willing to pay thousands for them bear.  while i feel rape and health are ok for it but, i'm tired of people playing god  in more than just abortion . we have a democracy so we can choose who better suits that party and their own beliefs . everyone deserves to be married i'm ok with that. why is it the same people wanting to murder babies protest dog shelters from putting down dogs because no one wants them? why is it the same people put likes on stories of premature babies that survive the odds and grow up to be beautiful people."

Great news. Murder should be illegal.
"The US isn't a democracy. It's a constitutional republic.

Just because the ""majority"" of the country believes in murdering children, doesn't mean it's right."
Well that's the only thing I've disagreed with trump on. I'm pro life too the life choice we should have
America just signed a death warrant for all the children being born into poverty and over population.
Botched abortions it is then well done America for going back in time further and treating women like crap as usual
Most of the states that want abortion outlawed are the lowest in the educational system..
"Here's a commonsense solution.  Use contraceptives, two different types concurrently.  This isn't the 1800's."
"Finally a Supreme Court made up of rational, intelligent jurists have overturned the prior unconstitutional Supreme Court decision that enabled the immoral and abhorrent killing of babies in the womb!"
"America sure needs a sweeping change,I hope this is going to be the beginning of many more to come."
"Crazy Nazis Satan churches pastor's is giving the Republican party of the supreme Court Justice and the young Republican Congress party members and groups are, pushing horrors on the USA people.
The church pastor's are giving instructions of what to do, what to say, what to think, and who to Kill especially COPS.
The young Republican Congress party is also taking its orders for the USA people,it comes from the Crazy Nazis Satan church and it's pastor's.
The Bible doesn't talk about abortion,no where in it, God has nothing to do with what happened on 6/24/2022 the Nazis Republican party"
"What a misleading title, abortion was never a right outlined in the Constitution to begin with, the Supreme Court simply ruled that the power be returned to the people within the individual states where it belongs. Many Americans are too stupid and lack the wherewithal to understand how their Representative Republic was designed to operate, not realizing that 'state's rights' won this victory, which is a beautiful thing. Removing power from a centralized Federal entity and placing that power back into the citizen's hands is what seperates America as a free Republic from countries elsewhere in the world where citizens are actually subjects under centralized authority, as an American myself I'm thoroughly embarrassed with most of my countrymen who do not even understand that they live in a Republic, crying for government tyranny just so they can feel as though they are safe under a nanny state's control mechanisms...so pathetic...!!!"
Isn’t it just up to the states now? You can go to another state...it’s not like they made it nationally illegal-just no longer a federal issue.
The problem with america is too much extreme freedom
bbc's sex education should not go to waste
People wants to so much rights to escape accountability and responsibility. Prior to 1973 the abortion was illegal unless the mother's life was in danger. Make sense to me. You can't just take unborn life when you want.
America is not the land of the free anymore.

Good to hear the US is going one-step to the right. The Federal government has no business forcing everyone to fund killing babies for the convenience of women. Let the states decide what they want.

"Maybe people should care about the kids that are alive breathing and thinking and are actually right now in many orphanages instead of thinking over a meat apple of an underdeveloped fetus that likely is going to end up in one without a parent, or worse be born and die while feeling pain early in life? If people care about life so much they sure didn't show it that way towards the ones that are currently alive and walking. The homeless, the ill, the kids without parents or kids with mental disabilities? This is just... hypocritical."
"Women are losing their rights every day. This country was supposed to be free but as always it is just for the straight white, christian/catholic male. This is religious coercion. What happened to the separation of church and state?"
Great day in America! The states get to chose their path based on what their residents want. The people supporting are evil. Look at what they are wearing! Losers!
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH GOD BLESS THE SUPREME COURT.........................................................................................
Wait did they remove abortion now??? If yeh then good because I think it’s bad to take away an innocent baby’s life away and it’s not right but I understand that people are not okay with it
"Gas is $5 a gallon and you have to drive out of state to get rid of the bump in your belly .....lol ,  you voted for it"
"Do they really think, banning abortion will end it? People will do abortion illegally which increase the risk."
"Another nail in the coffin of liberty in the self proclaimed ""land of the free"". At this rate the USA is going to end up about as free as Iran. It will become that which it purports to oppose.... a despotism under the rule of mob violence and the tyranny of fanatical religious nut-jobs. The same lawmakers who applaud this decision are the very same who viewed the massacre at Uvalde with cynical indifference. Presumably they don't think there are enough children to provide target practice in American schools."
Look at the bright side. More children around.  I don't hate  children. 😊.  Now who here hates children?  I have nephews  and nieces.
"Thank you, Trump. Unlike other politicians, you delivered."

millions of fewer innocent babies will be murdered"
"@5:20 lol, the irony"
You’re not pro choice. You’re pro death to the most innocent among  us.
People should look up who started planned Parenthood and after you read the story of the woman that started planned Parenthood and her reasons for starting planned Parenthood I think a lot of people are going to change their mind about planned Parenthood not only that people will be shocked
Well you better have great social services because orphanage will sure have alot of customers to serve soon.
"Right to abortion struck down by US Supreme Court - False.
US Supreme Court supreme court decision reversed Federal Law and turn abortion back over to the States Thats it thats all this does. The Headline is Propaganda.  Abortion is still legal in 35 States with some states have some restrictions. 3 more states and Dems can pass a Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing it as a Constitutional right. But Democrats want a wedge issue to win elections .
Roe Vs Wade was Court decision made into law circumvented the Democratic process .  Roe Vs Wade was illegal . Courts in the US don't make laws Congress does. The Courts making law  is Anti-Democracy . 
So Regardless if you're for or against abortion the Federal mandate was unconstitutional.
If Dems don't get off their Bums Conservatives will use the law to go after Gay Marriage in the same way. Gay Marriage was made into law by Executive order. Not by Congress."
ABORTION IS CRIME  ! AFTER ENJOYNG FROM THE BED ! U WILL KILLED  SO STUPID !!! PRO LIFE  PRO GOD !!
forced motherhood?  nobody is forcing motherhood. just practice sex safety. abortion is just baby killing pure and simple
"Her boyfriend hits her every day, but she sleeps with him.🤔"
"Finally a light in the dark! the business with the babies is finished, Lord, give wisdom to these women, so that they take better care of themselves."
Amen no abortion
"This comment section is so scary. I can't believe we still have to claim that WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS. FFS. 
Greetings from Germany where, on the same day as the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, our highest court overturned a law prohibiting doctors to openly discuss their abortion practices. All US women are in my thoughts and will be in my actions."
Aleluya!
Amen
# life has one this day.
All they've done is ban safe abortions and put millions of girls and women at risk.
One more thing to overcome same sex marriage
"I am so glad I am not from America guns, no abortion, no simple human rights like control of your own body it’s crazy"
If you don't want kids keep your lages closed 🔒. Abortion is only a choice for those who don't want to take responsibility for their action .
wait a min was that cat ears😂
Look at how many children in foster care.Look how many children are in the system already no one wants.Look how many children parents killing all due the parents didn't want.Why don't these people adopt these kid's give them family and a home?do they really think by overturning this will stop abortion? No it will not.Theirs going to still be a lot of abortions.Just not done in a medical office.But it will still happen.Who are them to tell women what they can and can't do to their body's.Our body's should not be in their hands/White house vote.My choice My body I choose.
Wonderful news.   Give the unborn a voice.  Do these people really believe that God will say the killing of an unborn child is ok?
"It's crazy how people struggle in USA to kill babies. I mean at their point things are fair cuz most of the ppl in their society are lack of self morale and discipline.

Why supreme court  so desperately want to bring a babies into the world when their parents are not ready for it. Who is gonna take care of those kids. I think this is all done to please the votebank of orthodox Christian community. Welcome to stoneage America.
"Women will continue to try to have abortions  as they did since of the begining of times , but now they will put their lives at risk , trying to do it themselves or  going to places that will do  it with metal hangers and die from infections ."
"Stupid young girls being happy about it .  Women will continue to try to have abortions  as they did since of the begining of times , but now they will put their lives at risk , trying to do it themselves or  going to places that will do  it with metal hangers and die from infections ."
No it wasn’t.  It was put in the hands of each state to decide.
life has indeed won! praise God
"Just because someone decided to abort there pregnancy doesn't mean it's easy. It's one of the hardest things to decide for yourself. It can be mentally draining, but if they feel like it's still the right thing to do then they should have THE RIGHT!!!!!  To decide if they want to do it. People who think it's just killing a life, aren't thinking of everything else."
All life should be protected
"American women should start going out more with colored men. Watch how quickly they will overturn the ban. 🤣🤣. Besides, colored men have bigger dingdongs."
"So America is going to listen to a bunch of religious extremists, sentencing countless women to death and trauma. Blood on SCOTUS' hands"
Thank fuck sanity prevails👏👏👍🏻
God is good!!!!
"As usual, the BBC has got their facts and their opinions all twisted. 
1.  The SCOTUS did not simply out law abortions across the country.  What they did is leave the decision to do abortions up to the individual states. 

2. There is NO PROVISION IN THE US CONSTITUTION GUARANTEEING THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION.  

What has happened to the BBC!?  Did you get bought out by CNN??
Get your facts straight, report only the facts, and stop trying to stir up fear and anger with your wild, unfounded opinions."
Now there will be millions of homeless  hungry babies
Great day for all those unborn children. God bless the Surpreme court.
"Recently, the CCP began to use its diplomatic power to explain its own faults to the world, and then demanded sympathy from all countries, and once again lured and bribed dignitaries from various countries. Don’t you know the essence of the CCP?  When he retreats, it is in exchange for time and space for the next attack. As long as he is soft-hearted towards him, he will have to move forward. Have you ever seen the gangster society?  As for Trump, if he takes office, he will bring the United States with him.  .  To hell, because he is a selfish person, he does not understand liberalism, he does not understand the spirit of the founding of the United States, the founding of the United States and the establishment of the Constitution, and can only say that he is a businessman.  And Pompeo is the future president who will truly lead the United States to the right path. For us foreigners, he will be a good president. He can maintain peace in the entire world because he has a righteous heart.  Today, China's banks and real estate are bound to each other. They have a set of funds, which they transfer around and support each other. As long as the people withdraw and run on the money, there will be a series of thunderstorms, because the CCP has no money and all bad debts.  It's all fake cover up."
Stop freaking out.  It's up to the states not completely abolished. BBC STOP SAYING THE RIGHT TO ABORT IS STRUCK DOWN!
"God bless u all , keep growing , 
Unite eachother 
Help each other"
Maybe if the Democrats didn't want to use abortion as political football they would have codified this during the Clinton Administration or the Obama Administration... I've heard political operatives say they would never pass it because it's too useful a weapon to use against the right.
"Reminder that this wont drop abortion rates, it will just mean more women die from unsafe abortions, and that's exactly what republicans want. Having this type of power over people makes these justices feel important."
"I’m not about abortion being used like candy but at least have exceptions like R word, insests, if having baby can kill the mom- like health situations. I’m sure women are would be more inclined to go for that. This is all population control - control that men are trying to get back. Cant believe being a woman is so hard today. This was a great way to move backwards. 😔"
"RED PILL FACT: If 'some' women were more responsible with their bodies, had some self-respect and respect for the unborn, abortion (minus rape/incest) would never exist. Mic drop."
Oh my god thank god I'm not living in the states I feel sorry for women who are now going to be forced by law to raise a child for all we know could be the end result of a rapist having his way with some poor girl imagine that looking at a child and seeing your attackers face! completely moronic country and the people celebrating that verdict only highlight that stupidity they have no idea what they've done IDIOTS!!!!
Anti-abortion is better than destroying the future generations of humanity.  Maybe our country will finally grown stronger again instead of weaker.
Those anti-reproduction rights gender traitors will be haunted by the deaths of women and children that this will cause.
you still van get them
US is the most advanced country in the world compared to the Europe because it does not cater to feminists hoes
Good job. Women with bad morals are protesting
Oh shut trump up.  He's only campaigning for votes.
I support the baby killers
"I want to hear how they are going to help the unwanted children, shelter, food, medical, education let alone family love. To grow up unwanted b& possible abuse"
So now I'm the criminal what you going to do charge me you going to charge me are you going to charge me for trying to push your asses to do the right thing make me a criminal at least I became a criminal for the right reason
"Bruh at least report correctly on the issue, Abortion is not federal banned it is now up to the States to regulate the issue."
Why is this headline news here in the UK. Who cares what the USA does. Dont see much coverage by the BBC of those that support the removal of the laws in question. Just another biased BBC low quality piece of journailsm
"the ruling simply puts the LAW to local  (state) lawmakers  ,  what  most news is NOT SAYING is the DEMOCRATS  control ALL 3 houses to MAKE LAW , but instead BLAME the JUSTICES who READ the LAW , why are they not doing what they preach ????"
"We are acting like these beings are an item u can cancel on Amazon. What determines your death? No pulse, then what should it determine at the beginning a pulse (heartbeat) it’s not a baby out the womb it’s been a baby since the heart beat.  These crazy people makes me 🤮"
First step to a responsible society  👏
"Too bad the title of the video is entirely misleading, they are not banning abortions, they are leaving it up the to the state to decide. Which is fair because some places believe that killing babies is ok and same don’t. California wackos want abortions up to 9 months don’t know if anybodys seen a woman 9months but she’s about to pop at the that point and you can kill it then. When are women gonna take the responsibility of  either wearing protection or don’t sleep with everyone. No common sense with these people. U can be poor and take care of children just fine I have several kids don’t make a lot and they are all happy and fine just gotta sacrifice. People that are for abortion up to 9 months is sickening. Do y’all’s homework and grow a heart"
We thank God.
Hmm American
This is all because of the f*** ing  Bible bashers
And thank you Guzman family Mexicans Latin Americans minorities majorities and everyone else for making this a priority when those administrative level offices didn't
"I'm so mad at this and i don't even live in America
I wanna choke every single one of those people who are defending this decision."
Decision as big as this decided by 9 people. Why do we have voting and elections? seriously
"Tens of millions of women in America do not understand where babies come from?
Contraception is cheap and available everywhere.
I'm sorry but abortion is NOT a form of health care nor contraception and those are still available to women."
Final justice for the  millions of unborn babies sacrificed to The Devil
Finally killings babies are over
"This is like the beginning of The Handmaids Tale 

Looks like we’re on a one way trip back to the dark ages"
"Paying to travel to a state where abortion is legal, is still an option. And much cheaper than 18 years of raising a kid. So if you want an abortion, remember the pregnancy was your “mistake”, accept the responsibility, fork up the money and stop bitching. By the way I support government provided contraception 
to all, NO government funds for abortion."
But at least I became a criminal for the right reasons
And my kid nobody wants to bring her to me nobody wants to give it to me and nobody wants to tell me whatever this I don't know what this stupid s*** is here I don't know how you guys shit works and since nobody will help me walk her to me something tell me what's going on I will become a criminal
President Trump knew what he was doing Biden is trying to cause conflicts with those countries no let's make sure that we unite those countries let's make sure that we unites everything that they wanted to cover up instead of making conflict with those countries let's all get in it together we're all the minor minority
"Don’t like it then don’t get pregnant 
Abortion is murder 
Not birth control for the irresponsible"
1:33 What an absolute Karen
Thank u for allowing comments
Not to mention the fact that you got shell corps baby turtles arent they illegal to sell
"""the HELL with SCOTUS, we will defy it""-Maxine waters (D) ca....a sitting member of congress said that!..
I wonder if she remembers  some other words she said...such as ""PRESERVE PROTECT AND DEFEND "".....IMHO ...spitting on your OATH OF OFFICE is a HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS....these ELECTED CRIMINALS  which are of this opinion  need to SIMPLY RESIGN  or be IMPEACHED....or simply  VOTED OUT!!"
This f****** administration they are covering up war crime sex trafficking they are covering up an international sex trafficking ring that is being fueled and funded by government agencies and offices
You kept my kid away from me for three years because you wouldn't give me my kid cuz you wanted a political insurance hits a surety bond 13 companies Miller real estate five star because you wanted to cover up your corruption but most of all you want to cover up covidian
"Sooo.....America makes abortion illegal because they argue they want to save the lives of future children, but yet America doesn't care enough about those children to change gun laws so they don't keep getting shot in schools. 
Got it."
Nary a word by mainstreams Dems about the children’s life in the womb.
I have an email where I believe was five to seven million dollars at States for a hit on me because it would appease many people in offices but they went to a bike to do it they just didn't know the minority is the majority you kidnapped my kid my kid you used because you were too worried about your corruption and your baby sex trafficking well don't worry you got the right one four and a half years didn't you lock me up send me to prison throw me the mental institution have the police beat me up because you wouldn't give me my kid
and i thought church and state was supposed to be seperate in the U.S. ....
Republic of GILEAD here we come..under his eye.
Don't I have that email
The fact that religious views of some has had a lot of influence on this massive decision is regrettable
Biden you should have did something about this board and you shouldn't have tried to hit me didn't you use a bike didn't your offices administrative level pay five to six thousand million dollars within your administrative level to put a hit on me to shut me up
This is the ugliest thing I've ever seen and I've never seen a goddamn administrative level office cover up something what I witness every f****** day my f****** kid has been kidnapped for 4 and 1/2 years because they wanted some goddamn money they wanted a political insurance hits
About time one step foward for conservatives
Do you know how many men are involved in this sex trafficking ring at the highest levels do you know that the southern district mayor of New York authorized for these people and these offices these Congressional offices to sleep with these women that were an institutions and then raped their children and this is all in a book and it is said that if it ever was to get out it would be politically controversial
The negation of abortion rights makes me feel as if we're moving backwards rather than forward
HAPPY DAY!!  WHAT A HAPPY DAY!!!  there is absolutely nothing in the actual US Constitution that expressly states a person can wholesaley murder a child!!
My kids are important and all these kids have been extorted sex trafficking thousands thousands of kids that have been killed at the hands of the administration at our borders that they have failed to do anything about it
"Yeah she HATES BLACK PEOPLE  and she KNOWS blacks make up over half of all abortions. 
Since 1973 over 19,000,000 black babies were aborted ... if those 19 million blacks were allowed to love then reproduce just imagine HOW MANY MILLION MORE BLACKS WOULD BE IN THE USA!!! probably enough to make half the population of America black by now... but deep down these politicians and crazy chalky ladies DONT WANT MORE BLACKS ALIVE"
Family planning resources should prevail.
These women mad they can’t kill babies.  Just strap up or keep your legs closed.  Stop being a hoe!!!
Close your legs and you won't need to murder your own baby.
Rocket man Mitsubishi bank kim jon ying
stOp ✋️ ⏹️ 🚏 🚦 🛑 🚥 killing babies
The people have won !
Israel jubilee bonds Israel dev Corp want it
Abortion is murder
You crying because you can't kill babies anymore f****** nuts
Baby killers mad and seething
"Those pathetic woke liberals have caused this with their gender fluid nonsense meaning that they can no longer define what ‘a woman is ! Feel the power of a conservative backlash you whining snowflakes !!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
What president
I'm happy with the majority of Americans who are making this happen
Keep your legs closed there won't be a problem
"In America considering the 63 millions of babies that have been killed by early ""termination"" something had to be done, obviously killing babies is not good. And sorry but it appears women don't seem to have the education to protect themselves and killing the babies has become the easy solution, I can't believe an American President can speech that killing babies is a right, whatever belief you are, I wish you well and all life on this beautiful planet."
"back to illegal abortion, at least now there is a chance the aborting woman dies in the process...2 flys in 1...HAha"
"I'm a WOMAN and am so pissed that these people say abortion is about women's right.NO, it is not. WOMEN  are naturally nurturers, care givers,protectors of life not killers."

"Welcome to Gilead,"
"I don't understand today's generation.... People have normalised sex and it has become a way of enjoyment. People nowadays take sex so lightly that it means nothing at all. If we consider sex as a holy gift of God to be enjoyed by married couple then there won't be any issue at all....
Abortion is mostly done by people who goes around having sex for enjoyment... In some cases, it's done by rape victims but mostly by people who take sex as a means of enjoyment.... If you are doing for enjoyment use protection. A condom won't cost you much. But for me having sex with multiple partner is not necessary at all... And sex don't prove your love for your partner, so say no to sex before marriage....
I am a Christian and I truly believe that sex is holy.

And the protesters here are not victims of rape or medically unfit to have babies.... They are protesting because they want to have sex with multiple partner and in case of pregnancy they want to go for abortion.."
why should a rape victim go through months and months of dealing with a pregnancy that she didn’t even want. women who wants kids talk about the struggle of pregnancy but they’re happy because they actually want the child so its a little easier to deal with everything that come with it. a child is a beautiful thing don’t get me wrong but for a rape victim they’re not gonna be thinking i have a miracle baby. no woman should ever have to conceive a baby that way. all they’re gonna think about whether they give up the baby or not is the fact that it’s a rape baby. and then what if it’s their very first child. idk bout you but i wouldn’t want my first child conceived by being a rape victim and forced to take care of it or give it up…that’s traumatizing…just saying.
Thanks for love of life Americans ❤️💕
Good job US. You're turning theocratic with every passing day.
There was never a Constitutional right to abortion you biased disgusting so called new organisation
"From what I can see, the point that is completely lost in this whole issue is personal responsibility.
If you check the numbers, one percent of abortions are a result of rape and half that for incest, next is medical reasons. That leaves irresponsibility for the rest. 
So, instead of threatening violence for the right to kill an ""unwanted"" baby that YOU created, how about being responsible with your body and your choices and don't get pregnant?  Not getting pregnant is very easy."
How dare these people in position of power think they have any right to tell a woman what to do with they own bodies ! Don't force religious beliefs on individuals wars have been caused by foolish people who claim they do things in GODS name if abortion is now illegal will every man going to be out in prison for masturbation cuz shit that's killing thousands of kids every time we orgasm pro life people are blind to the truth they constantly contradict themselves and in outlawing abortion they themselves raised the suicide rate pro life equals pro death smfh
And just like that the Democrats know what a woman is!
abortion mean killing/ murder and who support that it is satanic generation?
"If you don't want to have babies, don't have sex. Sex was designed primarily for procreation not for fun."
Still waiting for América to go full Nazi and invade Europe
"BBC is another liberal media which is known for distortion of the truth. First and foremost abortion is not enshrined in the american constitution. Secondly the judgement insist that abortion matters are solely states not a federal issue. Thirdly the judgement never banned abortion rather is specified a time frame in which abortions are permitted.
Why is BBC changing the narrative?"
"Life won today, indeed. 😊"
✅
"It was never a constitutional issue….. idiot, it was a state issue like it is now I was 15 now I’m 65 and lost my nephew   When I got out of the marine corps cuz my sister in law got one."
Everytime the left opens its mouth they vindicate the right position:  It is about human rights.  ALL HUMANS!!!
Thank your parents for not believing in abortions
Satan must be rejoicing right now! He’s managed to capture the souls of all of “god’s” little lambs. To the so called “Christians” just know that you’ve been suckered by the devil. These are the same people that would crucify Jesus were he to make an appearance today. Pathetic!!!
"I am a chinese and i am sad to say that in china ,we still dont have such law that can prevent us from stopping abortion. I am very happy to see that America walks in the right way and i hope one day in my country abortion can be illegal"
"Women not allowed a choice, Blacks  Africans that turn their back on their own culture and worship a white man's God. Pro lifers that want to keep the right to shoot people. Trans men allowed in women's sport."
Crazy people upset because they can't kill babies anymore.
Land of the free?
"This is one of the stupidest decision America has made this year. This is a personal issue, why is it politicized?"
"So many unreasonable adults out there....instead of wearing a condom,  or getting on the pill, or getting a vasectomy , you would rather have an abortion"
Snowflakes meltdown... Make America great again! From Serbia
"Use a condom, or birth control.  Stop being no, class sluts."
"I thought they were supposed to be the ""land for the free"" - don't seem to free to me... 1:29 I am very curious to know what ""devastation"" that person is talking about."
From what I can concern these horrible women can die doing illegal abortions...that'll rid US of horrid minds.
We in India has low rate of abortion
"Well, now that abortion is going away, maybe we can start focusing on banning religion next!  🤞"
I welcome
Will stop illegal sex..
Biden is a sad days for America.
Biden is a sad days for America.
Let me get this str8....It's ok for parents to kill their children? And its ok for Fathers to murder their children as well because they came from our ball sacks?
What the fuk have humans become? Abortion is murder. No person has a right to end life no matter what your fukin selfish excuses are.
The news anchor is wrong nowhere in the constitution does it mention abortion read the Constitution and the amendment
Liberals always look mentally ill 😂
"Enjoy going backwards SEVERAL 100 years MORONS.......ENJOY the Civil war that becomes a result of this, & WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING RELIGIOUS FREAKS, & you don't think it prudent to BAN GUNS........... YOU'RE ALL JUST PLAIN OLD STUPID"
Abortion is murder unless there is a threat to the mothers life or the child was conceived through incest or rape.
I wonder how many of Trumps girlfriend or flings he has given money to to have an abortion?  For shame to all of you that think he is a God fearing man.
Land of the free. 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
"Taliban country !
Next step : girls aren't allowed to go to school .God bless the USA ."
Women do have a right to birth control. Married or not. To kill an innocent baby just because momma failed to use contraception is not the babies fault. Abortion is legalize murder and should be treated as so ....
"The biggest killer of women around the periparturient period is suicide… sadly this I think will increase. 

Can’t help but feel if this affected mens bodies the result would be different. I’m glad Biden had common sense."
First why don't they fix the loose gun laws 🤡🤡🤡 USA
And they call themselves champion of Humans Rights 🤡🤡🤡🤡 USA
"Excellent news for the humanity, not to the abortion, not to the killing of innocent people, now USA win a moral standard, something that lost 50 years ago about the right to life. The politicians supporting the abortion will see the will of the people."
What are you talking about? These kids are human beings! They are alive!
Why do the right- to-lifers want to protect the unborn? They are not protecting or giving a better right to life to those born and struggling right now. The conservatives have stuck their middle finger up the hornet's nest one time too many.
Reality will dictate whether this judicial ruling will be progress or regress. I’m just here watching the future.
a poor law has been dismembered just like the clinics that only exist to chemically poison or dismember unwanted pre born babies
This decision was made by the Federalist Society that nominates all Republican appointed judges.
BABY KILLERS CRYING ABOUT KILLING BABY'S.
"Women's body...so let her decide plzz...if a child is born without her wish...the baby will go through hardships... what ever is happening in US is regressive...in the name of baby murder, you are actually snatching away the rights from the parents....plz put a ban on sex too"
They will not fully celebrate until women are not allowed to wear pants. Biblical theolgy ia taught in schools and being gay is made a crime in all 50 states. These people are insane
"America has once again proven itself to be the most backward thinking country of the civilised world. Land of the free?? I think not,land of the enslaved and brainwashed more like. Oh watch out for the invisible man in the sky
The let morons buy military grade firearms to kill little children in school, but don't let a woman make decisions about her own health and wellbeing.🤦🏻‍♂️🇺🇸😭 I weep for the women who have lost their freedoms today"
disgusting
What kind of country sets as its high mark those human rights practised in 1778?
Praise the Lord.  Evil people are losing ground
Next they make it legal to marry your dog

Now we need to repeal the 19th.
What a day now Americans got true freedom
Did the speaker of the House change the bathrooms in the White House so the pride man can walk in on her and ask for a kotex or a tampon just another opinion
I wonder how many of those pro lifers have adopted? Millions of kids no one wants. But we’ll just not mention that
"USA has very quickly turned into a shithole. Children routinely murdered in schools by crazy people with assault rifles, black people being assassinated in the streets by police officers and women being treated like second class citizens. If men had to gestate, abortions would be free and available on every street corner. Country is a complete joke."
"If you don't support abortion, then you support illegal abortion - that is what will happen, you may not like it, but the facts & evidence of history prove it."
This shows how backwards the USA is the right wing there is so hypocritical!
"So much seething in the comments section 😂 sorry ladies, no more killing your children at your convenience."
"It SELF RIGHTIOUS, to pride yourself on the dictatorship of other people's lives!!!"
"The right to murder isn’t something to,show off."
"Every one of the self righteous birth slavers should be FORCED to adopt a number of rape babies and children in the system, and pay reparations to the other children and families of women who died in childbirth or committed suicide after rape."
"Day after day it is proven that democracy and exces freedom fails, creat and magnify people differences to a point where we are at now in the US 
exces freedom brings a miss by destroying all good and moral values 
a society with out these moral values and red lines is a random society that suffer deeply , it's nothing but a broken everything"
"Hm...I don't care one way or the other, really, but dropping Roe doesn't seem like such a huge deal to me.  If you have so little personal responsibility that you can't keep from getting accidentally pregnant, just move to a state where the revolving door at the local abortion clinic is still open--easy fix."
"I noticed generally that no one is discussing the actual case, which I find a bit odd.  The draft opinion says regarding Roe:

“It relied on an erroneous historical narrative; it devoted great attention to and presumably relied on matters that have no bearing on the ‘meaning of the Constitution; it disregarded the fundamental difference between the precedents on which it relied and the question before the Court; it concocted an elaborate set of rules, with different restrictions for each trimester of pregnancy, but it did not explain how this veritable code could be teased out of anything in the Constitution, the his- tory of abortion laws, prior precedent, or any other cited source; and its most important rule (that States cannot pro- tect fetal life prior to “viability”) was never raised by any party and has never been plausibly explained.”

“Roe and Casey represent an error that cannot be allowed to stand.”

No one’s discussing the actual decision.  There is no right to abortion in the constitution.  It’s not a constitutional right.  The decision is logical.  It makes sense.  We can’t just project laws onto legal documents that aren’t there."
"I'm confused usa sent amry to war ,to protect dictatorships, to protect women , yet you've just done what Islamic state is, you pro life but yet your law also states you can legally make a women be sterilized, it's a total disgrace"
"Look forward to a decadent American society, no irony intended."
Make the hills have eyes abhorrent again!
"PRO ABORTION BARBARIAN MURDERERS WANT TO KEEP KILLING 300,000+ BABIES EACH YEAR!!!"
"Taliban: "" We are sh#t!"" 
American Supreme Court:"" Hold my beer""."
Glory to God... 🙏✝️✝️✝️
"women who are pro abortion saying it's my body and I have the right to do what ever I want with it , I say like it or not humans were created or found or made  males and females, females carry babies that is a given fact , you need to make peace with it and stop being angry about it , I agree it's your body so please take responsibility of it , and do not get pregnant to start with if you are not ready for it , I beleive this is a reasonable request and with little caution it can be achieved.
thanks"
Pro-Choice people can protest the US Supreme Court’s decision on Banning abortion all they want & until they’re blue in the face but the highest law makers in land made their decision it’s FINAL and it’s now CARVED IN A GRANITE stone slab and NO ONE could change it so it’s best for everyone to accept & honor it it instead of fighting it.
This happened in ethiopia
Its easy dont shag or use prophylactic's.
Looney left media does not report all the facts.  Abortion laws will be left up to individual states.  California and New York it will be abortion as usual. Nothing will change.  Read the United States constitution before you report. No amendment on abortion right shall not be infringed upon.
There are other ways to deal with unwanted pregnancy than to kill a baby! Killing is not the answer! Killing is not the answer!
"Glory be to GOD, the victory is the LORDs. Any female who wants to get a botched abortion deserves to die as they try to kill a defenseless baby, hoping they get caught and all who partake in it, go to prison you evil murderers. Just remember GOD always wins and you will reap what you sow."
You are the one who is removed mr. President. your words mean nothing to us
Ok. The Brits can now sanction the USA for its human rights abuse.
Bruh people say save life but when these children grow up they don't grow up with the love they should have most just get negativity and suffering
A rare W for america
"Years from now people will be denying they ever supported mass abortion deaths and stealing credit of its defeat from Christian movements, just like with abolition and alcohol regulations."
The only reason a woman would be against abortion is because she was brainwashed by religion. I just cannot see how that makes any sense whatsoever..
"Sarah Smith says the Court's decision, which she has obviously never read, is ""radical.""  If anything, Roe was the ""radical"" decision.  It propagated bald-faced lies about what is in the Constitution because seven male justices wanted to pass their policy off as part of our basic law.  The Dobbs decision is a simple retreat from that fraud.  During its five decades, Roe was never accepted by a unanimous Supreme Court, it was partly overturned in 1992, and the only thing shocking now is that three justices still claim it is partly sound."
Use condoms and birth control your liberals idiots
What God do you serve? God is against abortion!
Pro lifers want you to have the kid at any cost but you better not ask for social support services after the kid comes.
maybe a pro abortion woman should be called a mummy.
What the hell you protesting and crying about you flipping delinquents. You want to be adults and kill un born baby's but you don't wanna be an adult when having sex it's called use a condom or birth control 🤔 don't see how having abortion is easier then just to use a condom or birth control. Young lady you not 21 you are 12. Lol look at the people who want abortion bunch of clowns 🤡
"It amazing that humans who are alive can support abortion as if they fell from the sky.
Imagine if those who support abortion were aborted."
I dont know much about US culture but if abortion is legalised for medical reason if mother's life is in danger and not for women who cant keep their legs together and act responsibly then it should not be a problem.
'Right to abortion struck down...' That's one way of putting it. But how about 'Right to life for babies upheld..'  ?
as a society interest it's better not doing abortion but as individual it's high cost - unless we start to be more care for our actions and the government will help us  and close the gap
Are those women crying because they can't murder babies anymore?(disgusting human beings).
Teach young women to protect themselves if they don't want killing babies is not a choice is murdered.
"This is a great news.
Acknowledging the sanctity of life."
"Government are all for abortion so They will overturn this, give it a few months. It’s just gonna have women’s feel more accepting of it when they bring it back. Leading to more abortions than ever before! Shocking political tactic going on!! Dumb shit"
"Many ways to avoid children get your tubes tide, or use a condom. Killing a human is not a choice is murdered."
No abortions I agree 1million percent and I hope it happens all across America.Too all the fools protesting here you are marching the streets because you were not aborted even if life growing up was tough still here you are alive and well enough to march for killing an innocent child.If you women marching don't want children then remove your wombs and become a condom.No abortions is correct and jail time to the people causing these crimes.✊✌️
"Abortion is bad! Protect your sex, if you do not want kids."
"Abortion being banned in half the states, the same states who won't pass better gun control laws. So they're for life unless it's taken by a gun. 🤡"
Abortion shouldn't be illegal
It's hilarious to watch all these baby murder  getting upset and also don't forget to do your peaceful protest
clear to see whos side the bbc is on
We are DEVO
Forcing a woman to have a child Is wrong but I don't agree to kill innocent babies
All these signs were made over night? ??
The least safe place in the US is in a mother's womb. 1.5 billion unborn children have been  aborted in the whole world.
21 and scared of what?
Haha fuck that country
family is blessing
"abortion is Crime. 
God bless all Americans"
"And you guys wonder why, the rest of the world, think your systems are retarded"
"Horrible. I feel sorry for womens who are raped and forced to give birth, those who have a fetus with handicap , etc... I am so stunned that womens are pro with this crap. Mind blowing. Those saint Mary look alike , religious fanatics womens will regret it one day."
These idiot women  will never  win .The LAW have thec duty to  protect  the  baby 👶🚼🍼🤱🤰 if you were not  RAPE.
"Maybe contraception would be a better option than a vile abortion .My body my choice no that s gone ever since the vaccine green pass ,when their was no choice for those who wanted a choice ."
Implement consequences for people who are making these unwanted children over and over and maybe they'll respect sex more. I fostered a little girl who was her mother's 7th unwanted baby. I believe she needs a forced hysterectomy.
"Good. Why should judges make laws? In a democracy, the people elected by the voters should make laws. But the truth is that our elites don't want that: they consider the general population to be too stupid to make these decisions."
Pro-choice should have a option of getting cab just like animals so they won’t reproduce that’s the biggest worry
"Hey Joe Biden - how about fixing real problems, using this as a shadow to cover up the real issues impacting US Citizens today......
Biden says you ""US Citizens"" feel better today - how about the main voting population, retired - how do you feel now that you have lost 50% of your value / retirement funds, gas cost over double, food double, housing cost and interest rates out the roof, crime - all better right...
Inflation - All Time high in US History.
Fuel, Diesel that moves America - Highest in US History - DOUBLE - Remember Biden said he was going to shut down Fossil Fuels ""work it out"" - All Biden needs to do is Open up USA Energy 100% - Keystone Pipeline finish it, message it, reduce taxes on Oil and Gas, reduce limitations and regulations, promote and build infrastructure, new pipelines, refineries get going on this and message it, it will drive down futures cost of Oil per barrel / cost per gallon - no need for Tax Holiday or Gas Card - do your job...
Transporation / Production / Farming Cost up 100% due to Fuel Cost ""Diesel"" - this is just passed onto goods cost which you ""US Citizen"" pay...
Supply Chain Issues - never in the past have we had such issues with supplies, store shelves are empty / critical items gone or in very short supply - and with Fuel Cost so high, Truckers, Truck Companies are parking their trucks that will only add to the Supply Issues - AND JOE - Don't blame shipping increase cost 1000% - that is what it takes to fill up the tank with Diesel and that cost is passed onto goods that consumers purchase - called ECONOMICS, something you and Obama failed in....
Taxes - Joe looking to raise Corporate Taxes, where do you think Corporations get money to pay their taxes ""The sale of goods"" so if taxes go up, the cost of your end goods goes up ""Inflation"" - Biden does not understand Economics...
Interest Rates going up to all time highs which will just add to the Inflation as it will cost you more to purchase.
Joe going to pay off College Student Loans - 30% of the US population / making 70% pay for people that can't pay their debt - what do you get for free, do you get a check if you went to Trade School, or if you paid your college debt off in the past, what check will you get?
Border WIDE OPEN - Criminals just walking in, drugs flowing into our country harming our children / 200,000 deaths this year due to Fentanyl OD's, uncontrolled illegal immigration adding to the US deficit - No Border, No Nation - not enforcing the laws on the books - Cross at a ""Non"" entry point, that is ""Illegal Immigration"" go back to Nation you came from if you do not follow the process on our books - its call the Law that US Citizens have Voted for - Biden Enforce our Laws.
Crime out of control - DA's allowing criminals out on the street same day or days after committing a crime, Biden allowing this, US Citizens are not safe, Biden and his crew Defunding / Restricting the Police from doing their job...want to fix gun crimes (Do a crime with a gun, do the time, no early release, take someones life with a gun, you do life or death penalty, no release at all) this sets the example.............
Stockmarket crash - if your are retired, or looking to, well just keep working or go back to work, Biden does not care, you have lost half your funds thanks to Joe and his miss-management of the Economy.
Your Children - Forced CRT / BLM / Trans Sex Therapy / Trans Education being forced onto them at Schools without Parents Knowledge or approval - you have no rights, only the Teachers do....
International Standing in the World - at the bottom / Nations will not return calls to Biden...WOKE Military has shown Weakness and we now get no respect...Thanks to Joe..........
This is Biden's World that we are living in."
Simple things to deal with. Let every state to decide if it is ok ! This kind of thing can never be an issue in China and cannot image why it is so tricky in USA
"Shame on the Supreme Court.
A panel of 7 men should have NEVER had the right to vote.
Not you're body not your choice.
Ladies, if you need an abortion, I hear Canada welcomes you to visit.
They believe in women's rights."
I'm sorry but WHAT bloody right does a bunch of men and old at that have to tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies.. Communism here we come.. How blind can people be..
"This is what religion brings to your doorstep - war, destruction, segregation, authoritarian rule, dogma, just evil overall. 
Note that this entire thing was brought on , NOT by Muslims, or Hindus or atheists ….it was the christians ! 
Christians did this. Welcome to Christianity."
"What a misleading title. It does not ""strike"" down abortion rights. It simply says that it is not constitutional and gives it back to the democratic legislature.

It's a true pro democratic decision."
"America, what a shit hole."
Kinda sad when religion basically rules your country like in countries such as Afghanistan or back in the medieval ages.
Misleading title. They actually kicked the abortion decision back to the states.
"Châu chấu, những dòng sông nước chảy như máu, bệnh dịch, hạn han, lủ lụt , các điềm lạ, động đất.. là báo hiệu tận thế

"The Headline Should Read ""Right to MURDER struck down by US Supreme Court"".
THIS ISA A VERY WELCOME AND HUMANE DECISION!!!  THE MASS SLAUGHTER OF BABIES MUST STOP!!!
Roe v Wade was an EVIL, ANTI-HUMAN, PRO-NAZI, PRO-INFANTACIDE, PRO-GENOCIDE and SATANIC DECISION!!!
To See FEMIN-NAZI'S Crying in our Streets Because  The Courts have RESTRICTED THEIR RIGHT TO MURDER!!!  Is a Sickening Sight!!!  Their Mendacity  Is Incredible!!!"
Really this is a slap on the face of women all over the world.
To bad for the baby killers.
"If you're like me you're scrolling the comments for the words "" spock ears."""
Good 👍
"If women stop having sex. Will that put their lives in danger? Nope.  Plus they won't kill a new life. 
There you go.
Sex is for married male husband and his female wife anyway - Mark 10:6-9"
Shame shame shame!! 🤤😡
Right to abortion is like the right to murder
"It's all about there life all about them self and useing the word of its my ""body"".. Guess what britches GOD IS FIGHTING BACK FOR THE RIGHTS OF BABY'S..cos they are people too only little ones."
The republicans are such hypocrites it’s sickening. This decision (ironically) has nothing to do with life. These people voted for Trump which clearly says they are not playing with a full deck of cards. This decision has set America back….and more is to come. These Republicans may not be that bright but the combination of power and ignorance left in their hands is entirely dangerous for this country.
Amazing !! 🙌🏻❤😀 This is going to save millions of babies👶👶👶👶
It's still legal...stop freaking out
Jeez I seriously hope god doesn’t condone this stuff 🤦‍♂️
KILLING BABIES IS NOT A RIGHT LADIES !  WHAT WOMAN  HAS A RIGHT TO MURDER BABIES !
"I don't really understand why most ppl seem to be against it. Even though there's still 15 weeks for ppl to decide whether they want the baby or not. 
it's not 15 days, it's 15 weeks, almost 4 month. the baby would grow up to human shape and be able to move inside the uterus. How could anyone even consider doing such horrible thing? if you really have difficulties raising children,use protection. if it's an accident, hey you still have like 3 months to decide starting from tje late period.
if anyone consider himself/herself    a human being, start to act like one. instead of shouting for the 'freedom' that you wasn't supposed to have as a human being."
"Pretty obvious that Brits do not understand our Constitution. Since abortion is not mentioned in the Constitution it is not one of the enumerated powers granted to the Federal government. Therefore, under the 10th Amendment abortion falls ""to the States or to the people"". This ruling is actually MORE democratic that the arbitrary dictate imposed by Roe vs Wade."
"They could at least have made exceptions for victims of sexual abuse, incest, and when doctors know there is like 90% chance of Downs syndrome.

 But honestly i am not so sure normal healthy pregnant women should have a right to free surgery for a self inflicted condition that poses no health risks. How can killing a healthy fetus be part of the Hippocratic oath of treating the ill and doing no harm? If a woman have a right to an abortion a doctor should also have the right to say no, id rather spend my precious time treating cancer and bullet wounds than perform unnecessary surgery on the healthy."
Thank God 🙏🙏 thank you for delivering little baby's from the hand's of monsters
Human Rights should include all humans. And for those who would dehumanize the unborn...you're one step closer to being dehumanized by others who think you have no value.
I don’t see them adopting any new borns they just want live baby’s so they can have dead aoilders
Does BBC and its audience understand that the United States is a federation of States and what that means in light of the 9th and 10th Amendments to its Constitution?
Hi
"Once I was Pro choice,  As I become older however, I became aware how precious the  Life is. I saw the people dying in combat, I saw the people dying in this Pandemic covid-19, especially youngone that they can not help themselves. I realized that LIFE is PRECIOUS and is given ONLY ONCE, and need live it to the FULLEST. In that regard,  I rethought of  the value of life, that everyone, even unborn human being called FETUS has RIGHT to live, and giving a CHOICE to them to choose to live or die, that is the True Pro Choice. I am now Pro life. I have message for pro choice women and  If one is against unwanted pregnancy, first and foremost use caution in mating, and if that did not work or was in  a situation, it can't be exercised,  consider adoption rather than killing a baby unborn child. Yes we need change the law but not the legalizing a murder.  In that regard, we need  make it easier for mothers with unwanted child (and up to child under 5 )  to put up for an adoption and make it more easier in general adoption. That is responsibility of Law makers, up until now law makers; they choose easy way out by legalizing murder. Now they need gather and go to work."
Anyone else noticed that the two women at the beginning are ones that no man would ever be physical with
So glad Trump decided to elect those three judges! #LifeWins #AdoptionSavesLives #BabyLivesMatter oh and by the way.. with great pleasure comes great responsibility!
"I m from Brazil where abortion is prohibited since always  thousands of women do illegal abortions without safety or healthy care,thousads are arrested more than 50 thousand a year. brazilian press never talk about this subject  something like ""dont  ask dont tell"". The problem is not going to disappear women will keep seeking abortion too much hipocrisy and religious bullshit.thats a men world we know since early childhood.Free women around the world!"
"This is a strike against women. Period. It's about power and control, solely. The right to freedom of choice, for anything for women - let's be honest, is devastated by this ruling. Ugly. Gillead in on our doorstep."
What we will never hear is Biden say that something has gone his way.
What I don't understand is why are they over turning this. How bad was it that they need to overturn it? Was this really a problem now days?
"Why does the law in the USA consider the murder of a pregnant woman a Double Homicide if an unborn  baby is not yet a ""life?"""
"How many of these woman protesting against abortion will (or have) adopt a child from an orphanage? Reality is if woman who cannot (or mentally refuse to) take care of a child, now that they can't make an abortion they'll just leave the kid. And unfortunately staticaly not a lot of children get adopted and the ones who don't are kicked out of orphanage at the age of 18. Unfortunately statistics for these young people is not good. So yes sure protest for life but this decision will lead to a lot of young people having not so good of a life."
I love Europe!
"everyone has the right to move to another state.if abortion is important for you there a a dozens of states that are better suited for you. 
please respect the courts ruling. it was a democratic decision by a bipartisan elected court."
"Oh God. More fact lite partisan bullshit from the BBC. Color me surprised 🤣 
REALITY CHECK : MOSTLY FALSE. The SCOTUS has ruled that the Federal government has no right to impose this poorly written, unconstitutional law. It's up to individual states to decide. In California, New York, Oregon, Alaska you can abort your baby right up to the point of birth. As its head emerges you can cut it off b/c it's still not human. Most US states had laws permitting abortion up to 30 weeks. Now they are free from Federal control. Allowed to set the limit themselves. People can actually vote locally to change those limits. It's called DEMOCRACY."
"I can not understand the government!

In Germany it is so, that one may carry out an abortion only then,
if since conception (fertilization) no more than twelve weeks have passed. 
This corresponds to the 14th week of pregnancy.
The meaning behind it is, that namely after expiration of this period, the protection of the unborn child takes effect and must be ensured. (according to the Federal Constitutional Court)

Now the discussion about the deletion of paragraph 219a of the Penal Code (StGB) which then allows doctors on their website, to advertise for abortion to be allowed to perform, and accordingly.

With the new government since 12/2021 in the office is and not from conservative members consists, I am sure the paragraph 219a is abolished.

It belongs as I mean, to a liberal society that one may feel freely about it.
But it is also due to the principle of protection of the unborn child, as soon as the 14th week of pregnancy passes. 
This should not be changed.

I am happy that we have here, as one of the few countries in the world, a ""Federal Constitutional Court"", which alone has the right to decide on such morally difficult questions.
Also private persons can sue for their right.
As the highest court that stands above all courts, its judgment is unchallengeable.
One talks in Germany also of ""residence/city of the right"" or ""there I go up to Karlsruhe"" (in order to assert its right) (Karlsuhe = name of the city where the court is).

Poor people and mentally deranged should not have babies period...i know this firsthand...however the const really does not say anything about abortion so the roe law had no basis...which is why they reversed it. And now each state will enact their own laws which is how it should be...if u don't want kids...2 options...close your legs or drive over state line like CA and they will do it for free i imagine so they can take the fetus and do stem cell research on it for their miracle drugs.
Killing black peoples is murder.  That’s why I don’t listen to YP.  They say abortion is murder but killing black people isnt?
"The manosphere and their pick-mes must be jumping for joy at this ruling. Gone will be those 5, unholy decades when desirable, fertile women with better jobs, better education and more fulfilling and diverse sex lives, would run around free in both choice and options, and unburdened with both childcare and deadbeat husbands! Because misery sure loves company, especially with the chance to pull our said attractive heroines down a peg or two off their pretty perches!

Seriously, it's the jealousy and resentment from the unfulfilled and unhappy people in society who would want to put women back to biblical times.  Sheesh"
"We're taking this country back from you limp wristed leftists.

I wanna put my hands on them so bad
"I find it funny how even after banning abortions, conservatives never had a plan to prevent possible situations where abortions are needed from happening like free contraceptives, more and better sex Ed in schools, funding families and mothers who didn’t want a child and can’t afford one, improving the foster care and adoption system and making penalties for rape more severe especially if the rape results in an unwanted child"

"THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH WORLDWIDE 
IS KILLING UNBORN BABIES 
THAT DID NOT HAVE A CHOICE"
"This is the  greatest verdict ever given by the supreme court in the States. Abortion is deplorable because it means killing. To those who endorse abortion, i would say that you have no right to kill somebody for your own pleasure. That said, the victims of rape and those who have to undergo an abortion on medical ground, have to be exempted from this law."
"So much for the ""land of the free"".. more BS !"
Hahaha you making me laugh stop westing people time to cover body parts stealing crime
"IF YOU DO NOT WANT A BABY DO NOT MAKE ONE 
IF A BABY IS CONCEIVED BY VIOLENCE GIVE THE BABY UP FOR ADOPTION 
A RAPEST DOES NOT GET THE DEATH PENALTY"
"12-weeks is a good determination point on deciding whether or not to continue the pregnancy. That is the point where the fetus thereafter gains consciousness and the point where a woman is able to assess elements like drug addiction, health, social climate or whether her child should be forced to live in dirt poor poverty and low-life quality, etc. Now that Roe is struck: population will Explode in ranks of those already poor who are already struggling and/or unable to have basic human needs and facing homelessness at it is now, let alone there being any hope of their kid going to college and prospects for anything other than existence' and being dirt poor and on welfare from birth to death. Once upon a time centuries ago it was OK to flood the Earth with population unchecked and now this population has wiped out the rain forests and I predict the strain on 'water will be the next; As human population increased to today's level God gave abortion to man to remedy & control his numbers.   take a look at the situation with Lake Mead for instants then 'go ahead and crank out another several million babies beyond the capacity of our planet."
"Republicans love fetuses not children. They vote against everything that helps poor children, they call it Socialism."
"The states will decide, which is a right thing"
"The constitution makes no mention of abortions, mam 🤦"
Me and my dad had a long conversation about this last night. He even mentioned it was a very emotional day at work because of this setback. (He was at work when this happened.) It is very saddening to think that they also might even take away LGBTQ rights.
"It’s not your land, it belongs to the Native people."
"No one has the right to tell a women what to do with their body.  Get rid of everything in Washington, the are not for the people.  Don’t you get it, this he’s way beyond abortion rights. They are causing chaos so they can get total control."
The solution is easy. Stop voting for the American Taliban (Republicans).
"Having a child born or not is the right belongs to the woman because it only affects her health and her life. Why do they have to waste time considering that law when there are many other things that need their attention, things that affect life of many people (like guns or petrol)?"
How about telling all the women and girls to stop opening their hairy legs and having sex without protection? There are consequences of your actions.
"Responsible sexual contacts.  In case of crime related cases, woman's life is medically in peril from pregnancy then abortion maybe justified.  A offspring has right to life too."
"WHAT IT MEANS TO FOLLOW CHRIST IN IRAN:
The Iranian government is among the most oppressive regimes in the world. It is illegal to leave Islam, and Christians face the constant threat of imprisonment and being falsely charged with “acting against national security” for owning Bibles or even talking about Christ. Christians are routinely fired from their jobs, and it is difficult for a known believer to find a job or rent a home. Many Christians gather in secret fellowships and receive teaching through Christian media smuggled into the country and through broadcast media. Several Christians are currently imprisoned, and many others are under house arrest awaiting sentencing.

ACCESS TO BIBLES:
It is illegal to own, print, import or distribute Bibles. Since they are so difficult to obtain, Bibles are treasured by Iranian believers. Few have their own copy of God’s Word. Give Bibles"
"Only 25% of the American population believe that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances, if any GOP member tries to do that they will fail miserably"
"The country is riddled with problems like homelessness, drug addiction, and poverty and these sanctimonious judges have no idea how the overturning of Roe vs Wade will impact on the lives of millions of women. They're a bunch of dinosaurs, idiots  who turn a blind eye to an obviously corrupt ex president and his cronies and claim to have God on their side in making this decision. 
They are bible thumping,  heartless and privileged. They didn't need to do this. They did it because they wanted to and because they could.
  Only a woman forced to make a choice when confronted with an unwanted pregnancy can understand the consequences of and bear responsibility for an abortion. It is a personal matter. 

Government should not intervene but give every assistance possible to help women who find themselves in the position of  having to make that choice come to the right decision, do what is best for them.
Is it harder for a woman to give a baby up for adoption than have an abortion? Perhaps.

Many wealthy  couples in America who have fertility issues will be clapping their hands because there will be more babies available for adoption. For sure there will be a market for discarded offspring. Whose interests are being served here?"
"I do not agree with an abortion ban, nor do I side with feminists who honour an abortion. I am against a blanket ban or a complete authorisation for abortion.

Aborting a children at the first trimester should be legal, after that should be banned. Most of the abortion happens before the 12th week anyways.

At the time, the child is not really a child yet, and it gives the women the rights to choose.

The left and rights both have their agenda, which I loath. But this overturning should be expected because it has no legal ground of that, the state should’ve made legislations in the past."
I feel sorry for the rape victims and those at medical risk. But the fact that you can just get pregnant and then kill a life that depends on you for survival is wrong.
USA going backwards
"The problem? No problem...
 far too many people
 with far too little to do
 with far too little education and/or critical analysis skill
 with far too many glib opinions and untested assumptions
... being governed by people with the same credentials."
"Gosh, so much foreign news on Johnson's BBC."
"In India,  you can abortion even at  24 weeks.if the baby is unhealthy or mom sick they should do the abortion. It not murder. Every women not going to abort the baby after got pregnant. Pls don't ban women rights."

A wonderful step forward!!!

"''Losing the right to abortion....''    How about they might actually consider the idea of avoiding pregnancy in the first place?   Why is no-one addressing this question?   Or is that too difficult for their tiny minds to comprehend?   These selfish, ignorant women don't seem to think it incumbent upon them actually to PREVENT unwanted pregnancy.   

(Few pregnancies are the result of rape, which is a different question.)"
whats next... make it illegal to have sex before marriage?
This shows how many people were getting abortions because they had to be turned away..❤
All these morons are angry because they can't go around and have unprotected  sex anymore 🤣🤣
"When these children are starving. When these children of suffering from life without parents.  When they suffer at the hands of parents who were forced to provide them with life and are nowhere close to ready to have kids. When they are abused by the profiteers of the defenseless (human traffickers).  You best believe I will be there to remind you of your abject failure. I will make sure you know that simply living is not life.  Not for a human being. Not for someone who has the conscience understanding of the hell in which they live. There will now be millions that suffer. Not just the woman that is raped and you believe that to be by divine province, you sick twisted rats.  The people who will suffer are those who will be abandoned not only by their mothers but by the society that forced them to live and then blamed them for not being good enough."
Actually makes me sick and I’m not even American- it’s just so wrong
I think this a sad backward move for women. Every woman should have the right to her decision regarding her own body.
"Aight, I’m moving to Britain"
"Abortion is killing.
That's a murder."
Some people here wants to kill babies because they don't want them to live a hard life. Like wtf?
Nazi America.
1973 was the year i was paralyzed in an accident and abortion was legalized by the Supreme court. 2022 the Supreme court reversed that decision and I am happy. I wish the Supreme court would reverse my paralysis. I'm getting tired of hurting everyday.
Be aware: The Lude Media is a traitor of America!
Glory to God 🙏💫
This is simple… it’s about the court saying the abortion issue is up to the States. Each state shall determine how they want to manage the issue of abortion. If a state wants to limit abortion to medical emergencies then they have the legal right to do that. If Congress wants to pass a law concerning abortion then they will need the necessary votes in the House and Senate.
Divided States of America strikes again in 2022. What will 2023 bring?
Fifty years of murdering children has come to end .congratulations  to America .
A fetus isn’t conception. Just saying.
Insurgents will riot and should be treated as traitors.
More propaganda from MSM. You can still kill babies in certain states.
You know this is a line in the sand. There is no compromise. You’re either ok with killing babies or you’re not ok with killing babies. And it seems like these 2 sides cannot co exist together. One side is peaceful and the other side is violent.  Women’s healthcare.   This is a lie right from satan himself

"For a country that constantly barks to the world about its freedoms and rights, the USA does not have: 1) a constitutional right to housing & 2) a constitutional right to abortion. Instead, they prioritise their right to own an AR-15 (above such rights) even after the massacre of children in schools. What a backward, uncivilised shit hole."
"You should get your facts right. Abortion has not been denied,it never was in our Constitution, it simply says that the states should decide by the people of that state. Check your facts."
"People who advocate pro-life anti abortion sentiments should be forcibly sterilised... 
Lets see how they feel about their human rights being removed."
A nice step back toward the stone age .. Good job america.. maybe the Condom mafia got too strong..

Damn and i tough my country was bad  . . . America 0 - Romania 1
Women should just have sex with women then.
"Life wins, life has the final word. Abortion kills innocent lives. It s not about women's bodies, it s about the body of innocent little fetal infants.  Those who are chanting 'my body my choice' on abortion are the very same who refused to chant ' my body my choice' on masks and vaccine. If only logic was what they were after. Abortion is murder, stop it!!"
The only right that will remain is the right to shoot 8-year-olds. Crazy country.
are democrats now usingbunborn children to get the power to outlaw courts and emotional manipulate to vote   for them in the midterms ? anyway timing is perfect just before midterms
"But you can kill kids in school with guns in the U.S. and nobody really cares, Idiots still have guns."
What's right with America these days? Nothing.
We do care that's why murder is illegal
are the pro-lifers carrying guns?
They only made it legal to cut back on black ppl and save money on state aid
Women are not happy cause they cant terminate pregnancies due to inconvenience. You have to now think about before you shagg someone
"These babies get to be born into a country as poor, aimless, health system-less people with a gun in their hands waiting to be shot at their schools...good job America...."
Just reading this comments. Reminds me i made the right choice not to ever live with you guys. Enjoy your next 20-30 years of full orphanages & broken families (broken both economically and emotionally) I’m italian still you guys beat us on retro/Cristian mentality…
"Fake news! The supreme court cannot grant rights or remove them.  The infants constitutional right to life ,liberty and pursuit of happiness was upheld."

A life has a right to life
Noooo all the womans have the right to kill their own unborn childrens!!!!!
No more murders
"USA IS THE DUMBEST AND THE MOST STUPID COUNTRY IN THIS F. WORLD
AND I KNOW A LOT  STUPID COUNTRIES
How can a country be so technologically advanced but at the same time live so much in the Stone Age?"
Not true
If that's to control the raising amount of early teen Pregnancy then its good.
"very sad people can't take care of themselves they want to kill the unborn, abstain if you can't take care"
"As Clarence Thomas already stated in his opinion, I'm afraid, this is probably only the first of many serious blows this court will hand out against civil liberties in the US. Everything is at stake: gay rights, contraception (meaning every single form you could think of), even voting rights as a whole and civil rights of minorities. And the gloating demeanor of Republicans about this rule leaves little doubt that this is about anything else than domination and throwing the other side into unconditional submission. They will evidently stop at nothing to achieve this, and they literally got away unpunished after attempting a coup."
"ITS NOT TOTALLY REVERSED BBC. IT MEANS THE INDIVIDUAL STATES NOW HAVE THE POWER TO BAN OR KEEP  ABORTIONS. 
UNLESS THE PERSON  WAS RAPED, ITS MEDICALLY NEEDED, THEN LEARN TO HAVE SAFE SEX, THERE IS CONDOMS,  SPERMICIDE GELS,  MORNING AFTER PILL ETC."
The religious freaks are on the rise and have the initiative. The fight back must begin.
"Brilliant news, if u dont want children then don’t have sex out of situations where you don’t want children. If u are raped or incest I agree in abortion but only up to 12 weeks as it is murder."
"As Abraham Lincoln might have said, now is the time to heal the wounds and help women and children."
I am supposed to take a woman wearing a cat costume with spikes around her neck seriously. Halloween is in October. Just saying...
United States of Islam. No rights for women. Take the vote away from them.
"Welcome to North Korea, oops, I mean USA, where unelected 9 that stay for life can strip away human rights from half of the country’s population. How embarrassing!"
Those American judge who voted for disqualification of abortion respect God.
Repent before its too late
You are alive because your mother did not choose abortion.
*The TRUTH Will Find A WAY.. Thank You LORD…🙏🙏🙏💖🙏🙏🙏*
Abortion is still legal. It's up to each state what is legal and what isn't.
"Stop the industrial levels of infanticide!  Well done, SCOTUS!"
"Abortion is not a constitutional right,  it is upto personal interpretation. Gun right is (2nd Amendment)."
Death is not the worst of all evils
"These days, American exceptionalism means moving away from what the civilized world considers progress."
America is a hell of a scary place. I will never visit such a pro gun and anti women country. Ya’ll are backwards.
If safe sex was practiced there would be little need for so many abortions. Ironic how freedom means freedom to have casual sex and also freedom to abort babies. We've lost all sense of self control.

Only woman has full right over her sexual organ and consequence of its usage...
"If you can afford to pay for an abortion as often as it seems most of you have abortions you can definitely afford to drive to another state if your state has restrictions. If you don't drive, buy a bus ticket, it's a small percentage of the cost of an abortion."
America a country of dangerous religious nut jobs.. if only they had oil so we could all invade and liberate them
Fuck me just pure delusion glad I’m from the uk where if an innocent girl is raped she doesn’t have to keep her abusers baby
Idiots 🤦‍♀️
"Well, the title is so misleading. The right to abortion is not struck down by this ruling. What this ruling means is that the decision (whether to ban or limit the term of abortion to a certain number of weeks during pregnancy) is up to the states' legislature to decide."
Stem cell research had come along way from abortion
America fucked!They must have the dumbest populace on Earth.
Doesn't the US have more pressing issues than abortion?

Wow wow wow wow wow. This is the decision from the Lord against the innocent blood that is being shared
😂😂😂😂 how usa will now lecture the on human rights and freedom
America's version of Christianty is closer to extremist islam/cathlotisism than any semblence of humanity.
Your country does care about you moron's it just isn't letting people with multi coloured hair tell them what to do.
They loves unborn babies as long as they're not Mexican
pregnancy is extremely dangerous for humans compared to other mammals. the reason so many women die from child birth is not the Abortion it is because it is quite dangerous for a woman to give birth. and alot of women do die in child birth even when the child survives.
"If you're 'pro life' you should also be a vegan to make sure you're not contributing to the suffering and murder of innocent animals who are considered life and have nerves like people so they can feel pain. You should also be living off grid in a self sustainable commune so as to make sure you don't contribute to an economy that relies heavily on the destruction of eco systems, not to mention our planet.

But no, it's nothing to do with protecting life, it's about being a religious nutcase."
"البابا غنوج بتاع al darknessh  الأرثوذكسية المصرية مارس الجنس مع عدد كبير من الأفراد الذكور من صغار جماعتة 30 تقريباً (البابا غنوج هو إسم شخصية حقيقية وليس مجرد إسم أكلة .. من حولت إسمة لأسم أكلة هي راهبة اُعجبت بما بفعل غنوج ومن شدة أعجابها بة وصفتة بالــ""نهم"" وأطلقت إسمة على أكلة عملتها قال""عشان يفتح النفس"")   
والدوم فرولو أيضا فعل كغنوج مع واحد منهم

وبابا darknessh كان يسمى ""نويل"" 

وواحد منهم من مصر ذو قصة مشابهه تماما لقصة ""فرولو"" لكن الأختلاف ما بين القصتين أنة ذهب قبل أن يفعل إلي أب الغلام ليستأذنة قبل أن يفعل (وأب الغلام كان إمام مسجد) فقال لة أب الغلام ""مالي بية أذا كانوا سموة جرجس أو بطرس يبقا مالي"" قال لة هــ""كذا"" قالة ""كذا"" (وكذا دى كلمة عيب متتقالش)  .. وفى الآخر جالة أنهيار نفسي عندما عرف إن هذا الغلام كانوا سموة على أسم أبية .. يعنى كانوا سموة على أسمة ولم يكونوا قد سموة جرجس أو بطرس 


وبعد الحكاية بتاعت غنوج دي ذهب الذين مارس الجنس معهم إلي تياتروهات كانت موجودة في أيام الملك (يعنى منذ ثمانون سنة) ومارسوا الجنس مع بنات منهم كانت تغنى مونولوج""الحق والحرية روح الوجود هما جناحين الصعود والهبوط"" وخلفوا منهم أبناء هذة الأبناء بعتوها بعيدا ليقرأوا قرآن في المقابر مع الجماعة بتوع ""حملة تطهير المقابر"" ولبسوهم شيوخ وحولوهم إلي أئمة .. اللى هما الأئمة بتوعوت سنة vs  شيعة والنقاب والأرهاب و مسلمين vs نصاري ويهود .. اللى هما دلوقتى بتوعوت عرق السواحل والصاروخ أو الجهاز الأمريكي المتطور و""ماكس مان "" 

والخومينى أيضا أرتكب نفس الجريمة(مارس الجنس مع صغير من صغار جماعتة وهو قريب لة أبن أخت أو حفيد)  
و الشيخ ياسين مارس الجنس مع ""أحمد الدرّة"" .. 
و ""البخاري"" مارس الجنس مع ""مسلم"" عندما كان ""مسلم"" صغير .. بالظبط مثلما فعل الباباوات غنوج ونويل وفرولو 
والإمام ""محمد بن عبد الوهاب"" ليس له نسب وهو مجهول الهوية ومجهول النسب 
والحقيقة وراء نهاية الخلافة الأسلامية في تركيا ليست إن ""كمال أتاتورك"" أراد أنهاء الخلافة بل إن هناك إمام في ""آيا صوفيا"" مارس الجنس مع فرد صغير من صغار جماعتة.. ""كمال أتاتورك"" لم يكن يعرف هذة الحقيقة
والحقيقة أيضا وراء تغيير الهوية العربية في الأندلس وعودة الأندلس إلي أسمها القديم ""أسبانيا"" هو ثورة شعبية حدثت علي شيوخ الإسلام بسبب إشاعة أنهم ""حشاشين"" .. ولكن الحقيقة هي ليست إن الثورة حدثت بسبب إن شيوخ الإسلام حشاشين بل الحقيقة إن هناك واحد من إئمة الأسلام مارس الجنس مع فرد صغير من أفراد جماعتة . 

والحقيقة أساساً وراء تغيير أسبانيا لهويتها الأسبانية أول مرة وتحويل هويتها إلي هوية عربية وتغيير إسمها للأندلس قبل ٨٠٠ سنة من عودتها إلي أسمها القديم .. هو قيام راهبة  كانت تعمل خادمة في بيت الملك الأسبانى بوضع السم في طبق من التفاح والكمثري وتقديمة إلي طفلة ""بنت الملك"" علي سريرها .. ولكن الطفلة نجت من محاولة الأغتيال بأن أكلت الطبق إلي سناجبها اللى كانت مربياهم وبحلول الصباح فوجئت بتسمم السناجب 
لقد كانت الراهبة تأمل أن يشك الملك في أخية بأنة هو من سمم أبنتة لأنة كان بينة وبين أخية مشاكل اُسرية حول أحقيتة في الجلوس علي العرش بدلاً منة

هؤلاء الناس لم يعودوا موجودون والرسام فرانشسكوغويا رسم غالبية رسومة تتحدث عنهم 

والرسام ""فوسيلي"" رسم أيضا لوحة من اللوحات تتحدث عنهم وهي لوحة الثلاثة نساء الشمطاوات الغريبة .. واحدة منهم هي راهبة الغنوج وواحدة منهم حاولت أغتيال الطفلة الأميرة الأسبانية بطبق مسموم والثالثة الأخيرة هى واحدة مثلهم .. لقد رسمهم ""فوسيلي"" الثلاثة كلهم مثل بعض كأنهم أمرأة واحدة (أمرأة مجرمة واحدة)"
The BBC should be pro or against abortion but the BBC is clearly pro abortion and that is not news it's pure and simple activism.
What the hack is going 😳?
Trump’s strategic planning is on some next level
There trying to take our freedom rights and what’s next we already keep track of us but yet millions of people are homeless children being abused left behind in currupted foster care and people keep buying guns and killing taking peoples life’s you tell me what’s wrong in this picture
"The reality is that this decision is from the Supreme Court.  They are the final arbiter for the entire country.  This cannot simply be repleaded like a Bill in a special session of Congress, or a revoked with a Executive Order.  It can only be reversed with another abortion case from the ground up in a local court.  In other words it will take years for this to actually change."
Fu** sake why are these people trying to kill young babies.
The left and Democrats don't like it when it doesn't go there way and they cry 😢 about it.
America needs to start tackling real problems like Affordable Housing Of which there is none for minimum wage single men. Women only have to have kids and they are set up until the new born is 18 yrs old. Sort out free hospitals like the rest of the civilized world. And make social housing a real thing that is accessable to the homeless. The mentally Ill poor and the poorly educated become homeless. It is not only predictable and a should be a human right to a place to sleep. And dont get me started on guns! Holy shit!
Enshrined !!??? clearly not !!!!!
The problem with America is its full of Americans
Quite likely something to do with the rights of the child. BBC you need to report news without bias.
America is a broken country
"Why do they always focus on the absolute minority? Ie incest, rape etc. The overwhelming majority of women getting abortions are sleeping wrecklessly with men. They should stop being a slut and get their priorities straight."
All women in the USA should stop having sex until this law is changed.
this is a woman's problem and should be left up to the woman and man should ask them self's  if there wife was giving birth and they where ask it is the wife or the baby's life which one would they save ?
"Sorry but your country is going backwards, when mostly men, and some of them are that old they wouldn’t have a clue what sex was about, decide that it’s illegal to have abortions then there is something sadly wrong. What a disgrace."
So they cry and cry when it  doesn't go  there way but you told if you don't have the vaccine you're killing everyone.🥱🥱🥱
Choose two methods of contraception? Choose to not sleep with anything and everything? Choose life? Lots of choice still out there……. Where does it say in the “constitution” that women have the right to murder their unborn?
Republicans desperately hoping stripping peoples freedoms away will give them some whataboutism ammunition whenever Jan 6 is mentioned. The simple fact they dont care about living people proves the concern about the unborn is a lie.
Based decision
Conservatives have blood on there hands
"They pretend to save (unborn) lives while risking those of the living mothers. And once those children are born, all those politicians applauding the most now could not care less about the poverty and violence many of these kids will grow up in ... until they get shot at school."
There is finally a glimmer of hope in America...murder of innocent babies can never be right
"A small group of old white Christian men dictating to all: Jewish women, Muslim women, Buddhist women. Oh America ? What have you done ?"
Isn't in funny how in the land of the free women are not free to control the most basic thing.
okay baby killers
"They want to blame Trump , but it took more then three judges."
"""im 21 and  terrified"" use a condom then."
What is a woman tho?
Some of them shouldnt when they use that as birth control.
"Millions of abortions a year.
This been going on for 50 year.
Lets (make America safe again.)"
Who's seen A Handmades tale?
The theocratic fascists are in for a big surprise soon.
The women supporting this truly are betraying our rights.
"It was never a right, so I don’t know what you are talking about."
God save you all. God is good all the time.Amen.
Great for usa
Use contraception!! I'm talking to you to rapists.
"It's legal to kill in war.
Just a suggestion."
"Gun violence, police brutality, gangs, corruption, lack of freedom for women, etc, etc. America is just going backwards unlike here in Europe."
"This is just going to promote more death and hurt for babies. Abortions are painless, safe procedures that guess what, kills *nothing* 

But now women the victim of rape or incest will be made to carry their child, and those women might even just murder the baby from the postpartum depression, I mean they would have gotten prosecuted if they got it as an abortion anyway. 

Women who’s babies are severely disabled in the womb and wouldn’t live more than a few hours are going to have to spend months carrying a child only to hold them in her arms while they feel the pain of failing organs and death, when they could have been given that mercy without the traumatic experience of birth. 

Many women will die from dangerous pregnancies that they could have survived from by just getting an abortion and living to have another child.

This isn’t a win for life, this is a win for the continuous suffering of women and children. These people are disgusting"
"Abortion is not now, nor was it ever, “in the Constitution” Stop reporting falsehoods BBC nonsense. Stick to your own country...you got plenty of issues to deal with to keep your ratings up. Thank GOD for this decision! States now, as they should, have control, and power back to the people!"
This WILL NOT end well!
Shut up women and do as men say .
"Jus imagine countries in asia allow abortion,USA..u have lost it.."
Religious nonsense
Where is Potato Head in all of this?
You created a child. It’s not like adopting a puppy and giving it back.
"Perhaps this will force people from using abortion as a 'form of contraceptive'. This ruling of course does not erode the various exemptions for abortion neccesitated by rape, incest and medical emergencies. Stop reporting this news as though this decision automatically bans all abortions."

Amazing news for good people everywhere.. Abortion brings too much darkness.
What is wrong with America?
Allowing abortion is controlling poor masses who lack SEXUAL responsibility.... Blacks and Latinos I mean Democrats Will now have large unplanned families which can be exploited by the labour sector by rich white supremacists and also they will provide armies for advancing external aggression because of unemployment
Time zones are crazy in Australia its 9am in in Rome its 1am and in America its 1942.
"The most dangerous place for a child in the US is the womb. All this ridiculous fighting, it’s a woman’s right."
Right to Life won right to kill innocents
I've seen left wing activists protesting in Manchester England to protect women's rights to kill a baby . They're so concerned about it they even protest for women in another country to kill a baby.  Yet at the same time they can't or won't tell you what a woman is.  ?????
History repeats itself.. as someone whom studied history we are a powder keg.. once there is a spark.. it’ll get ugly.
Yes👌👌👌👌
I hope the religious freaks who forced this are prepared to raise those children. I wonder if AMerica has gone down the shithole so much it will present each newborn with a gun.
Production for adrenochrome and demand for fetal material will be in a crisis.  This is more than a women's right this is a challenge to  big business.  I guess when they start to abort a fully formed child at term even God himself had to step in.
They're alive so they aren't in position of talk about abortion let the aborted babies tell about it
"Pro-life? I hope they're willing to look after unwanted children, and not just take joy in seeing people suffer for their mistakes."
America is actually fucked
Lol
The left just can not catch a break 😪  lol 😆
Since abortion was legalised the family unit has been decimated. I hope abortion becomes illegal in my home country the UK.
Ha.ha head case
Land of the not so free
"Vile backwards self-entitled country devoid of values and a scar upon history, yet with the pomposity to think they've a right or a moral position from which to judge the rest of the world and lecture it on human rights and democracy. Your country employ torture, you consider other people's bodies your right and there are more of you incarcerated than any other population on Earth. You experiment on your own people (MK Ultra) treat black people, minorities and immigrants like dirt, you make health unattainable for many of your people and you probably have the most crooked, profiteering health systems in at least the developed world, many of you still fly a flag of slavery, the KKK have been allowed to persist, the majority won't even consider the slightest of gun law changes and if I wanted to get shot I'd think first warzone, then America, and you have caused nothing but misery, woe and destruction around the world. You also elected an illiterate, narcissistic ableist, racist who incited an act of terror, but of course we won't call it that because he's white and claims to be Christian, which by the way you force down everyone's throat and use to signal virtue, even though most pretend commandments 2, 3, 4 and 10 don't exist. That is who you are America, so stop strutting around pretending to have a morsel of moral integrity or authority; it is baseless."
"Killing Innocent children saved your life??? Evil People. Imagine your mother took your life, will you be alive now??? Thank God its overturned.."
"""the devestation and violence of abortion!"" ahahaha, what are they talking about? What was happening at the arbortion clinic? Perhaps they should increase security at the clinic, give every doctor a gun to solve the issue. Make sure there's only one door. They could have translated their logic from gun laws, kewk.

"I will be exposing my case of child trafficking whereby I was trafficked to Tom Cruise after writing to Jimmy Saville asking to meet Tom Cruise,  thereafter my Aunt (my main guardian) was misdiagnosed and murdered by the NHS I k by monarchy due to the fact she exposed depopulating and debilitating tactics used by the uk monarchy upon children whereby they distributed milk cartons which contained poisonous ingredients  to babies in nurseries and those who lived on council estates which led to infant death and deformities. 

After my Aunts death I was trafficked to france frontignan 1995 to Tom Cruise assaulted (hosed down with a firehose) and molested whereby he exposed his small genitals.  Ghislaine maxwell was in the resort as was Nicole kidman. 

Thereafter upon returning to the uk I was systematically assaulted terrorised and raped by various freemasonic individuals who were involved in paedophile networks and sex rings led and protected by the uk monarchy. 

I had 3 children from 2 of the men involved in this criminal network. All 3 have been trafficked to paedophiles,  my elder son Lushaan aged 12 has been trafficked to a male who is not related to him and has been tortured and terrorised by both the criminal paedophile working for the uk monarchy and the authorities. My younger son aged 6 Mohammed Ahsan being abused by his grandfather who is a known paedophile this family were known to the authorities and working for them. My daughter Yasmeenah has also been subjected to severe abuse which includes food deprivation and a humiliating torture. She has been unlawfully adopted and I have not seen her or my younger son since 2019.


This email will be circulated to every country to spread the TRUTH and spread awareness of what the uk monarchy are engaged in daily. The fact they have always adopted Nazi regimes which oppress the most vulnerable in society and systematically abuse the weakest of all, THE CHILDREN. The uk monarchy harbour paedophiles and agree with CHILD RAPE  TORTURE AND CHILD TRAFFICKING FOR PROFIT.


All my children's human rights have been disregarded by this scum uk monarchy and their vile lowlife spineless cowardly nazi cronies."
Let’s see how many women die needlessly because of this law. My thoughts go out to those women who have lost another right. 😪😪😪😪
"This is not about abortion, it is about the full term abortion that has become common place in the US, where the body parts of these Innocent children are recovered for Profit and for Stem cell research made legal under bush and, as yet has not cured any paralyzed person as Promised by George???????"
Imagine crying for losing your right of killing a newborn.
The British State media frothing at the mouth that murders are restricted. The Babylon Broadcasting corporation hates life particularly innocent life.
Yessss.Good news.👍👍👍👍
The wokeists/fascists are determined to abolish free speech. They are starting with removing the right of choice for women.
Who has a right to tell a woman what to do with her own body. Especially men!!
Good win for God and Humanity
"No more killing babies, yay!!!!"
BBC FAKE NEWS.
"They’re not pro life. They’re pro birth. They couldn’t care less what happens after. 
What a truly backward country."
"Ones body is ones property and so is what’s inside ones property. 
So who is the man or woman that believes ones property belongs to them  ?"
"“Jesus loves the little children”, as the clueless are singing here, except those that were apparently “saved” from abortion now having to grow up with easily preventable trauma. “Loves the little children” except those who had to deal with being raped and now forced to birth a child that will only cause them more trauma to themselves AND that child’s baby will also have to deal with trauma growing up.

And no, adoption is not an option that should be a default. Every child in the adoption system deals with trauma regardless of the age they were put into it (yes, including if they were a newborn). It is not an option to easily default to."
Its not a constitutional right. it’s nowhere in the constitution.
I don't care if you're christian. Your book will never dictate what should I do in my life let alone affect my humanity.
It's a good thing.   Glory be to God.
Just wrong !
"I understand extreme cases for abortion and agree with them but what about the hundreds of thousands of women globally. That basically use abortion as another form of contraception,. No thought or responsibility for your actions ?. This is what we really need to be speaking about in society. As for Biden and the Dems. This was the guy and party, that was supposed to unify the USA. How's that working out Joe ? Your political and ideological rhetoric, has over half of your population convinced some form of civil war is coming. Cessation of states from the Union is definitely on the horizon. The show trial that is Jan 6th. The Dems using the DOJ/FBI  to persecute your political adversaries an in doing so, demonise about a third of your population. Hitler did this during the 1930's and we all know how that turned out."
"I’m a Christian woman who is 21 weeks pregnant and just because I have moral biblical beliefs, that doesn’t mean my beliefs need to be forced upon others! The US is NOT a Christian country built upon tyranny! That has been completely forgotten! 
The best part about the US is/was religious freedom for all. Well not anymore! We are literally in Babylon now.

Jesus is 💯 about free-will, choice, love, forgiveness of sins, mercy and treating others how you’d want to be treated. God never, ever forces others to obey His commandments. He always gives people the choice to choose. It is SATAN HIMSELF that forces people to bow to him and to conform to his twisted will."
"""Women will die from botched abortion"" is like saying ""People can get arrested if they commit murder""
Actions have consequences."
Then increase rape sentences and respect womens rights
"You REPUBLICANS DO U Realise  WHAT U HAVE ACTUALLY GONE AND DONE TO YOUR WOMEN...!!!?.....in your own HOME ???? THINK,  GODDAMMIT . YOUR Jesus CHRIST IS NOT GONNA COME DOWN AND HELP YOU. .,"

2.17. Incredible hulk copped a feel.
"America is so backwards, such a laughing stock"
Change the judiciary.
It's the country which used to lecture the world on women's rights yet still practicing Christianity values.You should protect your minorities and women first then lecturing others.No the hell in world gonna follow us.US is history china is future
"Christianity, it's ok for priests to rape children but abortion is wrong."
"Waging war to SCOTUS : ""UC statement on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision"""

"Let's force males to breed, oh that's right, America is a sexist country run  by misogynist males."
The religious right are as bad as the taliban
"The death of any innocent human being is always wrong and MURDER. If you don't want children don't have sex, the totally depraved of the human heart is seen in the murder of baby's and casual sex. What rights are taking away from unborn baby's before they are MURDERED."
"Take precautions against getting pregnant if you don't want kids... don't create life, then destroy it. You have to be pure thick to not understand that you don't have that right to kill human life..."
America is an interesting country! U protecting fetuses but not kids who are already born with mad parents transitioning them at young as 2 years old? These are the kids that need the MOST protection!
"Why are Women fighting so hard to KILL BABIES????

Babies have the RIGHT TO LIVE. 

It's NOT YOUR CHOICE TO COMMIT MURDER on Babies.

Disgusted by all these women.

LEARN TO USE A CONDOM OR KEEP YOUR LEGS CLOSED."
Youd think they enjoy killing babies with the way they're going on about it.
Reeeeeeeeeeeeee. Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I guess this sort of thing can only happen in America...
"Now woman will die from botched abortions, kids will overrun the adoption centres, and kids will continue to grow up with poor morals/education/good experiences due to living with parents who dont want them/are not prepared for them. What a way to continue to screw up the country. looks like America is heading towards districts. hmu in 2050 yo"
I expected more people to protest. But nope.
Disgraceful decision
This isn't removing the right to abortion it's just now down to individual states
Good welldone america its not a right at all

''Why is it that most of the people who are against abortion are people you wouldn't want to fuck in the first place?'' - George Carlin
"That is only half my mind on that. 
Im so glad i married a real woman.
My wife has had 6 embryos that are still alive and expressing life. 
Every embryo 
Even one cell of living human should be able to choose Their way of life as God intended. No one should judge condemning to death those who are unable to defend themselves. 
The end result of every non molested embryo has been A Living Soul."
Do you have contraception in the USA?
"Women of America come to England where men are real men and won't try to enslave you. 
Or, in those states, refuse to have sex anymore."
Why’s everyone anti abortion butt ass ugly and never going to have a waine
"Land of free - biggest joke ever!
USA is a Christian country - Religion should not part of the decisions a country makes. USA has relegated 200 years in the past today."
There’s no excuses for getting pregnant by accident these days. Women have so many options to stop that happening. I hope they bring this law into the uk
america has literally gone to shit
*Nothing has been banned.*
USA has no right to exist... existence of USA is a error which must be corrected.
"These stupid gullible women that think god is real and voting to ban abortions, are they trying to say if they were raped by some disgusting evil ugly man that they would willingly have that baby and love it and they would not look at that child and be reminded of what happened every minute of the day for the rest of their lives bullshit and the leaders of these groups deserve it happening to them then see them run to the nearest abortion clinic as nobody wants anything to do with them after being raped pregnant and happy about it. This is a sick law and anyone agreeing with it is a mindless sick individual."
"Taking away rights from people that have had those rights for more then 50 years will not go well ! Then threatening to take away more rights will absolutely guarantee that you won't live in a happy country no matter which side you're on !  Taking away rights against the wishes of a large majority and doing it in the name of God by a financial right wing of Catholic judges will only turn millions more against the church . That will get even worse and unrepairable when women start dying ! 
Add this to their ruling that anyone can carry a concealed hand gun in New York city and congress still allowing 18 year olds to buy assault rifles and it's the beginning of a dying country."
If woman have the right to abortion. Man should  have the right to deny alimony
"they seem to think a woman is SIMPLY NOTHING BUT A CARRIER for the next human life that is to appear upon the face of this earth, therefore a female who is raped or has been incested her feelings is not consider

The people making these laws against abortion rights are no different from those in other places  giving orders for  THE CLITORIS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS TO BE CUT OUT!"

There are 3 times more abortions then Rapes every year and we also know that only a small percentage of those get pregnant.  Which means majority of the women are using ""Killing a baby"" as birth control.  Oopsy, C'mon people."
🥳🥳🥳
Trump's a genius
"I hope they stop unwanted pregnancies with easier access to contraception. If they don't want to stop unwanted pregnancies, then stopping abortion is an unbearable or even fatal decision towards the mother. And could be torture to the baby who was conceived through incest."
"All that's happened is they have given the right back to the people instead of the government......

If it's illegal in your state vote in pro abortion leaders simple no one has lost anything the blue states can still do what they want the red States will do what they want"
America is suc.
Well we clearly know on which side BBC is
it's always the ugly ones
The dems haven't been this mad since they had their slaves taken away from them...
Millions of women in the US losing their right...to kill their baby. Or we could say...millions of babies are gaining their right to live life.
This is the most amazing moment of my life tears of joy ! England will be next i would say hopefully but it’s a fact!
"Welcome to civilization, American."

This wasn’t the least bit biased 🤣🤥
"Can not ignore science and religion! 
Probably the only time religion and science actually agreed with each other ."
Wtf America?!?
"There is no future, no equality, no democracy without abortions. God does not agree with these fanatics and corrupt republicans. Poor and abused women will pay the price for this unfounded extremism. Women who are pro lifers are completely illusional. It is disgusting how evil they are. The SCOTUS are Putin puppets, sacrificing the life of women, not saving anyone. And Evangelists are evil and ignore the Bible. They don't follow the most important Christian law: Don't judge others. 
And the unborn child is called a ""fruit"" for a reason. It is very clear in the Bible that abortion is not murder."
Why get pregnant in the first place
CELEBRATE....LORD HIMSELF WALKS WITH YOU PRO LIFE
Good decision by USA 🇺🇸 court
It looks like America has lost IT in more ways than one with this court ruling I am afraid. Over population has consequences just be ware!!!!!
"Mothers, who murder their children. How about the children's rights. Because they can't speak then they have no right  !!!."
Body parts from tiny live humans have been sold to evil monsters by evil monsters.How many people even care?
"These people need to check out NDE.....and what happens to people in the spirit world....who have abortions. Anyone with half a brain realises that: you should not be killing babies. People think they  can do what they want on this earth....then that's the end.....they are in for one big shock at death. Some NDE expreiencers reports seeing mile upon mile of pod like objects in hell, each one containing a spirit being tortured. Another person saw a cave with millions of spirits crammed in the dark....screaming, weeping and wailing.....an angel nearly 8 foot tall told them: not to step back in there, or your be in there for eternity. Other people report seeing a lake of fire 15 miles in radius, and spirits burning inside the volcanic flames. Another who,s lifestyle revolved around alcohol, was told: this is where we send people with your lifestyle when you die.....and he was in a moon like landscape being attacked by demonic creatures.  No one knows for certain if it is true.....BUT, what If  it is.....and you are sent to a dreadful place for eternity ? It certainly makes one think.....and don,t forget: we are floating on a huge globe in the middle of space.....so anything is possible."

9 unelected people thinking they have the right to radically regress a country. ‘Land of the free’
People should be more careful and use condoms
"Women have the right over their own bodies and when one(male) takes advantage of that, the woman has to carry and so this is emotionally, and mentally, and physically demanding to a woman and so they make the decision for their health to have the bubble break and be removed. Woman DID NOT CONSENT to having their bodies invaded. Men do not understand the depth of making this decision and if male had made this decision over Woman, then stand fast ladies and fight a global fight. Woman understand women. So don't allow them to tell You what to do. The organisations and courts are private corporations and so you as living women Do Not Consent and You Do Not have to accept any ruling which is just an act to overturn it by private corporations. Federal and state are private corporations."
"Abortion is unGodly,life matters"
"This judgement suggest, results of political bias for appointment in judiciary.

Surprisingly there are no checks while appointing top post in judiciary.

If it's about right of unborn life, what about right of born women? Does women have any right over her body?  doesn't repeated pregnancy  hampers women body? Why should she be prohibited from natural sex?"
"Joe is just woke up !! 
Who’s woke him up ??? Just let him sleep forever ♾....."
Hallelujah!!! The unborn have the right to life! 🥳🥳🥳
"If you cannot afford buying condoms  you should not having sex !!!
Take care of your pusssssy !!!!"
Handmaid tale in real
Good. We’re amidst a huge demographic crisis and humanity os dying. We need people.
America hates itself!
This is the reaction to people pushing to allow abortions up to one day before birth
"Take your ass to a state that allows it. States rights ""Live Free Or Die"""
"Thank God I dont live in the U.S.A. Banned abortions, school shootings, Ku Klux Clan... I'd be afraid to walk on the street without loosing my life."
"Say goodbye to your HIPAA rights to privacy, IVF, contraceptives, surgery to stop an ectopic pregnancy."

"Signing a law that makes no exceptions for rape victims ? . So, they expect a rape victim to carry and birth a child they never wanted in the first place . What about the victims ? who cares? no-one by the sound of it !"
"Russians are just watching, they cant belive how hipocratic wst is."
"USA leaders=criminals! Go out from Europe, you corrupt criminals."
Hooooly shit. I've long said the US is a moral and intellectual third world country but I didn't expect this. America is so deeply fucked up.
"Guns, Political fracturing, Healthcare, ....this!!   America fully on its way to being a failed State."
Ohhh noooo 😞 it’s not legal to kill unborn children
"i salute the supreme court, this the happiest day 🥳🥳🥳"
"I predict this will result in a brain drain. Women who can will flee, while others will suffer. An increase in crime rates and maternal mortality. Increase in violence against women. The problem with absolute ideals is that tend to be bloody."
"A dark day for humanity. No one has the right too tell Women what to do with their bodies. 
This is disgusting. 
The far right Christians who endorse this are the scourge  of humanity. You have no right! 
Your God is a sick narcissist, my God is caring and compassionate. 
The Christian movement are no different to a cartel.
Your ""religion"" is a tool of control, not compassion!"
"Ive noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.

Ronald Reagan."
Roasties furious that they have to take responsibility for their degenerate behaviour.
Adultery and Formication should also have punishable results to limit women getting pregnant in the first place…it’s not rocket science
"Ok to all you pro lifers. Let me give you a little analogy. I am a woman of which has an abusive and violent husband. One night my husband comes into the bedroom yelling and screaming at me because I forgot to do something. He then proceeds to rape and violate my privacy. A few weeks pass by and something doesent feel right and I discover I'm pregnant with my violent and abusive husband's child. Now let's say that this ban has been put into place. I should be forced to endure a 9 month nightmare carrying the child of someone I am begging to get away from and throughout the pregnancy he still continues to be violent and invasive. One night, i go into labour and i am rushed to the hospital and things arent looking good. My blood pressure is through the roof, I'm passing out every few minuets and waking up screaming in pain. I come close to death itself. I then have to raise that child whilst their father continues to abuse me and possibly my child which can cause trauma in that child's life or teach the child that it's ok to hurt people. They then grow up to be a violent person and cause more crime in America.

Should I still have to have that baby? 

Let me add that even when this ban comes into place, PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE AN ABORTION! They are gonna resort to the illegal, unsafe and possibly deadly forms of abortion because to bring that child into the world will bring them an unholy amount of trauma. SO WHATS THE POINT! Let me give you another example of why this ban is pointless. Murder, is what you call abortion, well murder is illegal everywhere its banned but people STILL DO IT. Your arguments are unbelievably invalid!

You argue that a clump of cells is life and it's wrong to do so. Well everything is a clump of cells and you've probably stepped on an ant or some form of insect. You destroyed that life why limit it for humans."
Report the truth I know it’s hard for you lot at the BBC
And retardation in the West just grows and grows as time goes by
"Yes this is good news for us ,now all the countries of the world should do the same , abortion is murder and thoses that are fighting for abortions are also murderers."
BBC is fake news
Great news for the rights of those have been murdered(babies)because of the careless actions(women and men)in getting pregnant outside of marriage leading to conceiving and termination of a innocent child to be..
"This is such bullshit, its not health care, its killing babies, lets be honest."
"As the one lady said, you can't disinvent something. All it means is that women will have to travel or alternatively seek a back street quack. 
Someone stated that the judges are there to interpret the Constitution, written in 1796 I believe. Surely its time to rip up that worthless piece of paper. Its like trying to run a modern car on the old diagrams and notes on a steam engine."
Hallelujah praise the Lord!
"Antinatalism is the solution in this crowded and crazy world todays. I cant believe people keeps reproducing while life is getting harder and harder every day. You know life is a nonstop suffering and torment yet you still bringing new children into this cruel, cruel world so they can experience the same like you. How ignorant and selfish you are. Human beings are so pathetic. 

I hope global warming brings an unprecedented catastrophes to destroy this planet along with human civilisation and its unfair economic system."
"It’s amazing that joe Biden, Nancy pelosi and their ilk now all of a sudden know what a woman is    Amazing.  

Abortion shouldn’t be used as contraception.   That’s what the issue is from what I can see.   Abortion isn’t banned.  Women (they do exist.  And I’m no biologist) can still go to states who will allow it from what joe Biden has said.  So not banned at all.  More bs from MSM and the screaming loons “in fear for their lives” (!!!)."
Religious nutters
"My body my choice, except when you’re forced to take an injection against your will"
Mad how some Americans seem to be so deluded taking away the choices of women because “pro life” but when there’s mass shootings every other day does nothing about gun legislation..
The US is becoming more like Afghanistan every day.
Fecking crazy
peace full protest lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
She's 21 and 'terrified.'  Then keep your panties on and imagine the terror of being murdered.
Anybody can have it ... but not everybody should pay for it ... abortion is immoral
Let's abort THE BABY KILLERS. JIHAD against child killers
Reeeeeeeeeeeeee welcome back Q
"Lets make this a bit more transparent.  The Supreme court in the USA deals with the constitution, they are custodians and there to uphold it.  They have deemed, after retrospectively looking into Roe v Wade, which was a controversial decision at the time, is in fact not a constutional right - nowhere in the constitution does it state, or be interpretated, that a women has a constituional right to abortion.  This will mean that indiviudual states will have the right to make their own laws around abortion - some may ban it outright, while others will allow abortions up to 40 weeks - as Governors are elected they are directly accountable to the people.  More conservative states will probably have stricter laws whilst liberal states will not - but would probably be inline with the will of the people of said state."
"There is no constitutional riggt to abortion, as abirtion was not even mentioned in the constitution.
The decision simply means that each state has the right to democratically decide whether or not to allow abortion on demand.
As for Joe Biden, he professes to be a Catholic.  By supporting the killing of babies in the womb, he has shown he is not."
"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING !
THANK YOU CONSERVATIVE AND RELIGIOUS CHRISTIAN FOUNDAMENTALIST !
TELLING WOMEN WHAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO WITH THEIR BODIES AND LIFES : ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!😠"
ROE so dead 🤣🤣
Well loads of people are out of a job now
yo supreme court  ban guns that kills both adults and kids
America is the most backwards first world country in the world
"I think now only 2 things that Supreme Court must make it Ilegal 😍
1. GUNS
2. SAME SEX MARRIGE"
Great day for state's rights.
liberal melt down loving it defundthebbc
I actually agree with the decision. Life over death
This is like Trump's booby trap he left after leaving office. What a sad legacy from a selfish man.
"USA is going backwards, this is so disappointing."
"Knuckle heads seems there are no freedoms any more, but there are plenty of countries outside of the USA that one could easily travel to these days"
The last time pelosi had a period it was in the triassic!!!
The legal murderers need to find a new job. Vile criminals
"Wtf this 2022 anything could happen pandemic, ban on abortion, alien and world war."
If a country mandates vaccinations then making abortions illegal isn't a surprise because both are done in the belief of doing the right thing even though everyone may not agree
"Victory for the innocent, unborn children 👏👶. If you don't want to have children, keep your legs closed."
"Republicans when they get majority they get things done look at roe Vs Wade now 
When the democrat get majority they just talk talk look at gun ban 
😂😂😂😏😏😏😂"
The bbc opens with lies.. it only means very late abortive crimes..
Criminalizing pain relief is what it is. Ridiculous.
Haha all the baby killers lost today.....
The words right and abortion should not be used in the same sentence with a straight face
I wonder if all the women celebrating anti abortion would feel the same if they got raped on their way home and fell pregnant.
"This is horrendous news, I'm so sorry my lovelys.

Come to Australia.. you'll have more rights, better healthcare and best of all.. no guns 👌"
END THE KILLING OF CHILDREN.
"Hehe, do you notice most anti-abortion activities are fat and urgly."
"Do these people realize the children abandoned because their parents literally couldn't afford to feed them, have to go somewhere
Death is the greatest gift a man can achieve, and not being born in the first place is even more of a blessing"
Allahuakbar
The uk monarchy encourages abortion through the vile NHS. They and my non muslim mother who ironically works for the NHS forced myself  when I was most vulnerable before I Reverted to Islam. Witches
defundthebbc
America please bring back all of Gods laws
Typical disingenuous BBC i see
Well it's far from perfect here but compared to the USA its paradise here.
"40% of UK abortions are to someone who has already had one. That's quite careless to have been ""rape or incest"" impregnated at least twice."
I'm hoping to see riots.
"It’s ok, calm down everybody the Evil Democrats will have baby kill centres in all the states that ignore this ruling."
"can't we humans strike a balance... when it should be done and when not. if it is life threatening for mother then existing life should get preference over life yet not born. other extreme is girls take relationships so casual that every second month there is a b.f dumped and a baby that is bad and must be stopped. laws must distinguish between extremes. better is to apply and get permission from court before abortion. however no one can stop emergency abortions, it will continue as per existing situations (pragnent woman meeting accident may need immediate abortion even before her other surgery is performed). what about rape victims? i don't know how people on such big position try to apply a broad brush..."
"BLM






Babies' lives matter"
USA: mass shootings at schools solution is to ban women who get sexually assaulted from getting rid of an unwanted pregnancy. Gotta fill the schools up for the next shooter
Time to disband the USA
"*Abortion is murder, if you don't want the baby give it up for adoption.*"
"The protester said this will lead to botched abortions and many women will die...well if she is willing to kill her baby..then what is the problem, could it be a life for a life at all..."
The first city to be distroyed. Is New York City.{russia).
Wow the US is so backwards
America really is a massive cesspit
So Victory is taking away a woman's rights over her own body that's not victory that's overbearing control when that child grows up and kills somebody whines up in prison or wind up on disability runs our country girl broke then tell me
"Legalised Murder by the State hasn't been banned it has been put back for The People to decide in individual states which is where this decision should be ! WITH THE PEOPLE !
This perfectly highlights the left to a T. When they can't get enough people to vote for something they turn to the politicised courts to get their demands met by either Banning it or allowing it. 
When President Trump told people they should peacefully protest at the White house they demanded he was charged with trying to foment Insurrection yet listen to the open and clear threats of violence to come from the Left and the sitting President and you get Silence"
I just don't understand why women want to kill their babies? Can someone explain?
Glory!
"I would just stop having sex all together. Let the blue balled men overthrow those out of touch geezers.
Oh, I hope that there will be huge riots. What a shit show 🤯"
"He will rot in he'll
"""""""""""
"It’s crazy to me that, United States doesn’t have free healthcare, free education, free child care, or free birth control and yet they want to ban abortion?"
A backward-arsed country in so many respects but this and their inablility to act on guns just ices that cake.
"“Devastation that abortion brought on us”? If you want to save the children, you should stop guns! This is ridiculous, you’re making it more dangerous for all the women that will go through abortion in some illegal clinic. America is not being progressive example to the world anymore, more like back tracking into dark days. The best is that men are voting what will happen to a woman’s body!?! I’m sorry for the women, sad times 😢"
"Well done America, taking a life as a method of contraception In order to live a hedonistic lifestyle is never acceptable."
God bless America and to the Unborn 👍
I find it atrocious I really do
"I wouldn't actually mind people revisiting the idea of gay marriage.  People tend to forget that developed nations were doing pretty well without it.  In fact, it's in diametric opposition to another protected characteristic; that of faith."
When you law and country is built on the bible don't expect it to just stop these people are bat shit crazy this is why China is taking over from the USA
"They have struck down the right to kill another human being. 
Praise be the Lord!"
"When the beeb and the rest of their pals want you looking at this …. Just know something else is being done far worse to the people without them knowing it, yet."
"What a rag tag mob.  Not a normal person to be seen.  Lezers, fat ugly enforced celibates, women without wombs and men without winkles, day release mentalists, vegans with secret sausage fetish and finally the lush Pelosi and her alcoholic husband."
Protesting because you want the right to murder? I give up
"The ruling on abortion was given back to the states to decide for their own.
That’s it. No one banned a thing. The right to abortion lies with each individual American state.
Jesus Christ. How dumb are you lot. These comments are embarrassing. Go read the ruling for yourself. You can’t trust these liars. They just whip your emotions by not telling you the truth.
Right to abortion struck down…wow. More like right to abortion decentralised from man in government back to states, back to local opinion."
"An innocent child doesn’t deserve to die because of the actions of the abusive father, who would beat the mother. Let’s help the women in these situations find safety, treat them with love and compassion. Killing her child is another violent act towards her. Let’s work towards a nation that serves women and children and families in need. There is a lot of work to be done. Let’s fix the foster care system and the adoption system. Let’s fix our family leave so woman can have up to a year or two with their newborns. So much needs to be done this is the beginning."
The result of DT’s nominating of supreme court members..
What's the differences Urhcraine killings or abortions.
"People need to go home and get on with their lives all this judgement of vulnerable people by People with nothing better to do is ridiculous,
Rape and Incest aren't a problem but abortion is apparently 🤷🏾‍♂️"
"You're lying: the overturn simply means that it is up to individual states to decide what their stance is, and not the federal government."
The world is fucked
Usa supreme court is right
A lot of babies conceived by rape and incest will be born from yoke to prison and warped lives. Only religion can take a woman’s right over their own bodies.
"NOW EVERY OTHER COUNTRY NEEDS TO TELL AMERICA WHERE TO GO WHEN THEY … COME ALL HOLY TELLING OTHERS HOW TO RUN THEIR COUNTRY AND TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY… THEY ARE IN NO POSITION TO SPEAK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION WHEN THEY ARE ERODING EVERY TRACE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THEIR MESSED UP COUNTRY.
PEOPLE NEEDS TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHO THEY VOTE INTO POSITION OF POWER BCOZ IT HAS LONGTERM CONSEQUENCES … TRUMPISM AND EVIL SATANIC PPL STRIKES AGAIN.
THE LEADERS OF THE DYSFUNCTIONAL STATES OF MADMERICA SEEM TO WANT TO CONTROL PEOPLE’S LIVES ..TELLING THEM WHEN TO EAT AND WHEN TO SLEEP.
THESE PPL ARE BARBERIC AND EVIL THROUGHOUT HISTORY AND UNFORTUNATELY TIME DOESN’T CHANGE PEOPLE WHO WERE TAUGHT TO BE EVIL TO THE CORE FROM A TENDER AGE."
I find it funny how none of the comments on here mention the rights of the baby
About time America had some good news. It's been incessant evil for a long time
"Imagine thinking you could keep pushing for later and later abortions, even some saying after birth termination should be the mother's choice, wanting all that power over another life without responsibility, changing the terms from rare cases like aborting the product of rape/incest to an on-demand and at any time service, and not expect there to be pushback. 

The Pro-Life movement is majority women by the way, so abortionists can keep trying to blame men, it won't stick, especially when an on-demand abortion culture benefits men."
Medieval America.
Baby killers unite.  ‘The most dangerous place for a black man is in the womb’ (source unknown).
The news is a big part of causing violence. Supreme Court did not strike down any right to abortion. They gave it back to the states.
"good decision before""american blood"" goes extinct."
Another proof of the states being a third world country
And return to back street abortion. Well done America. 😢
Great day for America🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Yes
Land of the free 😂🤦
"These protesters should practice and preach, contraception, instead of murder for a better world. God gave Women the responsibility of the continuation of the Human Race. Do not abuse that sacred right. Life is a precious gift. Preach to your sons and men the against sexual exploitation and trafficking of humans. Preach to them against greed of money and power being the root of all Evil. Preach about egalitarianism for a better work."
Why does this remind me of breeding grouse for those with guns to shoot them
"The right to abortion was given to the people of the states to decide.
Why lie?"
I despise these religious morons who oppose there BS on to everyone else. America is the land of the free. Please!
"It's devastating. Abortion won't stop, only safe one will. People who think this will save more lives are complete idiots."
"“I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.""
President Ronald Reagan"
There's so much emotion in the rally that it will rip any man masculinity.
"I wonder if Sunday church will soon become mandated. Shortly after, working for your lord every Saturday."
"A country steadily heading into the dark ages...yet more laws that cause harm to people, pandering to relgious fantasists and extremists."
I wouldn't want to carry  nor raise a brain-damaged child. That's too much to ask of most women. The righteous always think emotionally and religiously instead of reality.
Just what the world needs....even more Americans
"The insane Christian Taliban won't stop until they turn America into a theocratic dictatorship, and they force us all to live as they think their imaginary sky daddy wants.

We must FIGHT BACK (peacefully and legally) or they will thrust us back into the Dark Ages."
"Keep your legs closed. No problems. And ask your self ""what if my mother aborted me?"""
So women will end up having back street abortions and unwanted kids will be neglected and abused this is so backwards 😡
"Time to riot burn loot kill injury and destroy people's properties businesses and cars , well ...... that's if your a unhinged left wing Marxist commie that is 👍🏼"
This woke snow flake world is absolutely fucked????? It's like living in the twilight zone!!!!!
Inshallah.
Just keep your legs shut - abstinence is the best form of contraception.
"Bullshit The House needs only a simple majority to impeach a Supreme Court justice or any federal judge. To convict and then remove the justice or judge, the Senate requires a two-thirds majority."
It is victory to godly people and a death blow to satanists the abortionists.
"I do not know why they are celebrating? the choice to abort or not it still belong to the woman, if they choose to have an abortion they will do it wether is legal or not, and that probably sometimes will cost two lifes."
"Pro life deluded morons, the land of the free, not very free is it."
Finally the tide of moral decline is turning. Praise God
It's still legal in most progressive states though?!
Praise be to God. I am grateful and thankful we still have righteous politicians.
From conception to The time they turn Gay.
Btw I’m not sure why some guys are boasting about this? Do you understand you get almost zero access now? It’s still their body. Their choice so this doesn’t stop access to anything. It just makes it unsafer now and makes it harder for you to get laid. Calm down 😂😂😴
I'm grateful I'm neither female nor American. This is disgusting.
"right I’m unsure what this means, can they have abortions upto so many weeks pregnant or certain circumstances or is it just a no straight from the start?"
It is horrifying that this is happening in 21st century America. Several states will not even have exceptions in cases of rape and incest! It’s evil. Shame on all of them who voted for this.
"The republicans will turn America into Afghanistan if they are not stopped. Womens rights mean nothing to them.
I wonder how many of Trump's girlfriends had abortions in the past?"
"This is not a federal ban on abortion. It simply returns the decision to the states.
The court is meant to decide the constitutionality of laws, not make them."
Why are these anti-abortion people all so fat?
A woman has the right of ownership over her own body
美国牛逼
"Most people dont understand what happened in US. They want the court whose only job is to uphold the law as it is written and understood, to make laws. That is for law makers! So if you want any rights laws then choose representatives who will give you what you want. Meanwhile use a condiment 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Such decisions which effect huge sections of ppl should be done through referendum.
Yeah these are the ones who have sex and get pregnant. And get abortion to lose those innocent tiny babies. What a shame.
"So it's OK for babies to die, but not women? 
What about girl babies, is it ok to murder them?"
"When they are permitted up to 9 months and including birth what do they expect. It was never safe, legal and rare. Both men and women need to start taking responsibility for their actions."
"More baby girls are aborted. This saves femicide.

Just behave responsibly, do not go for 500 partners simple and do not jump in the bed of every imbecile that calls you. Now you will have to behave, not be reckless and irresponsible. 

The world is going to suffer from population collapse in 2100 according to a BBC report."
What the AF is happening to America??? 😳
The dawn of the fall of USA :)
"from the reaction of these fascist women in the footage it looks like ALL women in USA were obliged to abort for 50 years. in that case I would understand these sort of reaction. but nobody want them to abort. it is more that them, as fanatic believers, want to impose their credo on other people. and off course the shadow of the scum of trump is still there.... poor USA!!!! poor America.!!! continue voting the republican. good luck"
"No woman may be allowed to kill. Exceptions are obviously acceptable  in case of rapes or serious health problems. Nevertheless, every human being must be respected while, on the other hand, pussies may never be faced as a ""green card"" to murder innocent human beings because responsibility inheres to women's liberty."
A lot of unwanted children will be trafficked. That's what they're really celebrating. So sad 😞
"America, the newest third world country..."
Well there goes womans rights ya bunch of psychos.
Murder != care
"Why is this a big deal?  It seems it’s only the hill billy states doing this. Sorry for my ignorance. I’m not from there but I don’t see the big ones doing it. It seems it’s those religious, hill billy states."
No one has the right to kill an innocent foetus.I support the supreme court
"Fuuuuuuck 😂 I'm genuinely in awe of this... The utter ridiculousness that America, what is considered to be one of the most leading nations in the world, would do something like this."
I can't believe this happened in the USA....
That country is headed for a civil war. It's actually terrifying how divided the U.S. is on so many important issues. Take care my American friends. 🤍
"It’s right , abortion is murder and also if you don’t want kids strap up"
"Shame on you America. You have put the rights of unborn babies before the rights of living women. Take away their reproductive rights, but put assault rifles in the hands of mentally Ill 18 year olds. Shame on you. You are taking your country backwards into the dark past. Shame on you."
"Great biased reporting once again BBC. You never fail, keep it up😂"
"Why do the nations(CNN MSNBC etc) conspire and the peoples plot in vain?
The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying, “Let us break their chains and throw off their shackles.” 
The One enthroned in heaven laughs;  the Lord scoffs at them. He rebukes them in his anger
and terrifies them in his wrath, saying,  “I have installed my king in the Supreme Court."
Stupid backward congress. This ruling has set back America 50 years
"Its about time people took responsibility for their actions.  When a woman says ""my body my choice"",  that isn't exactly true is it.  If you're pregnant then you've got another body in there, one without a voice.  The only exception I would allow is when there is a medical risk to said woman if the pregnancy would proceed, or if she was raped.   Being drunk or promiscuous is not an excuse to murder an unborn child."
"Great step! Moving away from the devil that covered people's eyes by the name of ""Right"". It is weird that people march in support of killing a human being.   Banning abortion and improving workable protection system for women and girls must be among the priority agendas."
"America is such a fucked up country, how a western democratic superpower like this would have such little rights for their people and control people’s bodies in this way while having no safety nets for people, no healthcare, no protection; they are in no way “the leaders of the free world”, they are a tyranny against their own people"
Sluts are worried now 😂🤔
"In today's world, only two countries issue new laws against freedom and liberty, Afghan Taliban and America."
It was never a constitutional right as it is not in the constitution  why are the BBC reporting fake in accurate  news
"Such a ridiculous ban!! Their bodies, their choices!"
The fat creature saying “I won today” has she got something wrong with her ?
Just use contraception
"Murica, where life is precious until the second your born. Then your on your own with no universal healthcare, workers rights, and you can get shot at school. I hope those policy makers enjoy living in The Republic of Gilead"
People should just deal with their consequences instead of killing their fetus and living their life with complete ignorance of what they have done
Well the US government has made a backyard butchers job legal now congrats idiots!
If the bbc aren't bias then why are they reporting this like it's terrible news?
"They don't get so hysterical when the West genocides the Third World. Spoilt, self-centred women who cannot face up to the fact that the biological female can get pregnant when she has sex."
"The media so biased. There is obviously an agenda being displayed here. 

Respect the decision as we would have had to if it was the other way around and shut the f**k up."
Congrats. Give people with mental health guns and now take away a woman's rights to a choice.
Thank God.. No more killings of innocent babies.  It is murder....millions of babies have been killed..... get contraceptive then..
Defund the BBC
Imagine being forced to carry your rapist child
Is it just me or do them women seem mad?
merica is a mess
Its simple they just want their name written in history. Even if its on the wrong side.
Thanks to Trump's appointments
That guy with the colourful umbrella yea he ain’t got no kids and he wants kids but nobody wanna have kids with him so if abortions get “Cancelled” he can definitely have a kid when he hurts another women !! W t heck bro
"The Christian nationalist judiciary will change the law to suit their vision of a society ruled by a Reactionary Elite, a society with a preferred religion and a prescribed code of sexual behavior, all backed by the coercive power of the state."
This is excellent news. It will stop the murder of thousands.
Do you mean they stop killing baby
"Is the Catholic Church running the USA ? Women now will have to have the rapist baby and what next no contraception, no sex before marriage good grief. I feel for the unborn but really there are over 7 billion of us in this small world, nations are starving, wars are raging, the planet is over heating. I feel for the unborn but they could be the lucky ones, now before saving the unborn, get of your lazy backsides and make a world worth living in."
Keep the ten commandments and we would not have problems with this.
"The BBC, so unbiased!!"
America is in shambles
Abortion is MURDER! We stand for Life!
Shocking and Biden just sits back and stumbles a few words out. Make America pathetic again. Another choice lost
"How can one nation be so detrimental to its own well-being. Aborting a child is wrong but allowing them to grow and be shot up in a school is just part of life. If the preservation of life is the most important thing, then the death penalty should be struck down"
They don’t look like normal women
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGMit4qX2RQ&ab_channel=UnorthodoxIndividual
"Yes, its about time we protected the unborn. Now the unborn have the right not to be murdered. Unborn have souls too."
They look and sound like men this evil “anti abortions”
"Simple ladies,take responsibility in not getting pregnant!! Use contraception, and dont let him go ughhhh in you"
Well done.. American women crazy
"Christian fundamentalism governing politics, similar to the Taliban."
"Sick, divided society governed by greedy uneducated psychopats."
it seems to me that you guys should have a refferemdom and not let a few people who think they know better than the rest of your population
"If I were a foetus, I’d rather be dead than born disabled with defects to people who don’t want me"
United States my ass at this point it’s just the states.
Life in the United Hates of America
Best news ever! God wins!
"There is a Brexit parallel here. Control of abortion has been returned from Washington (Brussels) to the individual States (UK).

Democracy at the State level will show us what the will of the people really is."
Doctors are criminals. Court decision almost 5 decades is appreciable
Excellent news… if people followed the word of God we wouldn’t have these things happen if your that bothered about being selfish for your own pleasure be prepared for what comes after that…. Man and woman should not sleep around before marriage it should be in love and true harmony
Man there’s going to be a LOT of back alley abortions and deaths.
All glory to God
❤❤
"It’s murder,Your taking a life for Gods sake 🇺🇸"
"I’m just worried that these pro-lifers are going to take this thing to its logical conclusion, and call for an outright ban on masturbation!😳"
BBC is the new CNN. All fake news all the time. This is not at all what you falsely report. There is no ban on abortion it moves the decisions to the individual states..  abortion is not birth control as it is being used. BBC SUCKS
How embarrassing
I swear the US is gonna have another civil war soon
"I saw some ridiculous girl on the news singing ""Jesus loves the little children!"" Oh sure he does, and now the little sweeties can go home to parents who didn't want them to begin with, out of mind of the authorities (who consider they've done their jobs by 'Jesus') and wait to be neglected, starved and abused to death!  Sometimes I think the Americans, as a race, are about as intelligent as mouthy school kids!"
I am pro life. We need more kids so that we can send them out to war....to die. Pro life/pro war. Makes sense?
"If u dont want a baby, close them legs"
"One aspect of the US constitution I did envy was the separation of religion from politics...."" the Establishment Clause prohibits all levels of government from advancing or prohibiting religion"".  What happened?"
"Question: if a woman was forcefully raped by a psychotic serial killer, she would still have to keep the child but that man would, by US law be put to dead. Is that what is happening? 
So a woman that is forced to do something against her will, should be once again forced to do something against her will. One person that forced is sentenced to death and the other paid a salary? 
Is that not insanity?"
I'm so glad I live in a country where people can destroy unborn babies without any consequences 😍
About time. This accepted genocide has been going on too long. Mass denial of this because you want to spread your legs.
The number of these idiots who needed to be aborted themselves is staggering.
The number of these idiots who needed to be aborted themselves is staggering
"What kind of reporting is this? Leslie Rutledge saying the doctor doesn’t have any facts, and no push back? Despite decades of facts. Just air it as an opinion?
Also most people in America support womens rights to have an abortion, nowhere is that said in this report. Also nowhere is it said that this is an infringement of human rights. 
Is the BBC just an ‘opinions’ show now?"
"Many who are outraged at this Supreme Court's decision little realize how blessed they are in America. For none of them would want to live in a society where human and divine law is no longer respected. That experiment was already tried in ancient France, and horrific were the results. Thus, those who are outraged are exhibiting that they, whether they realize it or not, have accepted the lie the god of this world continually propagates of ""Do what thou wilt."" Yet, those consumed with impulsive anger over this decision are acting thus because they, whether ignorantly or willfully, have abandoned the Creator God's plan for marriage and sex, and that is complete abstinence until wedded in holy matrimony."
"Fuck Pro life, I hope your daughters get raped with no possibility to abortion."
And this is the country shaming the taliban for making their women to wear a burqa 🤦🏻‍♂️
try taking responsibility for yourself     then you dont need to get upset or happy about this
"Welcome to America 2022 where you can walk down to your local Walmart and buy a high-powered assault rifle to help 'protect' your family. Someone could use that rifle to go on a rampage killing innocent people. Nothing is done because of the 2nd amendment and the powerful NRA.

Yet a woman who has become pregnant through either rape, abuse, incest or even is not mentally capable of supporting a child can no longer have the right to an abortion. It is a crazy situation to be in. In some states, women even risk being tried for murder.

All this has done is open up backstreet abortion clinics and there is a high risk that a lot of women could die as a result of this. 

America is turning into Gilead more and more each day."
Let's just faces it the US cannot be considered a free country anymore
The US leading the way for babies's rights.
"Fifty three years ago, Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon and made the famous quote: One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. Now the American Supreme Court has just turned that quote on its head. This is a second giant leap... only this time it's backwards. How in the world can the US of A, the so-called Land of the Free, be trusted to oppose dictatorships like Russia when they're intent on cracking down on liberties like this? We in Britain should have been reducing ties to America instead of Europe at the rate things are going."
Very good decision. 💝💝💝💝💝💝
"If only these women had access to condoms, contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch or contraceptive coil

.... Oh wait 🤔"
People are upset that they are reducing killing of life? 😂👏🏾 I think it's great as women use abortion  as contraception these days hopefully it will make ppl more sexually reserved and wise.
"Now Americans would laugh and look down upon on those countries which allow abortion legally .
American syndrome 
Laughs over ever thing which is different from their country .😂"
"LIES! “Tens of millions do not have a right to abortion?” It is state by state. They are free to travel to get an abortion. Leftist propaganda, all of this."
disgusting
I think they should consider regulation of guns first rather than mobilizing crowds to act more violent .
"Same old lying BBC! It's nit been struck down, banned or anything like that! Tyw Supreme Court has just given the decision to the States!
You're as bad as chabnel 4!
May as well cone oyt of the closet, and just admit you're a left wing propaganda machine!"
America willingly marching itself back into the dark ages. What a silly childish move.
There is irony in the fact that nineteen children were shot to death in their classrooms and the same people who claim to ban abortion to protect unborn children refuse to ban the military-type weapons that kill real children.
It's time for us men to do our part and stop treating sex as a recreational activity and letting our hormones get the best of us. Sex is for mature men in committed relationships; and thinking otherwise already debases women into sexual objects and unequal human value. I know because I have been there. But we can learn from our mistakes and do better. Let's treat women with the respect they deserve.
These people are crazy! Just sickening I feel for the woman of this country I hope they find access else where
"No prob 
They could canada for it"
When u get too much freedom that u even won't realise what's basic rights are and when were they taken away .
So they make abortion illegal but make it legal to carry a gun that can take more life's. So when they commit suicide as cannot get abortion I hope these people realise they have killed 2 people
I don’t understand why can’t they just go on the pill or use condoms
"If there so pro life why is it so hard to to get stricter gun laws passed. Children being shot in class rooms ,it just doesn't make sense."
USA 🇺🇸 = 👑God’s 🏡 home📯
If there going to make abortion illegal they should make all you religious nuts support the children your so concerned about!
"go on puny humans, go do the bidding of the elite and divide yourselves with anger, take to the streets in time of coming war and fight each other because you can't have sex without consequence. 'will of the people', what good is the will of the people if they're programmed by Tik Tok / China."
"All life matters. A dog's life matters. The heartbeat in that 10 week old matters. 
""Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you."""
Not a land of dreams anymore.
It’s time to abide by the right of a person even unborn to LIFE as enshrined in the US Constitution.
It is not “ the right to abortion “ that has been struck down - typical miss reporting by the BBC. All that has happened is that each state now has the power to make its own laws concerning abortion.
"And with an outpouring of misinformation the BBC yet again demonstrate to the world why they should be shutdown completely.

Judges don't get to make up new rights and grant them to the citizens in any democracy, because that makes it NOT a democracy.
If Amerircans want the 'right' to abortion, they're gonna have to get it via democratic representation, not via misuse of law to have an unelected, appointed branch of government create and grant it, like a Taliban council."
"because its was found that roe vs wade was based on ironically ""a woman telling lies"" due to that, law is clear the case must be overturned. 

so now if they want to murder their babies in utero then they have to go state level. 
still can't avoid, baby helping to kill mother, may still have a chance for rape babies. but either way, today is a good day because all the women who are protesting want is the right to both screw and cheat without consequences.. don't want kids 2 things you can do. 
Abstain or use birth control. 😂😂 great day."
OH YEA W’S IN THE CHAT
The US is slowly destroying itself from the inside out. The Republican influence is two hundred years behind the times and is dragging the country into serious division and conflict.
"Wow life and death. Serious consequences of death for an unborn human. 
Abortion clinic works McDonald's is hiring. Its better to feed people burgers and chicken then to kill what GOD has created. 
Yeah give life fill stomachs with life, not your pockets with death profiteering. Dont keep the horrors of fetal murder going. 
What person has the right privilege in FREE America to just dictate what life is or isn't. 
50 years ago a bunch of old, over the hill, already had families, morally deviant power brokers, made it ok to murder unborn human offspring. An entirety new money market of desperate emotional people manipulated into hating their own baby. 
A book said that a day would come when a woman would take their baby off their breast and throw  them in the fire, to eat.
Taking a life,that is know as life (from the beginning) by all people world over. 
Life is life. 
The byproduct of two humans a male and female is... male or female of combined  hunan genetic tissue. 
We call them new borns, baby's, inf"
American women will have to choose another contraception method.
ABORTION STILL EXISTS IN THE USA. The US Federal Government will return each individual State the Right to decide their own abortion laws for themselves.
Dumbest country on earth right now America. Woman are becoming a object over there now and those knobhead men going on about it.. they shouldn't even have a say over what woman can n cant do with her body. all them Crap wack states more like a CLUT overran by religious crap.. wont belong before they have the woman on collars and leashes
HAHAHAHHHHAHAHHAHHAHHAHA
plonkers. I rest my case. A planetary disgrace.
Take down that stupid article on your website about Billie Eilish and sack Mark Savage for poor journalism. Abortion was never a “constitutional right”. Complete lies by the BBC. Lies and poor journalism. No wonder people don’t believe anything you write anymore.
"So you are telling me people can’t just go around and have sex and get pregnant and then murder an unwanted child?? 

What a decision ! Great ruling !"
"Is abstaining from sex murder? After all, it's preventing life from coming into being and must surely, therefore, be a 'sin'?"
Vagina people now will think twice before looking for adventures  🤭 or just move to the blue states.
Life is the most precious thing and although I understand the desires of females to kill the fetus life is the most important thing. The unimaginably precious baby is the most important thing and although the desires of women to want to have wonton sex and not have to be a mother and be obligated to the baby is understandable the right to life of the baby supersedes all other human desires or wants.
"pfff pro-life woman said ""we build a better world"" - really???? did you pass the law about free contraception? or free baby formula?? or anything to actually HELP those unwanted kids ? vomiting."
"Pro life message, you csn not have an abortion but you can buy a semi autonmatic weapon. Once you are born, you are on your own."
Build a better Gilead more like...
The BBC is giving too much time to the forced-birthers. Why is THEIR picture on the thumbnail?
Another country were everything is policed.... except crime.
"Pro abortionists only have to attend one abortion to turn totally against it. Imagine pulling a baby to pieces with forceps, and putting the body parts on a tray so they could be counted. That is what abortion is! Nothing but murder! I totally support freedom of choice: If you made the decision to have sex, live with the consequences. No-one has the right to terminate another's life"
"Well for those who voted for it, I hope you don’t get raped then up the duff. Every human being is unique in their body and it should always be the woman’s individual choice, this is just Christian’s/ rich powerful home wreckers forcing their opinions on people. Left wing c**ts…"
My body my choice. 🖕
"That anyone ever thought they had a right over someone else’s life is obscure, that the BBC would defend a right to kill is atrocious."
"As a pro-choice Attorney, the Court made the correct decision. Abortion was never a Constitutional right. Abortion is a political issue better left for each State and their voters to decide. The decision does not preclude a woman’s right to travel to a state that allows abortion."
And they say America is freedom
biden needs to arrest the pedophiles and rapist and stop protecting them
"I get it abortion after a certain length of pregnancy is wrong but what about if the mothers life is at risk? What about ectopic pregnancy? A septic uterus? Or a miscarriage that your body won’t release is abortion! this why I love Islam because it’s a religion full of wisdom, in Islam you can have a abortion if the mothers life is at risk."
"they will brake laws now trying to play   god or shall we say kill babies .
the baby is innocent 
so are th victims the only one who should get a life of pain in jail are the rapists"
"Hmm wasn’t the US built on separation of Church and State?, they’ve done it again, embarrassed themselves in front of the world."
America is the devil
"Disgusting, I thought America was a farce already but this is just ridiculous"
This is not about pro-life; it’s about anti-woman.
And you call it civilized countries?
Ye coz not like we're in a climate and food and population crisis. What we need is a huge rise in kids people can't afford to feed or ouse
why is the BBC promoting this 🤔?
‘Jesus loves the little children” Disgusting. Who do these people think they are to force their religion on others.
Backward country
Why do I only see older white women supporting the Courts ruling.
"Make no mistake, for the Republican leaders behind this, it was NEVER about the rights or wrongs of abortion.  It was always about CONTROL.  They don't give a damn about unborn babies, and never did.  They want to control every minute aspect of your lives, and the gullible, naïve pro-lifers are handing them that control on a plate."
Open Padma bridge 🌉 bangladesh world record 🌍
Leftists do a good job showing why they should never make any decisions.
"For abortions to be legal both the man and woman should agree to the abortion. The choice was made to conceive when you were ragged all over for 15mins. If you were raped you should also be allowed an abortion. 

You do not have a right to an abortion because as soon as you use advanced medical knowledge to induce abortion it is no longer a right. 

You have a right to water, it does not have to be clean."
The yanks need more budding shooters pew pew pew
NOT ABORTIONS
Next thing the American law makers will do is probably make their females wear a burka
Very good decision
They should have banned Jesus instead:)
"That’s right US. Just let more woman have children so they can go to school and get murdered by some nutter with a gun. 

Great! How about overturn the gun laws before being ‘pro-life’"
"Good. common sense prevails. seems like the Supreme Court is our last line defence against and at the minute it’s holding up. Next, Phizer……. No wait, we won that too 😉 STOP WEF"

America are the richest 3rd world country in the world from the gun laws to health care to now this so happy i dont live in such a fucked up country with braindead people
"Different countries, different rules. Who are we in the UK to dictate our views on others."
"There never was a right to an abortion! It’s not in the bill of rights nor is it in the constitution. The Supreme Court misinterpreted back in the early 70’s the 14th Amendment of the  Constitution which as of yesterday was rectified. Abortion was not eliminated, but thrown back to the individual states to make their own minds up if they want legalized murder in their State. So please don’t read into this that which is not there!"
Very happy news. Killing is not a right.
I wonder if Jesus will feed them as he loves them so much. This makes me so mad. Is it not better to terminate a pregnancy when the parents can't look after it. I really don't understand this decision and it has definitely made America seem more backward in the eyes of the rest of the world.
Pro life believers and protestors must start by abolishing war first to prove that they are all genuine.
America is going backwards instead of progressing. Sad day. Religion in favour of science by a bunch of fundamentalists.
if your terrified girl use a rubber
As a lot of people have said I’m sure women don’t have an abortion lightly. Will all those protesting about abortion now devote their lives to looking after the children that will now be born? And not even if a woman has been raped or through incest? Insanity.
"Do we 'like' the win, or 'dislike' the hysterical news reporting? Choices choices."
The US is coming back to moral standards. Yes there is hope
Land of the free..
no one would screw either of those women unless they needed a green card or food stamps.....reality 101
Love the BBC but first time giving thumbs up for this story. R vs W struck down!
Women and girls who have been raped will be forced to have that baby. The foster care system and orphanages are already overwhelmed and underfunded. Pro lifers don't care about these babies after they are born.
"People are upset because they can no longer kill their own baby in the womb. President Ronald Regan famously said - “I've noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.” Over 60 million defenceless babies overwhelmingly Murdered in the womb for convenience in the USA alone, and from people who were given the chance to be born.
When a woman has an Abortion, she's not killing her own body, she's killing someone else's body."
"Again, BBC fake news, not all US states will ban abortion. This is a victory of good over evil so naturally the BBC is pissed off."
Anyone else sit on the fence on this? Could argue both ways?
How sad while others can’t bare children
The abortion industry trading in the body parts of babies is disgusting
"America : Ban abortion - abortionists are murderers!
Same America: Protect our rights to easily own guns!"
Very good decision by the supreme Court of America..... God bless America..... Moral and etical values must be preserved for the betterment of humanity
“I’ve seen the devastation that abortion has brought on our country” what.. Jesus Christ some people are retarded
"This is the world just going backwards in the first instance,it will just send women back underground to get abortions. Are we not ment to be progressive society not a backward one. The person that started the campaign probably has stepped back from the issue. I pray that all the people against it never have something happen to them that could result in the ever needing one, if they look to most religions does it not show that god gives people the right to choose which path they take?. This is so ignorant and stupid that this has happened. I can see a big reset happening,have we not learned anything??"
Amen stop 🛑 killing children 👶
"It's a good thing. That they did this, it gives an opportunity to the whole world, to observe,what happens,in next few years. It's better to learn from other's mistakes, then your
own."
"ABORTION WAS NOT STRUCK DOWN! Each state just gets to independently decide if it will be legal in their state now. This is how democracy works. The more liberal states will allow abortions, but now, more pro-life states get the choice to ban it legally if they wish. This is a big win for democracy and freedom. The media makes it sound so bad but it is quite the opposite, yet again!"
The USA is a backwards theocracy. Who knew?
Amen stop 🛑 killing young children 👶
👼🙏👼🙏👼🙏👼🙏👼🙏
Yes!!! No more death to babies!
What overturning same sex marriage??
America is a third world country
Mentally ill people
This is absolutely terrifying. I feel fortunate to not have been born is US
Excellent news. No more killing babies
"stupidity has frontiers, mexico and canada."
"Wow, Congratulations!"
"Look at those ""Activists""!!"
The anti abortionists should have been aborted.
"Oh brilliant!  Child services can't keep kids safe now, how will they cope with thousands more babies born to mothers who don't want them?  I hope the government up funding for the repercussions to come."
funny all those girls happily crying against abortion look like the girls that will never get pregnant of have a boyfriend..
It's amazing to know that less and less babies of colour will be aborted now <3
You can not blame the child for your actions it’s real simple
No greater evil than abortion.
"come to your senses, women will still continue to get rid of UNWANTED pregnancies, but those who need it - will have to do it illegaly while facing a real life treatening danger (because not done in proper medical facilities) and health consequences. better choice is to provide free contraception or/and baby food! but no, you wont do it..."
"If a women is raped the child is innocent , 3-4 years mandatory minimum sentence for rape. The women gets pregnant 🤰10 - 15 years ! Punish the men who do this ! Don’t murder children 🧒"
Bunch of fat ugly woman who will never get pregnant unless they pay on the pro life team 🤣
"Wow I wish people would understand before commenting, maybe if the BBC didn’t falsely headline they might, abortion has not been made illegal, the law has simply been pushed back to the individual states to decide whether it can be done in that particular state, yes some states will make it illegal but others won’t"
"Who else wonders how Americans do barely anything to stop the 45,000 people who die of gun-related deaths every year, but are happy to take away the rights of women to stop a few abortions."
"Why is the world going against the logic  it’s taken us thousands of years to reach ? 

Everyone is a hero campaigner 

Get over yourselfs not your body"
"they always isolate these victims, overall abortion rights helps destroy the family model and endorses unethical relationships"
America has a good heart at its core after all. And I’ve seriously never felt appreciative of Trump.
"Look at all those transphobes claiming that abortion is a ""woman's issue"". Bunch of TERFS."
Genuine question....How many of the Supreme Court are men??
Condom sale 📈
"So if a woman gets pregnant from rape, she has to have the baby and raise it? Will she also be forced to allow the dad ( rapist) rights to see the baby? Good job America."
"Did that Jennifer Thomson just say it’s heart breaking that she has to turn these irresponsible women away and then says I’m sorry if your boy friend beats you up every day and rapes you you will have to find another way, No if your dumb enough to stay with a man that beats you and rapes you everyday or every other day then you can’t complain. Another girl said I’m 21 and scared well act and make responsible decisions then 
Those two women said we thought this country cared about people and women NOT AT ANYTIME DID SHE MENTION ABOUT THE LITTLE HUMAN INSIDE THE WOMB 🤦🏾‍♂️ AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE RIGHT HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY SOMEONE HAS TO THINK ABOUT THE LITTLE PERSON."
"Abortion has never been in the American constitution. This is pure misinformation, nothing more."
"America do not care about ‘life’, the government/corporations must need  more bodies in prison & children in care to keep their profits up...This is wrong, women should have access to safe abortion care...

The interesting thing is, America do not give free contraception and the very people protesting against abortion are the ones who are against welfare and free medical care, To force someone to keep a child they do not want is a recipe for disaster, this is a crime against the poor"
This is gonna ruin the porn industry 🤣
That’s the end for the wicked evil planned parenthood organisation
Those who support and carry out abortion for reasons other than medical are murderers. Shame to you. Woe to them!
"""Times's Up"" for the hateful ideology called Feminism."
I agree with this Abortion unless it is for medical reasons is Murder ! Take responsibility for your sexual behaviour Men and women ! We as a race take sex far too casually
"What a load of crap, anyone wanting to kill babies can still go to another state and get it done. Majority of states still allow it but the way some of these people talk it’s like they want to use it as a contraceptive. And some want it all the way up to birth. Sick."
"The God of creation said 
                       Be fruitful and multiply
Read Holy Bible👉Genesis 1:28"
"Interesting how Americans are anti-abortion because it 'murders' unborn foetuses, but are pro-guns despite having school shootings every other week. Double standards much. They sure like to control other people but dont want the same treatment themselves."
About time. It'll be either Russia or Trump's fault no doubt.
"A sad day for women and their right to choose. I see too many women pregnant from abuse, rape and violence. What choice have these women got? Now to be reminded on a daily basis of what has and will continue to happen.
Ok America, tighten up your laws.. if you need to.. .. big mistake making it illegal.  You have set women’s  freedom of choice back 50 years. Put us back to being second class citizens… what next.. removing woman’s right to vote? 
Shame on you!"
"And it’s getting? to big to ignore ,why so many at the BBC are allowed to still use Blackface when presenting these things."
if women were not given the choose or don't have the money to take care of kid what are they meant to do now? not right.
"this is horrible. coming back to a stone age, where women had no right to open a bank account or get an education....("
This is good
What an inflammatory headline!
"‼️‼️‼️
I am not religious. Just consider thinking something. 

If you come across a child with terminal illness, consider asking her whether she would have liked to die before she was born. I think you know her answer. She'd be glad to being able to see the world albeit in pain.

When a life is conceived, without forceful intent (say rape), you no longer OWN that life. Just like a human/animal has every right to live, an unborn baby, who has no capacity to take the decision on their part, should not be killed, UNLESS she is killed by natural reasons or is a risk to her mother's life. 


Please have common sense before starting to exercise your all entitling attitude."
"I get this but also don’t, people getting knocked up left and right don’t deserve abortions but if it’s life threatening for the woman then I feel it should be legal. This is a horrible decision. They should’ve made laws to abortion like it it’s life threatening let them get it but if the child is healthy and the woman won’t suffer from said birth I feel they shouldn’t have an abortion. I also feel if they get raped they should have the option."

such a messed up country. all of these rape and incest babies will have the right to bear arms in less than 20 years. you can almost guarantee more school shootings.
America is truly backwards. One day it's ok to have guns and kill children in schools the next a woman can't  make a choice over her own body. Don't you ever criticize other countries! The world is laughing at you.!!!!!

The supreme court said this was going to happen even before they had a chance to hear the case.  Let the church pay taxes to support all the children that this will produce. They have had a free ride for to long.
Now rapists can do their thing without the threat of having their sperm wasted. Praise Jesus!

"This judgement is not just about the right to abortion. It is the removal of the right to destroy a child, right up to the moment of a full term, natural birth. An abortion, as we know it in the UK, is the termination of a pregnancy where the Foetus does not have a heartbeat and is incapable of independent movement. Overturning Roe V Wade was removing the right to murder viable children. Also, the 'rights' to abortion enshrined in Roe V Wade were in the process of being expanded to ban police from investigating and prosecuting infant mortality of children under the age of 28 days (after birth). Abortion law was never in the purview of federal Government. The US constitution demands that anything not specifically covered in the bill of rights should be adjudicated at the state level, where the time limits will be set by elected representatives and local electors can influence the decisions. The BBC know this. Presenting the decision of the SCOTUS as an infringement of the human rights of women is a deliberate act of deception. It is nothing of the sort. It is about preventing the willful murder of children."
God this is scary !! It’s like going backwards .
"Good job, Supreme Court!😊 Abortion mustn't be considered as a right. As killings are in many ways, anti abortion measure restricts one of those ways.😉"
"Not too sure why people are getting bent out of shape over this ruling, let’s be honest, 99% of women in the US won’t even think about having an abortion, the undesirable 1% who blame everyone else for their demise will suffer only. If you’ve been raped, that’s a whole different issue where it should be allowed."
"I am pro-life, but also pro-using the term ""birthing people""."
"""Extreme""... ""radical""... This is all we hear from the left.

""Finally, we've criminalised murder""... is all we hear from the right.

This isn't about whether abortion is right or wrong, its about whether the people should decide this. This is the way the USA was supposed to be before they started federalising everything."
WHO cares its gumpland  nobody CARES
"""Jesus loves the little children."" Yeah, that's why he allowed so many of them to be killed in Uvalde right? Right?"
God has opened the ear of American leader. Abortion is a murder and murder is a biggest sin.
"And the Catholic Supreme Court has done it again! another great morally correct action under 
the eyes of the morally right conservative republicans...
No to abortion. No killing of fetuses..only grown ups.  That explains why the same Supreme Court 
will let  everybody in NY to get a gun now... Let's go!  
I wonder if God would be a fair guy and let these Justices  have their daughters and wives raped and 
forced to carry the criminal's baby in their womb for 9 months..and then give birth, raise and 
support that child for the rest of their lives. 
I would like to see that. 
America great country, for some."
Silent killer finally come to an end
"Abortion is sometimes an unavoidable choice, but not a right. Don't be arrogant. No one has the right to kill a person. For example, is the choice to stop a ventilator in a person with brain death a right? It is sometimes an unavoidable choice, not a right. Don't be arrogant."
Arguing about women will die? but babies dying are okey?

We have a fool for a president.
"I'm curious what Ireland thinks about this, since they're the most traditionally anti-abortion nation."
My first reaction?  Hallelujah.  At last the tide is turning in favour of the unborn child.  There may well be a return to backstreet abortions and women may travel to other States who defy this 'strike down' but what doesn't seem to be mentioned here are the millions of lives lost since Roe -v- Wade was introduced; millions of lives whose taxes could have funded even Obamacare; the workforce who could have kept the US going; and NOT A WORD about women who have had terminations and lived to regret their choice.
Americas clapped anyways
It means that millions of unborn babies Will have a chance at life.
"Leftist marxist atheists and media are the enemies of own country. Anti-nationals. Fifth columnists. 

Leftist marxist atheists support illegals over citizens. Insult tax paying real citizens. Disrespect elected leaders. Kill patriotism. 

Destroy individuals. Destroy families. Destroy trust, innocence. Destroy friendship, goodness, holiness, modesty, puriry, honesty. 

Support infanticide in wombs. 

Made beasts out of individuals reducing to below animal status. Made mockery of individual value. Made mockery of marriage. Made to distrust people. Make controversies out of nothing. 

Leftist marxist atheism curriculum taught in schools and universities that life is meaningless, purposeless, we are random bag of molecules, complex chemical dust. Leading to depression and suicide. 

Atheism raised rebellious, depressed people, fatherless children depriving love and affection they deserve. Atheism brought lack of love, insecurity, stress, trauma, abuse, loneliness, lack of kindness, burning businesses, looting, attacking Police. 

In face of superior argument, the inferior argument becomes violent. 

Donald Trump vs low cognitive Joe Biden coverage palpable of bias. Dangerous selective reporting. 

How good it will be if controversies not manufactured in first place. 

Leftist marxist atheists are gutless to condemn Islam terrorists. 
But overt Christophobes. Attack Christians knowing their non-retaliatory stand. Imagine if the majority community becomes violent and rebels 

Atheists destroy the good work great institutions do or doing. But have no alternative or willingness or motivation or intention or reference to help or do themselves. Good at destruction, not construction. 

Living in prosperous cozy Christian foundational non-retaliatory countries and becoming celebrities. 

Atheists if you have spine go live and criticize Islam, and other religions in their countries and become even more popular. 

Atheists please show your credentials by moving to and transforming undeveloped or Islamic country in to a prosperous country. By make legal immigrants as illegals. Open the borders. Drug traffickers, Muslims, Islamic supremacist, illegals are welcome, and protected. Zero rallies/protests against Muslims or zero legal actions if they are against LGBT or refuse to bake gay wedding cakes or refuse to sell pork. Zero investigations on Islamic institutional child abuse. Zero criticism of Muslim hypocrisy. Laissez-faire. Burning and looting businesses are peaceful protests, not crime. Christophia is constitutional right. Defund police to non-existence. Global cooling. Create utopia. Without copying Jesus Christ principles of equality, human value, human dignity. Then rest of world will have bragging rights to praise you and undying respect for atheism. 

Atheism already destroyed Soviet Union, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela etc. Wants to destroy every country. Atheism is proven failed ideology. 

Atheists Hitler, Himmler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, Ceausescu etc killed millions of own cirizens. 

Have no morals as reference point, should have no right to make decisions affecting majority. 

Praise celebrities shamelessly cover their dirty deeds and critize every other. 

Discuss a problem with 'expert panel', blame vehemently all others, but ignore the root cause ie evil pre-existing in everyone. 

Have the conclusion written first to blame a target group, and then find favorable witnesses to pretend justifications. 

Atheism never produced a line that is comforting on a death bed. 

That's why I left atheism. 

Reject marxist atheism. They transform communities to worst than third world countries. 

And remember old times, original godly roots and foundations, there is profit in it. Each individual is fallen, broken to core already and needs healing, purpose, meaning, acceptance, forgiveness, hope, eternity which are available for free."
50 Years of murdering babies.
"in america, woman are considered to be ......nothing"
"No abortion allowed? Good, then gentlemen, please sterilize after you have a satisfactory number of children"
Imagine a women whom got rape and is deny abortion!
"""Right"" to kill children in the womb struck down by US Supreme Court."
"So if a woman was r*ped, then she has to deal with 38 weeks of the baby growing. Whoa"
Another ludicrous piece of legislation by the US — what a bunch of emotive fatbangers.
"But what if a woman is raped? Just imagine the awful experience of having to look after that child or having to sadly give the child away. Also imagine the awful increase of population.

It’s better to remove it when it’s inside the woman then to kill it when it’s and fully grown and released. To think so many mothers will now end the baby’s life as it’s released into the world as they are now unable to abort it.

To think these children will now grow up much worse and in much more awful experience as foster homes increase and of course violence will arrive."
These are sex mad they will kill for it!
Trump wins even when not in office.
"there's no constitutional right to abortion, once again the bbc lying and twisting the truth, the bbc side with baby killers."
"""care"" = killing children according to this report"
"The problem here is that woman can't make decisions on whether they want to have a kid or not any more, for someone who doesn't want kids, why force them to have one, yes, sure don't get pregant, dump that guy, blah blah,  but things happen yet we don't get to decide what we can do any more. For women who are living on the street, or drug addicts when they have babies, the babies will be drug babies, they will have behavioral problems due to drug abuse from the mothers..If a drug addict doesn't want to keep the baby, she should have her own right to do abortion safely, I don't see anythign wrong with it, it's cruel to force someone to have a child when they don""t want .....Some hypocrites just simiply thinking killing a fetus is wrong, but forcing someone to have babies is wrong too! Not mention there are other reasons...it's never black and white.. regardless, taking away this option , is not right.."
How can they chat and cheer for life when their gun reform laws are a total joke. The right to kill if you think person was worthy of dying. So corrupt. Absolute stupid logic this. It’s all about pissing the demos off and vis versa. All about funding their individual states. Raging at this. Absolutely raging.
"Thank God, their right to murder has been withdrawn!"
It's hard to defend abortion and also hard to be anti abortion. One side it could kill the mother and on the other your killing a helpless baby so fucked all around really.
"disgusting that state court DOES NOT fulfill the will of the MAJORITY. 

This is only the will of the few - career polititions and overpowered JUDGES.

@$#//%"
All the anti-abortionists deserve to be raped and impregnated by paedophiles.
"Well, since life begins at conception, how can a person scientifically and scriptural deny that it is not an embryo. You see dead things do not grow. It is that simple. When Jehovah God was speaking with the prophet Jeremiah, he told the young prophet in Jeremiah 1:5 that when he was forming Jeremiah in the belly of his mother that ""I knew you"". Jehovah could read the ""spirit in the bones in the belly of her who is pregnant"" (Ecclesiastes 11:5). In the book of Romans 9:11-13  Jehovah read the ""spirit"" in the bones if you will, of both Jacob and Esau. In Psalms 139:13-16 King David wrote about Jehovah saw even King David's embryo. Life starts at conception, cause dead things don't GROW. If two men got into a fight and in the process of fighting they caused a pregnant woman to have a miscarriage and the fetus died, one or both of them had to forfeit their lives (Exodus 21: 22-23). All these scriptures show how the Creator, Jehovah God views the growing embryo in the belly of her that is pregnant. He views them as a living human. Human life. Human child. Killing the child inside the belly of her that is pregnant is from the Creators standpoint, murder. To see what the Bible says on the topic of abortion, and so much more, simply go to the totally free, most translated website on the Internet, no sign in or out, no registration, no information gathered on you, all browsing and downloads are free, private. Please go to JW.org"
Finally the mass killing of unborn babies ..is STOPPED.  The US is  now a better country today.
use contraception its not that hard
In reality women really want abortions as a safety measure for the bad decisions they take.
"Just think about how many kids there are in foster care, or who are not wanted and are living a shitty life. The mothers dont abort the child because they find pleasure in killing children. What if the mom seriously cant provide a healthy life for the kid? There are already enough kids in foster care, abortion is not murder.

Edit: Plus why the hell are people worrying about other people buisness and abortions anyways? It aint your child or buisness so stay the heck out of it."
"Close to million babies are murdered by abortion every year in the USA. 
That is horrific, there’s no reasonable argument that can defend this casual destruction of human life"
They always try to use black people abortion is not a black issue. It's a white woman issuec
"Psalms chp127:3, children are a gift from the Lord the fruit of the womb a reward."
This will end up in South Park
"yes, it is very extreme to rule that murder is not a ""right."" It is extremely good and virtuous."
Democrats are going to lose a lot more if they don't start paying attention to black people's needs
"It seems your right to life ends when you leave the womb, enter the schoolrooms and get a bullet in your head from a Far Right extremist that likely preached at one of these rallies against abortion."
"Turkey do hair transplants, dentist work and now abortions. The care system is about to be overwhelmed by kids being dumped on them and expect the suicide rate to increase.  The fact someone could be raped  then forced to carry a child is going to have serious implications. America is about to fall"
Weird how the people that scream about saving the planet say that the future generations to come don’t deserve the right to life??🤷‍♂️
https://youtu.be/LrBI4rtivyo 🎉
US always was lying cretin and agressive country. Punishment is coming for mlns killed people in the world.
"Just phrase by the news lady ""guaranteed right to abortion"" killing a young child is a constitutional right?, i get there could be exceptions like when it saves the life of a mother, but to phrase it as a right is no bueno 😐"
Abortion is not healthcare. It's murder.
This is why I have never wanted to move to the US. The evangelicals which Trump has piled into the courts will destroy that country.
"Trumptards: dont restrict my rights to guns!

"This is a Great Victory for Men & for our Female Warriors ( who want to be men too ), for they have struck a Great Blow towards the destruction of Democracy & the ability to choose for ones self.  HURRAH !  For Men Rule Women That Bit More Now.
If I could become the elected leader of thinking women ( who want to stay women ), I would recommend they no longer have Sex with Men until the Movie 'Suffragette 2 ' is released !   Where the plot has been changed to remove Womens ability to Vote !.......... Dun Dunn Duuunn !

There will be no Limits to the amount of absurdity I could unleash on the General Population.
1/  I would create Laws to force Men to pay child support for children they didn't want & couldn't afford.
2/  I would create childrens homes to look after all the unwanted children, that even the ' Anti-Abortionists' wouldn't look after, this in turn would financially cripple the cities.  Where America would eventually F&*k themselves into financial ruin.
3/  Arrest you for being a Murderer when you leave my State for another to have an Abortion there.   Don't Come back if you leave.

Everyone knows, There's Nothing More Democratic than Voting to have your Medical Options taken away from you.
I would feel the need to sit back and watch the Movie that Hollywood makes out of it all...  Starring the Old Cast from the original ' Look Who's Talking ' Movie.

I will order my Popcorn now... And prepare for the New Era which will come to be known as... 'The Great Times of Mazturbaishin'."
"Banning/outlawing activities or goods doesn't make them disappear, it merely makes them go underground (and it greatly increases the cost/risk). It's not a question of letting abortions happen vs. not happen, because they will happen regardless. The question is: Should they be safe (legal abortion), or should they be dangerous (illegal abortion)? Think of drugs, even alcohol, and the toll society has paid when substances were rendered illegal. It boggles the mind that the U.S., at least a part of it, is still living in the distant past compared to the rest of the modern world."
Don't like the verdict? Keep your legs closed. UNBORN LIVES MATTER!!!!
It is a great day...at last the unborn defenseless babies have protection from being murdered...
98% of all women aborting got pregnant as a result of sex before mirrige aka adultery.
"Everyone has the right to live, especially innocent life."
Abortion was never a right. It's not in the Constitution anywhere.
"A good time to watch ""Junior"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger is this weekend."
"For normal  women and girls who consider having an abortion it’s  very traumatic to have an abortion. I can’t imagine anyone is having an abortion lightly. But in some situation, like pregnancy through rape, poverty, illness, etc. it should be there as a last resort and as early as possible. Making that decision for others is unfair. Are the people making that judgement also happy to foster, adopt, support poor mothers.
Plus the system as it is is atrocious, getting worse for most Americans, especially children. Crap education, housing or even homelessness, crime, violence, rising living cost, lack of employment, abandonment, abuse by their carers, failing social child protection services. And there seemed to be far too many children abused even killed."
Use and demand a condom to prevent pregnancy
"Before it gets out of hand realse the federal right was struck down. So it's like England, Wales, Scotland and N. Ireland get to decide individually on abortion. That's it."
Right to kill!! I mean US has abortion mills and that is the nation that want to tell muslims how to behave.
"How about encouraging abstinence , responsible relationship choices and marginalising the  casualisation  of sex 
They will reduce cases"
It must be awful waking up each morning and realising that you are an American.

The religious republicans in the US are no better than the Taliban - complete nutters obsessed by what they think God thinks is right
"Abortion is the ultimate expression of Hypergamy. Gynocentrism isn't just a ""western thing"", it is global, and women worldwide will fight tooth and nail for the right to be absolved of bad reproductive decisions."
got to save them in the womb so they can die in the classroom
It’s ironic that all those pro abortion were never aborted themselves.
The USA- land of the backwards
"America leaves Afghanistan, now half of it is run by the Taliban. Ironic?"
"You can feel sorry for them all you like- but the left wanted FULL TERM ABORTION. Yes, that’s killing a fully formed baby that just hasn’t been born yet. Some leftist states had even aborted babies after they had just been born. That’s murder no matter how you dress it up. No one has a right to do that."
There will be anarchy in the streets.
World is getting f**ked up everyday
"American has too many right and it better to cut some off to set boundaries . Use protection if you desire to have sex and if you are rape the innocent child isn't the victim here . People should wake up .
What about the women that dies everyday from abortion . To that need to be discussed right
God bless America 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
And there is Biden reading from an autocue again. Man can’t speak a sentence on his own.
"I'm in the USA, when Trump won in 2016 it became a very scary, nasty place. Today reminds us of his Fascist regime!"
Let’s be honest the woman shown here don’t even have kids
"Great... Massive inflation, so they brought abortion rights to the front of news.
Smoke curtain to draw attention from what is going on."
"The ironic thing is, this will lead to leftist rioting, looting and burning in leftist states, where in those states abortion is still legal. They are going to literally burn their own stuff down."
USA just a third world country wearing a Gucci belt
They are evolving just backward 🤡🤡
BBC fake news. Abortion is not in the constitution and the supreme Court has only relegated the Abortion decision to state levels. This is a great win for Donald Trump 👏 👍.  In Trump we Trust.
"Wrong!

Rights only exist when given by government...

...there are No Natural Rights..!

SCOTUS did not ban abortion...

It gave that “Decision-power” to the States...!

Factually incorrect and Biased...!"
you mean i cant sleep around and just abort the consequences? DIE CONSERVATIVES
That's a lie. They have not been totally reversed
😂 karma! too many opinions on other women from other parts of the world.
"Well, they have to keep those classrooms full for the shooting sprees..."
"Get ready for a summer of leftist (see fascist) idiots in their monkeypox masks (easier to hide from the CCTV) protesting (see rioting) in various cities across the US. Obviously, this won't occur in their own back yard as their leftist cities will still allow abortions regardless of the ruling as they are state controlled. Expect death threats, violence, damage to government buildings and local businesses. Oh and of course let's not forget the killing of babies too. Tolerance at it's finest!"
there seems to be  a lot of supreme court  justices when asked about the Roe v wade question simply lied.
"June 24 the day that the unborn got their civil rights and protection from being unjustly murdered by sexually Irresponsible degenerates, who refuse to take responsibility for their actions."
"It will still be in the hands of the people. When half are for it and half are against it, it is best for the States to decide."
Abortion groups must mind that they would be disappeared if their mom own it
go to hell this women
This is ever the most bloody violation to woman's right in 21st century. Your Americans had better shut up by mentioning any human rights from now on. So hypocrite and dishonest. What a joke!
Abortion rights for trans women !
"2:17 ""I am 21 and I am terrified"" 
Hmmm...you are not terrified killing a baby but you are terrified cuz your right to kill the babies is taken away? Oh my...what on earth is going on?"
Murder is murder!
Now women learn word - responsibility
"America:No abortions
School shootings:thoughts and prayers 

It's a joke they value ""life"" until it comes into the world"
"The Supreme Court did not make abortion illegal. The ruling was to say the Supreme Court did not have the right in the first place to make this law. They were correcting what was in effect and illegal law at the time in 1973.

The Supreme Court are basically saying you in the Congress must pass the abortion law. It was not the responsibility or the legal right of the Supreme Court to create a law that permitted abortion in 1973.

Joe Biden of course is squirming away from his responsibility as the president as are the Democratic party. They are blaming the court when they as the elected party, can immediately table their bill to legalise abortion across all states.

It's the classic cowardly politician a bit like what happens here in Britain, where they want to point the finger somewhere else when in fact it lies with the elected government.

The principal would be as if our own Supreme Court in the United Kingdom wrote a law and implemented it without Parliament having agreed to the writing of the law and without the Supreme Court having the power to implement the law.

Once again, we see Poor journalism from the BBC who do not represent the truthful facts of how this issue has come about but simply advocate for abortion. It doesn't even get into the deep moral issues around the rights of a child. Remembering that in some states, the abortion law allows the killing of a child right up to the point it leaves the womb where effectively, the child would otherwise be viable outside of the womb had it been born naturally.

we should also remember that there are a wide range of contraception which should prevent pregnancy in the first place if a woman wants to manage her risks in a more effective way. I recognise that in America, there may be challenges around that given that healthcare is not free at the point of provision.

we should also recognise that we are actively killing a human being. The deep challenge of course is when does that collection of cells moving towards fetal development become ""a human being"".

The ethical problem is that we are saying women's rights are greater than those of a dependent child when women do actually have the alternative contraception options to prevent the pregnancy in the first place. Of course, there should be exceptions such as rape or criminal abuses towards women where abortion should be in place along with all of those issues of clinical risk. 
The rights of the person who is not yet born versus the rights of the woman who has power over the unborn person is the stress test of society. it feels to me that ""abortion"" has become more like another contraception option where a woman has failed to make proper contraception plans to prevent pregnancy in the first place.

and yes, God forbid, I am saying that women do have ""responsibility"" to manage contraception. Responsibility in today's world seems to be something that belongs to someone else."
"So what about a woman who has been raped? Should they be forced to keep the child? Yes it is not the child's fault but it is not the woman's fault neither - she did not ask to be raped, so therefore, she should have the right to an abortion."
Quick one as Im the other side of the world. If you can travel state lines for an abortion legally if it’s illegal in your state. Does that mean they can now cross state lines to buy cannabis for the same reasons?
"Remember when alcohol was banned in the early 20th century? It didn't stop people drinking alcohol. People illegally made and sold booze all over the place. Same thing's happening here. Banning abortions will not stop them, it will only make them more dangerous by being preformed by people who aren't trained doctors."
"1. Prove its not a baby and just a cluster of cells and I would agree with abortion. 

2. If it has a heart, a brain and can feel pain (after 8-9 weeks) there is no logical reason why anyone should be allowed to kill a baby particularly when 99%+ of abortions are preventable and 100% are preventable after 8 weeks when a baby can feel pain by doing just 1 pregnancy test a month (£6 max) when sexually active.

3. If you are having protected sex and do 1 pregnancy test a month (£6) when you are sexually active, no baby will need to feel pain for your sexual pleasure. How could anyone not do that? 

4. At least before 8 weeks you won’t be putting a baby through pain. 24 weeks in the uk or later in special circumstances is ridiculous. You can have a baby at 23 weeks and it has about a 50% chance of survival. Obviously killing a new born 23 week baby would be the worst crime imaginable but if the baby is in the exact same state and just hasn’t been delivered yet it’s seen as a great thing vital for woman’s rights?

5. If you are prepared to have sex be prepared to have a baby, no one should suffer for your sexual pleasure. 

I should also say that before I looked into it I was pro abortion but I think more people should be concerned about putting baby’s (or foetuses) through pain when this is preventable. We are living in a society of 0 accountability."
"These pro-choice devil's are the same animals who go round telling people that eating meat is murder yet they have no problem killing children 

Also, the Pro-choice devil's who are complaining that they have lost their right to choose.....it's very easy saying that because their already born"
Hoes mad.
US 🇺🇸 is taking in thousands of migrants every year why don't this women who want to abort luk after the children
"Another step towards fascism in America. 
After all, they based overturning this on right to privacy not being explicit. 
Everything else also tied to right to privacy in now under threat."
"Ironic that this court case came from Mississippi, a backwards state with high child poverty rates.  Congrats, Mississippi, you now are getting more kids to abuse and neglect."
"Good! Abortion isn't your plan A!

In a perfect world people could have abortions out of necessity - but over 200k abortions a year is a complete joke. Accidental pregnancies with condoms and the pill are individually 15/100 and 1/100 respectively - combined that number should be VERY low. But 200k accidental pregnancies a year, people are looking at abortion as if it was a right instead of a privlidge and a lot of inhuman animals abused the system by killing babies.

Good riddance, now you dogs will have to actually practice safe sex. The horror, right?"
Just take necessary precautions to not get pregnant. All acting like it’s inevitable that you’re going to get pregnant. About time woman took responsibility for once
We are not a representative democracy. We are an oligarchy. We are becoming a theocracy. And this will flame our divisions.
"Satanist's are crying, no more unborn babies to eat!!!!!!!!"
"Abortion is sick, if your big enough to create a life, you should be big enough to provide for a life.  I love my kids and never once have I or would I ever amagine my life without them."
This isn't the end. We continue to fight for OUR RIGHTS! Because this is about CONTROLLING PEOPLE AND TAKING OUR RIGHTS AWAY! 80% OF AMERICANS WANT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS TO BE THE LAND OF THE LAW!
"Time to rip out my uterus, too much of a liability in this country."
"There are ways to prevent pregnancy for those who don’t want, not taking precautions when possible is not wise enough , ending a pregnancy should not be taken lightly but should be considered carefully according to one’s situation"

"Interesting new development. My theory for the security,prosperity and insuring of liberty for the ''' Collective Of Western Civilization'' best at this Point In Time.

Good News is that Eye Love You. Calling for an immediate ceasefire !

That stated, read the following thrice carefully and and please only discerning, wise and questioning persons respond : Back in October 2019, as a World Peace Advocate, Independent Student Scholar of History, Geopolitics, Wars & Civilizations and Independent Security Analyst and Theorist HAD concluded that we ( North America, NATO member countries and THE WEST) are on a path towards WW3 due to the US-CHINA TRADE WAR begun by the Trump Administration back in early 2018, The Arrest of the CFO of Huawei Meng Whenzou by the RCMP in Canada in order to honor an extradition treaty with the USA, other geopolitical events, & the historical event known as Pearl Harbor. Concluding as an Independent Thinker, Analyst and Philosopher that we ( Humanity ) are on a Path Towards WW3 HAD created, designed & made a New Training Program produced to go hand in hand with a WW3 scenario. Thus, October 17 2019 HAD performed the 1st session of the General War Integrated Total Body Training System aka The 300 Workout integrated & in parallel to a near future timeline witch was the WW3 scenario. 93 Days later, the COVID 19 Crisis Began ! In parallel to my WW3 scenario witch is caused by a Stock Market Crash witch consequently triggers a Global Financial Collapse the Coronavirus began. Not sure what caused Covid believe it was snakes but cannot rule out another possibility. What do know is my scenario HAD a solution the creation of a New Institution : The International Citizen Integrated Social Security Force aka The Dragon Army witch am calling for the creation. Tell the Leaders of the Free World Dragon Zero's Message : Drop Down and give Dragon 13 pushups with Love & For The Sake of World Peace.

What say ye ? Will you join the Dancing Goddess & Dragon Kingdom for World Peace ? Can u support, volunteer, bless & love Adrian Hannah Dragon's World Peace Work ?"
"I am only alive because my mother’s back street abortion was unsuccessful in 1945. She hadn’t been raped or beaten when she got pregnant - to her, her pregnancy was simply a mere inconvenience.  Yet, in spite of the efforts to dismember me and kill me, I survived…. just. I died at the eventual birth but was resuscitated.  Even then she didn’t want me.  I am so grateful to be here 76 years later with four children and ten beautiful grandchildren who would never have existed if my death had been successful.  The unborn cannot speak or plead for their lives. It’s not just about ‘My body, my rights’ that pregnant mother’s body has another body/person inside her and that little one has no say. Now, thankfully, someone has spoken up for them to protect these little ones.  Its murder to kill another human being, whether that child is in the womb or out."
💔
About time !
"Unfortunately, since the Demacrats fear losing power,they are spearheading a movement to overthrow the supreme court.
You can tell it by there words. They have Loved the Supreme Court for the last fifty years, even said it was not political, but every honest American knows it is, and always has been.lol"
"Prolife believers want to save the fetus but once the child is born, literally the child is f$#@"
"Right to abortion = right to kill a person who can't speak for himself
unless it's for medical compulsion of life threatening for respective mother"
What surprise and terrifies me is that many ppl who are supporting banning abortion are women themselves. So pathetic
Maybe these dumbasses will stop shagging for 2 seconds and realise what a shithole the 1st world countries have become.  But then again.... we expect much from stupid people
"What part of the US constitution guarantees abortion, or the right to access medical care🤔"
"She just lied about the gay thing,they didn't say anything about the gays.ugh"
"As a pregnant man, I find this attack on mens rights very distressful"
"How embarrassing. The passage of this law is part of the war of religions against each other. They pass a law to protect the fetus. Women are seen as a bag in which future soldiers should grow. But, in the case of the hundreds of thousands of children who fall victim to violence and war every year, children who go to war by force, children who work on the streets, children who are trafficked for sexual purposes and organs, and dozens Another catastrophe,
The legislators and men of God are dumb and blind. Sorry! I forgot! Children victims of sexual harassment in the church. More than 300,000 victims a year, in France alone. Church leaders may need more children to meet their sexual needs. Maybe Handmade’s tale has already started."
Wow! The right to murder babies in the womb has been denied. All those would be murderers will have to stop having gratuitous sex or use contraceptives instead. SMH.
Omg so funny to watch 😁😁
End baby butchery!!!!!! Ban abortion mills!!!!!!!!!
6:17 the rape baby argument. We are using the 1% of cases to justify the other 99% healthy ones. 😒
"If you don’t wanna have a child, use protection but if it does happen that you get pregnant, see it as a gift of god and love that child no matter who the father is, how stressed your life is. That child can’t do anything about who the father is but will love whoever gives him/her love back like every mother and father should do."
The US is socially evolving backwards 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Fantastic news!!!!
"The separation of church and state is over, the USA is fucked."
"Yeah, Murica the Freedom Land 😂😂🤣🤣"
No.. the rights to abortion lies in the state that votes to have the rights of abortion.  That’s why local elections are important.  If you want to murder your child then vote for it.. if you don’t want to murder your child then vote against it. It’s that simple.
Good. Stop murdering babies it's disgusting. The fact people actually advocate to end babies lives is disgusting to me. The future generations will see this abortion culture one of the worst atrocities in human history.
I hope u can understand. The elites want your kids as slaves to theirs. They do not have your best interests at heart. Every three days the wipe their behinds with the constitution being constipated from the diet of kings.
"Taliban rules based on religion, same in US.
Human rights are missing.
Sad."
Pimping just got harder out here
These men better use protection!
"This is a great day in the history of the USA 💪 the killing  of babies has come to an end 💪 I know women in my community that have had abortions  6 to 8 times because they keep sleeping around with crappy junkies , useless men. If you believe that killing babies because of your hoe attitude is right you are a terrible human being"
How long will it take Planned Parenthood to send for planes to states like Texas to pick up girls during school hours without parental consent and wisk them off to the nearest slaughtering state but with the full cooperation of the schools?
The American people are becoming rich and they are forgetting the rules of religion. Prohibiting abortion seems to suffocate American citizens. But the American government has done well.
It's yea the video game industry is in control of everything so they are doing this and should be because abortion is torture.
"2:27 will of the people, I’m with you sweet heart, now the majority of Americans want the right to bear arms. 

So hands off the guns. Respect the will of the people right?"
Blacklist blocked Putin! do what we can do!
That's human against selfish monsters
Lies lies lies.  Don’t worry democrats you can still kill your children in all 50 states. It’s just up to the states on what restriction will be instituted. Some states like California Illinois New York say you can murder your children up to 9 months in the birth canal. Others say no.  Up to 5 months to kill your kids.  I hope this clarifies things
"It’s not everyday you witness a country regressing… Just wtf is going on, USA?"
Its simply Pathetic.... nothing but just pathetic
"Mothers will die as a result of this decision. Guaranteed.
Teen pregnancy will increase 
Child marriage will increase
Poverty will increase
There will be more malicious prosecutions
Republican states will have greater costs.
Young people that can afford to leave Blue states will leave, those that can't afford to will have babies they don't want, if they live"
"There is no such thing as ""abortion rights"". Abortion is the killing of babies. Is BBC a baby killer??  👹🧟"
Best tv drama ever: USA.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
"Perfect, the  rate of ungerage people in conflict with the law will surely boost the in the next 18 years."
"We're overpopulated, humans are a virus.  Many of the people that would want abortions wouldn't make the best parents.  So regardless of when a soul enters a body, we may as well allow abortion.  Who wants more Commies in the world, anyway?"
"So that's what a women is, I thought there were no sexes anymore."
"Maybe I'm wrong but,ban abortion = more soldiers, not worrying at all in today's climate."
IT'S NOWHERE IN THE CONSTITUTION!!!
"When all of the churches in the US have closed down and do not reopen, then we shall have democracy and freedom again."
Revival is coming to America
Just look at trans rights😔
"Abortion was never a constitutional right and actually violates the 4th amendment. It was an illegal act by the SCOTUS in 1973 by making it a federal law set right today and set the abortion issue back to the state legislatures, where it can be voted on for each state.  SCOTUS in 1973 only was to interpret the law, not make law. And that's exactly what they did, and it was a violation of the purpose of SCOTUS. Women have a choice with their bodies, not to have sex; since abortion is not birth control. Here in America we are giving the LORD all the glory for this victory."
Biden trying to be different 💀
It’ll bankrupt Republican red states with unwanted babies… Someone has to bathe them feed them and send them to school before they give them guns. And not any of them are going to vote Republican? 🤣
I am waiting for burning buildings and rioting in this peaceful protest.
Cassava leaves are very good for abortion
"Call it what it is, forced pregnancy. Disgusting"
The USA going backwards so much for the land of the free !
They are pro life and allowed people to be kill by those who are pro gun
The science labs don't need aborted feotus's anymore. They need to be responsible and not get pregnant in first place.
"USA, the nation where it's not ok to kill a human pre-tadpole BUT it's perfectly fine to shoot human adults...voted by the same crowd 🤯"
6 of the 9 judges followed the constitution it had nothing to do with their personal beliefs.They are supreme court judges there to interpret the constitution.
It's the dark ages
the president cant even bring down the price of gas.
Deus Vult
Life won today! Then they turn around and call for the death penalty. Ahhahaha oh the irony.
No where in the US constitution does it grant you the right to an abortion.
"From the US - WE ARE NOT POLARIZED. The majority of Americans want abortion to be legal. We are literally under minority, extremist rule.  6 religious extremists decided today that they don't like abortion so they overturned 50 years of legal precedent to make it so.

EDIT: They are going after gay rights next. And the right to contraception. And god knows what after that. This is what fascism looks like."
"why do many Americans fight so hard to stop a women's tragically hard choice on there body for whatever reason  they feel its  there only option is too end their pregnancy , but nobody riots or protest and courts don't even attempt   to try and overturn any of your assault weapons laws . im not trying too be rude or disrespectful as im not American so im just simply trying to understand the logic of some mom out there homeless ,or drug deepened ,raped abused many reasons besides a lazy birth control method where a women keeps getting pregnant and just keeps getting rid of baby that way is disgusting and should have tubes tied but as i was saying why is there so much passion in your country on the life of a mom its consider evil for her to end the fetus from growing but it almost seems less important to stop a person from killing classrooms of children why dont those moms who wanted their babies and just sent them too school not have the support of so many including courts too I change that law on assault weapons ?"
Is it that hard not to get pregnate
Watch this mad nation bring back segregation and prohibition within the next decade.
Why don’t women just goto another country for the procedure
I’m american and abortion was never a constitutional right!!60 million babies dismembered and slaughtered at the alter of convenience since ‘73 by immoral people that need to learn what morals and contraceptives are!!thankGOD in heaven it was struck down!!!
"Putting A MAN'S tenth child into mandatory servitude to the Early 
Catholic Church is the root of their views on mandatory procreation."
"I pity the Brits, law not based on facts. More tea, anyone?"
Can shoot full grown kids but lord forbid you kill a fetus
How awful! That country is going backwards…Wasn’t it called once “the land of the free”?! what a joke!
That’s good because all those innocent lives will be saved and they’ll have the opportunity to experience the world. Before they would have been killed. Millions of future lives have been saved. That’s wonderful!🙏🥳
"So , US in God we trust. UK God save the Queen. Who is God of Biden & Johnson? Blame or Praise?"
Fifty years backward on abortion rights and 150 years behind on gun control. Way to go USA. Donald Trump making America great again in the 19th century
"I'm one happy Yank! and God is Whom I thank! next overturn of Jubilee, same sex marriage NO MORE."
I take it the us supreme court is full of old people. Shame on them.
"I am pro-choice, but if the abortion will be used for medical emergencies, for r*pe victims, or for mol*sted victims that is fine, but to continuously use it as birth control is abuse and wrong. 

The States has complete access to contraceptives, why not be responsible and use the provided contraceptives? Its your choice to give into your lust and allow yourself to be impregnated or to impregnate women."

Nice one. Let's celebrate this day
Unfortunately this heralds the time for the big migration of the American people progressives will have their States and conservatives the other States this way elections will become significantly more predictable as we all will know to distinguish the progressive from the conservative States thank you very much and good night 😊😊
Okay rape i get it BUT U WOMEN OPENING YOUR LEGS WITHOUT EVEN THINKING YA'LL ARE DUMB
"I'm not American ( thank god), also zero political knowledge  but  I get the impression  that  judges are driven by their own personal feelings ,opinions and  which party they belong to. 
Best interest of the ordinary people of the country takes the back seat."
Bravo 👏
"It was never a right, it was a medical care extended affirmed in Roe vs Wade. Which was later abused to kill children."
Hahaha snowflakes becoming responsible.
i surely hope the government will be funding orphanages. women are going to be going through unsafe abortions. teen marriages and teen pregnancies are going to sky rocket. soon there’ll probably be a plan b and birth control shortage. this is just disheartening for everyone

"Get rid of all the progressive trash that has been put in to law, get rid of them all and crush the leftists that have almost destroyed the West."
"Nowhere in the US constitution does it say women have the legal right to murder their unborn child.
Absolute joke of a news station LOL"
Lets hope all the anti-abortion protestors don't get raped by the family members or  a stranger
This isn't banning abortion. In my state you can have an abortion until it's born. Quit acting like women will be dying from dirty knitting needles.... Just innocent little babies.
"Its not ""right to abortion,"" knuckleheads. Why not?

1.) This ruling does not outlaw abortions. It merely sends it back to state legislatures.
2.) There is no ""right to abortion"" in the Constitution. The word isn't even mentioned, hence this is a states rights issue by default."
Thre US fought the Taliban just to replace them with their own Christian Taliban
"Imagine a guy cutting holes in a condom, just to trap a woman"

For paid abortions or if you can't AFFORD kids get a VASECTOMY OR CONDOMS. We are NOT here for food stamps, welfare, GOV Assistance, Section 8, free housing, free funds for a child that you can NOT afford. SO... it's not your body! It's the Child's Life and our packet is NOT paying because you decided to DATE and screw the REST!!! GET A GRIP!!! 😠"
"It's very upsetting to see this happening. I'm pro choice and I believe that women should have the option to have an abortion. But on that same note, if women have the right to say ""my body my choice"", I do believe that there must be discussion on what a prospective father has the right to say as well (ie: my wallet, my choice). With abortion being legal (as I said I believe it should be) women can choose to abort a child, even if the father doesn't want them to. And assuming the woman wants to keep the child but the father doesn't, the woman can still have it and get money from the man. So, obviously the discussion of abortion is a topic concerning women, but it also concerns men as well. 
I agree with this outrage, but I just wish there was more outrage like this when fathers can't even see their children (who are already walking, talking, and conscious and where there is no debate as to whether they are ""alive at conception"" or ""a clump of cells with no consciousness yet"") due to spiteful spouses and court systems that treat men terribly. All I'm asking for is a little consistency, because, let's be real, as a whole, women's issues get spoken about significantly more than the challenges that men face (and there are PLENTY), whether it be in mainstream media or just in our social lives. Women and men both have issues, and just because I ask for attention to also be directed at the other side does not mean I'm saying take away attention from the other. But I shouldn't hold my breath, I doubt anything will change. My mini rant is over lol. (also, I assume most people won't read through this unfortunately)"
"GOP to announce their next political goals:
Remove women's right to vote and property rights
Bring back slavery"
"Nobody had a legal right to an abortion in the first place, but nothing is being taken away from anyone or being banned. All they're doing is letting states decide for themselves if and when an abortion would be performed, letting elected officials decide for their constituents. In some states for example, abortions will be allowed up until 24 weeks, and in others they won't be allowed at all, but they're not making it illegal to travel to another state. It's incredibly simple to not get ""accidentally"" pregnant though if you're in such a terrible situation that you can't afford to raise a child. Perhaps this will encourage people to be more responsible, instead of treating getting an abortion like picking up a prescription."
Why are pro abortionists so transphobic? Don’t they know men can get pregnant too?
Home of the free
It's called recovering moral sanity.
It’s the woman’s choice not the state !
Just have contraceptives man....such a cheap and simple practice

Ya' we want to kill our kids ! Practice abstinence !!
The Pro-choice protesters are so uneducated.. The school system and Tik Tok has failed them. The ruling is the state you live in makes the decision.. Most of them I’m sure live in a Democrat state so there going to be able to have as many abortions their cold heart can handle. The American Liberals are so anger and lost
America slips back into the 19th century by removing every woman’s right to self-determination. The so-called ‘pro-lifers’ aren’t nearly so bothered about kids getting shot to pieces en-masse in schools on a weekly basis. As if we needed confirmation that 50% of Americans are stupid.
I think abortion is murder and the unborn baby did nothing wrong unless the unborn baby endangers it's mother life.
Still driving around with a huge placard with your name on it sarah?
"Forget about all the other issues common Americans face but oh no, you just had to stick your nose in people’s personal lives.  Let’s see if pro life people will be there for you when you’re with a child that you cannot care for"
Naturally nothing will be done despite Justices committing purgury in front of the nation which then turn around and steal rights from our population.
BIAS BBC as always
HAAHAA...fuckbunnies...it's over.
"And this shit country has the audacity to preach others  about human rights, when they have the largest incarcerated population, astronomical health costs for majority of the people,a failing education system, children gunned downed at school, and people so paranoid to carry guns everywhere. Now this. Well done Muarica."
I'm encouraged to see young women that are fighting for the right to life! Abortion is murder! Look at a newborn baby and see if you are ok with anybody ripping it apart or stabbing it in the neck and murdering the baby?
Be good if Republicans cared as much about human life after birth as before it. What a different country the U.S would be.
I hope we don't follow this
Sex ❌🍌🪓🚮🚮
California allows abortion.
"Why is all of this blown out of proportion?  If you feel you want to kill your unborn baby, just drive over to the closet state where it is legal and get it done and live a happy life.  I think the overturning it is a good decision overall and every state should be able decide what they think is right in the matter of abortion."
"They didn't take away a right, the right to abortion was never constitutional. They gave the right to decide to individual states, as it should be. This is not the job of the federal government, it's federal overreach. Take responsibility for your own decisions, the decision to have unprotected sex, when there are numerous methods of protection."
I hate it here.
Divided States of Ameristan this is all fluff people will just go to Democratic States to get one with a whole movement to help them.Anita Thomas must be celebrating tonight its farcical.
YEEAAAAA!!!!! 👏👏👏💥💥💥💥
🤣🤣🤣🤣
The right to abortion was not struck down...there was never a right to abortion....the court just said that judges can't make this decision and that it has to be decided by each states individual elected legislatures
"The world is tumbling upside down into a terrible abyss. There must be something wrong with society. Is it ""Culture Wars"". Poor, poor America!"
Move to state that let's you murder your baby 👶.
"They're gonna keep fighting for what? Gun legislation to protect the lives of kids in schools? Healthcare for all people? The many deaths and complications from back alley abortions? Or how about proper care for the many, many children in vulnerable situations that they have no control over? I doubt they'll give a shit about anything else now. Well, maybe taking away other rights that have been fought for over the years. What was is, heard there is talk about taking back the right to same sex marriage."
"What most people don’t know is that babies of 9 months were being aborted and used for nefarious purposes.  When you look into the details, it’s horrific."
"Dear women, dear feminists: men have always been in danger to be made a father against their will. In those cases, there is hardly any personal autonomy left, if you have to care about a child although you did not want to. Women benefited from the privilege to be able to undo their bad choices/mistakes after the fact, men always have only had the option of contraception.

The perfect example to show that women are extremely privileged regarding the societal empathy they receive. Where were all the protesters fighting for men's rights of family planning/life planning/personal autonomy? Have you heard, my dear feminists?"
"Well, now safe abortions will only be available to America's wealthy... as God willed it I guess. 🤦‍♂️"
America... De-evolution in practice...
Q is back  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Plus I'm pretty sure all of them Baby's would still love to have a life without instead of been born
"Abortion has never been guaranteed by the Constitution.
   About  the only right guaranteed, would probably be the Right to Refuse to Abort. 

Should abortion be considered as a legal option... sure.
   But in 95% of cases where abortion happens in America, there's no Medical or Rape issue. 
   There may be considerations for supporting the child after birth, or concerns about the hospital costs of giving birth. 
But that's unlikely to be the case for more than 10-15% of cases at best. And adoption, or pregnancy centers are a thing. 

And realistically speaking, *the supreme court would have probably considered the outcome of some woman taping some guy...*
_And then insisting on aborting said baby._ *Against her victims wishes.* 

Abortion on demand, is wrong. Abortion on having a Need... that's something worth discussing. 
   I would point out that if only 0.001% of all Abortions resulted *directly* in death for the Mother... that  would be around 800 deaths annually.  And we know from antecedents of situations where the Mother to be, dies but it is not attributed to her abortion even if investigations by family reveal probable links. 

California, for instance, doesn't even report what information on abortion they do collect. Let alone try to track the so called back alley Abortions that happen in their state.

Simply put. If people want universal abortion access, they need better & more reliably researched arguments for it, than emotional arguments based upon the Mother's 9 month inconveniencing. _(Especially when so called abusive boyfriend's, are just as likely to Coerce their girlfriend into Getting an Abortion, if not more so._ _I know from stories former planned parenthood workers tell, that this happens._ _Frankly  speaking, it seems more likely. )_

It doesn't really help the pro abortion argument, that prior to this overturning...
North Korea & China, were amongst the few countries that could match America's abortion access standards. 
   *Most of the 200+ countries worldwide, restrict abortion access in some fashion.* To a greater or lesser degree."
U.S.A population about to hit big 💪💪💪
Free contraceptive.  Free health care.  Then.
Jesus loves the little children!!!!🙏❤
"She said, ""I am sorry I can not kill your baby"""
You sick bas**rds lost!!!!!!!
They picked one woman with glitter glued to her face to argue for abortion (1:30) and one woman with glitter glued to her face to argue against abortion (2:23).
if only pro life people put this much effort in the banning of guns across America. i guess they'd rather take people rights than guns
The USA takes another step backwards into the 18th century demonstrating even further what a retarded country it is.
i too wish that they were aborted
Why do one gets pregnant in the first place if you have to go for abortion
Abortion is illegal and guns are a constitutional right in afghanistan as well. America is great
It's a pity an unborn child cannot stand up for their right 😢
They all better be donating to orphanages. All of those nut bags.
"I truly wish pro-life idiots would understand the implications of what they believe in. 
ABORTIONS WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN!
Roe vs wade made abortions SAFE and calculated, now America is returning to the old days where coat hooks and two day trips to Canada and Mexico are common"
Yes way to go
What about the rights of unborn child???? What fault is theirs?
Pregnancy is profit for America that's all that matters nothing else
"God bless 🙏 I'm so glad, now it could be more Baby's 🍼 born and Earth Population and United States population can Expand 🙏"
women who want abortion will find a way. I expect to see the rise of people who are NOT medically trained now offering abortion. Babies that are not wanted will be abandoned. Social services are not funded to provide a safety net for this
We don't want church in the schools and businesses but you want to take away my right.
Abortion is killing by hit and run.
"The law never changed...""Thou shall not kill."""
I'm 21 and I'm terrified? Why?  Because you can't get an abortion?
banning the procedure AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME HAS PASSED IN THE PREGNANCY .... a logical decision and a win for sanity
Absolutely love this.  Ben a while since I've ben proud about my country.
You have the right…. To wear a condom
"If you support banning a woman's access to safe, legal abortion - you are flat-out anti-American. The vast majority of Americans want abortion to be legal (with obvious exceptions based upon term limits). 
You are NOT an American if you are happy with what happened today. That is the ultimate truth.
We have a LOT of people in this country masquerading as ""Americans"" when they disagree with everything America is supposed to stand for. They hate freedom. They hate democracy. They hate anyone who is not exactly like them. And most of them live in the traitorous South who cost our nation millions of lives when they rebelled in the 19th century. Nowadays, they like to claim they are ""more American"" than everyone else, even though we all know differently. You are NOT Americans. You are scum."
"Dear police covering riots/protests.
Give the baby-kil lers a taste of their own beliefs-shoot them.
At least they can run and try to protect themselves ..."
Simple don’t want to get pregnant don’t have sex
Absolutely disgusting.
"They can do something. Impeach Thomas, Barrett, Kavanagh, and Gorsiche. Thomas has ties with right wing extremists and is unfit to serve. The other 3 lied under oath to Congress regarding their views on precedent. Alito can stay, but those 4, gotta go."
Land of the free? If only they gave a shit about “the little children” after they are born.
What if the baby was going to have no quality of life? What if the mother's life was at risk if the pregnancy continued and she already had a child whom she didn't want to leave with no mom ?
Democrats you welcomed to moved back to NY and CA
"Murder requires an actual person, not just human matter."
Im incredibly happy that people care and are fighting to get this human decency back abortion should not be seen as murder I see murder as if something has already been born not something that can’t even breathe and is leaching off its mothers well being
"A great day for America. 
A great day for the unborn children. 
Time to go the same way in UK and Europe."
"As an American, my country never ceases to embarrass the hell out of me 🇺🇸 #shameful"
The title reveals the bias of this reporting.  That is not what the ruling was
"I wonder how many of these happy, young women celebrating here will die because of their pro choice decision?"
I'm delighted.
Bear in mind that the Democrats are in favour of 'abortions up to and including the point AFTER a child has actually been born ... ! It doesn't take much to translate this into selective infanticide ...
*Planned Parenthood is a branch of white nationalism and supremacy such as the KKK! Disown and destroy Margaret Sanger’s statues!*
Great news Amen Jesus Loves ALL the precious babies💯❤
"As Canadian, I feel sorry for all the women rights. Come to Canada 🍁"
Biden is always on the stupid  side
This can be fixed by your vote!!
rather than banning guns they are taking away a v important constitutional right from the women. what a shame!
The christian racist Taliban is takin
"America is a complete joke to western society, it’s like their evolving backwards thank god I live in England 🙏"
women being made accountable for their bad behaviors ? omg
Vote vote vote vote vote vote vote
"This is being overplayed divisively.
This was a correction of a bad Law ...
All that has happened is that individual States will be responsible for their Abortion Laws via their elected representatives and so Democracy has been improved.
Nothing stops women from crossing State borders to get an abortion.
The decision was not caused by Trump judges at all. It was a decision based on correct legal interpretation of the Constitution by 6 to 3  in favour.
The BBC is showing bias in it's presentation and people are overreacting emotionally. Many subtle adjustments will balance out inherent difficulties that are being screamed about and are well known to need addressing, such as cases of rape and poverty, etc.
49 years ago the Supreme Court invented Law in contravention of it's jurisdiction and that has now been corrected. The Democrats are pushing reaction to get votes ...
Joe Biden (President_ and Nancy Pelosi (Speaker of the House) both back Abortion very strongly and yet also claim to be Catholics. It is completely against the Catholic faith to endorse abortion ... so they are both clearly liars whichever way you look at their stances."
America is the most backwards country on the planet.
"No one has “lost the right to abortion.”  It may become inconvenient. Jurisdiction was simply remanded from Federal to Individual State control.
JayBee, installed elliptical office occupant is most certainly not a “devout Catholic.”"
"The Constitution never gave them a right to an abortion. That's false and anybody saying that is either a liar or ignorant of  the facts. Roe vs Wade is not a law it was a judicial decision, that's all. It's supporters say it's legal precedence that enshrines it, under that logic Jim Crow laws would still be in affect. It's left to the states, in otherwards the voters of those states that determines it legality, where it belonged all along."
so all the left has is groomers.  baby killers.  free loaders.  and rioters and looters on thier side.    and they wonder why the left is getting so much push back now days ?  hmmhmhmhmh
lol the baby killers are so mad.  and thats a good thing
"Roe has delighted sane people, and enraged fanatics......xian sharia law is celebrating their hollow 'victory' o' telling others how to live - and it will NOT stop there.  goddamn, i thought this was america..."
4:10 if he really cared about it being up to the people he would be for legalizing it. but hes not so he uses buzzwords and catchphrases instead
"I am not a US citizen and don't know the politics either. But I personally think they should have never banned abortion, they need to ban guns totally instead.
Raise your hands if you agree with me 🙋"
Shame these pro lifers don’t give as big of shit for the children murdered in school shootings.. wE nEeD oUr GuNs
Abortion was never a right granted by the constitution. More far left propaganda.
"Best news ever , thank God. Dont sleep around and have unprotected sex and you should be ok."
Guns n bibles. What a country.
Someone in Sri Lanka is committing many unscrupulous evils and murders from within the physical reality of many countrymen in defiance of God. Investigate and take action Sri Lanka is a bad poison.
"More are ""enraged"" than ""delighted"", This happened because, currently the US has a minority rule. 30% of the country has more influence over the direction of the country that the other 70%. That not democracy whatever way to cut the cheese."
YAY THANK GOD
"""As a child, did you imagine this alot?""

Yeah as a 6 year old girl I can imagine she was so excited and passionate about murdering an unborn fetus in a strangers stomach who she didn't even know anything about and who had nothing to do with her let alone the story behind the pregnancy or the reasons for the feeling of needing to get rid.

I'm sorry but what a STRANGE group of people Americans are lol"
It was never a Constitutional right. Any rights that are not specifically written into the Bill of Rights are left to the States to decide. i.e. Cannabis
why do women protest to kill their children? great decision from the Supreme Court.
Y'all will see what hell is like
American women sleep around too much. What willl happen if women do not have any lasting relationships and keep aborting babies that are from casual affairs? Don't they know that many societies look down on them? Being a superpower is not enough. Have family values and take care of your babies.
"Funny how abortion seems to be an issue and CHILDREN GETTING SHOT AND KILLED EVERY MONTH, IS NOT. MAKE THIS COUNTRY SAFE FOR CHILDREN TO LIVE IN, FIRST."
That's what's wrong with this country stupid asses like them dumb asses
"People are saying ""use protection"" until a woman gets raped multiple times by multiple people. Until certain details  about the pregnancy lead to the death of the child and the mother. Until they start finding children dead due to the irresponsibility of an unfit mother/father .  Until they see hundreds of underage sexual abuse victims die during birth because they're bodies can't take it. Not everyone deserves to be parents.. not everyone planned to even have sex. What is wrong with this country"
"This crazy where the world is heading, all thanks to fasist mentality people"
I wonder how these animal women who are cheering like idiots wpuld feel if (god forbid) any of them individually was r##ed by an awful man and now was unable to abort that baby and have to live with that reminder and pain forever. I wonder if they would still be cheering like animals then. They would deserve a massive crowd of people screaming in joy as that individual is left broken and terrified yet unable to get help for what's happened.
"Europe might need to liberate the USA from fascist rule somehow please .i am not trying to overthrow the government , just shame the hell out of Republican tourists and ask them why they are so racist and stupid . every time you see an American on the streets ask them if they are  Republicans ? and if they are ask them why ? and ask them if they are fascist and or racist .and then tell them to f*ck off. and you don't need their money and go home ."
"something people are ignoring or intentionally missing out, is the fact that roe v wade was based upon testimony of a woman being raped which was later admitted to have been perjury, so its based on lies and as such has no reasonable way of being upheld in court. stop treating this like an attack, its not. its how the law works."
"Praise God, Jesus is the Righteous Judge and He is coming back, repent while you have a chance! You wicked people fighting against God, only foolish will fight against God."
Thanks be to God. Now charge all those doctors with murder. Throw them all in jail.
The shitty judges in the supreme court deserve to be jailed.
Who’s gonna feed Baal?
"Pi$$ off with your lives matter! Honestly it’s not selfish or disgusting of parents to end up getting an Abortion, what is selfish of a human is having a baby knowing FULLY well that you cannot support or raise that child to the best of their abilities and potential, knowing that food is short, housing is a struggle or knowing that you couldn’t afford school fees or clothing! 

All these a$$holes fighting this nonsense, remember you live with mommy and daddy! They pay everything for you and the only reason you have anything on your back or in your hand, so get out of mommies basement and go get a real job!"
"it is disgusting see a ""nurse"" crying because at her place of work, she can no longer murder babies...... it grosses me out"
"women will use herbs and governments will try to punish them for it , herbs is how women took care of themselves and were burned at the steak as witches , this is the same thing in modern times ."
Pro Life. Pro Responsible Parenting.
They have no idea what they're doing at this point
"Men have been treated like secondhand citizens when it comes to their children for years. Men have had no rights whatsoever when it come to their children if they wanted the mother to keep it or not yet they have to pay child support, any custody cases men have been treated like dirt. Now women are going to have to learn something about personal responsibility"
"Good, we don't need abortion in America and around the world. How can one person murder      unborn child.  In the name of Abaution.."
This is the best decision in our history. Finally murder is elegal
"Sleepy joe - ""how far WE are removed"", you can't even go a bicycle LOL x"

"Certainly Jesus, son of Mary (the servant and messenger of Allah ), peace be upon both of them, will descend in Syria - Al-Manara, on two angel wings, wearing two dresses of cotton, his face dripping with water as if he was coming out of a shower, his breath reaching the tip of his fingers at the length of his arm, killing everyone who entered his breath except  Muslims, he breaks the cross, kills the pig and accepts only the religion of Islam, he prays with the Muslims in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, then he will kills the Antichrist, then he and those with him hide on Mount Al-Tur for fear of Gog and Magog { Gog and Magog :

A people who have been imprisoned by Dhul-Qarnayn under the ground, and he said that they will come out when Allah wills.

They will kill everyone on the earth except Jesus and his companions and they will eat the green, dry and inanimate opjects, then Jesus prays to Allah to kill them, so they all die because of a flying worm that enters  in their noses, then he would rule the earth for 40 years in which love, justice and much prosperity would prevail even children play with snaks and wolves guard the cattle , then he would die and be buried in Muslim cemeteries.

[4:171]
O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion nor utter aught concerning Allah save the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah, and His word which He conveyed unto Mary, and a spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers, and say not ""Three"" - Cease! (it is) better for you! - Allah is only One God. Far is it removed from His Transcendent Majesty that He should have a son. His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is sufficient as Defender.

[4:172]
The Messiah will never scorn to be a slave unto Allah, nor will the favoured angels. Whoso scorneth His service and is proud, all such will He assemble unto Him;

[4:173]
Then, as for those who believed and did good works, unto them will He pay their wages in full, adding unto them of His bounty; and as for those who were scornful and proud, them will He punish with a painful doom. And they will not find for them, against Allah, any protecting friend or helper.

[4:174]
O mankind! Now hath a proof from your Lord come unto you, and We have sent down unto you a clear light;

[4:175]
As for those who believe in Allah, and hold fast unto Him, them He will cause to enter into His mercy and grace, and will guide them unto Him by a straight road.
19:81]
And they have chosen (other) gods beside Allah that they may be a power for them.

[19:82]
Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents unto them.

[19:83]
Seest thou not that We have set the devils on the disbelievers to confound them with confusion ?

[19:84]
So make no haste against them (O Muhammad). We do but number unto them a sum (of days).

[19:85]
On the day when We shall gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, a goodly company.

[19:86]
And drive the guilty unto hell, a weary herd,

[19:87]
They will have no power of intercession, save him who hath made a covenant with his Lord.

[19:88]
And they say: The Beneficent hath taken unto Himself a son.

[19:89]
Assuredly ye utter a disastrous thing

[19:90]
Whereby almost the heavens are torn, and the earth is split asunder and the mountains fall in ruins,

[19:91]
That ye ascribe unto the Beneficent a son,

[19:92]
When it is not meet for (the Majesty of) the Beneficent that He should choose a son.

[19:93]
There is none in the heavens and the earth but cometh unto the Beneficent as a slave.

[19:94]
Verily He knoweth them and numbereth them with (right) numbering.

[19:95]
And each one of them will come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection, alone.

[19:96]
Lo! those who believe and do good works, the Beneficent will appoint for them love.

[19:97]
And We make (this Scripture) easy in thy tongue, (O Muhammad) only that thou mayst bear good tidings therewith unto those who ward off (evil), and warn therewith the froward folk.

[19:98]
And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Canst thou (Muhammad) see a single man of them, or hear from them the slightest sound ?

39:4]
If Allah had willed to choose a son, He could have chosen what He would of that which He hath created. Be He Glorified! He is Allah, the One, the Absolute.

[39:5]
He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth. He maketh night to succeed day, and He maketh day to succeed night, and He constraineth the sun and the moon to give service, each running on for an appointed term. Is not He the Mighty, the Forgiver ?

[39:6]
He created you from one being, then from that (being) He made its mate; and He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds. He created you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, in a threefold gloom. Such is Allah, your Lord. His is the Sovereignty. There is no God save Him. How then are ye turned away ?

[39:7]
If ye are thankless, yet Allah is Independent of you, though He is not pleased with thanklessness for His bondmen; and if ye are thankful He is pleased therewith for you. No laden soul will bear another’s load. Then unto your Lord is your return; and He will tell you what ye used to do. Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of men). ——-----------------------------------—----------

America wtf is wrong with you
"BBC:Walking a tightrope off political fire ,I can tell you it’s getting crispy 
Me:Well done you managed too stay neutral."
Religious bigots have overturned democracy. Im amazed usa isnt on fire. Fascists have taken control
Original case was based on a lying women who said she has been raped. Good decision.
"the Supreme Court was once the last recourse , to excesses of the government , but now it enforces the excesses of governments"
"I understand how people feel but I'm not fully agreeing with this decision but abortion is like taking someone's life and that's a sin, also if they do this the country is gonna end up overpopulated...And also poverty is gonna be high."
I don't understand how people can be anti abortion when there's multiple situations this could happen in. For example a woman who was raped and became pregnant. The woman shouldn't have to carry the trauma through the rapists child. Also accidents with pregnancy can happen even with contraception. America is taking away one of the most important human rights. CHOICE. The US has gone backwards and people need to wake up that this is unacceptable
Hallelujah hallelujah x
"Keep turning the clock going backward in time ..... well done USA. Land of the free where laws are backward looking. When will we withdraw the right to votes for the minorities, women and other progressive laws ?"
Sensible decision
❤️
THIS ALL HAPPENED BECAUSE OF MITCH MCCONNELL'S SCHEMING AND DENYING A SITTING PRESIDENT OBAMA HIS RIGHT TO APPT JUDGES YET MCCONNELL RAMMED THROUGH DATE RAPIST AND THE LATEST A FAKE 'CHRISTIAN' AGAINST ABORTION YET PRO ARMS/ OIL AS CODE.... PROSECUTE MCCONNELL'S AND PROSECUTE THE THOMAS'S AS WELL AS THE TRUMP KUSCHNERS !!!!
Ballots don't matter when the gop are stealing our rights to vote and blatantly stealing elections and promoting and funding  armed treasonous home grown terrorism.
"Repubicans want open carry and push sales (and drugs) push terrorism, allow our kids to be blown away in public places, churches, schools, temple's and at work but they care about a fetus ??!!"
Time to stir the pot ...election coming up🤦‍♀️
God bless president Donald trump. I love this man and I pray that he comes back to the White House. We need this man in power very badly. Use birth control before having sex and getting pregnant. You don’t kill a child for the sake of saving the life of a mother who was careless and didn’t take any precautions
"YOUNG LADIES, IF YOU SPREAD YOUR LEGS TO HAVE SOMEONE CUM IN, THEN YOU BETTER BE WILLING TO SPREAD YOUR LEGS FOR SOMEONE TO COME OUT. ✝️"
Yeah!!! More tax paying slaves for America!!
All the people of America need to vote for Trump and we   need Trump to go back to his office in 2024!
Thank God.  It is about time.
"As a classy woman who’s been lucky enough to have 6 abortions from potentially six different fathers, this is a setback for humanity. As a single mother on social assistance after my exs money ran out, I’m not sure how I’m going to explain this to my transgender children, this world is so disappointing!"
The baby killers are a salt mine tonight lol lol lol
First off you at the BBC better get it right women can still get abortions in this country it hasn't been made illegal so the misinformation you're putting out and the lies stop doing it.
"Potato Joe Biden, you're not sure what you're saying, time for your warm milk, and your sleepytime!
You're a Corruption, Baby Killers!"
"Some people are crying, because they cannot murder babies any more. The white man has been methodically wiping himself out in abortion clinics, causing a demographic crisis."
Time to grow up. Stop doing drugs. Use actual protection. I’m grateful to be adopted and alive.
The motions of a soon to be police state. Absolutely shocking 🤪🤪🤪
BBC is no longer a real news network. Abortion was not struck down by the Supreme Court. The decision regarding abortion has been shifted from the centre to the states. That's all the ruling has done
"Thank you, prez Trump."
"I guess its alright that abortions are banned, now we can have a backup surplus of kids to stabilize the population when another shooting happens 😒"
"dont worry. Hedge fund CEO mistresses ,wives and girlfriends will still be safe."
Thank God! The blood of these babies have been crying out for 50 years!🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️What a glorious day for the sanctity of LIFE🥳💞🎉
"Ohhh btw, what do you Brits have any business in our politics? Fuck-off, Limeys..."
"The left is so accustomed to killing the unborn that it's normal to them.  Murder is still murder.  God bless the Supreme Court and Donald Trump.  God will deal with them.  The Trigger laws were in place to take effect as soon as Roe was overturned.  Abortionists don't realize what they've done because of their selfishness.  The right to abortion is NOT in the constitution.  It was a big mistake to legalize abortion federally.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself said the decision was ill advised upon reviewing it.  Norma McCorvey (the real name of Roe)
regretted heavily her involvement in the process and spent the remainder of her life trying to make up for it."
Christo-fascists now own America.
What?
ABORTION = MURDER
HAHAHA!!!
Unborn baby s saying..thank you...I hope nobody gets hurts
America is Awful an F'd up! They have literally taken away women's right and gone backwards. Like does America not understand that some women don't have enough resources to care for children. And some are even teenagers who maybe not even be ready for raising a child. Like this is literally just Disgraceful. Like Bruh!
"god can't stand Americans, why is nobody fighting for middle of the road European policy on abortion. Consciousness begins at 24 weeks and that's when abortion should be allowed to after that its no longer just ""your body"" but another lives."
Your body your choice well take responsibility ladies because you can't be having unprotected sex with random guys then complain when you get pregnant when you should know your own biology.
the devil is going to be very rabid these days
it is not the right to abortion it is the right to have a law to kill a baby in the mother's womb
Big dub
Based SCOTUS
WE cant kill babies ......that sucks
"Its so great!!!!
Finally,  a win for the beautiful unborn child. Thankyou Lord ✝️🙏"
Americans are so weird
BBC should stay out of American Politics and comment on their own government for God's sake.
Aye agree with abortion if raped but its when women just get rid of the baby for no reason other than they dont want it its still a living human being.
2:22 “ I’m 21 and I’m terrified “ well what are you terrified about? Your assignment results? Dumbo 😂
i'm 14 and i know a lot about life and abotion is wrong babys don't need to die smh 🤦‍♂️
The decision is correct.  The constitution does not guarantee a right to kill the unborn.   It is up to the legislature to create such a law to provide such a right.
"The BBC will probably delete this but the fact is, the BBC haven't done their research and are lying again. The Supreme Court did not strike down the right to abortion. It simple restored the Constitution, which clearly states in the 10th amendment that any power not mentioned in the Constitution is reserved to the States or the people. In other words, States make local laws."
".Women have been finding ways to abort fetuses for thousands of years.  By the amount of children that are sold into the sex trade,  and murdered and tortured by their parents it seems that abortion is the least cruel of them all.  There are millions of people who do not want to be and should not be parents.  There is no birth control that is 100% effective and abstinence is very rare."
God is coming back to the heart of America! Reap it!
Fake news media. Abortion has simply been relegated to a state level. It has not been abolished in the US.
I truly hope they pass the law to ban gay marriage and stop this pride nonsense
"Doctors need to stop saying no to sterilization. If you want abortions to stop, then allow women to be sterilized the first time they ask."
"Do they really think that killing is ""Healthcare""? Unbelievable..."
"Tragic. I hope this can be reversed as soon as posible. 

Although our society is not perfect and we have so much to rectify, it is ironic that we mexicans had gained more rights and liberties, as time goes by, compared to our northern neighbours."
How can Americans care so much about unborn children yet not bother at all about killing their children with guns?
Why the hell people dont wear condoms....right to abortion is same like giving a right to kill a human being....just because you enjoyed sex and in your emotions you were not able to control....you shouldn't have a right to kill someone.....freedom to kill is not a democratic right
DOWN WITH FASCISM IN AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!
behold the banality of dichotomy
Yes!!!! Take that all you leftists genocidals!! Finally Justice has been served! Suck it Nancy Pelosi and all the left!
"What a glorious day to be an American!!
I've never been prouder of my adopted country!
First Bruen, now Dobbs.
God Bless this Supreme Court
Born British, proud Texan by choice"
6 Judges decide what American woman can do with there bodies is just wrong . It’s a personal choice for woman not a government choice . It is a sad day for America
Give FREE birth control!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is more important things that need to go or be added but this is a tragic thing to hear another right been removed from the books for women ✊️✖️✖️
"Look at the woman protesting at 1:30, no man would make her pregnant.  She just looking for a cause."
"""If this is freedom, then I don't want to be free"" seems pretty apt."
Its like we dont want a civil war but sometimes you wonder if reform and a cleanse of all these old men and the blind women that follow them  would help America be Ameroca
Why are all these pro-life female activists obese? LOL
This won’t affect Trans women as they can’t get pregnant can they. It’s just play time
"Absolutely disgusting, disgraceful and vile decision making. The judges should be executed!"
This is unthinkable in the 21 century. Every women should have the right to her decision and not force things in the name of religion.
STFU 🤬 MY BODY MY RIGHT!!

"Canada gonna get a lot more visits, what the boarder guards gonna do, stop pregnant women leaving the country? 
Probably makes me a racist but I treasure all
life and it’s breaks my heart that abortion is needed, but it is needed for what ever reasons.
Are American birthday rates so low they decided this 🤔"
May I suggest the pill if you don’t practice safe sex if you don’t want a baby take birth control
I'm just glad it pisses off the weird liberals
"Oh fuck, so with the combination of the gun law and now this (abortion) court cases it seems the Courts aren't only bias it seems that the Government an systems of the US will collapse. Seriously if the US does not do anything soon to try to fix it's fuck ups both on National and Local it seems that the ""once great nation"" will now cease to exist. 

Now the chance of States leaving the Union is at it's highest in years, if this keeps up not only will the anarchy from BLM come back it might get worse."
Abortions are NOT illegal in all US states…it takes away government power and restores it back to the states.
"In the US (a nation where more women die from complications of pregnacy and childbirth than in any developed country, where hundreds of thousands have died in a pandemic from lack of healthcare or poverty, and where historically females were bought and sold as breeders to enrich slave owners) forced labor is an established national tradition and reproductive rights are another example of human rights that were never guaranteed for the poor."
"Discarding thinking about genuine failures of contraception; this should lessen the instances of ""random sex"" in America, as ALL women are noe responsible.
I'm going to enjoy watching the YouTube videos of American guys saying ""... but my girlfriend wouldn't let me..."""
"Again, more mis-information by the BBC. There was no right under the constitution that allowed for abortion. That is a law by STATE and no judiciary, in the UK OR the US can make laws, that is by legislators. All that was done was overturn and set right the constitution. The decision was that Roe v Wade was flawed as it meant creating a new right under the consitution, and that can not be done by ANY judiciary OR legislator, laws and rights are very different. Judges do NOT make laws both in the UK OR the US. It is still law that States can decide what is allowed, when it is allowed, for abortion. 

The decision does NOT mean abortions can NOT be done. Abortion is not a right under the constitution. The fact is, ending a life is murder and people can try and twist it all they like, it is infanticide and even goes back to sacrificing children to Mollock. Personally, abortions should be outlawed. Arguments for it are flawed by nature, biology and even science itself. That being said, the States in the US can still make their own laws as it was for a long time. Roe v Wade is not constitutional and that is ALL the decision was, it changes nothing on abortion laws and those laws have always been state level. 
 
Quote the constitution where it says abortions are a right. You will NOT find it.
 
Abortions are alloowed and STATE legtislator are responsible for making those laws ion those STATES. I am an Englishman who knows this so Americans who do NOT? you should be ashamed.

The decision does NOT mean an end to abortions no matter which side you stand on.

The Beeb needs to stop mis-informing people.

So yeah, abortions have NOT come to an end in the US, Beeb are lying yet again. Propagandists. Get your facts right BEEB. The right in the constitution has NEVER existed and Roe v Wade could NEVER be right, that was a State level decision and SCOTUS should have thrown it out then and told the State to make their decision. There has NEVER been that right in the constitution. IF the state law exists then they can have one so what is the issue? stop gaslighting people.

RIGHTS and LAWS are NOT the same thing."
Great job US 👏👏
Thank God. Sacred Heart ❤️
American democracy is fraud where holding guns is fundamental right and control over your body is not fundamental right. How can these mentally ill American govt advise developing nations to about democracy whereas developing nations improving a lot in comparison to themselves but USA is going backwards.
This is a tragic moment for America
"You as a woman can have the right to Abort a baby as long as the man can have the right to not financially support the baby if he request you have an abortion and you decide you want to keep it.
As Dave Chappelle said ""If you can kill it i can decide not to pay for it"""
Thank you LORD
I've never seen a country go backwards so quickly without suffering some kind of coup first.
I have never seen so many uneducated women praise their own loss of personal choice in one video...
Pregnancy should be illegal because the child hasn't consented to being born.
"BBC isn’t getting this.  The court has merely said it’s not a right in the federal constitution, which means the question goes to the states.  For some people, they will need to go to another state and get a motel in order to get an abortion.  Once in a lifetime? Twice? I can’t really imagine getting too upset about that."
killing  babies is not carrying  women
Goodbye gay marriage please respect the church
I am happy to see this.  God bless America.

Jeez the amount of children I would have in England if this was a thing
looks like US needs to build many new foster homes from now on.
Let's overthrow the government
Not going to mention that the roe v wade law was based on a lie????
"4:20 i became a Satanist today because of those fascists. Yeah jesus loves those children who are born blind, deaf etc."
"- June 24, EU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell is heading to Tehran to request the Islamic regime of Iran (the master of terrorists) to agree with a fake nuclear agreement! Then the EU + US  lift all the sanctions and also give them  billions of dollars. They could  keep all the rockets and they still can supporting all their terrorists groups in middle east and north of Africa!
 - This is happening after the visit of the Russian Foreign Minister to Iran!
-  Mike Pence on June 23: ""Now Biden and his government are threatening to undo all the progress we have made in marginalizing the repressive regime in Tehran, we call on the Biden government to withdraw immediately from all nuclear talks with Tehran."""
wow!good news
"All fuel for our coming 2nd Civil War.

"I get it, you're killing someone before they are born that's bad sure....  But what about accidental pregnancies?  Even worse, what about women who are raped and just want rid of the kid so they don't have to have that memory every day, that they were forced against their will to have a kid.  I am a man myself, so please forgive me if my views are unjust...  But I do believe there's a few cases where you should have the right.  Obviously people will disagree with this view and that's fine, we all have the right to free speech, well within reason of course."
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe"
Lies bbc🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦
Coat hanger sales will go through the roof.
Great news
"These people act as if these never happened before Roe v Wade or as if they'll stop after it. They've been happening since the beginning of time and will continue long after today. They have stopped NOTHING. The only thing they're doing is making it much more dangerous and increasing losses of women's lives, but then, that's what they want, the ""pro-life"" piles of fetid feces thump their bibles and screech that if you are trying to do this, then you deserve to not survive the procedure. 😠 ""pro-life"" 🙄

Hardly surprising that most of these people are religious zealots, using their dusty old pile of paper to justify doing whatever harmful evil they want by pretending it's ""god's word"". 🙄 But it's not just religious zealots either, some of them are also conspiracy theorists who think that by forcing people to have babies, they'll stop the ""great replacement"", which is absurd since the ban affects the immigrants too, and who do you think are ""knocking boots"" more? Duh. 😒"
How much more sane the pro-lifers seem.

"The right to abortion struck down?
Now you know this isn't correct don't you?
I knew the BBC was bad but this is misleading even coming from the BBC."
#letsgobrandon
Life wins 👏👏👏🙏
"darkness has left, its cleaning time now, buckle up"
"This really isn't that big of a deal. Go to another State or Mexico etc that's all this does. I'm a right leaning guy who doesn't have much of an opinion on Abortion really, only that banning it doesn't stop it it just makes the woman get it in unsafe means like traveling abroad etc but all these people protesting... why? Not a big deal, so you need a road trip to get it done, very tiny inconvenience."
Having illegal abortions hmmm okay go to prison lol 😂😂 it's actually classed as murder go to prison .
"Yehp and,......... Meanwhile the entire world is being culled for the WEF   NEW WORLD ORDER AGENDA CULLING GREAT RESET....... All of this is distraction from the FACTS these same WEF 300 UNITED NATION EVIL PUPPETS are purposely STARVING AND DESTROYING YOUR COUNTRIES TO THIN THE POPULATION SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP CONTROL. WAKE UP PEOPLE YOU ARE THE FROGS IN THE POT"
"Please wear a mask... nope, constitutional rights. Please get vaccinated.. nope, constitutional rights. Let's ban untrained 17 year old minors from carrying semi automatic weapons in public... nope, constitutional rights.  Let's make this 15 year old rape victim give birth to her rapist's baby because of my religious beliefs ... sure, screw the 1st amendment.  Let's let the border patrol assault citizens in their own yard..  ok, the 4 amendment isn't important.  So while we point to a constitution written by slave owners for a country built on land stolen from the natives they slaughtered,  let's consider renaming this country for what it is,  The Oligarchy of Hypocrisy."
"I live in a big city and to find an active pro life group? No where around. There bribed by the opisition to shut up, that is exactly what they do."
Well done
Texas here… God bless the Supreme Court! Texas secession 2023!!!
"The constitution doesn’t mention abortion. The courts have restored democracy in America with this ruling. 

Now states can vote for those that share their beliefs on abortion, and the majority will prevail. 

That’s how it’s meant to be."
9000 IQ move. Give anyone providing or getting a abortion (that was legal yesterday) a presidential pardon…. Is this technically illegal? Yes. Is it for a good reason? YES.
"This is fantastic hahaha now all of them women who make BAD CHOICES and can't control their mating skills, will have to WORK HARD at doing exactly that hahaha hopefully this begins to put the ACCOUNTABLITY bad on women to make BETTER CHOICES. I really wish this would happen in the UK. The single mum problem is actually an epidemic. The same in the USA and that's why this is so IMPORTANT. Thank god something has finally been done :)"
"Killing anyone including a foetus in the womb should not be part of any constitutional ‘right’! 
The screams of the women in the streets who somehow believe that ending life is empowering for them just shows what’s wrong with society! These women literally are opposed to what femininity is ultimately about! 
Abortion should never be a ‘right’. Human rights (which I support) is about something very different! And again ... in horrible bias of the media shows it’s ugly face right away, these commentators and journalists aren’t even trying to stay impartial but must berate us with their personal political views! I for one who has 
passively experienced the horror and aftermath of an abortion am glad that the termination of life in the womb of a woman can no longer be celebrated or downplayed with euphemisms like abortion!"
"The incestuous Abortions that were missed 60 years ago are now making decisions for others, what a freak show !"
"I always hear ""my body, my choice"" but what about the unborn's body and their choice. Oh I forgot, the left hates life."
Noooooooo!
"From this video, what I am seeing is all abortions are illegal in America. If that is so then the country has some serious problems. If not then there should be cases in which abortions are allowed, such as serious mental illness, rape victims, if the child in the womb is deformed or stillborn, if the mother continues it will lead to death of both or either the child/parent, and any other serious issues. 

If a female doesn't want to have a child while having unprotected sex, then plan B works fine. Abortions should be the last measure a female has to take to abort an embryo, imo I think she has almost till 4 months to know if she wants the child or not. The partner of the woman should also be conscious and aware what kind of responsibility he is handing his partner with having unprotected sex. He should learn to either use a condom, pull out, or finish with oral or external way. 

With all the technologies available to prevent pregnancies why would people be happy with a last resort, abortions. I do know some people don't notice their pregnancies until birth but those are rare."
"Today I have never been more ashamed to be called an American, 2 3rds of our country considers themselves democrat or liberal leaning, our Supreme Court is wrong. Today the louder Conservative minority won. We cannot allow our nation to be controlled by screaming, rageing bigots who think they speak for all Americans"
Hahaha! Life is LIFE!
'At what point is it okay to take a human's life?' abortion is murder.
Hope there's life on Mars. To much death here.
"I can bet a lot of those pro life girls and women will want to have an abortion when they gonna have a baby, for one reasons or another. Not all, but still plenty. And if somebody would like to ask me "" well how can you know that"", look around for stories about pro life people getting abortion. It happened many times in the past and will happen again and again in the future."
Looks like life in America is becoming worse and the country is getting in a downward spiral. Biden is to be blamed.
"USA is Pathetic!!! They ban abortions but WONT ban automatic military weapons that kill innocent ppl every few seconds in USA ! Shame on USA shame shame shame USA is a horrid country
Men should have reverse vasectomies so then abortions don’t need to happen !!!! Use your brains JFC forced vasectomies on all men pass that in your USA government 
USA s u x"
"Just a note, the vast majority (like ~80%+) support first trimester abortions, and the vast majority ~(65-70%) support some second trimester abortions. This is not the will of America."
Why should mothers have the legal right to have others expertly kill their unwanted children.
"Whatever happened to condoms, birth control, or chastity until marriage. There are other options besides genocide of the unborn. The left is obsessed with sex, murder, and revolution. Us Christians are winning and will  continue to fight until this is a Christian nation again. Praise our lord Jesus Christ."
"Abortions are not banned in the US. The court ruling simply hands decision back down to the individual states. Some states are not affected like CA, NY, VA, etc. The states that have banned abortions have exceptions like rape, medical issues, etc. 🇺🇸✌🏾"
Love does not delight in evil good over evil repent God almight gives life more life good sense prevail
if women die of botched abortions that is their choice
"They bask in the false glory, but the will of the people will be heard and we shall overcome by enshrining abortion rights and reproductive rights for that is human rights."
"Great news for the unborn, for those that cant defend themselves and for those who love life. To the rest of murders, f yourself"
Why did you have to post two videos on this irrelevant issue?  The next law they need to pass is castration (and maybe a forced sex change plus throwing them into men's prison for life) or outright death penalty for rapists.
America really is a sh❤️thole isn't it?
glad that the murder of babies in some states will not be allowed
"No sex = no pregnancy.
The anti-abortion rules really make pathways to the rise of LGBTQ in America. 

You will not get pregnant if you are becoming lesbians."
"This just allows each state to set its own abortion laws. Abortion isn’t banned, some of you people need to calm down. If you want unrestricted abortion including post birth abortions then move to a deep blue state like California or New York. If you don’t want abortion used as birth control then move to a red state like Idaho, the Dakotas, etc."
"Honestly if there is ever a time to storm a government building, it wasn’t Jan 6th. It’s now. And the Supreme Court"
OMG where will Big Pharma get its immunoglobulin now?
Love does not delight in evil good over evil repent God almight gives life more life good sense prevail repent
They are forcing rape victims and victims of incest to have their abusers babies or go to prison in Oklahoma. This shit is wrong on so many levels
All the women’s banners my body my choice we’ll take responsibility if you don’t what children then use birth control the men as well
"No more baby killing. Excellent. Finally, some justice for those who cannot protest for themselves."
Human rights violator
"Disgusting. There's no way you can call the US a first world country. Some of the most stringent abortion laws in the world and no change to gun laws, it's exactly like George Carlin said they care so much about the unborn but once you're born you're on your own."
waitaminnit! How...HOW are the infant sacrifices to the androgynous god Moloch going to continue? How are these Marxists in DC going to get their adrenochrome?
1 out of every 6 American women have been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime. Lots of women are raped in the us and now they are forced to have their rapists children. These vile disgusting men should keep there laws of women's body's.
Hat's off to those people and the supreme court who decided to stop the abortions.... Loved it!!!!
Claims to be a pro life country but endorses gun laws which culminates in having the highest gun death rate in the world - what a backwards country!!
Sweeping and long overdue change.
"There are of course very sad situations that pregnancies come about and for those my heart goes out to.
However it's about time that people took responsibility for the decisions they make,if you don't want to get pregnant don't have unprotected sex!! Its that simple."
Good! It isn't in their constitution so it's a State matter. If you don't like your State then change it via voting or leave. End of.
Grossly misleading.
What the fuck
Well American is going to become the next China with way to much people that you'll probably have to put a law to make sure everyone only has one or two kids
Radical Christians
If you don’t like this country then GTFO! Bye Felicia!
"Yeah all the women wanting to keep abortion legal are the Ho's that don't want the consequences for their actions, just my opinion but that is what it looks like. I agree if a crime was involved options should be allowed but if you opened your legs, you have to accept what comes out of it, I totally agree with that. Life should always be protected."
It’s so funny. The fantasy of one right has been destroyed by a belief far more powerful one. One that the left have no control over.
Up Next: Liberals Pause January 6th Hearings To Call For Insurrection
There is no right to abortion guaranteed by the constitution. The founding fathers would have considered it an abomination.
"I am not even in US, but I feel so terrified!"
Please tell me if a woman dies from not being able to do abortion who's fault is it?
"What about post roe v wade? Are there any plans to help women who may have sought a medical abortion? What will happen now if women will have to birth ""unwanted/unplanned"" babies? Will ""pro-lifers"" step-up to provide loving, nurturing, supportive, homes and care for the babies born from the abolition of abortion? Who will help women and babies from this reversal?"
So don't get pregnant & use protection lol tf.
"Do what you want girls it's your body your baby, I can't tell someone not to do something or do something because I would be called a nosey dictator 🤷🤣"

"The US government finally degraded under Biden. In their own country, they cannot deal with social and economic problems, but at the same time they climb into Ukraine. They transfer tons of weapons and billions of dollars for the corrupt Ukrainian regime. There are so many hungry, poor and suffering countries in the world. But no one is helping Africa or South America. But there were 40 billion dollars for the war with Russia."
"Abortion is murder, plain and simple.  A beating human heart has rights."
"Don't be surprised when the racists, white supremacist and the conservatives who believe authoritarian ideology now work to continue their efforts to overturn the 14th ammendment and all civil rights gains for blacks with an aim of making racial segreagation the law of the land again."

"Some are old enough to recall times before the Pill. Unwanted pregnancies, desperation, mutilation, backstreet abortions (dirty table and knitting needlesĺ and Death. Loss two friends in high school this way. Tragedies."
"Testimony of Jeremy Thomas Robbins:
When I was a young man I enjoyed what most young party going men liked, such as girls, beer and drugs. I would have sex with any girl, any time and anywhere. For so long I am not sure how many I have been with at this point. I had little to no morals nor cares about anything really. The only thing I held onto was my word as I was taught when I was a child, that a man is measured by his word and to keep your promises. So, IF I said I was going to do something, I did it no matter the cost. That being said, one night I awoke from my sleep. Sat up in my bed and vocally promised myself I was going to read the bible. Not sure why, to this day I still have no understanding as to why I made this my word. But I did, so I read.... and read and read more. Turns out the bible is a rather large book and it was taking me some time to do it. But I gave my word and I kept on reading it and as I read it the words where convicting my soul. I could feel something in my heart start to turn and became uneasy. Then one night, when I was asleep. I awoke to a presence in the hall at the end of my bed. I could see something was there but I was not able to see what it was. Then I heard a disgusting noise coming from it and I told it. 
You're disgusting!!

Then out of the silence, out of the darkness I heard.

YOU	ARE	       TO

And it grabbed me.

Then I awoke not knowing I was in a dream as the entire dream was where I was and how I was. ""Never had a dream like this before and never had another like it again."" 
The crazy part.... I still felt right where ""IT"" grabbed me, as if the tightness of its grip was still on me.
To say the least I have seen something that is not normal nor good. There are evil things in this world we can not explain nor understand but I know as true as the air in my lungs. Spirits are real and so is God.
This is my testimony."
"Americans live in 1952 , Abortion is a mere right"
"4:16 
Jesus loves our little Children, 
He made one to make many more, 
And it grew up and raped, 
Many Women from State to State, 
And they cannot be aborted anymore.

America is one crazy place 😂"
100% the right decision to ban abortion.Well done America
Watch the massive crime spike in 15 to 20 years time!
"abortions are not in the constitution? neither is cheese, where is the ruling on that? oh wait its america, land of the fee, and home of the slave"

It's okay to murder your child when?"

"America is ful l with bs Hon. Clerance Thomas you are still considered 3/5 of a human being according the constitution, you hypocrites."
I'm surprised they left the comments on being such a divisive issue. I suspect it's because the media are not happy about it whereas they stood for no criticism on issues they supported over the past couple of years.
https://youtu.be/K98TQJ5ldW0
These morans who are screaming victory are too dumb to understand real implications of this..they need to work on making life of kids 8n this country better but who cares about those
Latin America slowly legalizing abortions over the last few years and the US now banning it after having had that right for 50 years. How demoralizing this setback is. Makes me sad as an Argentian after seeing how hard this battle was in my country to know how hard it will also be for American women now
Yes Save the Kids!!
"Her body, someone else's right. The land of the free.."
Shame!
"Now how  can you sleep for one night with this womens.
While you know they will kill your child or you.

Killers I hate this womens 
Not all of them most of them."
"Abortion is not a right in the constitution lol 😂  it now means individual states can set their own laws for abortion, like Texas has a heart beat law , maybe more women will be actually thinking about thier repoduction and contraception more diligently, abortion is not a form of contraception, it’s the murder of a child"
Why was that one girl dressed up like a cat?
"People will get angry enough at not having abortions,

but when they hear their country is being purposely destroyed as a means of a “Great Reset” to make us all own nothing then it’s sounds wonderful to them🤦🏾‍♂️"
One question for everyone else equal parts of America...if you observed one man eating human being ... do you want to be eating...if you want to be eating... you have a great mental health problem because ... woman genitals are no conch meat... what are you eating baby... myself asked... The Man conch meat...do you want some... myself go to bathroom to vomiting... okay woman who want to be conch meat...in God name amen.
It high time the President increase the number of judges on the Supreme Court.  It’s the only way to combat the Moscow Mitch’s who is nearly single handed destroying our country.
"Abortion is still a sick term but it lessens the horrific reality of the situation, murdering babies."
"So, the BBC get told about their bias and all I just heard were people crying about their rights. Not one mention of the fact of the rights of the life inside the womb."
"Thank u Yeshua !!!!!!!!!!!
PRAYING FOR OUR CHILDREN UNBORN AND BORN !!!!!!!!!!"
This is so backwards 😓
Time for me to leave this country. It doesn’t stand for much anymore. Hypocritical at best. Downright dangerous at its core.
"So America is closing down its killing fields finally. Freedom to kill innocent babies seems to be one of the reasons that triggered self-destruct America we see today, see how it leads to a country without boundary and the freedom to destroy public property and the woke culture..."
IT WAS NEVER A RIGHT TO KILL A BABY
"I'm so happy for that and proud of US supreme court , if you don't want to have babies just be responsible with your body."
"SCOTUS has established one religion, which our constitution is supposed to prevent. Alito wrote that abortion was not tradition - but her has zero proof. So we need to bring back traditional slavery ??????"
Hopefully Far-leftists don't cause billions in damages like in 2020 burn loot murder riots.
"Due to some family history I'm not pro-abortion. Not because of religion (I don't have one), not because I wish to control women. It'd be a long explaination, but basically I am a ""liberal leftie"" who has different views on this one issue.

But I recognise that this doesn't outlaw abortion, it outlaws safe abortion. Women are going to get desperate and take unregulated medication and even go to back street abortionists who may butcher them.

I fear that the US has just traded one lot of issues and problems for another lot. If there is a God then may God help any woman caught up in this political battle."
"Did Trump really say that?
We know how to create life so only a idiot would think God plays a part. 
Religion is to blame here. 
There are to many extremists in the US."
"Well, if the pro-life women get sexually assaulted (or r**ed if you really must), then say they don't want to keep the kid, then laugh at them, tell them of their decision in this case, and laugh in their faces before walking away."
Damn but I don't really care
Finally all this evil nasty women need to be  lock up.
"Many women WILL DIE! 
Thanks to the trump ADMINISTRATION and these f*cked up SCOTUS'S!"
Abortions are evil. How you can pull your baby apart in the womb is disgusting. You wouldn't do it to a dog.
"Unbelievable.  America is being held hostage by the Christian right.  Abortion won't go away.  It will go underground and, in the process, become more dangerous.  The fact that they bristle about any attempt to introduce sensible gun control regulations but are perfectly willing to restrict a women's reproductive rights tells you just how pro-life they aren't."
"I used to look at BBC as more objective than other media until it stated ""right to abortion""."
"I'm shocked and honestly devastated for American Women, this is going to pain women all over the US."
why are we going backwards WHY
"It wasn't a RIGHT and it wasn't struck down! They simply moved the decision of legality to the states, where it should have been in the first place."
"The ultimate freedom, is the freedom to kill your unborn baby."
"Just a reminder to all you Biden voters, this decision came under his term in office."
So condom sales should go up? right?
"Literally going backwards. 
“Build a better world” how does she think that’s possible when the biggest problem we face is the exploding population. There’s already to many people on this planet."
the supreme court merely ruled that nowhere in the constitution is the right to destroy human life. i'm not sure what grounds there are to disagree with that
The opposite of Pro Life is Pro Death.
Every country should allow one mistake. The 2nd should then become a crime.
"The American dream is only a dream,  its not real."
Karen's get a win.
Children born of unwanted pregnancy must be state responsibility.
This ruling still allows the 8 states who choose to terminate pregnancy up to 1 minute before birth the right to do so. Yet you do not mention this FACT ???
No wonder the population growth in Europe is lowest....yet their stupidity grows in bounds and leaps.... leave USA alone think about your own countries and how to fix your own problems....idiots
WELL DONE AMERICA!! 💪🏻 a step on the right path
"This is one of the idiosyncracies that make US politics lesser than under developed or developing countries. There are actual problems world is facing and US is still can't decide on Right To Abortion, Right To Bare Arms, ... etc.,"
And sad it is they all will end up in foster care but yet no one wants to adopt them….even those yelling that its not a good choice
"Life is worthless, rats and roaches can make lives. But making choices, having a life plan, respects, make us be human being."
Yes right now... but please don't people understand the situation...the cannibalism is over Americans... because the trade humane for gold...the gold digger trillonaries using the same thing since we have knowledge of the rapist make woman's pregnant to give meat to the canibals trillonaries...get to the bottom of...the dream is only a dream... woman have plastic bags in the chest and never can feed the baby... because nothing is natural anything else is yes a dream... wake up dreaming people... amen.
"No one actually understands what this decision is. It is an excellent legal decision.

The whole point is that the SCOTUS is NOT a political institution: Roe v Wade gave people a right that was not legislated. If you want a law, such as ""legalized abortion"" then the proper path is to ask you law maker to pass a law, that involves due process.

Roe v Wade had no due process and yet it performed the function of law making.

the decision simply deemed it improper and ask that if the public wants that right, go and ask your law maker to do it, because the function of SCOTUS is to interpret the law and not making them.

And here are people throwing a big tantrum simply because they heard some people saying they ""overturned the abortion right"" when it is nowhere near that case.

If you want abortion, vote for it, don't ask judges to do a politicians work."
Time to head to America 🇺🇸 and rap_ me some women
"Biden is a moran, save the babies, we can not have a society that uses violence  its barbaric!"
"Abortion leads to female led eugenics: its 2055: ''Artificial Intelligence analyzing the Baby's DNA:....BRRR...BRRRR...analyzing probability of the baby being over 6 feet tall, looking like Johnny Depp and not being bald nor over-weight as an adult....BRRR.....probability: 23%. Woman: ''DAMN! well, i guess i'll abort this one. Maybe i'll have better luck with the next guy''....there MUST be responsibility, otherwise we will be heading towards a society we wouldn't want to live in."
"Monsters, they deserve to be after birth aborted"
why are people so braindead in america
Sad yo back to coat hangers I guess 😔
"Too many people are claiming the right to abortion is not included in the US Constitution. Although it's true that the actual word is not used, it is included in the right to privacy. Body autonomy is a critical component of the right to privacy, in fact, which is protected by the Constitution—as decided in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shimp (1978), and of course Roe v. Wade (1973)."
"Here's how to avoid the need for an abortion: stop having casual sex!
If you must have casual sex, use contraception.
If you still manage to get pregnant (contraception fails, rape etc), you still have a wide selection of post-coital  contraception options (most/all are free in Western nations):
# Morning-after pill
 # IUD (99.9% effective at stopping pregnancy if used up to 5 days after sex)
 etc"
No! The right to murder innocent speechless babies has been struck down. Since when is murder of the innocent okay for any reason ever?
there's a lot of inexpensive birth control out there why isn't that talked about.
"The unborn” are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don’t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don’t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don’t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don’t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.

"Should be changed to ""home of the brave"" but still quite a few cowards."
"Put it this way if you think they truly care about the Unborn, Charlie Kirk a prominent pro-lifer said if he knew a women who had an abortion he would feel sorry for he. If he truly believed it was murder on what planet would he feel sorry for a murderer..."
Of course they call them trigger laws because that's what they want the whole right side to have your finger on
Do they realize its no gonna stop anyone from having one.just because  its ileagal doesnt mean its gonna stop.dont like abortions dont have one
The Supreme Court just went full Order 66 on the libs.
When roe vs wade was passed the morning after pill wasn’t available.
"Choose life, your mom did."
There should be better options 😌 people should not be using abortion as birthday!
👏😊
Handmaids tale.
The real dark day in America was when roe v wade was passed.
Biden is powerless. Period.
Unwanted pregnancies cause tax payers a lot of money.
my state is new york and any woman who is being forced to go thru with anything they dont want to is welcome here. hateful comments will not be responded to.
Expect bloodied coat hangers to be found in ally ways in states who got rid of abortion. That’s all I have to say.
"Every child is a precious and sacred gift from God #President Trump…I’ve noticed that everyone who is for abortion have already been born #President Reagan..❤️❤️Incomprehensible that since 1973, 61 million abortions done in the U.S.😭😭"
There are very few sane people on either side of the issue.  Just look at those women.  FYI: This case was about a Mississippi law that banned abortions after 15 weeks.  Women in Mississippi can still get abortions up until 15 weeks.  The media's characterization of this is misleading.
still the state decides ... so the people of the states decide ..which is still balance and good
"Bless the yanks, the majority of ""anti-abortionists"" in america using the argument of ""murdering babies"" are the same people who will bite your head off for trying introduce stricter gun laws to reduce the amount of murdered babies..."
good maybe now the std rates will go down
There is no baby for these people to save. The life isn’t made yet.
I guess In the case of a medical emergency you can claim the that rape has lead to mental illness opening a case to perform an abortion. That’s just me looking at a loop hole instead of mass riots as this decision went through all the legal paths.
Only sl*ts and manh*es be disappointed. 😁
"It’s not as if it means abortion won’t happen anymore either. It’ll still happen but it will be a lot less safe and bad people now have an opportunity to make money from it. 
And not the first time a U.S. law has had these effects, might I just add."
There are enough types of birth control and the morning after pill maybe young women might be more careful with their bodies. Abortion is not birth control. American women uoto now could abort a baby right up til the week before it was due. That shouldn't be allowed in any civilized society.
This is a great day! No more abortions!!!!!! Thank god!!!! God bless America!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎉🎉🎉🎊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🎊🎉🎊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Dramatic? For who??? For innocent ones por for killers???
"this is a decision to let states legalize abortion, what is the big deal?"
"The non-aborted humans in the future thank the Supreme Court. Abortion should only take place when the mother’s life will be in danger if she gives birth. 

Terminating a fetus because it will inconvenience your lifestyle is immoral and demonic."
Very good. We're going back to our roots in America. A proper conservative country.
Voting matters.
Great news for USA from these Low life creatures - enemy from within worst than ISIS - the Demon RATS
"The ignorance of the protesters amazes me. Do they not realize the only thing this overturn does, is to put the abortion rights back into the states? They can still get their abortion, that hasn't changed. It is still legal in the majority of states, especially in cases of rape and incest."
Never go to America.
The sport of killing humans a law is needed for the woman.
Let the accountability start :-)
"This subject shouldn't even be up for discussion. I had a friend who got raped when she was 15, her parents were idiots like these people and forced her too keep it and carry it for 9 months. When they could have allowed her to abort it since it wasn't even alive yet. She dropped out of school in order to take care of her baby. When she turned 18 her lovely parents kicked her out of their house. My mom let her live with us and took care of the child for her since it was painful for my friend to even look at the child since they so closely resembled the ""father"". My friend died in her sleep 2 years ago, she was only 19. Her whole life was ruined. She felt sad and tired all the time. And was left with a lot of inguries after giving birth since her body couldn't take it. She was such a sweet beautiful girl. I truly dispise all the men and women who are ""pro life"" what life are you talking about. It is a fetas. It has yet to develop. Unless the lady is already 5 months pregnant where the child can feel then it's none of your concern if the she chooses to abort or not. The only life is the womans who is going to be ruined. A child should be a blessing and a choice. Not a consequence. These people scream privileged and uneducated. And I wish the pro abortion people would actually bring up scientific facts and peoples stories instead of stupidly shouting ""my body my choice"". That ain't doing shit to help anyone."
"women says it will lessen the violence in her country, but the guns are fine"
"What will be next ??? Same sex marriage? Mix race marriage? What the F next ? Having cops in your f  bedroom? You can only slow down the change, but you can’t stop it."
So now what? Prohibiting guns THEN blaming on unaccessible abortions?
"Abortion should also be banned in the UK
It goes against the core principles of Christianity and Judaism and Islam but more so .... humanity"
Amazingly balanced reporting.  It is sad that “balance” in news reporting seen as remarkable.
As a citizen of the US from birth. I an deeply ashamed of this country. It is on a collision course to either another civil war or conservative dystopia. All in all there may very well be bloodshed before the end.
I see potentially HIGH risk of GUNLESS females
Great news :)
Nice!
the US politics is so bizarre. Normal things in other countries are polarized and politicized in the US.
"This is not about abortion.
The ja6 will be forced."
The dishonesty of reporting is scandalous. SCOTUS simply corrected a wrong. Roe was unconstitutional.
That has to b a complete violation of womens rights got to be!
"@5:26 you thought this country would still allow you and subsidise your child termination, got it."
i hope all the S lags and S luts arent too upset
"Glad I was able to help my 15 years old friend when she wanted a termination.
I was her only friend and brother figure ,and she needed an adult.

Only thing we had to do was travel to Manchester because someone could have recognized us in Newcastle."
"This is not really about abortion. Everyone is missing the point.  It's about judges that are biased. I don't know what people expect. You know the judges are biased, and you expect them to make a fair unbiased ruling ?"
When someone gets raped and forced to give birth abd they don't want to have it. ALL I can say is wow  good luck
I wonder if the BBC is the most hated corporation to ever exist? certainly is mt top choice
NO they lost the supposed right to make me pay for it.
As a Hispanic immigrant that came to the United stated I’m very happy for this decision. If people want to have abortions let each state decide if they want to be participant of murderer.
No it's not. It's now up to individual states to rule on the subject.
This country is dying 😂😂😂
"its not a constitutional right......your getting mixed up with the carrying a gun laws......which is an ""actual""constitutional right"
"00:08 - Abortion was a ""right"" ???   WRONG !!!  The ONLY Rights that Americans have are those enumerated in the US Constitution and its Amendments.  Americans have no other Rights but they do occasionally get ""favors"" from their Masters, the Social Security System being a prime example."
Thou shall not kill!  It's a commandment that has been overlooked for a long time. The unborn finally got their day in court & justice prevailed.
This is some taliban 3rd world shit.
America is the most divided place in the world...in my opinion.
Do America know how much of a meme they have always been to the world? What a backward place.
"I wonder if there's a statistic that shows how many pro-lifers in USA are also NRA members. Oh well, look on the bright side, more kids means more targets!"
"Now, US Supreme Court forces Americans to stand with Taliban together? US Supreme court is trying to prove the power of a religion over laws, just like Taliban? This is unbelievable. This is making US a barbarian land. So shameful! It is not other countries beat US down. It is US itself drag itself behind the world."
Are they going to have insurrection are these people going to have an insurrection against the government because abortion rights was shot down wow you better watch it people the FBI's going to throw you in jail like you and throw away the key if you're going to try to over the government what you did try on the supreme Court there before it was passed you better watch out cuz you're going to get locked up if you happy insurrection against the government because of abortion right was passed by the supreme Court
wow what an impartial report lmao.........the people are awake now......we see through the propaganda
"These comments are disgusting, my sister would be dead if she didn’t have an abortion you animals"
👍👍👍👍
"Get your molotovs ready, my boys. It's time to burn some judge's mansions."
Strange that country which is so hyped up on 'freedom' allows unelected officials to make decisions that impacts millions of people.
"The report was bias.  Noone was shown celebrating their choice to keep.  No mention, some people abuse Roe v Wade, to use abortion as a last ditch contraception, due to unprotected sex.  I dont trust non-official statistics on how many US women choose to abort during their lifetime, but a safe bet will be 10%.  I would believe among those maybe 10% were due to rape, medical, or other trauma.  Lets say 9% overall used it because of unprotected sex.  This is acceptable to keep it legal, to me.  However no mention that some people believe much more abused it.  I found stats claiming it is as high as 30% instead.  I know pro-choice and pro-life issue is so loud mainly for ideologically, political and religious reasons, not on moral ones.  Actual arguments for and against on moral grounds, matter less, and used as tools instead.  The fact, this is kicked back to the states, where abortion can be legalized one day, isn't as emphasized relative to how bad that it was overturned.  Mind you the SCOTUS issue, is not abortion legal or illegal, but who should handle this, if the abortion is a constitutional right or not, not weather it is criminal.  This report was bias, pro-choice.  No judgment, maybe for them it was impossible to represent both sides equally.  I am protesting unfair representation, not the ruling.  Dont know there, my flavor for today, pro-choice constitutional, but i am not against letting it swing, if it was legally done.  Being fair to some in their perspective, in this case, will be unfair to others in theirs."
"@2:21 “I’m 21 and I’m terrified” use condoms or other form or contraception if you must, that should do it :-)"
"Good it’s changed. Lot more men an women now will practice safer sex. No brainier, makes me happy this news 🗞"
"So misleading and one sided it’s unreal. If you know the facts. How about it’s un done many years of  a unconstitutional overhaul of the legislative process in the states, now the power for people to make choices is back with the people to decide when life Begins is a decision for the people . Trying to claim abortion is a god given right is ridiculous. If California wants to keep theirs laws so be it now red states if they choose can change their laws. Not so much for freedoms of choice when it’s other peoples choices."
"I bet the Communist BBC is sick as about this. i personally dont really care.....but the more lefties and commies and BBC staff hate the news.....the more i love it.

I'm literally amazed the BBC dare keep comments open.......how do you keep up the pretence you are impartial when all your commenters hate you and everything you stand for?

Imagine being part of the BBC.......the most PEA DOH FILE supporting organisation to have ever existed......whos the statue of outside the BBC?

scum bags

and you all dont realise how hated you all are"
"The United States of America. Or as we SOON have to call it: The-country-that-must-not-get-laid. Thank your grandpa's in the supreme court, dudes. They just drafted you ALL into the permanent FRIEND ZONE! 🤦‍♂"
"British media reporting on US news like we are a US state, please stop it’s just embarrassing. They follow the Americans like a lost dog"
"The Democrats have deployed National Guards unlike on Jan 6th when although Trump/Pence had made 20,000 National Guards ready the Democrats wouldn’t deploy them because they wanted a riot."
Who wakes up thinking about other ppl pregnancies and abortions???
"This is the greatest news the USA has had in decades! Finally the 55% of Americans who oppose abortion will be able to decide their own states' laws on the subject. History will remember this the way it remembers the ending of slavery and all of its ""less-than-human"" arguments."
keeping legs closed is usually a good thing to do or take the pill
Abortion is wrong
HAHAHAHA!!!  HAHAHAHAHAH!!! I e never seen some many lunatics in my life. 😂 Women still have the right to choose. To choose to keep their legs shut.
And im an englishman no way this should have happened women should have every right to choose period !
"I thought America was a free country ? Clearly it's not as good as they say, im moving to Japan"
all the anti-abortion activists in the video are fat and ugly women. I wonder why.
"How about birth control pills, day after pill, and condoms??   rape is practically the only time the female has not all these aids to keep from conceiving.  if a woman does not want to conceive............... i sure as hell don t want to be born to her.  even when they think they want a kid..... they usually f up.  and that is when they are not sadists, pedophiles, etc."
Thank you my Dear  Heavenly Father❤
country who wanted to change the status of women's rights in Afghanistan.... lol
There will be violence....
♥️💪🏿✌🏿
congrats Americans!
I’m living in Massachusetts and this ruling doesn’t apply to my state. We will still having abortion. Conservatives can go F themselves.
Garden tools be angry 😂😂🤣🤣
right to abortion is like a right to cut your finger off if your finger gets broken abortion is wrong
"KEEPING LEGGING CLOSING , SAVES LIVES BECAUSE WHILE YOU TAKE UP A HOSPITAL BED GETTING RID OF A LIFE THAT MIGHT WANT TO BE HERE -- THE BED YOU TAKE ALSO DEPRIVES A SICK PERSON THAT WANTS TO BE HERE . ? -- JUST A THOUGHT ."
"If the two sides could just respect each other I think that would do a lot.
Its not murder.  it's not just a parf   of a woman's body
Spare  14 day embryos in iVF clinics receive no sacraments
Ani implantation contraceptives ""morning after pill"" are available over the counter  in some states.

It is obviously the woman's choice - as it is her risk

A Brit"
Love our Supreme Court! ❤ This will teach people to be more responsible.
I INVENTED GILEAD. THE SUPREME COURT IS MAKING IT REAL. Margaret Atwood.
Trumps still at work.. a win for life today. 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
"The BBC shouldn't be aloud to t port on their it's like this as they don't report the truth, and just feed us Democrat bullshit... No one should be a!our to about a baby when it's almost due to be born!"
Now they can adopt all of the kids that will be born into poverty.
"Go Back to California, also give California back to Mexico"
A disgusting country.
So is this good or bad?
This sucks…
"Perhaps they don't want to cancel abortion, only fix that old ruling that served as a platform for wider rights of woman.  Hope I'm not mistaken, but now they can start a completely different procedure, giving back abortion rights to woman based on plain scientific facts. That couldn't ever be overruled because science doesn't change with time. 
But first science must make it very clear there are no other people living inside a woman body."
So do I still need to pay child support 😂
Its a sad day that the unborn child cant be slaughtered ( joe biden )
They care about babies lives and at the same time not do anything about kids being killed in schools makes sense
"We need to support the right to choose abortion for women. If parents cannot support their babies, then who supports? I do not want to see child neglect. It’s a fact. Right?"
America further becomes a sick joke.
"While the supreme court decided abortion rights, our planet secretly wished for an extinction event."
Lol what a great country hahaha mad days ahead
"So now you will force american women to have babies after they have been raped!gangbanged!abused,incest babies that are born deformed from mixing family genetics from abuse will be forced to be born? Are you crazy america? Have you judges gone simply wacko?!have you opposition not got any screws in your brains whatsoever?what about women that are raped by serial rapers,serial killer babies that could grow to be serial killers and rapers themseleves because of passing over hereditary genetics,omg what a bad decision you guys made today !"
The bbc is creepy.
"Finally! The libs rant its ""my body, my rights"" but what about the rights of the baby its ""his/her body, his/her rights, his/her life"" abortion is MURDER of a baby, a human child."
"I’m obviously pro-life but this is bullshit, people are being stripped of their own rights, what if A women was raped? “Oh you have to keep that baby and communicate with the father… (rapist)”"
Can you stop obsessively reporting on the US. It's not the UK
It just went back to the states you dumb ninny.
Excellent news.
"So...  A  bunch of old men just decided American women have no right to their own bodies any more? 
Sorry USA Dude, you can't hang with us FIRST WORLD countries any more. Forcing chicks to have kids is NOT cool and soooo THIRD WORLD country. Respect your women as fellow human beings, Brah."
These people pick and choose their religious sins what is tolerated and what is not look in the mirror before telling a person what to do with themselves
"In China,  an unborn placenta is not yet identified as life,  it's just mother's property and the mother has the right to give up the property, which is her freedom，If abortion would endanger the mother's life, then no hospital would perform the procedure, because the right of Life  is first."
F***ing Arkansas
Women that travel from one state to another to have an abortion is nothing short of premeditated murder.
"The ""pro-life"" crowd are the same people who would deny asylum to desperate people fleeing warzones and abject poverty, they're also the same people who want to allow unstable teenagers access to assault rifles, and they're the same people who support Trump's immigration policy, tearing families apart and caging them. They must think were stupid if they think they're fooling anyone into believing they care about strangers unborn children. To them, this is simply about attacking feminism, upholding ""Christian"" values, and winning one over on the ""libs"". That's how petty and backwards these people are."
pro lifers have no brain
"So if a woman get's raped and get's pregnant from that, she will have no choice but to keep it even if she does not want it. So much for a free country....."
Its hilarious these ProLife also promote Pro Death by expanding Gun right and minimize restrictions. Expect a 60% increase in orphanages & abandoned newborns too.
"EVERYONE must vote for representatives that support women's rights. Since they threw this issue to the states it is up to us, the voters."
Based. Fuck leftists and fuck child-killers.
"This comment won't go down well Every day in America more &more extremely young children are treated like trash & abused & murdered by their own parents So that's where quite a number of these unwanted children will end up I'm sure the rest, after yesterday's ruling on the second Amendment Upholding Americans rights to keep feeling & thinking they look macho due to the fact that they carry a concealed ego in their holster which means they are in control Those children will probably get wiped out in the waves of mass shooting that is inevitable Bunch of HYPOCRITES"
"Repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, for the salvation of your souls...."
The fuck¨¨¨talibans of occidental countries. This is not the end - Respect to all American women who gonna start a hard resistance against this oppression of their fundamental rights.
"Abortion is not a human right, it's murder period."
I love children and all people. I am so grateful for the results determined by the Supreme Court. I believe in human rights. This protects the human rights of the unborn child.
1 in 4 pregnancies 'self abort'. For these religious extremists does that mean their God is an abortionist?
For such a new country not 250 yrs old. To actually force someone else's recent religious ideals onto non religious ppl is NO democracy. Recent? Coz didn't the nuns used to abort teen pregnancies? For all we know they probably still perform these on convent girls now..... holier than thou....
"100 years behind civilised society, including gun laws"
"It looks like the BBC doesn't understand how the US constitution works.  The Supreme Court can't and didn't make abortion illegal.  It simply said the constitution doesn't protect it as a ""right"".  That means that each state can put it to a vote.  This is called ""democracy"".  Rights are not put to a vote, and nowhere in our constitution is there a ""right"" to an abortion.  If a subject is not stated as a ""right"" than according to the 9th amendment of our constitution it is a matter for the states to decide by VOTING.  This is why the US is a constitutional republic using democracy to settle matters the constitution does not address.   Read the US constitution.  It is a very short document, and no where is there a right to abortion.  The word does not even appear in it.  This is where democracy plays a role in our constitutional republic.   In California they'll be killing their kids right up until the age of 18.  In Texas killing your kid will be illegal.  That is how a republic works."
Hallelujah for the unborn babies!!
Typical BBC. So biased and one sided. It is heartwarming however to see so many prolife comments on here. ❤️
Sluts got to stop slutting I guess 😂
What’s next reversing womens rights?? America is so tapped and backwards 😔
same people that  whine about too much  government . they  have taken control over  female  health. the  power of a few over the many . everyday  our  freedom is  fading in amercia.
BBC bulshit again all 50 states will still have abortion but will have a time limit states can vote who are in charge out so democracy rules you can go to a different state to have an abortion these people want late abortion up to time of birth 🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥
NOTICE ALL THE PEOPLE A GAINST ABORTION YOU WOULD NOT FUCK ANY WAY ? Just have the baby and drop them off at the prolife HQ......
Lol what a looney bin
What a sad day in America all because a group of men
usa is a theocracy - so much for freedom of religion
"man this looks like a SOUTH PARK episode, unreal.."
"To the woman who said she's terrified

""Do you feel helpless, Do you feel victimised, Do you feel like your rights have been taken away and your voice silenced by a higher authority? Well you're in good company because I know thousands of unborn babies who know exactly what that's like, if you dont want a baby, dont have sex!""

To the woman who said were gonna keep having botched abortions and die as a result.

""Your basically saying we are gonna keep illegaly murdering people until one day our victim kills us""

I would really struggle to feel sorry for you in that instance."
You may not like what they take away from you next !
"It will come down to each individual State having its own sets of values; America 
was started as a Republic, not a Democracy. Food for thought. 🦉🍏🦉"
This is messed up
"Roe v Wade also made legal, contraceptives and contraceptive education. These can both be banned buy any states now. Companies who market these product, and health care facilities that provide advice or there products are now criminals in America."
isn't it funny how the left all of a sudden knows what a woman is after this ruling
it simply means the states control abortion.
Good if you don’t want children put a johnny on it
CANADIANS WILL HELP AMERICAN WOMEN WE ALREADY SAID.  YOU CAN COME HERE AND GET A ABORTION ANYTIME.  YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY BUT AT LEAST YOU CAN GET ONE HERE DON'T WORRY.
Sorry you can't kill babies some Men can't even have any
The supreme court didn't ban abortion. BBC doesn't understand how the U.S. system works.
Now we need to fight to ban same sex marriages
A victory for humans.
"THEY KEPT THEIR GUN LAWS, YET THEY LOSE A RIGHT TO ABORTION? CRAZY USA"
It is a shame to see such a modern country act so pathetically with regard to human rights. They base their constitution on their being oppressed but do no more than oppress their own people.  So you cannot abort a  child even from rape but we are fine with a teenager owning handguns  and driving cars but they cannot drink until 21 they allow TV evangelists whonprey on the weak and poor and are ok better than thieves themselves and then without checking anyone can own an assault rifle. What a ridiculous society
"They had to cheat the system, lie and become hypocrites to get it done."
Handmaidens tale in the USA
America is dusted
I agree!!!!!!!!!
"Arbotion clinic: “I’m sorry Ma’am, we are not going to be able to murder your unborn baby today. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.”"
"America – land of the free… unless you’re poor, female, non-white, anti-gun or atheist."
People you better pay close attention. The prison camp walls are being built getting aid from the Supreme Court. They just made a moral decision. Not a legal decision. That's not their job. This needs to be looked into. This is a warning shot. First in many. In plan to rewrite other laws to their benefit.  All in moving America backwards. No regard for the majority wanting this law to stand & what's brazen is they knew what the majority wanted & carried this out anyway. Little side not for you guys out there. Your fucked now. Do an oops and your life as well as the girl is really fucked. Advise? For your sake get a vasectomy. You could get stuck with a woman like who's interviewed here. God the mental immoral minority are yelling through a megaphone.
Great news!
Praise God 👏 how awful that they want the right to kill their own children 🙏 😪
The mostly peaceful riots will start soon
I thank God for this awesome victory today. God Is Good
More life more money more wife
"women applauding a return to a bygone age of oppression and no rights for women now they have no control over there own bodies. only in america, whats next ? cover your faces walk 6 feet behind your man. never say no to rape? its coming because its america the land of the free but only if your male heterosexual and of course white and wealthy. sick country"
The best news in 2022. God bless United States of America. Abortion is murder.
"Sections of the US of Americans love to kill, by hook or by crook.
By all types of guns murdering the young 'uns,
If not before birth, then before they see earth.
Women supported by the men causing impregnation,
To have pleasure and without any procreation,
Better as justice to the unborn give the couple sterilisation."
"Well this means they can change the gun rights, right? 😅"
American politics needs an overhaul. The system is broken. First you have the Trump fiasco and now this. Maybe they need to adopt the Westminster system. Hard to call what they have now a democracy for the people. Come on guys sort it out.
"MASTER TIP: I now understand why my childhood friends said women that believe in abortion are unfit for marriage and should be for recreational use only. If a woman is so heartless as to murder her own children, think of what she will do to you when you no longer serve a desired purpose. It’s simply a good vs evil and light vs darkness spiritual battle. How can any moral person justify demanding the right to murder someone with impunity. What a shame?"
"Yes this horrible. These babies will now be birthed and immediately start carrying guns provided by the SCOTUS ruling! Theses babies will  be wanting payback because the Birthing  Persons wanted to abort them but SCOTUS has put a worldwide ban on abortions. Gangs of newborn babies will be roaming the streets of America armed with with AK-47,s and AR-15,s looking for the new Chest Feeders that reluctantly brought them in to this lawless world!"
The majority of woman who get abortions do so because they got pregnant by not using protection. Or just not having sex at all. I understand why woman who have been raped are upset. Those have my sympathy. But most of you need to learn responsibility.
"The problem that arises from more millions of Americans as refugees from the failed GOP states -- like for California that handed Joe Biden 5-million of the popular vote, that he did not need to win California -- is that it entrenches the disruptive power of a death-grip on the country, that the Republicans hold, by way of the Electoral College system. The majority of Americans, as appealed to by Joe Biden, must give the Democrats the commanding majority in both Congress and Senate, with which  set things right. If they refuse to do that, this 2022 and 2024. the US is on a Daytona-fast-track, track, to becoming the Former Democracy of America (FDOA) under Trump (or similar), like the Former Democracy of Afghanistan (FDOA)  that Trump handed over to the Taliban."
"Almost 50 years passed before the Supreme Court of America can see beyond the clouds. Now you get it, change has come to America."
"For the United States, this over turning of Roe v Wade, continues the rocket sled ride back into the times of ignorance and cruelty. I see this dilemma as a women's issue, it's best left to them to make a decision that primarily effects them. No exception for pregnancy resulting from rape or incest flies against the tenons of a descent and supportive society. Drawing on religion and the words written by ignorant, ie primitive Middle Eastern desert dwellers in a world we think of as being enlightened yet has no humanity for others, Americans pray a lot, cast judgement on other people, yet whose military is responsible for wickedness so egregious, so vile, that even God will deny you all  entry to the heavenly kingdom where most of you are certain exists.

"Stupid rule, women should be able to make decisions on what happens to there own body. Americans are mental ."
"America – land of the free… unless you’re a poor, female, non-white, anti-gun or atheist."
Was this not prompted by states like Commiefornia  legislating for termination 24 days after delivery. . Tell me if i am wrong.
"Every idiot out there for those of you who abuse people with conditions, when much applies to you, you will not be helped, for you bash people with conditions then get one yourself.

This has nothing to do with the American Dream to that of life is uncivil or perverse. And for the government to be involved to force pro-life people and blame republicans is unacceptable when they took up the case to choose to that of they had the house through a corrupt means. 

If it were up to the president though he argues in the case of women, it would be used as a ploy to score political earning points for democrats that turned the nation upside down or divided it even more. The fault is the democratic took it up and yet the high justices made their decision with clarity and hopefully not politically motivated tough confused some people by their decisions.

Why are people so committed to murder outside the womb and by that, I mean women - aside from the fact they did not want the child? They should think about that before they think about sex is what others would have thought to that of the vital heartbeat bill is important to determine if the baby is functioning or alive. If so, it gives people the right to choose rather than to sacrifice for intentional murder then, so life is justified or somewhat satisfied. Though I mean there should be a limit of time to get that procedure done anyway? - They forget to include that rape and incest is a matter of abortion rights as well and it does not explain this validity of rights or wrongs in the constitution but amended. 

To it has to be the Morales of humanity is screwed up before the face on both sides. 

One to argue for life and the other for murder. In this case 
I would claim give the baby to the caring mother and not that of the one willing to have life and kill it. - An ancient example that time forgot.

Though I have to admit, this is actually good to teach people a lesson about the abandonment. - By that I mean people who continue to give birth and persecute on a purposeful means. What the democratic of idiots in the government to the president do not understand to a point is that it should have been chosen by the states to begin with, to that of the lady should also have a right to choose based on case-by-case scenario in defense of whose body it is - referring to the lady's wants. So technically Poloski in one case is right and wrong. This is actually a step forward for what is right for the lives of others to that of also a blow against those of anti-life.

It should not be up to the states to pay for illegal abortions or intentional murder. It does not advocate for murder but to justify for life. So, I am unsure if this statement applies knowing I do not know the case too well."
"Overturning Roe v Wade simply moves the issue from a federal level to a state level, the amount of hysteria in these comments goes to show that many people don't do any research when giving their opinions."
Let's wait for all these peaceful protests
Realistically?
"This title lets me know BBC is mega Left and heavily uninformed, abortion now isn’t banned it’s just controlled by the state nevertheless killing babies for selfish reasons is morally wrong and a sin"
"Let's be honest. The majority of people who want abortion is not because of the welfare of the baby, even though that's what they are preaching. It's because so they can have sex without the worry of giving birth. It's about them, not the baby..it comes down to desires and their lust. I would say perhaps 5% of them? And I'm being generous here, would probably do the abortion for the welfare of the baby."
"What's the point us having a president/leader again? Doesn't f***ing work does it, he can't do jack shit by all accounts, unless you mean endanger human life in afghanistan, then he is your man. Of course he didn't make that decision either."
Please don't come to California Jesus Freaks......
"Arkansas law protects the life of the mother? WTF! She should be forced to carry even if she dies.  why is her life more sacred? If the law was fair it would let her die, put her on life support and the baby delivered when viable.  All men who rape should get the same sentence as the mother who can't choose abortion - life imprisonment.  Fathers who abandon their children should get the same sentence as the mother forced to birth and raise the child - life!"
It is understood better from a female put in that position.
This will teach irresponsible females to be wiser with their bodies. Don’t have unprotected sex.
Based.
"It should never of been in the constitution you idiots , ps its now in the public legislators hand where it should be, abortion is not ileagle ,the people of each state can now decide"
Those women who are against abortion have probably never heard a story of a rape victim.   That's just one example
"What's the difference between an infant and human adult? Size, development, dependency, and mobility. What's the difference between the fetus and an infant? Size, development, dependency, and mobility. HMMMMMMM. Scientifically, when does a human beings life come into existence? When the sperm meets the egg forming a zygote and a complete unique set of DNA down to each individual cell that will stay that way for that human beings entire existence. What is the definition of Murder? The intentional killing of an innocent human being. Abortion: The intentional killing of an innocent human being... God bless America. God is smiling upon us today and I am proud to say I am American."
Yes yes yes 🔥 this was nonses from a woman

"The 9th amendment states: 

""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.""

This means that are human rights that are acknowledged, but not stated in the bill of rights and that the constitution cannot be used to infringes upon the rights of the individual just because it's not explicated stated in the constitution. 

The banning of abortion at any level of the government is a clear violation of one's 9th amendment and 14th amendment right that promises equal protection under the law."
Sad day for women. People should probably care more about the actual kids being murdered in schools and stuff but sure change this law instead
"Lol President Biden thinks that letting the elected officials of the people decide their own rules and regulations is extreme.
Yet forcing all states to allow the mutilation, dismemberment and discarding of helpless human beings is totally not extreme guys.

"Abortion should be legal, the unborn baby is not a citizen of any country after all and it should be accessible to all women."
"I can understand the religious stand point these people have and I can respect them for having that opinion. But from a sociatle standpoint is awful and disgusting, as well as ruining lives but also halting scientific research, simply vile."
"Correction: Oversight allowing Infanticide, an egregious crime that's suddenly become trendy, to be legal patched by US Supreme Court. Only good thing it's done so far, everything else has been garbage"

"Very sensitive subjects. To me if someone cant or don’t want to have a baby, let them make that decisions. What good for the baby come out and got throw away, got mistreated, or got killed. Best advice i have is if you really want to have abortion then go to other countries."
Praise the Lord.
"Imagine if these people actually cared about children, how much better my life would have been. Instead religious nuts just told me to pray as I suffered as an unwanted child in care."
Why are they focusing on the rights of the woman and not on the rights of the baby? Its not about women its about the babies🙏

"The US is just a messed up country. It´s a fact. And to think they´ve been trying to feed us for decades the non truth fact that they are the ""beacon of democracy and freedom of the world"" HA!"
Imagine in the UK if the county council decided you suddenly couldn't have an abortion. Federalism is nuts!
Abortions should be nobodies damn business except for the woman and her healthcare provider. Everyone else needs to stay the fuck out and mind their own damn business. Stop shoving your beliefs onto others. Abortions were banned before assault weapons. USA is on a downfall thanks to republicans who voted for conservative leaders who then voted conservative justices onto the Supreme Court. This is beyond disgusting and a clear violation of womens rights.
"And just like that, magically, left wing extremists liberals suddenly know what a “woman” is. You can only stay that crazy in the head for so long."
Next impeach Biden
"On the NYSE, coat hanger manufacturer stocks are going through the roof."
"Excuse me young women use a condom or abstain, murdering babies in NOT A RIGHT"
I think it’s only fair to give the decision over to the states. The federal government has too much power.
"I’m just watching the same  right-wing extremism that tried to steal an election, flood the streets with guns, ruin the environment, and now they're forcing women to have children they can’t raise."
Nothing has been taken away from any US citizen! That is not what this decision is saying at all.... it is simply stating it is not for the federal government to decide on the matter.
Excellent.
As a woman i can confidently say that there is no such thing as a right to kill your children.
"Democrats shriek ""my body, my choice"" but not when it comes to the vaccine!"
Just move to a state that thinks the way you do. Problem solved. 👍
There's so many ways women can stop getting pregnant these days. The coil the pill and condoms and not having sex unless you want a child because that is the purpose of sex. Why after all of these choices a female/women/xx can still kill a human is sick. Take responsibility for your actions not lives!
Lo han hecho bien el aborto es un crimen. Los hijos se pueden evitar. Hay muchos medios para prevenir un embarazo. El aborto es un crimen.
"And if we can accept that a mother can kill her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?

Get the facts.......They just turned it back over to the states to make abortion laws.
Trump's Justices finally did something useful.
I wonder if the USA 🇺🇸 Supreme Court will overturn American women’s right to be a person?
There will be an epidemic in 'dumpster babies'.
The constitution does not say abortion is a womens right
Lmao the libs are melting
"You keep thinking that America cannot become a worse theocratic cesspool, then it manages to sink lower. Biden needs to grow a pair, appoint 50 new SCOTUSes by presidential order, get this immediately overturned, then impose term limits on SCOTUS, and impeach every scotus who lied during their selection. And while he's at it, can he PLEASE lock his treasononous predecessor and his partners in crime up, along with every person currently working to subvert democracy, then remove the ridiculos presidential pardon power in perpetuity, especially the means to give proactive pardons.
But we all know he wont because he's both spineless, and part of the same rancid, corrupt system, and HE wants to protect his own pitiful interests."
Absolutely horrible!  The Government has no right to Control our Bodies!
"Disgusting BBC ""reporting"". Abortion is not a ""procedure"" it is MURDER of innocent unborn babies. Ave Maria!  Protect the innocent from evil."
"It took me a few hours to digest this decision, because i had not really thought about it because i dont really care.   But now I feel relieved that the abortion issue can be decided state by state.  Because when it was a supreme court ruling that was like tyranny.  Said every state had to let women have abortions that was too bossy.  Now each state can vote, and each person can live in a state they chose.  I think this is great, and women should stop whining."
"This is the most important day in history that protects the unborn and their rights to life. God is more powerful than Satan and today is God's victory over Satan has finally come to fruition.  This slaughterhouse nation - backed by Planned Parenthood - has murdered 60 million babies for 50 years - people who could have been our leaders, scientists, teachers, doctors and contributors to society.  With today's victorious ruling we finally bring everyone back to their senses and fight for the freedom to live not die by a planned parenthood butcher.     The slaughter of our nation has gone on too long and all the femi-nazis have drunk Satan's Jim Jones Koolaid convincing them abortion is health care which is a lie - abortion/murder is good which is a lie.  The Aztec and Myan civilizations use to throw their babies into boiling oil to sacrifice them to Satan - abortion is the same ritual to honor Satan and now it has come to an end. PRAISE GOD"
Isn't this all over the vast majority of the world changing how they view terminating a life and when?
More women's need to move to North Korea maybe they have better rights over there.
"It's great news to hear 👂 that ROE V WADE is being over turned.
It's about time you stop the killing  of the innocent. 
I here a lot of women and girls say it's my body my choice yes that sounds just about right from a sinner who doesn't know the real truth about what they are doing. 
It was the Almighty God that gave you the opportunity to be born and to inter his world 🌎 but you can't see beyond your self-centered wicked heart ♥ 💔 to show mercy to the unborned.
Woman has always wanted to choose what is not right for the family 😕 it started in the garden of eden the great rebellion yes I know you don't believe it but it is true even if you die not believing any of it.It still will go on with are with out you. 

There are many women and girls who have chosen to do the right thing and show mercy to unborn.But there are still many spiritual blinded daughters of the Almighty God who have chosen rebellion your rewards will come faster than the wind and in that day you will call for mercy 🥺 but because you have not chosen wisely there will not be any for you in your time of troubles.
ROE V WADE is a tool used by the devil to kill as many unborn as possible to stop the plans of the Almighty God but it have never worked. 
He the devil tried to stop the Almighty God in the days of old Egypt 🇪🇬 😪 when the  Pharaoh's of Egypt was killing the first born of the children of Israel to stop the Almighty God's plans but it did not work. 
So if you are one of those who wants 🤔 abortion you're working for the devil.Even if you do not believe 🤔 this devil exist he the devil is working in you every time you decide to kill the unborned child.your murderer by the Almighty God standards."
"The way pro-lifers were speaking, they sounded frustrated with the state of the country and are channeling their frustrations to abortion. Some people were saying that banning abortion would bring the USA back to its former glory and to being a great country again"
That means millions of women will have to think before they have sex.Women need to wake up.
It should be up to the woman if she wants or needs to an abortion Not Congress !!!! If they are so worried about life why was the Aids and Corona Virus released on purpose and do not forget the Twin Towers !!!! ( World Population Control ) More of our Rights Gone !!!!!! It is getting like old Germany NO Rights for the people WTH
"The Democrats have held commanding majorities in both the Congress and the Senate and could have legislated this problem out of the way. But it was politically  safer to kick that can of a third-rail, hot-button issue into the long grass of the SCOTUS.  Will The REAL Republicans of MAGA suffer any consequences this November 2022 and for 2024 ??  Will the Democrat judges walk out and leave the SCOTUS inoperable ??"
How about you stop having sex with anyone you see. Have some respect for yourselves.
Right to life protected by Supreme Court
"The overturn of Roe just means the decision goes back to each State. So if you live in a leftist state like Commiefornia, NY, etc. this won't effect you - you can still kill your babies. Calm down.
Research the details, ignore ignorant headlines and celebrities screeching on Twitter."
"We exist in time! To understand ourselves means to reflect on time. To understand time, we need to reflect on ourselves. The book Your Brain Is A Time Machine by Dean Buonomano, he states that your brain reacts with the passage of time and establishes bridges between the past, present, and future. If someone throws us something to catch, we move our hand to where the item will be in the future. We plant seeds to grow crops in the future. We invest in scientific research so that in the future it will result in knowledge and technology. This being between past and future events is central to our mental structure. From the book The Order Of Time by Carlo Rovelli. What I get from this is that the evolution of the brain from before the Cambrian times to the present around six hundred million years, this is how the brain functions. What is happening today in America is that the majority of American Homo sapiens are not connecting the past with the future. They just want to live in the status quo of the past, becoming stagnant, never creating knowledge or learning. Their past is a white supremacy state with racial divide and a fascist state in which some dictator tells them what to think and what to do as they sit on their couches eating barbecue, watching sports and reality tv shows. The only future they are interested in is the next sport event, reality tv show time, and reporting for work. To them it's a crime to have education, critically think for yourself, and question authority! Proust in his novel Remembrance Of Things Past states that reality is formed by memory. Which is so perfect in American society today! False memories constantly given to the people by propaganda channels like Fox News, OAN, Epoch Times, Breitbart, and other radical right wing fascist channels are creating this nightmare of a reality we face now! This stagnation is the death of American democracy and America! Other nations will advance in science, medicine, education, and the arts. While America degrades into warring villages and states. Hint! Study the Islamic empire from 1000 to 1400 should open anyone's eyes. The insurrection and Reversing Roe vs Wade are just the beginning! ☢ ENDS ☢"
"I think it should be legal for this doctor to kill the babies.  But we live in a democracy, and now each state can vote on how they want their state to handle abortion.  And if one does not like it they can leave to a state they like."
"So much drama and emotion, how exhausting."
Abortion is crime
BBC = British Brainwashing Channel
you don't need to screw America. America fucks it self
"its not about a woman's right to abortion, its about a child's right to not be killed. this should encourage more people to take precautions and unless their life is at risk then they have no right to kill"

"See the next time some American tells us they are the land of the free.....ram that right up your arse, free if your male and that's about it."
Bonkers
I feel so sorry for women in the USA.  next they'll have to cover their hair.
I blam Rupert Murdoch.
I wonder if abortion should be authorised by the given circumstances and not to gender? I.e with men’s rights
"""Separation of church and state"" is paraphrased from Thomas Jefferson and used by others in expressing an understanding of the intent and function of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution which reads: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...""

Let's ban religion too."
Wow the Democrats haven't been this angry since we freed their slaves. Its gonna get crazy this weekend.
Just put contraceptives in all tap water. Women who want a baby can drink bottled spring water. Problem solved. 👍
Today's decision of overturning Roe vs Wade is a no-win situation for everyone because everyone loses. It's a things of yet to come that is not in a good way.
"The F'ing media strikes again. It was never a constitutional right and there was no amendments adding abortion to the constitution. Abortion isn't illegal in America, its now up to individual states to decide, which is how their constitutional republic system works. Weed is illegal at the federal level in America but individual states have made it legal, same shit, different days."
This is amazing!!!
Maybe not the best country in the world but the most crazy for sure.
"Yay,  save some babies!"
Can we ban religion please?
"It is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live as you wish.
-Mother Teresa"
"And this is why the rest of the world watches the US with popcorn in hand wondering which aspect of human rights they will play the uno reverse card with. This law is forcing women to do 'at-home' abortions leading to unnecessary deaths. This was proflific in Europe for years and changed like what, 50 years ago?"
"It’s not making it ilegal at all, it’s up to the states to make it legal or not. There’s are states that allow abortion up to 8 months of pregnancy. That’s scary"
The true is. Govermemt knows that without baby.  There will not be a America in the future.  Just like Japan and China now.  All the Govermemt around the world is doing whatever they can to make as much baby as they could for their country.  Without baby.  In 50 years.  You left with 2 options.  Your country either going to be run by immigrants. Or everyone that’s over 80 years old.

DEUS VULT! GOD WILLED IT AND IT WAS DONE!
Feminists can rant and rave all they like.
"The world now
Wtf"
About time
"Yay ! Congrats America.. Your rights have been shut down. Land of the free and and all that.. that now means fuck all.  

Your free to be told how Women are denied the right over their own bodies. Well done very progressive. 

To the Women affected by this, I am deeply sorry..And I say this as a Man."
This is truly awesome
"This means more single mums.
More children to adopt and orphanages.
More underage mothers."
The reason why these people exist is because they were not aborted.
Perhaps a greater use of contraceptives ?
Woman should have the right to there own anatomy my body my choice I'm Antinatalist against bringing kids in to exsitence having kids is worse than murder
"The bottom line is that restricting abortions will lead to: more single mothers who are not financially supported by the state sufficiently, greater birth rate of children with disabilities - also consider women who were alcoholic or drug addicted prior to getting pregnant (that could have been previously tested for and aborted), more young women unable to go on to college and be independent, miserable upbringing of unwanted children especially those with disabilities from parents who take out their frustrations on the child as they see it as ruining their youth or independence financially. It’s really difficult to end it when there are definitely good reasons for it. I am sure even a pro lifer wouldn’t want to have the child of a man who raped her! This should be a personal choice between a woman and her doctor but set within a definitive time line. And women who abuse abortion having had multiple ones (3+) should be sterilised."
Just like in all other areas of life our rights are being removed one at a time.
Protest don’t work. Now it’s time that we start spilling blood
Liberal Tears are delicious.
"Women have the right to do what they want with their body !!
WRONG ❌ ! 
When a life is conceived inside the womb, then its not only that mothers property ,but its baby's property as well as  it's dad's (sperms donner ) property. 
Its like an Embassy which is located in host country ,but ownership and responsibilities are shared ."
Never met one person in my life in my country the netherlands who was against abortion.
America is looking like a third world nation
"America. kill your kids and let in more illegals, you know, the people who might vote for democrats. MIGHT."
Did nobody read Freakonomics?
I’m literally…shaking….right….now
"Just to clarify things as the BBC are liars. 1, there is no Constitutional Amendment that says abortion is a Right. 2, this doesn't make abortion illegal it just makes it a matter for individual States. I'm actually personally in favour of abortion being legal but with a limit of around 18 to 20 weeks"
"If you don't want a baby ,stop having sex. it is simple... God be praise!!!"
"I truly believe that until a fetus has been grown for 24 weeks, and can survive outside its mother’s body, it is not a completely separate life. It is a human soul tethered to its mother’s body, and she has the right to choose how she proceeds with this part of her life and her body. Whether you like it or not their rights do not outweigh the health and sanity of their mother’s. Late term abortions (post 24 weeks) should only ever performed for serious medical reasons. Women who are having late term abortions are only doing so if their baby will not have any quality of life outside the womb. It is unfathomable for me how any politician let a bunch of narrow minded ideological driven so call Justices of Law can believe that they understand more about a woman’s health, and survival, than the doctor caring for her."
Didn't mind when they were telling people they had to have the jab. Fuck off BBC. How about telling the real truth about the grooming gangs?! Lying by omission is still lying!
"Only goes to show.  Your 'rights' depend on the whims of some old decriped lawyers. One days it legal next day it's not,following day it's legal again?  That is not a system that is anarchy!  Not based on safety or science,but simply that is what they want now.  No nation can endure being run at the whims of people."
It’s okay to shoot kids but not remove a bunch of cells🤦😤

And i always thought they were a liberal and advanced country like i saw whem i was there...   i was completley false...
Human rights? Womens rights? What about the babies rights?
A civilization that literally begs for and celebrates the killing of its future generations is a major sign of a dying civilization.

It’s a big victory!:)

"How can killing babies be okay?  We killed millions of babies since 1973, how can we say that other countries like Saudi or China have the worst Human Rights when US has killed millions of babies.  What a hypocrisy."
I cannot believe those nurses were crying they can't murder babies anymore 😂
People should stop minding other people's business and mind their own. Individuals have Individual needs. Health and safety should be our first priorities.

Traveling to other States is legal ( if they have the funds to do so )"
If I killed a pregnant woman  I will  double homicide but a woman killing a child they call it an abortion people are crazy AF

Up to 9 months it was legal. How can you say that's not taking a human life ?
I’m not sure America is a real place 😂😂
"The majority of the world is shocked by the rank hypocrisy of the ""Land of the free"" where you're not even free to control your own body as a woman... Where they're ""pro-life"" but couldn't give a shit about the mother or the child once they're born & where only 11% of children in the care system get adopted.
Where they won't even control guns to stop children from getting slaughtered... but don't forget, these people are ""Pro-Life""?!

You're an outlier as a developed nation without Universal Healthcare & where severe illness or injury can bankrupt you...
You have comparatively minimal workers' rights & now the religious extremists are removing freedoms from others they have zero intention of helping in any way shape or form. It's disgusting.

I'd recommend ALL the women & men who stand against this, see the state of what their country is & is becoming, & leave.
I'd like to see the state of their economy & country when all the educated & non-religious extremists have left & benefit other countries."
"this is what democracy looks like, we vote in preisdents who place judges on the supreme court who reflects his voters views. abortion shod have never been a right, its a privilege and now that it is defederalized each state will now vote on keepin it legal or not, so states wont be forced to offer abortions in which goes agasint there values and other states can still offer it if they wish. this is what democracy looks like. america has always been pro life. this clip doesnt say that the u.s was one of only 7 countries in the world which includes china and north korea to offer abortion after 20weeks and even 1min after birth. this is not american values."
More church bs trying to control people choices
The USA is so religiously retarded. It was always going this way. Religious fruitcakes win the day. god bless America.
Now they will be more careful
You cannot stop abortion. You can only stop safe abortion.
"""Are expected to do so.""
I see riots, civil war or a coup happening."
"Ahhhh the USA, where someone's right to own a gun is seen as far more important than a students right to not be shot by one, and the religious nutjob far right pride themselves on removing the rights of anyone they don't agree with

As far as the ""Land of the Free"" delusion, Jim Jeffries said it best; ""In Holland, you can smoke weed in front of a cop while hiring a hooker, and you have the nerve to think you are the land of the free?"""
"We want all kinds of abortion to be banned everywhere in the US. Those who wants more abortion can leave. Next is LGBTQ marriage. We are going to ban it all. America is God’s country, we won’t let this idiots destroy it with woke agenda"
5:50 - Do your job. We don't need your opinions.
Making it illegal will not stop people doing it. It will force them to do it under unsafe conditions and will cost many young woman's lives. It is hard to believe that this is really happening.
Gay marriage next

Right to Abortion??????  There is no Right to an Abortion under the American Constitution.  Get some education
2:39 don't  you mean  birthing  people  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fuck them they better adopt some of those poor kids in the system if they really pro life and take care of all of them and not complain about it but what do they do nothing about those kids in the system just care about those unborn babies. Shut up and take care of the poor kids there are right now.
If  woman who are sexual assaulted and cannot have an abortion then the person who also created that child should pay for the child It is unfair for woman to go through that alone
Those same morons will be banning contraception next.
Women still have FOUR options - abstinence/contraception/motherhood/adoption. That’s plenty.
"make the world a better place what a joke
they just want the women to go to private clinics for abortions so
they get more money"
About time the evil of random abortion was challenged. God only knows how many souls never made it
Bro that lady with the face paint has an iq beginning with a .
If we really cared about children in our nation we would have banned assault weapons but no people want their god damn ak-47 instead of protecting kids
Pact up and move to a democrat state!!!! point blank and period...or go see your doctor and get on some good birth control!!!! That is before you lay down with the scum!!!!!
"Life won today? What about the woman's right to her life? Pro life usually ends when the baby is born, and the mother gets no help. I wonder how these
young women will feel when birth control is banished. The Taliban is here in the USA, disguised by judicial robes."
I Don't kniw what us wrong with them I was part of the NOW thus makes me ANGERY and a lot if women are going to suffer and die because of this my body my right so am suck and tired. Or other people telling me what I can and cannot do as a women
Great victory for the Constitution and basic decency.
"COPE AND SEETHE, BABY KILLER.
COPE AND SEETHE."
"So women can go get pretty much free abortions but for those women who have trouble getting pregnant and want a child it cost outrageous amounts of money. Ya in certain cases like rape or incest the women should have a right to an abortion but for those who just go out having sex and have had multiple abortions, well better strap up now."
"As a capitalist country it only makes sense they would do this, they need more people who are going to be put into horrible situations that will work the jobs no one else will at close to nothing in terms of pay."
Stop sleeping with anyone saying you look beautiful today
Stop aborti 👉🔥⛔🔥
The funny thing about Conservatives praising this is that the majority of these babies will grow up to vote Liberal. It’s like turkeys voting for Christmas. We won’t see the real effects for 20 years or so but it will happen.
Great
And most states in the United States they've got six weeks to get an abortion I don't understand why they don't think that that isn't enough time to go and murder a little baby when in New York they allow even post birth
Well done 👏  America
"SPA = when I was a mere child although supremely wise, there were only 4 things that I could not over-stand = here r 2 = Abortion &  homosexuality but now than I am gifted with supreme enlightenment I have come 2 over-standing the reasons & the whys the creator gave it living creations the magic/creation wants of vagina and penis = so the question becomes = If the creator gave I life and the abilities/magic to give or take life? Then tell I who or what religion, government has the right to trump the  gift/abilities/magic given to I by I creator to chose or not to chose that which I do onto I own self, even 'taking my own life ?
Personally for she who has aborted could never bear suns or moons for I not because of a wrong or right = simply because I know the chi-effects associate with said action but at no time should I or any human being be so stupidly demoniclly audacious to think that their idea of how I, as an adult human being, should trump my god given right to chose that which affects my body of mentally or physically in any way, whether wrong or right.

Women with men should replicate, Black Lives Matter with a more power and effect 'Women Lives Matter' = It's a great time and season for this act of True American Ideology  SPAdotcoms.com"
I bet everyone of those who have been fighting to take others rights away have never known a hardship
I wonder if all the people crying out to stop people having a choice are helping all the homeless and foster kids in the country as well.
"""I would do it [study UFOs], but before agreeing to do it, we must insist upon full access to discs recovered. For instance in the L.A. case, the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination.""

hovering right outside the front gate. I’ve got all the men out here with
their weapons drawn.” We lost between 16-18 ICBMs (nuclear tipped Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles) at the same time UFOs were in the area… (A high ranking Air Force officer) said, “Stop the investigation; do no more on this and do not write a final report.

“Yes, there have been ET visitations. There have been crashed craft. There have been material and bodies recovered. There has been a certain amount of reverse engineering that has allowed some of these craft, or some components, to be duplicated. And there is some group of people that may or may not be associated with government at this point that have this knowledge. They have been attempting to conceal this knowledge. People in high level government have very little, if any, valid information about this. It has been the subject of disinformation in order to deflect attention and create confusion so the truth doesn’t come out. ”

MEANINGFUL congressional hearings, ala the Watergate hearings, including aerospace/defense contractors and Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson must be held to address a vital issue that transcends politics and we will never properly advance until it happens: The 75+yr ongoing-constitutionally illegal,
EXTRATERRESTRIAL cover-up. How can we truly believe anything our elected officials say? The dog n pony shows must cease."
Are these anti abortion nutjobs happy to accept and raise all these unwanted children as there own? fuck no.
America...land of the free? I wonder what the definition of free is over the pond...
This is an awful decision implemented by a man (trump) who wanted to break democracy. This is a sad day and I feel for all American Women who have lost control of their bodies.
They lost they just hate themselves too much to realize it
George Carlin....who would to fuk these anti people anyway 🤣
🤣🤣🤣
"Excellent.  Life is short and precious. People should persevere and show a sense of fortitude. Plus there are other options for this example of this hypothetical woman e.g adoption. Besides the points made, there is a greater choice of choosing not to murder."
"Land of the free, ladies and gents"
Impeach the Catholic Taliban masquerading as Supreme Court justices.
"Your headline is a lie, abortion is not a constitutional right. You got to watch the BBC, you can see a little socialist contamination.
Journalism has went downhill in The Last 5 Years."
You can kill an intruder in your livingroom but you can't choose to have an abortion.
"So let me get this straight from the UK, the US do not allow women to have a right to choose whether they can abort or not but gun rights are for everybody to choose? Just trying to keep up!"
This is some 3rd world stuff going on. It reminds me of how women are treated in the middle east.
People choose to have a unprotected sex. End of discussion.
"""Right to Murder Babies Struck Down by US Supreme Court.""    (actually, it now goes to the states)."
It's just gross.  And so are the people who say this is a good thing and the SCOTUS should keep going.  Let US be a reminder to the world - this is what happens in even a so-called first world nation when the religious zealots get control of the political and legal system.  Move over Taliban - there's a new caliphate on the block.
"All the court did was recognize it was always a states rights issue. 
Democrats can still kill black babies but only in democrat run states."
"What should happen now is that woman that can not keep their babies for whatever reason they think they cant keep them, should be left at a church and they have to pay for their education, safety, and make sure that he/she is successful and loved since they fought so much on Jesus name, that should be a law actually. Abortion will not stop, these woman will be butchered,
And they call themselves the greater country in the world. Do something about your politicians US people or they will deep fry you and eat you."
This is good news day for babies- if you disagree with that statement then you’ve got to justify to yourself why the right to life does not extend to all human beings!
"All children deserve loving parents, NOT all parents deserve loving children ❤️"
"For those of you celebrating in the USA, the American Taliban is coming for you next."
rip
Disgusting  That country is going backwards..
That woman being interviewed at the start « On a personal level » - How is it personal if you’re not the one getting the abortion? How does it affect you if someone decides to get one? That’s what I ask
These feminist can’t rely on planned parenthood anymore 😅
This decision is up there with Dred Scott v. Sandford as one of the worst decisions ever made by our illustrious SCOTUS ... not to mention their recent gun rights blunder ... what a bunch of educated ignoramuses!
"US women now have the comfort of knowing that they can be forced by their government to act as a living life support machine, even for their rapists child. 
If you think that's moral, you have something deeply wrong with you."
The people who scream “pro life” are probably the same people who believe they have the right to shoot someone in self defence and the ones shouting “my body my choice” when they were asked to get vaccinated. I feel to sorry for the people in America
I have no idea wtf is going on anymore. As a white man just leave me alone and we will be fine.
1 good thing in the past few decades that is coming from USA
"I know what happens next, SCOTUS will ban men from masturbating. Technically sperm is life too, they shouldn’t drain and kill them, they have rights and freedom too lol"
Good news
It`s funny how hard women will fight to have no accountability for their actions...now maybe they`ll start actually taking that one pill a day to assist in not getting pregnant during a Tinder hookup...
"I agree with ruling , abortion is actually murder , you might say its only an embreo and its not human ""yet"" i think they are completly wrong . If it is not aborted it would have grown to become a person and a human is a human from the moment of his conception till the day he die. This  is my personal opinion and since we live in a free world we can all say our opinions!"
The world is over populated already and the world's resources are running out so basically fuck the planet with no abortions we all die sooner as a whole
"Surely whichever side of this you fall on, this isn't good. It's the same issue that the US had in the 1930s with prohibition and the ongoing debate about legalising drugs. The cat is out of the bag and you can't get it back in. If women really want abortions they will get them, legal or not. Seems to me all this will do is lead to a sharp rise in dangerous backroom abortions."
AWESOME!!!!😃😃 THANK YOU JESUS CHRIST!!!
"Didn't this ruling come in a week ago? Geez, BBC, report in a timely manner, eh?"
"There was never a ""legally enshrined right"", there ever was a ""right to an abortion guaranteed under the constitution"".
It was never in the constitution, or the bill of rights.
The original argument to abortion was a privacy right, which made no sense at the time, and continued to make no sense.
A better argument would be bodily autonomy under property law, but even then, it's not only your body the decision effects."
"People really want to be able to kill babies, if you're pregnant then it's no longer just your body isn't it?"
BLM - Babies Lives Matter
New York is keeping the right to abortion. It’s believed that many women will go there. At least some women will be saved from the back street abortionist of the last century.
Thank you Lord for the Supreme Court  .  God is the one who has last word !!! Amen
Celebrate good times .
"Quantity over quality, America just want MORE of everything."
lol
This is a women's decision not the government's.
Abortion equal abomination
Imagine wanting to control someone else's body 🤔
"I thought first world contraception is available, why wait to be pregnant"
If I were a woman I would probably start useing condems and date men based on how hard a worker they are  and I would start useing sexual discipline 80 percent of men get rejected  and go into their 30s virgins  if men can go with out sex so can wemon
6:09 yeah stop bullshitting the majority of the time it’s women just being irresponsible
"Welp, I don't live in the U.S. but I think they shouldn't have been bowed down to. They think they're right but this is wrong."
Go Trump! He was really thinking when he made sure those three judges were “anti abortion.”
"The pro abortion group is all for bringing children into this world to stand back and watch him starve to death. They call that Christianity. Sounds like pure evilness. These women who are pro-life, they have been beaten down to where they don't think they are human any longer so they are against all other women who has rights. That they have allowed their preacher or their men to take away from them, by putting them down. And brain worsham to believe that pro-life is the way, when it only really allows children to go hungry in the United States because they don't care about them once they are here on Earth. If that's what they call Christian. I wouldn't want no part of it sounds like pure evil. They claimed their Christians, but they violate their own beliefs. Their beliefs are only for others they want to have control over."
"Keep your legs closed and it won't be an issue. 

Problem solved..."
"God help us. The most disgusting thing to happen in a civilised nation in a while. 
Every person deserves the right to choose, why ban abortion? It is choice you don’t have to abort, you choose to.
Anyone who says that abortion needs to be banned is a disgusting, low - life and has no idea what this means on a larger scale. 
Choice is important. You made yours and I hope it is your last."
"All pro-lifers have now one reason to shut up.  Live in a state that doesn't allow it if you don't like it, and vice versa.  Simple."
"It's good , people are realising slowly that there is never an ideal time to face the responsibility of parenting. 
And it's just part of the journey of maturing and growing.
And for men to discover both how to lead and how to respect and follow, in turn.
Leading to order, and civil society.
The reason why immigrants, are succeeding and taking over in many cases, in the UK and Europe and USA is simply they have family values and still follow traditions that Westerners have been loosing.
And good for them they deserve that success for following a natural superior way of life.
Ultimately people are going to have to make more sensible choices.
I just see lots of spoiled children in every shade of the rainbow 🌈 whining about how they want to have their cake , puke it back up, and not get fat. 
If you get my drift.
This is very good news for black America.
 the democrats will VERY gradually loose their grip on the vote  of welfare dependant blocks of African American communitys as by default they face up to parenthood and create more family units. 
The ultimate opposite of what BLM wants"
Anyone who is pro abortion has no right to criticize the nazis.
I am more curious why is the BBC not covering the money that these abortion clinics make for profit from killing these babies.  Because easily over 90% of abortions are not medical emergencies period.
Whats next? Legalise slavery? USA is now a third world country
🫣🙈 💁‍♀️🤦‍♀️
"Cope and seethe baby killers, cope and seethe."
What a stupid country. Their power is going. Here comes china 😬
What a shame that women can’t kill their kids any more. Such a shame for world peace and love ❤️

Slaughter the ignorant parents not the baby that did nothing wrong!!!!!!
Don't they know there is such a thing bith control. Roe v Wade was based on a lie from the FBI. The aborted baby industry is a VERY LUCRATIVE BIUSNESS. A lot of the so called ELITES are going to be losing a LOT of money :))
Why is the UK getting this rubbish? This is a yankee issue.
Next getting rid women's right to vote.
"didn't go far enough you want a baby and government hand out's you have to give a full clean STD screening from both the mother and father, mind you all these pro abortion people wouldn't even try to get pregnant if this was a law."
"Not that I have a dog in the fight but if you accepted a forced vax, the argument of ""My body My decision""  is gone. You can't have it both ways."
"There may be hope for us yet, maybe we will miss the wrath of God coming."
"USA showing its true colors, no freedom, no choice a PRISON.  I am glad now everyone worldwide KNOWs.  USA is not a Free land.  Gay rights next!"
Women should have the right to choose wtf as for the religion comments dont get me started religon is the root of all evil and if god actually excisted he wouldnt be killing people all the time so dont even bring god and religion to the comments
"The only thing you can do is avoid moving to red states, or leave your red state. Sad day for liberals."
"A great day for humanity 🙏🏼. A bad day for irresponsible women, baby organ sellers and adrenechrome consumers, oh and the lefty libtards too."
"Emancipated US women! U should be grateful to your dearly beloved, Mr. Donald  Trump!"
"This is so wonderful. No more killing of innocent babies. How evil has our society become to think it's acceptable or moral to kill a baby. No, an unborn baby is not a fetus it's a human life. Thank God this evil law has been overturned."
"This is so multifaceted. people can use methods to not have unplanned pregnancies because abortion is immoral.  But in instances of rape or when pregnancy threatens the life of a mother, she should be able to choose."
I’m sorry but all those tho wanted abortion to be illegal your all fucked in the head what if some poor girl gets raped and gets pregnant because of that she now can not get rid of a child that she never wanted and was forced to have
This is for the children of the world.  The lives of those children who have died are what we are honoring.   Just think of all those souls who have a future now.
Really good to hear.
"Na f gun control, les control women>>>>"

F'k the FED"
"According to the bible: ""righteousness raises up a nation"". A great tribute to the Supreme Court of the USA.

By the way, let's do a little analysis together: There are about 354 million people in the United States, let's say there are 150 million women who are able to procreate, let's say about 30% have an abortion every year. So, you could say that US infanticide kills about 45 million children every year."
Great news
"As usual the BBC misreports the facts.  This reversal does not make abortion illegal, but mearly puts the onus back onto the individual states, where it belongs.  Yes there will be a few states that may outlaw abortion and even a few of those will have exceptions to their particular ruling.  Most states will have laws allowing abortion and if the state you live in doesn't allow the type of abortion you want, you can drive to another state to get one.  The Pro-abortion crowd destroyed themselves when they started pushing for abortions that would allow babies to be killed after the babies were born.  Sounds crazy, but the discussion was out there."
"Conservatives:  Desperately protect the laws that have made shooting school age children a national pastime in the name of freedom.  
Also Conservatives:  Cheering that they just lost the freedom to control their own bodies."
"According to the bible: ""righteousness raises up a nation"". A great tribute to the Supreme Court of the USA.

"So in the matter of a few days that extremist kangaroo court has made it even easier for Americans to keep killing each other and now they’re insisting on women birthing children whether they want to (can do) or not. I have us citizenship but will never, ever move back because it’s become a sham democracy with politicians picking their voters, an elected unaccountable king they call a president, it’s violent the likes of which would be unthinkable in any other developed country and it’s a dystopian society with all the worst parts of capitalism leading to such incredible wealth for a few and such poverty for millions without even basic healthcare. It is a shame the most powerful country has become an example of how not to run a country but for the rest of us in the west, we can separate ourselves from being too closely linked so their twisted vision of religious supernatural nonsense and bigotry do not infest our societies. Children & the elderly should be able to ride public transport without fear and go to school without passing through metal detectors, women have a right to decide if they are ready to have a child, humans born gay are still people, people with a different skin colour are all the same under the skin, and everyone has a right to believe in whatever god(s) they want to or not without having it thrown down their throats by the state. These are basic things any developed civilized country should be able to guarantee without question. Sad day, especially for Americans, but also for the west in general because our most prominent member disgraced itself so spectacularly."
This thumbnail is very misleading to people who don’t live in the US. As an American who was born in 1993 I can assure you…that the future is not anti-abortion in the US & the majority of young people are outraged by this.
"The Chinese government likes information control! Delete user, delete comment! Now let's learn from the Chinese government! Delete Putin related information throughout the network! Just like the Chinese government did to me! Putin wants the rights to speak, but we will not give him! Delete Putin's content in the same way!"
In many states it is still legal
"well done, iam moving to US!"
"Abortion should be legal to anyone who wants it, but to ban abortion completely even in instances of rape is barbaric. Wait until you see; instances of rape will increase, but reports will decrease. Anyone who gets pregnant through rape will be reluctant to report it, as that will mean they'll be known to be pregnant and therefore cant get an abortion. These laws are not prolife. They are pro-rapist, pro forced birth, pro maternal death. Pro lifers do nothing to help with the very gun laws that kill the babies they are forcing afabs to have, or the formula shortage."
"It's nothing about pro life. Because if it was they would be taking care of the ones that are already here on Earth that are breathing air. But instead they pretend like they are pro-life just to watch the children be born into property, and no rights as a human being in United States of America. This people who say they are a Christians, but allow children to be abused sexually, and be starved to death. If they are so pro-life then why have they took care of the people who live on the streets that are homeless and hungry? Because it is not about their caring heart, it's about Church's controlling the people of the United States. Churches need to be made to pay taxes. Because they have violated the agreement that they would not get involved in politics which has been nothing but a lie, to the people of the United States. Churches have continued to shave their false belief down everyone's throat. The Bible was wrote over 100 years after Jesus Christ was sacrificed. And the ones who wrote the Bible were nothing but men who wanted control of others. They have took Jesus words and twisted them for them to be able to have control.
If there was a election today between Trump and God guess who they would vote for? Trump. Because, religious christianities believe that Trump is their God. They are led by a false prophet, they say they go by the Bible. But if that is so. Then why. are they worshiping Trump as their God when that is clearly printed in the Bible but that is considered as a false prophet."
"America is becoming the new North Korea. The UK is not far behind. We the people need to rise up and stop this take over of our basic human rights. The bubble is about to burst, or maybe Putin can just start firing nukes at us, end the misery of the West."
"Good news. Now its time to ban guns to under 21 year olds, implement universal healthcare, free college education, greater taxes on the rich 1%, and no more foreign invasions."
"There are already many children in foster care who get treated so poorly, why would you want hundreds to thousands more to be treated like that? Even after being adopted and being of legal age to be out on your own so many teens get kicked out and left on the street, at 14-17 many of them end up doing drugs or getting PREGNANT on the street, or even RAPED by their FOSTER PARENTS..hell even death. Are you going to adopt and feed the hundreds of ""babies"" that would've gotten ""murdered"" to give them the crappy life thats already set out for them? This just screams the unsafe ways women will try and get an abortion, even if their life is at stake. Pro-lifers make me sick. I'd rather die than bear a child I did not want to have."
"This was easy to foresee. The Trump court will rule like this for at least a generation, but for the 8 million lazy, smug democrats who stayed home because they knew Hillary would win."
America is already populated not even MORE people 😒🙄 SMH
Men may start buying more condoms now. Hope it scares then now as much as women.
What's so bad about a baby?
"What a stupid decision. 😒. 

Clearly there is more money to be made in raising a neglected child then there is to save a life that likely wont get the necessary love, support and upbringing to raise a level headed human being. 

Women should majority of the decision to birth a child or to end it. It is their womb at the end of the day that creates life."
It's a pity they overturned it  but it's not guaranteed by the Constitution. This is a common misconception. And the flimsy construct put together by Justice Blackmun back in 1973 is the reason and the tool for today's SCOTUS decision
"It was never a constitutional right in the true sense, 50 year old mistake"
what ever happened to separation of church and state?
Finally some good news from US😂
Surely a simple gestation period threshold of legality is all that is required as a compromise.
For this decision to affect women's rights you first need to be able to define what a woman is
Sickening decision and just as sickening to see criminal conspiracists like Kevin McCarthy gloating about it.
This is absolutely devastating for American women. A setback on epic proportions. I’m so sorry that the system has let you all down!
this is scary
Yet they still think they live in a democracy .The country where you can’t say what you want and can’t do what you want with your own body .
Murder is wrong. Controversial I know....
"Very good to hear, a step in the right direction."
"The SCOTUS gave women the right to choose to live outside of states with state sponsored child murder. Don't worry lefties, you'll still be able to murder unborn children in half the states of the US."
Just look at this pro-abortion crowd. What are they woried about? The only way that these hags will get pregnant is by artificial insemination.
People who are close minded or extreme will never be right whether they are pro or anti abortion.  In this day and age it’s hard to understand how there can be unplanned pregnancies in the first place.  There may be good reasons for some abortion but we shouldn’t be backing abortions for convenience.  People need to be responsible for their actions and make better decisions.
"Dr. Willie is a clown who got embarassed like a schoolgirl on Jesse Lee petersons talkshow, nothing but liberal sob stories in what was a great victory for the united states"
"Great,... no more slaughtering of babies from slut mothers who dont know how to use protection"
"Republicans don't care about life, else they would support universal healthcare. All they care about is controlling and cutting rights from women."
Girls get your wedding dresses ready cause if you cant be free to choose neither should he if he get you pregnant he your husband!! How many women would have kept their child if the Man married her ? You cant have one without the other .
"In the end this issue will be decided by young women. 

Remember, the US has much higher labour mobility than we see in the UK with people far more prepared to move across the country in search of a better life. If access to abortion is as important as people seem to say then young women (and especially the more talented ones who have more options) will choose to locate in States with more liberal abortion laws. Talented young men will follow. It won't be long before some corporations start to leave States who restrict abortion because it's easier to recruit and retain talent in States with a more liberal attitude. 

Alternatively, maybe young women will prefer to live in places with restrictive abortion laws because this will engender a culture with less pressure for them to have sex before they really want to. 

But whichever way it goes, in the end, it will be young women that decide."
"Exactly the right thing to do, Also if you are with a partner/ husband,it should be a joint decision,in other countries.   Woman that take drugs whilst pregnant should be charged, the baby should not have to be born a crack cocaine or heroin addict, then they should be sterilised"
Men would rather play video games than have sex and deal with feminist so whats the big deal.
America won't have many more chances to turn back to God... Women should think about the consequences before laying down and conceiving these little innocent babies and this so called ten months abortion outside of the womb is murder plain and simple....
"The header should read ""Right to abortion passed back to the state legislators, as opposed to Right to abortion struck down, it was not struck down."
21 & terrified  lol 😆 ya.
What else are they going to take away?? This is just the beginning! This is not about saving life this is about exercising power over people and tell them what they can and cannot do. God gave us the right to choose Good and Evil. Are we becoming a little China? Were the government tells us what to do as far as reproduction? Are they prepared for all the adoptions that are going to happen? As far as Free Will and freedom of choice I'm disappointed in America! But like the Bible says they will start acting like a beast exercising powers over people
Anything that allows abortion with Bidens offspring is a good decision
This artice aims to enforce people's lack of knowledge of the law and our rights. Be careful and know your rights. Wherever you are.
Sure wish everyone would hurry up and die already the human race is just pure shlt anymore.
America's a strange place
Everybody forgot God performs tens of millions of spontaneous abortions a year.
"Lessen the violence of abortion, but increase the violence of guns. Pro-file before you're alive, anti-life once you are. They want to ensure that you are born, and then don't mind handing someone a gun to shoot you dead once you are."
Oh boo hoo.  Sick that these women cry when they cant kill babies
"The left - banning legal abortions will only result in illegal abortions!

Also the left - banning guns for the law abiding shall stop criminals using guns illegally!"
"This issue and the other decision made by our Supreme Court related to guns make me ashamed of my country of origin. This is a sad day in the US, sadder for our daughters."
Too bad none of these protesters could trouble themselves to vote in midterm elections.  Their indifference is the reason this has happened.
Maybe the states should make the penalty for rape a cutting ✂️ off the offending parts too would be helpful
And insulin is still high and L.A. Is still in a crimewave.

Insest still ok in royal & elite circles
"ROE V WADE  is Not a Constitutional  Right..it was NEVER intended to be used as birth control ..if Law enforcement  rules that if a drunk driver accidently kills a pregnant woman and fetus its A DOUBLE HOMICIDE..but if a pregnant woman INTENTIONALLY  kills her unborn baby its her right to choose..YOU CAN'T  HAVE IT BOTH WAYS!! There is nowhere in Scripture where GOD gives PERMISSION  for women to MURDER their unborn child...in fact..he gave a Commandment  that "" THOU SHALT NOT KILL "" it did not say only if its an adult"
"^SUPREME ""Justice""  CLARENCE THOMAS is a RACIST!             He will NOT ""Kill"" Unborn BLACK BABIES.                   peace"
"For everyone that’s ever had an abortion, remember this. You went against your biological programming to protect your kid, and then you killed it. You murdered your child, nothing can change the fact that you went to a “doctor” and you paid them to rip your child apart while it was still inside you."
This is the future of something isn't done. + The courts can't just decide things like this....
Never met anyone on the pro-death brigade condemn their parents for not extinguishing their life in the womb.
They won't change gun laws which will save lives but will revoke abortion rights that will ruin lives
"21 and terrified lol.  Not terrified enough of the irresistible trouser snake, evidently."
America the most backward 1st world country
Where is people’s right to overturning the Supreme Court?
"Pretty sure even 3rd world countries are able to offer this minimal human right. What has America become now, a 4th world nation?"
Bruh how
"They will force you to carry a pregnancy to term, but don't give a crap if that same child is shot to death at school. Think about that."
Would genuinely hate to live in America for so many reasons
"This proves that America is not a free country, banning abortion is removing freedom of choice from women."
"85% of Americans support abortions being legal in most cases.

Welcome to the death throws of modern conservatism, the last dire swings before the next generation snuffs them out with pure disgust at their oppressive nature.

Don’t like abortion? Don’t get one. Land of the free my ass."
Bruh
Now states can ban it! SCOTUS don't want GUN regulations but want to regulate WOMEN!
Victory for the babies and Jesus. Thank you Jesus for this victory
"There is no ""Right"" to abortion in the U.S.A.  ... I thought this was the BBC?!?"
"Looks like the fall of civilization.
So now we'll begin to see the rise in back street abortionist parlours, meat shops run by the unskilled
and the unhygienic.
Or worst still, a rise in the birth-rate of the unloved and hated, given a living nightmare that would have 
otherwise been called a childhood.
Well done America."
Based. Baby killers seething.
How stupid are you to think America care about anyone but the rich.
"This is sad. Yet again, another MAN making decisions for a WOMAN's body. Abortion is illegal while GUNs are not. 😯🙄🤦"
This is awesome..it's about time..No more babykilling
🎉🍾🎊🥳
All it did was return the issue to the states.   People can vote for state legislature that lines up with their beliefs and the clinic that you featured has had women die . I know this to be true because I work in the emergency room at the local hospital
Religion dragging the world back
"The white, evangelical, conservative right ruling the Republican Party and courts will not stop at abortion. Next up gay marriage, with some wanting to even ban contraception and sex education in schools."
"""I'm 21 and I'm terrified!""

Well if you keep your legs closed,  you won't have nothing to worry about will you sweetheart."
I guess the  media  doesn't  understand... all the Supreme court  did was give the power  back to the individual  states.... The federal government  should  have never had this power  under the Constitution.  Now if you feel like it empowers  you to murder innocence  babies  so you want be inconvenience...that is on you..... a baby if a gift from God
America is mental now back alley clinics will be all over well done
Why didn't someone ask these pro-life women how many homeless children have they adopted?  How many young mothers in need and without jobs have they helped?
Liars!!!!
"This is a minority imposing their personal and religious beliefs on everyone. This is wrong, and it is clear that the Supreme Court is no longer a neutral body, but yet another political tool to be wielded by whomever can stuff their “side” into the most seats!

I honestly blame Harry Reid. He was the one that “went nuclear” and dropped the 60 vote threshold for court picks!"
"Easy, or even subsidized access to the morning-after pill may constitute a compromise solution agreeable to both sides, as it prevents procreation."
"Abortion is Murder. A baby from the moment it's conceived to birth is a human being. Even if you still say that abortion isn't what it clearly is(killing of Unborn children and the extermination of Human life(which by definition is murder)) is a denial of the basic facts. ""My body, My Choice!"" isn't even valid because you're not making the desicion for your body but for the inoccent unborn baby in inside the woman(The baby is a whole different entity to the mother just the same as you are an indivisual human being). You and everyone else that advocates for this foolishness are degrading children from human beings to objects or inconvenices that can be disposed of . If you say it's just a clump of cells, that's not even evidence because you are a clump of cells and every living being is a clump of cells. You would know that if you payed attention in 8th grade biology. That baby will grow up to be a human being just like you and me. What if you're mom was to abort you, I bet then that you wouldn't be advocating for the murder of unborn children (unless you see yourself as worthless). If you state that you can kill an unborn child then it's the same as saying that you can kill anyone or that I can kill you and by all means is a violation of human rights and basic moral princibles. It doesn't matter about what stage the child is in or what other factors lead to the impregnation you still do not have the right to kill a human being. If you can't take care of the child then give it up for adoption instead of outright killing the child. Murder: the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another. By definition, Abortion = Murder. And saying that you could kill a child after it was born is even more trifling. The child at that point is a living and breathing human being (even in the womb it's a living and breathing human being). In conclusion, Abortion is murder and there is no evidence that you can give that can prove me wrong. Not only because it is facts but there are no valid point that can debunk the proven biological fact that a Human Fetus is a Human Being. Genocide: the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group, the group in question being children. 628.9k children are aborted/murdered every year which is by definition called genocide. Abortion is not only murder but genocide. Case and Point."
"America has become a nation dominated by bigots and fascists.
How embarrassing that they speak English over there."
Empathetic ProLife supporters versus pro abortion psychopaths.
The US supreme court has just signed the death warrant for 100s of American women every year. All thanks to Trump. Man that guy was in power for just 4 years and he still torments us.
My country doesn't even take care of the children once they are born. All because a few religeous freaks want to have more babies to adopt~~~
"Can we please put in a law to stop certain people coming to or visiting the UK.
It would be those coming from the USA that are pro life and still think its a right to not only carry a hand gun, but also a given right to let 18years old have an automatic weapon,  that kill multiple people in one go, including children. We have enough or our own idiots without allowing any more coming in."
100 millions of babies later. After 50 years on concentrating clinics in African American communities controlling the population.  BLM! Justice will come!
"Damn, it's like no one's ever heard of birth control"
"the supreme court with a majority of Right Wing dedided to Overturn Roe V Wade mainly impacting all Women in the USA, now All Women in the USA have less privacy and abortion is harder to get!

This again was decided by the all the Conservatives which are the Majority in the Supreme Court!

Biden needs to add 3 Liberals to the Supreme Court Now! To have Balance and Real debate about issues like Roe v Wade instead of letting the majority rule just because they want!"
"I have not been enthusiastic with the abortion on demand concept, the ""right,"" for many years since its inception. As birth control methods multiplied, abortions did not decrease. Abortion was merely the birth control of ultimate last resort. I think the right to safe abortion was misused. But now society faces the magnified problem of defective and/or unwanted births. I am absolutely certain that conservative Christian men and women are not going to step up to take in this population of outcasts, nurture them and see to it that they are provided for. Nor will they require of their political representatives that there be incentives for society to the job. It is fanciful and delusional of me to think that females will take the responsible step to protect themselves, and prevent a disembodied soul from emerging as a being who is unwanted."
"Woman will die, millions of children will be unwanted because their mothers were raped. Late abortion is not right but if a woman is raped she has every right to abort."
The world's gone mad.
if u can abort i as a man want not pay child support
USA once again proves itself to be a nation of fools
The Best Thing That happened in America after a very long time!!!!!!
"How many of the Anti-abortionists, women, mothers and their teenagers daughters,  have had abortions, already!!"
This is absolutely wonderful news.  I hope the Cult of Death weirdos who think only of themselves cry themselves to sleep tonight.
People who want to impose their views in such a controversial subject are intolerant and non democratic people and not other way around. There will be a space for every way of thinking and living in USA as always. But it is important to fight this narrative.
"They just took away my daughters right to choose, and Thomas said he is coming after birthcontrol? I am ashamed to be an American~~~~ Love and light world~~~"
"Once again showing they're a completely uncivilised place. They will force a potentially unwanted and unloved child into the world, but won't protect them from being killed in a school shooting. The US is the cesspit of the entire planet."
"The whole System is Divided the Supreme Court, the Congress the Senate and the Church maybe it's time to change the name of America from United States to Divided States lol 😂"
A society that devalues human life is a society that demeans itself............Democrats are simply evil.
"No such thing as the ""right"" to kill a child, neither outside the womb nor within."
"Never mind, at least you can all carry guns eh"
A reckless court abandoning of past Supreme Court Justice Ruling is the downfall of the United States of America Courts.
"If you don't want to get pregnant don't have sex.
If you have sex and get pregnant be an adult and take care of your responsibilities.
Seems some women want a free pass on taking responsibility for their actions.
You can spot them a mile away they act like children and are abhorrent people,woke feminazi's and such."
Absolute stupid decision.
"Western women and men are too promiscuous, that's the problem. Abstain from sex before marriage or use a condom or morning after pill."
Nobody speaks about the father's right in that Holocaust of babies.
What is going on in America? Pakistan and Iran will have more liberal abortion laws than large parts of that giant lunatic asylum across the Atlantic. Trump's appointment of three crackpot religious fundamentalist Justices has caused the Court to go off the rails. The decision doesn't even guarantee abortion rights for women/underage girls who are victims of rape or incest. Individual states will be able to force them to give birth to a rapist's baby against their will. It's barbaric and isn't the end. They will push on for the same thing in relation to access to contraception and gay marriage. It's as if the Puritans had just landed.
"If the unborn child could speak: ""My body, my choice"""
I'm delighted! The BBC is hopping mad!
"From the comments I've read, they are missing the mark massively, the real point is as a woman you no longer have rights o we your own body. America has taken several steps back into the dark past. I'm ashamed and embarrassed for the US. It's now a backwards 21st century country, well done you republican clowns."
God is smiling today congratulations if we do not protect life nothing else matter Stop slaughter babies for God’s shake ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
To be honest this decision is just making ‘land of the free’ false. Women should be able to have an abortion if they feel it’s necessary
Abortion is murder
"There's hope for America yet.
All life matters."
"All this anger. There is a thing called abstinence!!
BIRTH CONTROL!
CONDOMS!
JUST LAZY YA LETS GET PREGNANT AND KILL THE BABY.
There will still be States that allow abortion! They act like they can't STILL KILL A BABY. USE BIRTH CONTROL. GET UR TUBES TIED. There are many alternatives. ITS ALL ABOUT R I. O T. ING. ANGER N UN NEEDED VIOLENCE. UN REAL"
‘We don’t have any of the facts that the DOCTOR based that statement off of’ god they don’t even hear themselves anymore. They can’t hear how ignorant and wrong they are.
"It is about money,folks and greed!!! Planned Parenthood is major money maker and they don't want to lose their livelyhood!!!! They don't care about the women,and they certainly don't care about the babies!!!!!"

Good.....Good....
Viva Cristo Rey!!
Wheeeeeey
Fuck this country.
wild that america was once a superpower. the decline of the country is going to be very interesting for the rest of the world to watch. hope yall learned chinese.
abortion is murder
not even incest or rape will allow you to have an abortion. That’s disgusting I pray for America
Abortion in the case of Rape n Incest is OK but Abortion shouldn't be like a piece of cake. It's not healthy for the Mothers.
It will still be legal and safe for the woman. Now it's up to the states to decide when to limit it for the child's sake... NY says up to and even shortly after birth. TX et al says at heartbeat.
how about British? Is it legal for woman do abortion there?
Every baby should have the right to have a life.
Lunacy!
Victory to humanity🙏
Good news for the Mexican tourism industry 😄
Such a retarded country. 2022 or 1900’s. Get a grip America. I wonder how these activists who were against abortion would feel if they had been raped and got pregnant or carrying on with a pregnancy that would have massive health implications. Bet they would feel different then. Sometimes it’s necessary.
"Aleluya
Let the wicked die ."
There are other methods of contraception
"I knew the Taliban whooped USA's asses in Afghanistan, but I never realised they gained control of American courts as well."
Thank you for giving babies 👶 their life back. Glory to God🙌🏾
"Freedom to conform to others concept of Freedom, so not Freedom then."
38 million terminated so far...glad to see it overturned
Did u just here the nurse say women abort just to spite
"It's absurd in this day and age where men can control a woman's body! Now even rape victims and children from the numerous incest homes in the States will have to go through their pregnancies.
 But fine go and get a  AK15 rifle to carry around!!!"
"You are not a developed country because you make abortion a norm, it's called moving backwards. How can people call themselves civilized people but find normal to kill babies? I have never heard a pregnant woman referring to their unborn child as  a ""thing.""So why do stupid creatures think abortion is a human right?  And they are able to utter their nonsensical opinions only because no one chose to abort them, foolishness! How I wish all the pro-abortion creatures were aborted!"
A dark day for women 😔
Well if they've overturned this constitutional right they can overturn the right to bare arms as well
Jesus Christ is Lord ! Amen
One side of America is happy that babies will live. The other side is sad that babies will live.
"Absolutely shameful, the world is going backwards. I can't believe a president cannot overturn this. What is the point of him if he can't over rule such laws."
Get raped and have rapist kids. Cost of a abortion vs have rapist kids and live off government tax dollars for life. Logically abortion saves more tax money long term. Who wants to keep rapist gentic line going anyways?
There has to be a Balance in Human Rights About is Murder but Self Defense causing murder is legal
More LIFE ❤️💛💚
damn the women who are happy about this look just about exactly like i imagined they would
I hope someone challenge interracial marriage.
Let’s re-legalize slavery next!!
Minor win for humanity but Pfizer depends on these babies so they will find other means
"""That's why they call it the American Dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.""

"🤣🤣🤣 How many dumb people in the comments that think the US has outright banned abortions, its mostly the idiots who are upset by this. Leftists"
Land of the free....?
"States already made their own decisions regardless of what these Judges say. Arkansas I know because I live here has allowed abortions until 6 months ago then Asa Hutchison changed it to emergency only…. So see how these people lie because apparently abortions where still being preformed in the US.
Now there showing Arkansas like there proudly doing away with abortions as if they hadn’t already said they done so lying to their citizens….

I don’t approve of abortions… but who remembers babies tied in garbage bags in garbage cans.
Or backyard doctors doing abortions where women paid thousands then died because they bled to death….
I don’t know what the answer is 
I believe we all must answer to a higher calling somebody, regardless if you believe there’s a God, 
There still is a creator of all things regardless what you call this creator.
So should we not all be responsible for our own decisions. 
I’m not for abortions but I remember the 70s there where so many babies found dead In garbage bags, so many young women found dead next to coat hangers 
Is this the world the US wants.
I know I don’t, I think it’s a personal choice the US got it wrong today…

Something too, I think these Judges was part of a bigger agenda here. To help provoke chaos rioting possibly shootings in the US…. It’s what Joe and his Nazi regime wants….
What good is being a president if you don’t have the final say…
Something is fishy here. It really is..
The majority of people support abortions in this country
These judges aren’t supposed to bring their personal beliefs into the mix so what prompted the change…
I think it was Democrats wanting a uprising in the US is who"
Statistically a poor decision.
Absolutely wonderful.
Thank you yankcels. China and Russia when?
wtf its Healthcare
"Seems like an unnecessary feud to say the least. I wonder how many anti-abortionists care about climate change or the damage big pharma, big tech and the military industrial complex is doing, or poverty or racism etcetc.... not many I'm guessing."
My goodness the hand maids tale may be on the way for you Americans.
Let’s go Brandon can’t wait for November
This is not about pro-life; it’s about anti-woman.
"I think there should be more programs of safe sex and stricter sexual crimes laws as it solves the problem of abortion. So I am happy for USA with this decision. Congratulations

If someone really needs abort sure they will find it. 

Its right that is not default as there should be no situation where family would even need to think about it. If there is, the root of the problem must to be found and solved not this genocidical way. Unborn kid is not the root of the problem"
Nah banning abortion is crazy ass hell
Stop opening your legs !!! Pretty simple
"Hallelujah, what a reason to rejoice that people will no longer be allowed to disembowel; dismember; decapitate; suffocate and chemically burn helpless babies.

God have mercy on us for allowing this modern day child sacrifice"
Well I am delighted
"What a mess of a country!
#womenrightsarehumanrights
I cant believe people are celebrating this change.
What a disgusting country!"
GOP voters' relatives and friends do not get pregnant. This is a democratic thing - says the basket of deplorables aka GOP voters.
"Murdering babies for money but painting it as a woman's right, the left truly are evil people."
"Banning abortion is awful and a disgusting thing to do, but the possibility of banning same sex marriage is simply a red line! If these bunch of stuck in the past bigoted groups of extremists honestly think they can turn the clock back to 1950 without consequences, then they are truly and unequivocally insane. When America turns into a second rate power, let there be no doubt that it was the extreme far right GOP that caused it to fall."
Liberals suddenly know what a woman is.
America is officially a Christofascist sh!!thole.
"As a woman  who is mother i would not have the corauge to have an abortion and the issues that it implicate but as a mother of another woman i have no wright to rule about her ideas and believes...i not own her and her body is her choice i can only love her no matter what or wathever.
Face a World with options for all. 
Respect."
"Abortion in Ireland is regulated by the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018. Abortion is permitted in Ireland during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy, and later in cases where the pregnant woman's life or health is at risk, or in the cases of a fatal foetal abnormality. Abortion services commenced on 1 January 2019, following its legalisation by the aforementioned Act, which became law on 20 December 2018. Previously, the 8th Constitutional Amendment had given the life of the unborn foetus the same value as that of its mother, but the 36th constitutional amendment, approved by referendum in May 2018, replaced this with a clause permitting the Oireachtas (parliament) to legislate for the termination of pregnancies.

Abortion had been prohibited in Ireland by the UK Offences against the Person Act 1861. The Eighth Amendment was added to the Constitution by referendum in 1983, after concerns that laws prohibiting abortion could be found to be unconstitutional based on a right to privacy. In 1992, the Supreme Court held in the X Case that a thirteen-year-old girl who had become pregnant as a result of rape could be permitted to obtain an abortion in the state because there was a risk to her life from suicide. There were unsuccessful constitutional referendums in 1992 and 2002 that aimed to preclude such grounds for abortion in future cases. Between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2018, abortion in Ireland was regulated by the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, under which abortion was illegal unless it occurred as the result of a medical intervention performed to save the life of the woman.

In 2012, Irish abortion law received worldwide attention on the death of Savita Halappanavar, who had been denied an abortion while suffering a septic miscarriage. This increased calls to repeal the Eighth Amendment. The constitutional and legislative provisions were discussed at a Citizens' Assembly in 2016–17, and at an Oireachtas committee in 2017, both of which recommended substantial reform and framed the debate of the referendum in May 2018."
Regardless of conception once pregnant it is no longer only about you thus I support this.
Now they'll overturn Brown v. Board of Education
"About time,what a medical abomination."
"0:17: In case you didn't know: It was never "" *guaranteed* "" under the constitution in the first place, in fact the constitution doesn't speak for or against. So, it is disingenuous and a misnomer for legacy media to characterize it so. Plus, for the neutrals, perhaps it would be fair to put this in context Think about this number: 63,000,0000! Yes, you read that right, over 63M+ abortions! From 1973-2017! Before now, ONLY the women got to decide who lives and who doesn't. But now, except in the case of extenuating circumstances like sexual violati@n, this ruling to return jurisdiction back to the States might perhaps even the playing field and foster accountability."
Well America has to do something to keep it's schools topped up with victims.
Abortion is disgusting and never should have been legal
So if abortions are banned can we have the right to assisted suicide for the ones who didnt want to be born?
The Republican Taliban has more to say on women's rights. Birth control is the next one.
the US should sort it's education system out before doing this.
Good ruling by the Supreme Court
Drug dealers gonna be selling plan B's
Guess it's back to medieval days! They'll be burning rape victims at the stake next and watch out for a new green light on lynchings. Land of the free.... piss off! The world shakes it head in disbelief at what the US has become since 2016!
"Abortion is not a constitutional right, Abortion was never and it will never be law… such liars lol🤦🏾‍♂️"
"@Daniel don't hold your breath, the GOP has never funded programs that help children. They are ""pro-life"" up until the moment of birth. After birth they don't give a damn, the single mothers & their children are on their own."
61% of Americans are pro choice. 70% of Americans support gun laws. It’s minority rule in Murica.
"BBC did not read the decision, it seems."
"There’s no right for abortion, they were considered as legally killers to humanity life that has God(Allah) given to everyone on earth.
These shouldn’t be allowing at all, life to be borne safely n abortion to be allowed on health status only.
Killers babies should be punished seriously n there will be no such law to be considered as legally abortion by anyone.
May Allah blessing, guiding, protecting all of us to live as humanity, justice, harmonious.. etc in life , always.. 🤔"
The BBC should realize abortions are not guaranteed in The Bill of Rights. Abortions are not healthcare it's mass murder. No female has died for the right to have abortions
The baby holocaust has ended
I'm guessing no one's actually read the abortion bill.
Good. Why should a woman decide if my child lives and dies?
"This is crazy because two thirds of Americans support legal abortion. 
The majority need to organize and stop being pushed around by a religious extremist minority."
"Thank God some good news for once, and spare a thought for all the children murdered under this evil law and let it never be considered acceptable again."
Good …now babies have a fighting chance to be born
Good decision for the future generations. I know some people aren’t happy but it’s what humans need. Exception circumstances only should allow abortion.
Doctor death is outraged that his blood money stream is coming to an end!
"There is no ""right"" to abortion."
"Abortion is a violent act against your body, your soul, your mind and your unborn child."
A decisão é correta. O que o Supreme declarou é que cabe ao Congresso e não o Judiciário legislar.
"Women will die because of  this! If abortion is murder,  then miscarriages will be manslaughter!  This is beyond dangerous.  More rights will fall after this. This decision already paves the way to overturn marriage equality & contraception! Today they strip me & my daughter of our rights, tomorrow they will come for yours!"
"The main question is that abortion is not a right guaranteed by the US Constitution, so it should be left for states to deal with this and other matters."
No abortions mean bigger classroom sizes which in turn means more targets for the bi monthly school shooting....
Yeah soooooooo who’s taking care of all those unloved kids that won’t get adopted like we could’ve gotten to the point were abortion wasn’t needed but that’s a far future
"What a blow for human rights!!! I am truly shocked!!! Her body, Her choice!!!!"
A fertilised egg is not a chicken. Life does not begin at conception.
Don't fuck random people. Simple
Why is everyone obese
How can they? Murder shouldn't be illegal. We should be able to kill babies all we want obviously.
"America, America, what have you become?"
The decision was to allow states to come to their own decision by the people voting in each state. This is the most democratic way to do it rather it being left to a handful of judges.    Typical BBC   misleading biased reporting.  There will be plenty of states still doing abortions and plenty of people and groups ready to pay your expenses to go to these states to have an abortion.
US business. Not ours.
"One step forward, two steps backward..."
America has failed and it isn't funny anymore
Shithole country.
The ruthless people who support abortion is because they are already born. Only followers of the devil favour abortion.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wire coat hanger sales are gonna be through the roof.
Make Abortion Great Again!
i only agree with the procedure if a womans life is in danger or was raped the only time doctors should be handling a situation kindly is when a woman miscarries suddenly cause these women never asked to have a miscarriage
"Let's go, thank God this happened"
begun the clone wars have
"What is wrong with ""Family Planning Clinics""?  Think about it!!!"
"The decision just means states can decide if they want it to be legal or not. And this is essentially better. It lets a gay get married in California and a polygamous life their live in their own terms in Utha. A group of people imposing their ideas to oder it is good only if you think like them. Abortion is going to continue in many of the 50 estates of the United States. If no central authority can control our lives, everybody can live their lives in their own terms. We are loosing the essential values of democracy and freedom."
"This comment section has made me loose my faith in humanity, when people say you should be held accountable for what you say on the internet we all start pulling up 1984 but when this happens you all forget about the Handmaid's Tail?"
Wait till the dead bodies start piling up (a 20% rise is predicted). Lets hope the sharp increase in needed welfare will bankrupt these states. Hopefully this will stem the fascist red wave in November.
Babies everywhere are happy.
"For the first time in the long time I have faith in America.   Someone needed to stop these lunatics, no one is stopping people from using birth control."
"No problem , mass shootings will regulate population growth"
It'll be griswold v Connecticut and Lawrence v Texas next - this is a horrific slippery slope on the way to a theocracy
"Abortion is murder. Always has been, always will be."
This is awful “land of freedom” I don’t see that any where America has let so many people down I hope you know what you did.
THEN MAYBE THOSE WOMEN NEED TO KEEP CLOTHES ON AND THEIR LEGS CLOSED. 😆 🤣 😂
"It's sad but true, abortions will continue regardless many will be unsafe. Many women and children will suffer because of this, women dying from poorly done ""backroom"" abortions, women inflicting self harm onto themselves trying to get rid of the child, domestic violence from partners who don't want the child, more abused/abandoned children from parents who don't want them etc.

Both outcomes suck, however legal abortion was the necessary evil to prevent suffering in many circumstances."
this is great news
"People nowadays are so irresponsible. It’s YOUR BODY. YOU KNOW YOU GET PREGNANT FROM SEX. IT’S YOUR CHOICE TO HAVE SEX OR NOT. 

Stupid morons. Dumb irresponsible worthless people."
"Congratulations to the American Supreme Court for another ""f the poor"" decision. Back to the stone age full steam ahead it seems..."
"This is soo insane that US is even thinking about banning abortions....its just sooo horrible!!! Woman should be able to choose over her own body especially if she has been raped...I would never give birth to my rapits child.... I would be soo disgusted , thank god I live in Europe where my rights as a woman arent in danger"
Our country will implode due to all the insane depravity of our people.
Women will just have to keep their legs shut
Government by flaccid old men and religious nuts enacted by justices appointed by Presidents that didn’t win the popular vote.
To God go the glory from Massachusetts yay
Absolutely correct. No more killing of babies by ruthless mothers.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
1 friendly advice for all american woman: Prepare your luggage for Jail befor illegal abortion or suicide.
I'm embarrassed of the country I was born in. These are sad days.

God gives life. We do not have the right to choose who lives and who dies. I pray we can all repent of any sin in our lives and put our faith in Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour. God bless.
Pimps no longer have abortion on demand for victims of human trafficking
Trump wins again! #MAGA
Disgusting that womens rights are being taken away. Absolute travesty. The is a huge regression and step backward in human rights. People cannot stand for this. The US is going backwards.
Thanks God for this decision ! 🙏🏻🙌🏻
Abortion isn't a form of contraception
"No to vaccine passports, mandates or lockdowns"
I feel sorry for all those babies who will land in the bin because the mother didn't have access to arbotion
"Now America is now down the right wing conservative Tory hole!

I hope those that are on the centre or left in the USA go to Canada which will look after them pretty much, especially because they have the NDP to vote for. :)"
"Ladies of the USA - Just put a ban on sex, unless the guy is snipped.  Watch the outrage then."
7:46 why is the gay man with the rainbow  umbrella celebrating a ban on abortion? 😐
"I don’t even have a strong opinion on this really

Still unsure on what I think yet it still makes my breath and HR increase weird"
"Typical American crappy laws after all  they are happy for everyone to have access to guns that kill thousands of innocent young people and kids in their classrooms,  but if a woman get raped and is impregnated she had to carry a baby she never wants."
"The US has taken a step towards protecting the most vulnerable and returning to it’s founding principles, namely the universal rights of all people starting with the right to life. Thank God ❤️"
The right to kill a child… you have all lost your minds when you think a baby’s life should be terminated. Good will be called evil and evil will be called good. These are the last days of a dying civilisation. God help us.
"In 1973 Roe v. Wade literally made up a fake ""Constitutional right"" to abortion which is found nowhere in the Constitution. It's the same thing as happened in 2015 when they made up a fake right to same-sex marriage which is found nowhere in the Constitution. Justices are supposed to uphold the actual text of the Constitution, not make up new legislation and force it on the states. Constitutionally, both those questions must be left to the individual states to decide via the legislative, not judicial, branch of government!"
Baby lives matter! I am happy for this finally!
"I like to play a game these days when I watch the media news - I like to try and spot the narrative - is it for or is it against - forget the good old days when there was neutrality and they just gave the news.
Did you manage to spot the narrative - try the game it's good fun."
Land of the free? Nonsense 😅
Thank God
They terrified because they don’t want to take responsibility of their actions. What happen to being an adult? Save the babies and human life.
Tell us about the rules & limitations of abortion in [bloody] UK & EU... 🤔
"Voting matters.  All these morons vote in these fascists and this is what we get.  It's a war on women.  And they don't want all these unwanted black and brown babies, either.  And will the GOP step up and offer any services for all these unwanted babies?  Don't hold your breath.  But they will make sure each one gets a gun."
I Blame religion .... Its a womans right .... Stop going to a mans Church
Miscarriages will increase dramatically I would guess. This law seems pretty medieval. It's not good.
Notice how all the people celebrating are so f***ing ugly they never need to worry about needing an abortion. Separation of Church and State? Land of the free? You gave up your rights to the vote of 5 people. That's not democracy.
Biden struggling to read just the one paragraph on the teleprompter this time.
yet the gun law JUST MINUPLAITE PPL  with some think else to forget the gun crime  ;ets just add somethink else to keep ppl happy with
Guys are going to be dateless!
Sex is not a casual thing...
whats next for this extreme court?
"Yes! Yes! At last! After about 60 millions babies killed by abortion and planned parenthood, now we will have generations to come..Now babies life is granted.."
USA going back to the good old days. With the right to carry arms it’s going to be like te Wild West. It’s going to get real interesting
"Ladies, the only thing how we can take a revenge- no random sex to men!! Let's make them married us first and take full responsibility about unpredictable pregnancy!! We'll see how they would all get nuts from such perspective!! No more Tinder and one- night stand!! wanna have sex - make a commitment!!"
"Why do some women support to not have rights. I just don't get it, like what The fuck is going on inside thier heads?"
We are waiting for another ruling that ban Gay rights....🤣🤣🤣
very sad day
Sheep
Ah yes the “land of the free”
"We are basically fighting for the right to kill... Is this really how our world will end? Guys, take responsibility for your actions having sex means you can eventually get pregnant, face it. Every choice has a consequence. And please don’t come and tell me that abortion will help you get over a rape! BELIEVE ME, abortion will not make your trauma go, it will make it worse, 2 traumas.

The baby would have chosen to live. His body, his choice."
"Amen, Praise God✝️"
"""I'm 21 and i'm terrified"" wow"
Well come to the 1970 and the republican morons you are look on as backwards thinking country this 2022 we have freedom
Taliban States of America
Too much skanks this generation allways get knocked up.. sad times
This illegitimate puppet dictator is such a hypocrite he and his agenda is the worst hindrance for abortions. The demonrats in control of the government are the biggest hypocritical hindrance to the people period!!!
Great decision. Killing an unborn baby is absolute murder and anyone who does this is going to hell
"This comment section makes my stomach turn...

I’m in favour of a woman’s right to choose"
Republicans... Pro life until elementary school.
"Suzy Boniface and people like her mentioning children killed in schools , but how many unborn children have been murdered just because the baby cramps their lifestyle in say the last 50 yrs far more than children murdered in schools , which is every bit as evil cos their ALL children"
In a short time the courts take away womens rights and at the same time let gun toting maniacs roam the streets armed. If it were a movie it would be deemed to far fetched to  be credible
disgrace.  No court of old farts should tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body.  Its not an unborn child is a foetus that is growing because a male cell fertilized a female egg.  And in the cold light of day the woman may well  regret a moment of .......
"Seeing some crying over not being able to kill babies anymore is disgusting, that one nurse said getting an abortion saved her life but extinguished the life of another who didn't get a choice to decide like she heartlessly did"
yeah keep breeding morons the world is already at breaking point.... animals
"The woman who claimed that she was rapped  and therefore “ that” 
 case became  into “ Law”” said before she died/passed to the other  world that she LIED about it!!! Because of “ her” and the greedy“ ones” millions of babies were killed… THEIR BLOOD CALLS FOR JUSTICE!!!  NO MORE KILLING OF BABIES, WE ARE NOT UNDER “ MULLOK SACRIFICES”…. OR ARE WE????  WERE WE??? AND IF LEFT TO THE RADICAL “DEMONDS” WILL BE!!! NO MORE SACRIFICES TO MULLOK!!!"
"Have a feeling it’s not just about pro-life, pro-choice standpoints. You seen the demographics of wealthy nations? Who’s going to do wage slavery and keep people supply up for the rich people to exploit else if the poor people get abortions to prevent bad situations both for themselves and their children? The rich lobbyists don’t care if a child grows up in an impoverished environment so long as such can work whatever occupation in future for cheap. Think supply and demand, high supply of poorer people and they have to compete for your position and get lower wages, less supply of poorer people and you actually have to pay them and treat them well to get them to work for you."
I still have no words for this appalling ruling of the Supreme Court and for its  consequences
"In other news, coat hanger sales skyrocket!"
"You shouldn't get to make choices that affect the decisions people make in their own best interests
#ProtectWomensRights"
Misleading title - the decision just means states can decide if they want it to be legal or not.
"Women have been talking like we live in the 1800s forever. Men have no option to opt out of parental responsibility, so to me this is closer to equality."
Get ready for civil war 2.0
America is the laughing stock of the world
I live in South Carolina so it's probably going to be banned here but luckily I live a 15-minute drive from North Carolina if ever needed.
Massive W for humanity
"Fantastic,  isn't it?"
God bless America
End The Tyranny !!!!!
Where are those Biden loving democrats now?
Violence is never the answer. Let's make abortion history.
"America is based on the God of the Bible,
The Babylonians in the Old Testament worshiped Moloch, they sacrificed children.
That's fast what was happening to America.
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and today,
Each child is a gift from God,"
Well appreciated for the decision 🌹🎂
Just remember the same people who like abortion  are the same people who want to make saving 18 cents a gallon a federal holiday
"democracy, innit?"
As an American I will say this:  Any woman who wants to have an abortion can still get one.  America is a big country and they can go where it is still legal.
Abortion is not banned it’s left to each state please do not add to miss information maybe ladies and gentlemen can take precautions to stop a pregnancy and even in states where abortion may be restricted for rape victims 65 million babies where terminated last year please bbc tell the truth don’t add to the destruction at least tell all sides you may get more people to watch
Thank you President Trump.
"They went past the bedroom and straight for the womb! Next weeks ruling... skin color, sex partner and religious authority"
LOL Joe you know how unpopulated you are right now? Why are you talking?
"If all life is so sacred, stop eating anything that used to be living.  It's impossible. 
""Life"" does NOT mean the same thing as alive."
Will the US be split into two countries?
#hoesmad
And fathers have no say … it is a disgrace that woman and men of color wil not say anything about
this is lile movie apocolypto
"Protection? An ounce of prevention, after all"
"Pro life conservatives are evil, vile people. Using their Bible to control people. So much for small government."
Why is abortion divisive? Everyone knows it is murder of a human life.
I'm aged *Zygote* . Thnks US.
"One side is happy babies will live.
One side is sad babies will live."
They will fight everything except their racism.
this is just like prohibition it sounds like a good thing but its taking away their freedom of choice people will still find a way around to getting rid of babies by killing them with the taking of drugs or secret operations its just sad that Americans yes again got rid of their own freedom of choice yet again
"As a social worker in Georgia in the United states. I see thousands of kids going through the system who never get adopted, no life skills, the majority of my kids  emulate what they see and at 18 we kick them out on the street and about 11% of the kids do get adopted, the rest are just lost, Working dead end jobs, falling prey to addiction and undiagnosed mental health problems and my hands were tied. It was sad to witness. I really hope they dump lots of money into the system so I can really help these kids"
"The last time the bbc did this, we all took down the video and it was hilarious."
They also increased funding to support new mothers right?
obortion is south american sacrifice
"Got this mad idea if your not wanting a baby try either proper protection or celibacy , don’t blame an unborn child for your own mistakes. Either that or put the baby up for adoption there’s plenty of women who can’t have children who would love 1"
America is the most backwards of all the advanced countries.
"Is not like every human born is going to do anything worthwhile with their life. They’ll grow up to be tax smoochers, drug and sex addicts, with no ambitions of anything in life. No worth in work nor hope in heart; no wit, nor will to fight. Soulless, brain-dead, and over-medicated. #theModernConsumer"
The end of the Black Genocide.
Gotta love hypocrite conservatives. It's only my body my choice if it comes to a vaccine. This isn't saving lives. Women will get back alley abortions and be forced to birth rape babies. Pro life. Bullshit.
Abortion has never been guaranteed by the Constitution. The overturning of Roe V Wade does not ban abortion it just pushes that decision back to the States.
"I am sure all those who are pro -forced birth, are going to adopt all the unwanted babies"
"OK, folks, NO KILLING of babies until they're old enough to start school and get gunned down by some coward with a gun! Nice hypocrisy there!"
going to be a lot more 'suspicious' falls down flights of stairs in the US
Land of the free and home of the automatic weapon
"Wow. What kind of right is this? Right to kill babies? Luckily those who are fighting for this right to abortion, their mother didn't aborted them"
I am so confused. SCOTUS decided NY can’t make their own gun laws BUT  abortion will now fall under the States to decide Huh?
The consideration ls are so weighty and nuanced and yet one reads these comments. The spite in your hearts is truly unbelievable.
Was it a right?
"Slowly being stripped of our rights
YOUR GUNS ARE NEXT 💯💯💯😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"
"Good!!  Imagine if all the females took advantage of the NUMEROUS forms of birth control in which to choose from, how many countless THOUSANDS of babies would be saved from murder (up until birth) and instead shamelessly playing Baby-Roullet actually took responsibility. Imagine 🤔 Glad I won't be forced to pay my tax dollars to this any more"
American womans worst nightmare lmfaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Democrats are going to burn 🔥 and riot. But Life Wins
Good stop those baby murderers
"Disgusting,  and the yanks go on about the taliban. Women should own the right to thier own bodies."
Best news in years.
"The same day as Germany abolished the restrictions on information about abortions...
What irony"
Is this the start of Handmaids tale?!
"So Clarence Thomas now wants more power given to the States.  Let the States make the laws.  So now when the Republican controlled States all pass laws against abortion,  STATES RIGHTS!  SO, when a State now passes a law making abortion legal in that State at 8 months and 3 weeks, for any reason,,, STATES RIGHTS. ? When the suit is brought against it what will the Supreme Court say,   STATES RIGHTS  ?"
"People should look into the other rights we the people have that aren't part of the original constitution, like the right for women to vote. The way they worded the decision means they can go after everything that has been put in place since the original document was written. Religion wins again, we will be under religious law soon and you'll see your rights go away. You just wait."
Hobo Ch.t. ~ Puppy Nutta F*WIT 🫒🕎
Praise Jesus hallelujah
"So this hands the power back to the people in each State to decide what they think is acceptable, instead of DC having the power to decide for the Country.  The Democrats are peed off because planned parenting won't get millions in funding from the tax payer,  who then give millions to the Democrats election time. It's all a show and media like BBC enjoy adding fuel to the misleading fire."
I'm expecting huge protests that might even turn violent and deadly over the weekend.
A great day for children
"""BLUE Discount Sale"" in liberal cities across the nation over the weekend. Unbelievable prices on flat screens and sneakers."
"Oh boy. Now they can undo mixed race marriages, and women's right to vote and birth control .After all they aren't mentioned in the Constitution either. I don't think people understand that Thomas said last year that legal precedent is something he doesn't believe in."
N.Ireland : What's An Abortion?! 🤔🤨🧐
"Jesus hate abortion, don't promote evil..https://youtu.be/wr4NLOcRbSc"
"Absolutely ridiculous to take away a womans right 
My god unwanted pregnancies child pregnancies rape victims why should anyone be controlling other peoples lives
Going back to dark ages
Dont agree with abortion being used as contraception or late term abortion but every one has their unique situation they will drive this under ground becoming more dangerous WOMENS BODIES WOMENS RIGHT anything else is ridiculous meant to be western country where women have equal rights and choices"
You're 25? Here's a plan keep your legs shut or get on contraceptives
Baby killers.
Deeply disheartening. Our neighbouring country is systematically dismantling hard fought for rights. It is going to take so much effort and a renewed compassionate focus to work towards undoing what the current Supreme Court has inflicted upon the populace. ⚖️
What's a women
Balsa basalt tensel pencil line pitch curve
US Politicians and Courts keeping the unwashed masses distracted fighting each other on red herrings while they make off like bandits.
"Women, if you live in a state where it's illegal going forward just get on a flight to California and get your abortion. Otherwise, bring the baby to term and give it up for adoption and bless someone else with a child if you don't want to be blessed."
This is not a historic moment. This is a huge mistake. So many  children will now be killed by there parents and traffickers.
The US Supreme Court decision was inspired by the Great Replacement conspiracy theory that white Americans are losing.
"Thank you USA. Im from México, We dont want abortion"
These sickos do not represent us. Republicans and conservatives have put the final fork in this country. It's doomed. Over.
"US sliding back to medieval times real fast. First an attempt to hang the Vice President, rampant conspiracy theories and now this. Ireland reversed their ban a few years ago and it was one of the last countries."
Abortion Has Done Irreparable Damage To The Human Race.
Watch how this ages
Well I hope every man in this country has brought enough sex dolls and vaseline to last them a lifetime. Because it will be a long time before they ever get sex from any of these women out here. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
GO babies!!! :)
"I guess America _doesn't_ believe in freedom of your own body, huh?
If they try to say it's for the baby's ""freedom""- then they're okay with depriving one person of freedom to give it to someone else?
Morally, that's a pretty shitty situation."
"As a man who identifies as a foetus, I feel relieved and safe now. Thank you US Supreme Court."
The US of A. Going back in time and on the world stage.
THIS IS SAVAGERY
Thoughts?
"<I totally agree with what you are saying.  I started in crypto in August 2017, and I bought in.  I was up 5x by December only to watch that disappear quickly and then watch  the original investment go down by about 85% during the ensuing 4 year bear market.  I took the opportunity to accumulate more over the last 4 years which was hard to do and at the same time a smart thing to do.  I wish I had bought more.  I am in profit for now but I am planning on using my experience and what i have learnt from Jim Brin I have learned from you and other Youtubrs  especially my mentor  Jim Brin who taught me how to make trade and increase my crypto from 11 to 27btc that no one really knows what is going to happen in the market.."
"Abortion only should be allowed if the woman/girl  has a 
life-threatening medical condition, been raped, or pregnancy by incest. I think there is 
just too much abortions done. There are options such as adoption. Live and 
let Live."
Abortion won't be banned completely it will only be allowed for rape victims
I'm so proud of Americans today
Only on the federal level. It puts it up to each state to decide whether it's legal or not. So stop spreading false narratives!!
Sounds Error 😂
It was never a constitutional right.
Liberals and leftist 5 minutes in the sun is over and more to come all them lives taken and no chance at life not they have that chance
Republican party politicians ended the right to abortion to increase the population of white Americans and control the population of black and brown Americans because they fear that white Americans are becoming the minority.
"Listen, Man United might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done since he's come in. TEN HAG'S (Ole 4.0) at the wheel, man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing. MAN UNITED ARE BACK!!!"
The BBC has NO RIGHT to pass judgement on an alien culture they know NOTHING about
"I wish everyone who clicked this video the most love, peace, and abundance"
"I'm American. The damn Republicans did this now to distract from the January 6th Committee exposing Don the Con Trump as a criminal.  Twice impeached Trump was the worst US president in history for many reasons. #1) Trump committed an act of treason against the US by inciting a violent insurrection on January 6, 2021. #2) Trump’s incompetence regarding his management of the US response to the Covid-19 pandemic between January 2020 and July of 2020. Thousands of US citizens died as a result Trump’s failure. If Trump had a proper immediate response to the pandemic the way that the South Korean government did, then thousands of US citizens who died would still be alive today. #3) In April of 2019 Trump vetoed the resolution to end US military support of Saudi Arabia's GENOCIDE of thousands of innocent civilians in Yemen! Trump was using the US military to support GENOCIDE in Yemen! #4) Trump violated the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution for his entire 4 years in office, then in 2019 Trump verbally mocked the US Constitution. The foundation of the USA is the US Constitution, that is why the presidential inaugural oath includes to swear to protect and defend the US Constitution. In January 2017 Trump publicly swore an oath on a bible at his inauguration ceremony to protect and defend the US Constitution. In 2019 Trump mocked the US Constitution by publicly saying the words ""phony emoluments clause"". #5) Trump misogynistically and adulterously said of women: ""Grab them by the pussy.""! Trump committed adultery with Stormy Daniels and then tried to cover it up. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, was in prison for crimes related to Trump's cover-up of his adulterous scandal with Stormy Daniels. Most Republicans claim to be the moral party and/or the majority Christian party, but hypocritically enthusiastically want to give an adulterous Donald Trump, another 4 years in office. If a US president who was a member of the Democratic Party did the terrible things Trump has, of course, the Republican Party leaders would be screaming for his removal from office. #6) Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice. #7) Trump committed crimes of trying to tamper with elections, especially in Georgia. #8) Trump's attempted abuse of power regarding Ukraine. #9) Trump committed tax fraud in New York State, which is partly why Trump hides his tax returns. #10) Trump practiced corrupt nepotism as he appointed unqualified members of his family into positions of power in the executive branch of government. #11) Trump illegally destroyed documents and illegally took documents with him after he left the office of president. 
There are many other horrible things about Trump. Here are some of them: Donald Trump is a dumb corrupt businessman which is why he hides his tax returns. Donald Trump is not a self-made man, he benefited from nepotism. His daddy Fred Trump gave him millions of dollars to start businesses many of which have failed! Donald Trump's failed businesses are many but include: Trump Airlines, a Trump Casino, and Trump University. With his failed Trump University, he defrauded hundreds of students. In Trump's many construction projects he failed to pay some of his contractors. Trump committed fraud with his non-profit in New York State which is why Trump recently transferred his residence to Florida. Donald Trump is too stupid to write his own book which why he hired a ghost writer to write ""The Art of the Deal"". When Trump was in high school, he hired another boy to take his SAT college entrance exam. Trump claims that he is smart, but he refuses to show us his college transcripts. Donald Trump's daddy bribed a physician to write that Donald Trump had bone spurs and therefore could dodge the Vietnam War draft. Donald Trump and his dad also practiced racism in who they would rent properties to in the 1960s and 1970s. That is just scratching the surface of the long list of horrible things about Donald Trump."
Oh no!!! America is finished!!!
🙄🙄🤡
"The Right to abortion was NOT struck down! The federal government no longer controls abortion. That decision is now something determined by the states, not the federal government."

Love  ahead everything
next they will also ban male abortions.

Christianity the big hypocrisy

Never vote GOP again. That's how we fix healthcare.
"a better world, with less murder"
"EASY SOLUTION. If men really wanted to save babies lives, they would mandate vasectomies instead of playing politics with women's bodies.    VASECTOMY is safer, cleaner, more successful, a one timer, not risky nor fatal, and a whole lot cheaper,       Hey guys, how about it?    SOLUTION TO ABORTION IS PREVENTION."
Extreme?  No. Sorry.  A wrong has been righted.  Roe vs Wade was based off lies.  Using Larry Laders ideologies.
They be illegalizing abortion but still let people sell gun legally
They took are JOBS!
"Many churches are evil.  Don't give your child up for adoption.  They want to ban abortion only for their own greed and evil intentions; to sell children to pedophiles, sexual perverts and into slavery."
"1) Abortion bans do nothing. Women will always have the option of abortion, whether it’s banned or not. 
2) Abortion bans actually increase the number of abortions, ironically. So I guess you people really aren’t about saving fetal lives so much as virtue signaling.
3) Fetuses now have a right that no other human being has, and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another person’s body to stay alive. No other human has ever been granted that right. Even if you stab someone and they’re bleeding out, and you have matching blood types, the government cannot force you to give them your blood to keep them alive. Or if you use a mask, gloves, etc. but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organs start shutting down, the government cannot forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organs. You used protection, so the chances of giving this person the disease that you’re a carrier for were very low, but it still happened, and now they’re dying because of you. Guess what—the government does not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive. That’s exactly what an abortion ban attempts to do, however. So I’m not sure why fetuses should have that right when no one else does."
"By the order of God, a soul is sent to a particular womb, but by this contraceptive he is denied that womb and has to be placed in another. That is disobedience to the su-preme."
I'm pro-choice. Is abortion killing a baby? Yep...but I'm good with it anyway. We have enough people.
People on b9th sides quite  your stupid stuff.there are more life threatening  things going on in the world. There using you all to run on elections and money same thing ever year.
Not Government role to control stay out will never please all.  Waste of time and energy.  Individual  decision. People mind your own business
Look at all those people it’s ridiculous the world is populated with people what the hake do I look like adding on to that I’m good ✌🏽
Isn't it something how they talk about the one woman in a million that couldn't get an abortion and something went wrong but they don't talk about the other billion of babies that are born safe and naturally. Ban all abortion pills. It goes hand-in-hand with overturning it
Every abortion is the murder of a baby.  I don't understand how blind people are.
"The ""right to lifers"" tend not to mention the things I've delt with; I am mow 62, never had kids (because I did not want them to grow up in this world). I get consistent 💩 from people in the Reich-wing because I didn't have any. Seems it is not all just the gripe that abortion is murder. Clearly they have other motives. The Reich-wingers will never touch my children!!"
Every woman encouraged by Dems to just get an abortion All wind up in therapy.   Dems should get abortions
I wanna get rid of my kids too man y'all please help me.😓🥲😢😥😓😞😖
"It makes me so angry.  These people demanding abortions until as long as they want.  Who do they think has do these things.   Nurses and doctors who don't have a choice or lose their job.   We get to do the nasty murderous things these people demand.  Nurses and doctors committing suicide on a daily rate because they are being forced to be murderers.  Assisted suicide, late term abortions.  They monsters demanding it don't have to get their hands dirty or sin against God's wishes.   They don't have to live with seeing babies taken out piece by piece.   You are monsters to make medical people who swore to say lives take it so you don't have to be bothered.  That is why I left my profession and why thousands are leaving daily.  You selfish little snowflakes."
Till she's on deaths door really..
"Does abortion cause breast cancer?  In medical circles, estrogen is a known carcinogen (cancer causing). When a woman is pregnant, her estrogen rate spikes significantly, and her breasts begin to change in size and function (differentiate) for breast feeding. Specifically, her ovaries produce 2000 percent more estrogen and progesterone at this time. With the levels of estrogen now elevated, if she interrupts the cell differentiation process before full term pregnancy, this elevated estrogen introduces routes for the onset of breast cancer. This is the triggering process where abortion increases the risk of breast cancer. This is why in a late term abortion or miscarriage, with this abundance of estrogen, the risk of breast cancer increases by 638 percent over those with no such history. This is also why teenagers who have an abortion are especially at risk for breast cancer, because of the changes estrogen is already causing in their breasts, plus the additional estrogen from the pregnancy. 

There are a lot more data on this but the bottom line is, (1) abortion significantly increases the risk of breast cancer for all women, (2) the younger the woman and the later the abortion, the greater the breast cancer risk, and (3) the breast cancer rate for women almost doubled since Roe v. Wade. It is medically established that abortion increases the rate of breast cancer. But women typically are not told about this until the breast cancer starts and by then, prevention is no longer a choice.  If you wish to learn more, check out ""My Right to Choose,"" on Amazon. This information will help you make informed choices about what you do, and what you encourage your family and friends to do. It literally could be the difference between life or death."
Jesus is coming folks. Repent and be saved.
"The living but unborn are persons in the sight of God from the time of conception. Since abortion takes a human life, it is not a moral option except to prevent the death of another person, the mother.” The sin of willfully aborting a child, except in those very rare situations where it may be necessary to save the life of the mother, is a sinful act, totally contrary to the will of God."
I wouldn't personally want to abuse my child but I wouldn't stop other parents from doing so.
Free tickets to heaven! Free limbs to be able to afford to get through life!
Stop the drama and use protection! If you can’t afford to raise a child then use a double condom. Actions=Consequences! Pro life! 👍
Happened with Biden administration. Y'all voted for him and wanted him. Don't cry now. Just like how he left extremely expensive military equipment in Afghanistan purchased by my tax money.
Killing is killing use a condom.
Yeah. It means no babies will be murdered. That’s pretty much it. 👌🏼👍
The defining moment of being a modern woman the right to abort your child. What a sick position it's the epitome of stupid. I'm pro-life even if it means The Unborn Child might possibly turn out as ugly as your disposition. Shame on you for bringing your hurt to the party and advocating for termination of The Unborn. Go forgive your mother
You can get all these people out on the street to fight for the right to abort but you can't get anyone to protest the current political regime in America even when you can't afford gasoline and your family is going hungry. How about a great reset to the American people's priorities? Good luck repopulating the future too.
"Women should have the right not to become pregnant.  Haven't they always?  It is her body after all, her choice.  Pregnancy is not a communicable disease, it is (usually) a choice for exposure they make for themselves.  Irresponsibly removing consequences of detrimental decisions encourages more of the same.  ""More of the same"" meets the definition of perversion.   Some people want Big Government to mess in personal lives where individually you own consequences.  That you can depend on Big Government for your well being is a fallacy Democrats are selling and failing with.  Think about it. People reach new understanding every day."
I know a woman who is EXTREMELY  conservative and all about the abortion ban. What she won't tell you is that she's had 3 abortions herself when she was younger. If she would of had any of those children her life would have been completely different
"Reverse psychology that's why they did this, it's to easy the government is smart.  They don't want anymore babies born,  there are to many people on this planet. You'll walked right into there hands!"
We need to fight for abortions so blacks and Mexicans are not born anymore. Legalize abortions n place them in all black communities plz!!
How about women start using protection and taking responsibility for their actions? AKA don’t be a murderous POS!
"I'm a 100% Republican, and I just don't get my sides point of view on abortion, or understand why they're all so against it. Personally, I think there should actually be a 100% legal forced abortion, after a family has just 1 child, if that many even. None of this adoption garbage either because that just adds to the problem. Not just because I hate, and despise, children but also, and mostly, because this World and especially this Country (US) are all completely overcrowded. We do not need more people in it, plain and simple. Enough is enough."
Abortion is not medicine it is murder
"The movie 2001 a space Odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion. A space Odyssey is a fetus in the womb. The Clint Eastwood dirty Harry movies was angry calm. It seems nasty but it's a good police officer. Angry calm is how a women chooses abortion.

Everything in motion makes one error. Your supposed to park the error where it doesn't matter or you play wack a mole with errors. It's intelligently designed that if you try killing God you will always make one error. A movie is in motion so you have to park the errors where it doesn't matter. 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind. That why Hal computer eye is colored red so it still has artistic integrity. 2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made. It only has one error to park. You can't do better than that."
abortion is not the issue most people want some regualtion schumers bill advocated for 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 months and aftr birth thats murder
Simple solution.... stop spreading you legs
More future wage slaves this is why they decided to banned abortion.
they bought the supreme and now this anti abortion law in 2022 ? this law is bigoted intolerant and make a lot of problems for people . i dont know how this people were elected but sure usa voters have to ponder about it
"Exodus 21:22-25

Authorized (King James) Version

22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. 23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe."
"Men have no right to be the ones to decide women’s issues, especially about reproductive rights. If the shoe were on the other foot men would literally lose their minds if women were in charge of deciding men’s issues, such as who gets vasectomies, who is allowed Viagra, etc!"
"Here's what I don't understand:  
1) Bearing a child carries an inherent risk of death or grievous bodily harm.  
2) One may not be forced to use their body at the service of another; that would be slavery.  
3) One may not be forced to endure medical risk, physical pain, and mental anguish; that would be torture.  

So HOW, exactly, is abortion anything other than self defense?"
"I don’t understand how people who are/were against government mandated Covid vaccinations, but are in support of abortion bans. It’s enraging that some only support bodily autonomy when it’s in regards to themselves, but don’t care that women’s rights are being violated."
More lies and propaganda. ABORTION HAS NOT BEEN BANNED. Check with State voters!! MSNBC can't  be trusted. Beware of these propaganda news networks. Americans deserve truthful reporting!!🤬🤬🤬
"U.S. democracy is a broken system and it does not represent the majority of Americans. The majority of Americans approve of legal abortion, they approve of stricter gun control laws, support raising the minimum wage, recognize our Southern Border is in crisis with illegal immigration and etc., yet our representatives continually fail us, playing political games back and forth, prioritizing their own needs and the needs of corporations and special interest groups over the average American voter."
"GOPs can't respect a women's right to decide what to do with their bodies in order to ""protect."" When it comes to gun and violent though, they don't seem to care about those lives........"
We are all here because our parents choose life for us and yet in 2022 we are still killing babies in the womb. So wrong.
Hopefully what the Supreme Court did will be the undoing and the permanent removal and destruction of the Republican Party and hopefully we can have term limits
You can only ban legal abortions.
"Just wait, it’ll be 2055 and the country will be so overpopulated that you have to live in stacks like ready player one. Imagine banning the one form of population control we had a right to."
Almost 50% of the adult voting age population are women. If they don’t stand up and vote these Republicans out they will have only themselves to blame when their rights are taken away from them. What will it be next? The right to vote taken away? The right to travel to another state is already in jeopardy. Will they make it so you have to have a man sign for you if you want to travel or open a bank account or get a loan from the bank to own your own property? This is only the tip of the iceberg and women need to sit up and take notice or they will lose all the gains that our grandmothers and mothers fought so hard to secure for women of today. Wake up to what’s really happening here!!
"Its less about abortion and more about that some ppl believe they know better how to live your life. But don't tell them how to live theirs, that's THEIR freedom. It's your freedom that offends them."
Abortion bans dont stop abortions. Only Clinics. Most women are just causing their own miscarriage. I am glad women have abortions. Pro Life only want us born so we can suffer. Every abortion saves a child from this world.
"It's a Woman Choice!
Republicans have no business taking away a Woman's Choice to their bodies... PERIOD!
Remind, Remove Republicans... ROEVEMBER!!!
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
"Remember, Remove, Remind Republicans!!!
... ROEVEMBER!!!
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
VOTE to Remove Republicans Across America!!!"
Still hasn’t changed my mind.  These children matter more than you think
Dude it’s up to the states
Protection of the helpless babies is never mentioned.
"Why do peopke think they have any right to tell a woman what to do with with her body? No one should be able to. My body my choice.
If someone doesn't believe in abortion fine, don't get one. But why bc they don't believe in it, they get to tell others what to think, how to feel, what to do with their bodies? I bet most of these people yelled ""my freedom..."" during covid. Thing is they weren't forced to do anything. There were limits and boundaries but not forced. Women are being forced to do something major with their bodies."
"As a mature woman who lived in the times before Roe, I remember. The tears of a teen who missed her period. The ostracism of a pregnant young girl from school, church and/or family. The swallowing of pills & potions attempting to self-abort. Or the horror of nurses & doctors when left with the ravages of the damage a coat hanger can do when a woman is desperate. Those were horrendous times for women. Please don’t make me live them again."
"Never forget that all it takes is a political,
economic or religious crisis for women's
rights to be put back into question. These
rights are never truly acquired. You will have
to be vigilant your whole life. -Simone de
Beauvoir"
"It’s like a really old computer, one is too lazy to get a new one because the old one still works, even though it’s slow and out of touch and doesn’t pick up the internet well, but it has all your old files and would be just a big mess to switch over to a more functional government, ahem I mean computer."
Over a million dead labor units in the US alone.  Big money wants Forced Birth Cattle.  Religious nuts want to control crotches.  What a team.
"Republicans don't give a crap about the unborn, they just want to keep birth rate up, so we don't runout of taxpayer's and cheap labor in 16 years."
Abortion kills alot of babys
Can Texas please just secede from the US.  It’s a POS state.
That's just a small percentage of the general population.. not as many idiots out there as I thought 😂
I would like to know if there are any incidents that doctors were charged when treating a miscarriage. If not this is fear mongering. Every party does this. If it has happened then that would be ridiculous and we should address it
The staff at MSNBC is reason enough for abortion........
"Come on, ""Supreme"" Court, follow through on this fair decision based on the same reasoning! Update the Federal voting law!
Roe v. Wade was overturned based on 14th Amendment and the situation in 1868. Look at who were allowed to vote or hold office in 1868 based on the law and the 14th Amendment.


Arkansas Constitution—1868 
Sec. 3. The following classes shall not be permitted to register, or vote, or hold office, viz:
1st. Those who during rebellion took the oath of allegiance, or gave bonds for loyalty and good behavior to the United States Government, and afterward gave aid, comfort or countenance to those engaged in armed hostility to the Government of the United States, either by becoming a soldier in the rebel army or by entering the lines of said army, or adhering in any way to the cause of rebellion, or by accompanying any armed force belonging to the rebel army, or by furnishing supplies of any kind to the same.
2d.  . . .
3d.   . . .
4th.  . . .
5th.  . . .
6th. Those who are idiots or insane

The first group takes care of the former President, many Congress members, and the Insurrectionists. The sixth group encompasses those people who still think Trump won in 2020!"
This will make people less reckless about getting pregnant.
It is inhumane to murder your own child.
Vote blue and get these people out of office
"You are being SNOWED, wool pulled over your eyes, they tell you custody isn't kidnapping, and they tell you child support isn't enslavement, and they tell you abortion isn't murder, you are being snowed."
"Man imagine not being able to get treatment because you are pregnant, but you can't cease your pregnancy to get the treatment that can save your life because of the new abortion law"
"I really don't see the problem. 
No one outlawed dumpsters."
"WHAT IS NAUSEATING IS THE MOTIVE FOR BANNING ABORTION...
THESE SO CALLED PROLIFERS  SAY THEY WANT TO SAVE A LIFE, BUT THEY WONT SIGN ON TO FEED AND SUPPORTING THE LIFE OF THE CHILD...
LIKE EXTENDING MEDICAID OR RAISING THE WAGES THAT WILL ENABLE THE FAMILY TO FUNCTION AT A HUMANE LEVEL.
SO THE FAMILY WON'T BE KEPT IN POVERTY...
POVERTY IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT THE SYSTEM USES TO REMOVE CHILDREN FROM THE FAMILY....
IN TURN AN UNSUPERVISED PROLIFE  ADOPTION AGENCY WILL BE AT THE FAMILY  FRONT DOOR.
HOW MUCH WILL AN ADOPTION AGENCY GET FOR A NEW BORN BABY... 
ITS A FACT THAT THE YOUNGER THE CHILD... THE HIGHER THE PRICE...
HOW MANY PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY HAVE HORROR STORIES OF BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILY AND GETTING LOST IN THE ADOPTION SYSTEMS.... NOT HAVING KNOWLEDGE OF  THEIR PROPER IDENTITY... THIS FORM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAS BEE GOING ON FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.
THESE PREDITORY PROLIFERS MUST BE CHALLENGED.
SOMEONE NEED TO PUSH FOR LEGISLATION TO REMOVE THE PROFITS FROM THE ADOPTION PROCESS, ...THE LEGAL  HUMAN TRAFFICKING PROCESS"
Reversing roe is huge mistake
"Yeah, Republicans shoot themselves in the foot...lol"
"Based on this, Greg Abbott is DONE!!"
With all the issues in the world and as big as the world is why focus on abortion !!!    USA needs to find something else to focus I !
Welcome to the Islamic republic of America.
"Organized crime is what you are really seeing, women's biggest partner in crime walked away from them, look at all the custody and child support laws when they really started and you'll see it all about the 70's when they legalized murder of the unborn, just because they call something different than what it really is doesn't change what it really is. Custody=Kidnapping, Child Support=Enslavement, Abortion=Murder, they just changed how you think about it by calling it something different."
Reclassify embryo as a tumor 😉
No matter how you feel about abortion. MSNBC is an ignorant outlet that is driven by hate.  Every valid point they may have is lost in a river of stupidity and ignorance.  MSNBC SUCKS
It’s not that I don’t understand being pro-life. I do understand. I get it. But it simply doesn’t outweigh the reasons to be pro-choice. There are too many exceptions and too many tragic situations where an abortion is - as unfortunate as it is - the best option. And it’s really nobody’s business to impose laws upon a woman in one of those situations.
"Watch out in 15yrs or so, crime rate is gonna go up."
"It is time for Americans to man up. If Republicans win this then we must face some facts. Republicans have not hidden the fact they are going after birth control next so together with banning abortions this amounts to FORCED BIRTHS. If they win and you care about children you might want to consider getting your TUBES tied or a vasectomy. If this sounds a little drastic, IT IS. However, if Republicans win would you really want to bring a helpless baby into this country under their RULE??????"
Lets vote this republicans out of power.
"Abortion is not for religious fanatics and politicians to decide. It is right of the woman to decide, with help of doctors and specialists. There is so many things wrong with you America."
What does msnbc know about people?
The Republicans are making sure that they will not be elected with all of the very unpopular choices they are making.
Abortion is not healthcare. Miscarriage is not manslaughter
If people don’t want abortions banned then murder should be allowed
"She went into the eyeglasses store and thought ""I want to look like a woman Disney villain"""
"Meanwhile in my state no change in Maternity or Family leave- we are literally one of only three countries in the world to have no care, women risk losing their job for having a baby, no care by doctors for fear of doing wrong and having to carry your dead baby to “term” after a miscarriage, no plans for mental health for these women going through trauma, no plans for expanding the foster care or adoption system bc they can barely account for the thousands of children and women, especially black women and children, who disappear after either being in the system or going in for medical care… Yeah, we really pro-life in the US. Meanwhile all those rich girls who get knocked up come to whatever doctor or clinic they want before the clinic office opens and gets the deed done under the table."
"You know the same ""christian brothers"" that want to deny food assistance to our continually starving kids,  want to force MORE starving kids that we can't afford or raise. Religious scum."
"It has nothing to do with keeping babies alive and everything to do with control.
If you cared about those babies you'd stop killing them in your schools."
"This will be the same as Brexit and Trump’s election. People make important decisions based on emotions, gut feelings and stereotypes. Decisions such as these should always be grounded on solid thinking through. 

People are acting more and more rushed, hot headed and arrogantly these days, and it’s impacting our democracies"
Enact a law the requires males who father children and do not financially support their children to be chemically castrated.
The american dream just gets better and better 💛
"In anti-abortions states, could people set up Planned Parenthood clinics on Native American Reservation lands?"
"If everyone votes, the GOP handed the democrats a major share of both houses. 

The majority of people believe in human rights where as the GOP believes in Billionaire rights and bad faith politics."
"a big part of me is desperately trying to hold back from laughting at them for allowing such rights to be taken away
another part of me tells me that not everyone of the voters knew what it meant"
The problem is not the banning of abortion but its performance
So… are we going to have punishments for assisting women in getting pregnant?
"Take a measure of our schools, of how disgustingly underfunded, undersupported, de-prioritized our children are. 
See how the GOP fights to take away WIC and food stamps that feed hungry children.
See how the social workers are handling 10x the caseload that they should be, and all the instances where horrible abuses go undetected because we aren't lookig out for children in the system.
See how utterly dysfunctional the adoption Gordian Knot is.

You think these unwanted pregnancies, the children resulting from the forced births, that they are going to be ""taken care of""? Give me a fvcking break. That is a fantasy.

Doctors and pregnant women need to be able to make healthcare decisions without government interference."
"I tell you what....I'm so fvcking livid.
Itching for the ballot box. Time is now. This is an attack on women."
It’s always been banned in my country
"Senator Raphael Warnock Stole $60,000 in Campaign Funds to Pay His Child Support! That's How Demonrats Operate!"
"Here's the thing: it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if a fetus is a full human being. It doesn't matter if they have a heartbeat.
Thousands of people die every year because they didn't get organ transplants. There's no law forcing anyone to give up their organs. Medical schools need corpses to study - but they legally can't use a body that did not consent in life.
So. Even if - and the ""if"" is very exaggerated here - abortion is murder, then that doesn't matter, because you cannot force someone to preserve another person's life."
NEW MOVIE COMING OUT SEPTEMBER 7..MY SON HUNTER..MUST SEE
If women don't care about ending the life of a future baby why should we care about their life?
"And yet Planned Parenthood tells protesters not to say “woman” on their signs. They claim to speak for women’s rights, but won’t even dare to use the word “woman”.
Cute, right?"
MSNBC GET YOUR SUBTITLE SYSTEM SORTED SO THAT IT IS CLOSE TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING
"As women die due to self abortion or unsanitary ended pregnancies it will be revealed JUST how little the male population cares. All the natural miscarriages that occur, will be considered as an abortion. Where are our rights as women, as voters. This sickens me. Being pro women's rights doesn't mean being pro abortion. It means as it says being pro women's rights."
Can they not have a referendum on this? Let the people decide through a vote.
That's why when November comes all these women all over this country  have to vote to let the Supreme Court and GOP hear them clearly that a woman's right to chose is hers and hers alone
"'The Handmaiden's Tale' is merely boot camp, according to the repukeliekkkons."
"If abortion is murder than every person you didn't donate your liver, kidneys, or blood to and they died is YOUR fault... murderer."
"Bottom line: Law makers are all about creating more human suffering!
There's just too much money in it for the people at the top."
"Watch the movie THE SILENT CRY! I GUARANTEE YOU WILL CHANGE U MIND ABOUT ABORTION! IF THAT MOVIE DOESN'T AFFECT YOU , YOU HAVE NO SOUL! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR BLACKS IN THIS COUNTRY IS? IT'S ABORTION! 15,000 OR MORE BLACK CHILDREN ARE MURDERED EVERY YEAR!"
All you Biden Democrats don't worry about it abortion go down to the Border pick up 10 or 12 people call them your kids call them whatever you want and then while you're at it let your president know what's going on down there
Texas wants to finish the Wall all on its own but you idiots have tied them up in court for a LONG time disallowing them to finish the wall. Discuss that. This whole administration is disgusting n a lie.
Should be banned every where. You people are evil
"Really dont care about females rights to abortion,  because its not that you can't vote, but won't vote for your rights. Until you do, you don't deserve them."
I hear they are building a mayflower to sail across the great pond to get away from religion persecution.
"Why don't they do something about the root cause - the reckless f****g!

In this day and age, there is simply zero excuse for an unintended pregnancy.
Wrap that rascal. Snug panties. Just say ""No!"" A solid punch to that horn dog's throat.

Terminating a pregnancy should be so onerous that couples will think twice about doing the dirty deed.
LoL^10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Abortions should be free. Cheaper for the state than unwanted children they can't afford or parent.

But if you still have one walk into any Starbucks, there will be a free clinic in back.
When you leave you will be sterile, there will be no repeat and certainly no three-peat.
And we will hunt down the dumb SOB that contributed and fix his junk, too!!"
every time a democrat fights for more rights.. they end up losing more then they gain.. hey dems.. stop shooting yourself in the foot while trying to win a sack race..lol  just about every state gave WOMEN 15 weeks to decide to abort or raise the kid.. you challenged for more  now you got nun.. when ya gonna learn
"Hay Lindsey G, here's your people in the streets."
Fun fact the democrats  have already taken away everybody’s Medical Rights bye forcing injections into peoples bodies with out consent Democrats just passed a law a gun bill that strips away the second amendment from the constitution so Democrats have already started taking away and stripping away fundamental constitutional rights from every single American citizen and we the people are allowing this to happen and we don’t have the courage to stand up against Joe Biden and his tyrannical administration.
Impeach the Supreme Court Judges!!! NOW.
STAY OUT OF MY BODY. The govt didn’t have say on the moment of conception(unless they were peeking). It’s None of its business.
Must be hard to live in a country that takes backward steps on large issues.
"Overturning R vs. W will cost the GOP just as much, if not MORE than 45's ""indiscretions"". 😈👍"
"the overturning of roe vs wade was a political choice by republican lawmakers to help their party get religious zealots on board to vote for their party during the mid term elections.  think about it.  the timing isn't just random.  whether these justices are religious zealots thou isn't an argument i am going to get into now.   what is a religious zealot?  well in my opinion its a person who has a faith and that faith dictates their lives... and they attempt to force others to comply with their beliefs by any means necessary... whether it be changing the laws, mobs, all the way upto death squads and such.  they do not believe others who do not follow their ideas or their faith have the right to exist.  and by their actions others of faiths with anything in common with them, will be forced to help them or face their wrath.  and that is how you get anyone who is religious to get in line and support the zealots...  fear and the desire just to survive take prestant, to fit in, even if these ideas are not your own.   so ya in my opinion... roe vs wade being overturned is a means to buy religious folks compliance to the zealots, and to force the population to follow the ideas of the zealots.   either the population acts or it lays back and accepts these religious zealots rule.  which has only just begun.... next it will be public schools, science, medicine, the list is endless... but attacks have already started on every front.... people fight back and hopefully it will be enough to retain our democracy and not fall back to being pre constitution days."
"Everything happens for a reason. I believe this is happening because it's damaging republicons reputation to the point where even die-hard supporters are saying they're voting blue this year, effectively removing the GQP's power over us one election at a time"
"I hope that every woman that has been denied medical assistance and has suffered for it , sues every pro abortion government."
"Everyone needs to plan ahead and make sure these cheaters have not purged you from the Voter registration list.  We all need to plan ahead and know where, when and how we are voting this November.  They have passed a ton of Voter suppression laws all over the country.  We gotta do our homework well in advance.  There are fewer drop boxes for ballots to be dropped off at. You may no longer be eligible to vote by mail so check now.  They have closed and or consolidated many precincts to make the wait time to vote in person prohibitive in minority areas.  The maga klan (red hats) will be out trying to intimate voters.  Some of them have run off the usual poll workers so that they can intimidate, misinform or discourage voters that might not vote for mara-lardo.  We should all expect obstacles and be ready to overcome them quickly.  Know who's running and what policies they stand for and against. Vote against the fasci-publicans or we will loose even more of our rights and freedoms.  These crazies will make Handmaid's Tale An American Documentary if we give them a fraction of a chance."
Living in NC near the border. Still wanting SC money for it. We go for fireworks they come for abortions. Crazy.
I cry for all the women who will die because their right to safe care has been taken away. Too many women will die when we could have helped save them. I live in Texas and I’m terrified of having a complicated pregnancy now.
Overturning Roe was a beautiful thing!
If a man is against abortion they need to be sterilized meaning a operation
I’m a democrat but am against pro choice
Biden was against abortion in 2006 I only support that version
Land of the free...
I'm so happy I live in Kansas. I think this is the most my state has ever been in the news!
"ABORTIONS ARE NOT TAKEN AWAY, THE QUESTION OF ABORTIONS WAS PUT BACK TO THE STATES WHERE IS SHOULD HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
ABORTION IS NOT BIRTH CONTROL"
"Abortion needs to be legal again, it's a woman's body and her choice. Unless she has an abortion to spite someone like her husband or wife. While we are on the topic, circumcision should be made illegal, his body his choice."
Blessed be...
It's about the total ban of abortion for me. No exemptions is a fking joke.
"Can we Ban MSNBC, FOX, CNN. The Biggest Virus is the Media."
"See some people think that abortion is a religious thing and some believe it's killing of a life, but it still is a woman's right. Now women have to walk around with dead bodies floating around inside of them. This is not the old dark witch doctor days, but it seems the right far right religious nuts want us to do. Everybody don't live by God every word."
"I am so ashamed to say I am a Texan. Abbott, Cruz and crew are HORRIBLE human beings and even worse for Texans."
I registered to vote this year specifically for abortion. I will be voting from now on.
"What if we just remove government social programs that pay for women's contraceptive and reproductive health bills.

 women want the government involved to pay their reproductive health bills, but then they go around saying I don't want the government to touch my body it's my choice.
The biggest problem women face today is thier own stupidity, and utter lack of perspective."
"Some will be happy that babies wont be killed, some will be angry that babies wont be killed."
"15 percent of pregnancies end up in a miscarriage. Women have known this but legislators do not. These bans will affect women choosing to get pregnant, because the risks are too high."
GOP Christofascists are the American Taliban. Forcing women to give birth is just a start for them.
"Women's rights being taken away are just the beginning. The GOP plans to take more rights away from many different groups. The GOP say the Democrats want all your guns, not true they only want to ban weapons of war being sold to 18 year olds."
Beto 💙💙💙
Texas VIOLATION OF THE PREGNANCY ACT!!!
"When children lose their mother due to a complication during pregnancy, I hope the fathers get worthwhile help from their pastors.  Jesus wanted your mom to die just doesn't seem that helpful."
"99 years?  Premeditated murder carries a life sentence, usually only 15-20 years depending on circumstances.  These people are waaay out of line."
Where and when is the next march?
We should either take away the penalty for doctors for making the wrong call or also put in a law that prosecutes doctors for delaying life saving treatment
America gives more rights to corpses than living women 🙄
Texas is terrible
"This has worked just as well as banning alcohol, or drugs. Complete and utter failure."
"2 sides to everything.  If the state can force a pregnancy they could one day force abortion.  It's already done in China.  
The state shouldn't decide."
Those who take life will answer to God. All of this evil increase is just getting us closer to end times & Jesus' return.
"Does this mean we're gonna have organized groups that secretly provide adequate medical care for women, similar to people that were supping up their cars to evade police for alcohol running and eventually become the first Nascar drivers, drug cartels in Mexico, the underground railroad?"
IF THEY DNT WANT TO HAVE A BABY THEY NEED TO USE A CONDOM N THEY WONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HAVING A BABY JUST USE A CONDOM
"Democrats should use abortion, booms banning and other things to get support from both side to win this midterm"
"I Am an Example of Women that morally had NO ""Right"" to have Children. Zero. 
My children would have become burden on the State."
It's ridiculous that a corpse has more bodily autonomy rights than a living person.
"Conservatives: babies having babies, that's hot.(strokes m16)"
easy to pass laws . . . but the consequences????? . . . these right wingers are clueless
"Can a conservative please explain to me why you don’t want to save a dying mother, therefore her baby will also die? I’m so confused. Or why you want a woman to die over an etopic pregnancy, which is never viable?"
"The court that did this are bonkers, causing extreme unnecessary suffering for an already vulnerable population.
Poor women.  Government is bonkers.  Anyone who enforces this persecution of women (doctors, police, lawyers, etc) are guilty too."
Dump patriarchy
Sorry but if your going to make us wear a mask then screw you then the unborn deserves to be have life at anytime
I love to see the strength of women!
"The loudest group is almost never the most popular group. This is why we all must vote and vote for the candidate or issue that you really support, not just vote to be on the winning team. The quiet dont need to necessarily protest in the street, just actually exercise their vote."
"India is with republicans and Trump, protect the child!! 🇮🇳🇮🇳💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾"
"By banning Abortions, they thought that it meant just ""stopping"" abortions!! Now they're seeing that it's so much more than that."
Abortion is murder.Thank you Almighty God that Roe vs Wade was finally overturned!❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Vote the anti-abortion jerks out.
Texas LUL she’s my cousin I seen her first! Go Murica
Why is nobody talking about NOT get pregnant in the first place? Other than extreme situations.   The pill is free and there is the morning after pill.
"Just wait til the people see the private water tanker hooked up to the Jackson Mississippi GOVERNORS MANSION while the 150,000 people have no clean, safe running water. Its way past time to eat the rich before its too late."
"Fortunately, none of these people were aborted and have lives and freedom to protest."
ABORTIONS is MURDER the INSIDES RIGHTS or Don't get Pregnant Simple as that.
People are welcome to move out of the state you're in to a place that is better for you. I'm planning and preparing to leave mine already. Is it quick and easy? No. Its not impossible.
Black is the dominant color. Lol if we as black men impregnate a bunch of white women I promise those white males will change the abortion law so fast your head will spin. Lol I'll do my part 🤣🤦‍♂️
"America had a high maternal death rate before Roe was overturned.  Now its just going to get higher.  No one would be okay with being told ""sorry cant treat your failing kidneys until your kidneys have completely stopped functioning, just go home and come back when they've completely failed. Youll smell a rotting smell that'll make you gag.  Sepsis sorry the law told me I cant treat you until they are dead and rotting inside of you.""  So why are we okay with telling folks they gotta wait for their unviable child's heart to stop beating. And come back once its actually dead inside of them, when the child would have died shortly once labor starts or exit the womb anyway?"
Why don't you stop the false narrative. The supreme court handed it to the states and people to decide.  Fake news and the Democrats and nuts are causing chaos and should be ashamed their doing it.
"Yup, babies get to live"
If you can’t trust me with a choice. How can you trust me with a child?? 👀😐
This is similar to Brexit. A lot of people voted without really understanding how they would be affected. Then suddenly... 😳
How can the United States hope to lead the world in important issues when they are busy fighting over problems that belong in the dark ages?
The democrats were in power and they did not sought this out.
"Shame on these lawmakers for not thinking of WOMEN’S HEALTH, and only thinking of their own selfish religious beliefs. Whatever happened to separation of church and state? Maybe we need to ban vasectomies, and make it a felony for doctors who perform them? I GUARANTEE it would never happen, because it involves MEN."
They is the devil they know the world overpopulated but the devil wants a war
Conservatives should be the first to complain against abortion restrictions since they don't want government to be involved in their lives as little as possible.
"*The Republicans have created all of these problems that we are suffering from in our country right now! They have done this to try to trick American voters into voting for Republicans!*
*Every American voter needs to understand that Democrats are NOT to blame for inflation, high gas prices, rising crime, or any of the other problems the Republicans are blaming them for!*
*The Republicans DESPERATELY want American voters to be totally distracted and confused about the absolutely most important things to vote on! That's why Republicans are doing this!*
*Just vote Democrat all the way up and down the ballot, in the midterms, and in 2024! If you do this, and the Democrats control the country, all our problems will start to go away! Trust this!*"
"Here's the secret... *Every single bill and law the Republicans vote on is deliberately harmful to the American people in some way either directly or indirectly! And this is NOT an accident!*
*The Republicans do not have any policy or any intention of ever helping the ordinary average American citizen! The only way they can succeed is if they make Democrats look bad!*
*Americans need to realize that the only people who actually care about you are the Democrats! You must have faith that the Democrats are the good guys! You need to VOTE DEMOCRAT!*
*The Republicans want Americans to think that the Democrats are doing the wrong things so that American voters will vote for Republicans! This is the biggest mistake you will EVER make!*"
"OH I KNOW THIS ONE, it's barbaric.  That's what it means.  There is a reason most of the world offers abortion one way or another.  It's because when you don't allow abortions to be performed,  women die for no reason.  We have the technology to save them and we aren't using it based on the decision of a few judges that weren't elected.  They were appointed by a president who didn't win the popular vote.  Based on the preference of a minority of deranged religious fanatics.  A loud, caustic minority, but still a minority."
"Women do you think it is time to take to show we have power. Now is the time to fight.
This must be much bigger then my time of burning bras.
We never kept it going equal pay for the same work.
Why is it these men feel they have the right to a woman's health.
Who was the republican sob who wanted AS PART OF A BILL EXCLUDING AGE WHICH WOULD MEAN HE COULD MARRY A CHILD.
IF THERE IS A GOD THANK YOU FOR GIVI G WISDOM TO CATCH IT EXPOSE him for the predator he is and what wanted fing children."
If it’s your body your choice then why were people being threatened to be fired from their jobs if they didn’t get vaccinated? It’s the principle of the matter. My body my choice. Not to mention all the people who are dealing with the side effects of getting vaccinated. They won’t even publicize that. Our principles are “not your body and it’s not your choice”. That’s what we should stick to. So too bad
"I'm so glad we have put a stop to the wholesale slaughter of babies!!! Yeah, I said it!"
"0:02 TANGENT! WOW, face filter much? Does she really think no one can tell she's using a face filter? 😆"
Pretty sad when it's better legally for a doctor to let a woman die or become maimed by her pregnancy than to help her and give her the care she needs to maintain her life and health.
Why aren't OB-GYN doctors fleeing Texas? Why aren't pediatricians fleeing Texas? Why aren't women fleeing Texas?
they didn't ban abortion if dems hadn't promoted same day as birth abortions  then supream court wouldn't t have made that decision until Ms turned it into genicidal .murderof infants that's the reason they did this left it with states pluss pregnant teen sarearesultof leftist minoratracted persons
"About half of children in the United States (40 million) are now insured through Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)  the vast majority in Medicaid. 
54% of child support ordered by the courts goes unpaid so tax payers pick up the tab.
We should put a Human Services Dept on every corner there was an abortion clinic so women can enroll in all the entitlement programs possible in their state and federal programs. 
Every poor woman is entitled to WIC, Welfare, Medicaid, Public Housing, Free Day care, Phones. and internet.🤔"
So glad I don’t live in the US. What a joke!
"Abortion is a woman's choice across the majority of the world.
The US constitution has been amended 27 times and it's easy to amend as abortion law.
Americans are like Taliban men who pretend they can dictate what women should do. Land of freedom?"
I am SO confused. 99 years for necessary health care while they fight for cops to have the right to murder. Can a Republican please respond and explain to me why a potential life is so much more valuable than a living one?
"Nickson Started a political war on drugs. Reagan made it a real war will laws. Clinton provided the prisons  and militarized police.
 
Politicians use abortion right for political gain. Nationalist made it a real issue. State's are providing laws and the same militarized police.  

Curious, Do history repeats itself?"
"I grew up hearing horror stories about the aftermath of back ally abortions. Of ""Doctors"" using the equivalent of a coat hanger to pop the placenta. Of women hemorrhaging and ultimately needing a hysterectomy in order to survive. The fact that the country took away necessary medical procedures based on religious beliefs is an affront to the very constitution. The freedom to believe/practice a religion or even to not believe in religions. 
The fact that only now people are realizing the toll that their close mindedness is  causing is as tragic as it is selfish."
"Choice is about letting the person have the freedom to choose.  Why are religious people so adamant about dictating over other people’s choices?  You don’t agree with abortion, then you don’t get one.  But who gives you the right to determine another person’s choice?"
"Your Body, MY CHOICE!"
This is really heartbreaking
Just get married and have children like granda ma did. What?
"Yea, we never asked for it the supreme court did it entirely against our will but go off."
"The simple solution to this would be to make Americans who want to force women to give birth, pay for the cost of raising those children. Medical bills, food, shelter, and education should be paid solely by Americans wanting to ban abortions. Take responsibility and put your money where your mouth is."
Let the voters decide. WOMEN bodies are not to be controlled by 🦽 🧓🦼🧓 men telling them what can or can't do about their body. What's next. Bare foot and pregnant. It ain't happening. Millions of women in 🇺🇲 can't and won't be controlled like their PUPPETS
These people have no idea what our bodies do.

I simply don’t understand why women are allowed to vote in the USA.
These people want to make sure their position is very clear: The lives of women mean nothing to the white men who have control of all laws.

Yes. People realize that murdering babies is evil.
Texas AG shouldn't be fighting emergency abortions.
"Laws need to be clearer so that doctors know what they can and cannot do. Removing a dead fetus should be legal, of course. But banning abortion is still good."
Banning abortion with some exceptions is good policy. Enforce the law as a deterrent to reduce abortions. Keep your legs shut if you don't want a kid.
anyone that is against abortion should have been aborted
VOTE!
Most Arrogant/Irresponsible/Deranged/Delusional Step America has ever taken
Ridiculous that politicians and insurance companies decide on what kind of care we will get.
it's obvious that the majority of Americans prefer blah blah blah than actual social justice for all.
Just call abortion right guns rights
You want abortions? Allow fathers to have a right to deny paying child support. It takes 2 to make a baby but you crazies only want the woman to have a say so. Why should you have 100% say so in killing an unborn child if the father wants that child. That’s not equality that you clowns scream you want!
"Being forced to have children is more important than gas prices. ​ ​ the traditional birth control that contains estrogen strings the clitoris volume by half. They’re castrated. Only the mini pills w only progesterone is the one that doesn’t completely ruins women. ​ ​. This is not a male issue. the fetus is not viable up to at least week 26, it’s not killed bc it’s not live yet, take it out and the tissue has  no possibility in any way with all the money and medical help in the word to survive, it’s not alive yet, so this is only about controlling females. Women need their clithead rubbed to get off, that does not take more than 5 min or longer than men=sex education, the angle of the dickrod need to rub the clithead while thrusting, that’s it, we all get off and live happily ever after. I’m just posting it here cause it’s like people don’t know these  basic things in the US. A law just passed forcing all men to have vasectomies, that makes u feel a way, that pain is what women are feeling now. I am an MD."
The GOP is an enemy of the people.
"lol, see the power of inertial mass"
The biggest unintended consequence is that doctors will choose to not go into obstetrics because of the insurance. All of these babies PL is OBSESSED about will not have proper doctors. And women will still get abortions because as long as you can get pills through the mail it’ll continue and you cannot stop it. So all of this and you’re not saving lives like you think.
"The Republican Party is the Party of ""NO"". Their only Agenda is to defend a fascist criminal, Donald J Trump.  Democrats put people first over party.
It's a no brainer people."
Trump and the horrible justices he seated should be arrested because the agonies that they have initiated against women and their access to healthcare should be considered criminal.
Trump's  SCOTUS made zygotes more important than women. Rapists have more rights.   This is the what Republicans believe. Vote democratic if you want any democracy left
It’s called life happens!!! Abortion means murder!
"Exactly that is what emergency care is. An emergency is some thing that happens that must be treated or it could result in deformity, lose of lame, permanently damaged health, or death. 
Normally if a woman is pregnant she has an obgyn. If she comes into the ED her doctor would be notified, because that doctor has already been to care for the woman until her child is born. So it wouldn't be some unknown,to the case, ED doctor but her own doctor. So it isn't like some women is just thrown to the wind. Well it might be if the woman wasn't getting pre-natal care, but that is different level of stupid. 
People like the woman in this video who base their argument on hysterical emotionalism are no help to anyone."
"Women, and girls, in the USA are fkd."
The Hippocratic oath is more sacred than that of the Bible
If you didn't see this coming you are truly ignorant. If you are a woman and didn't see this coming you should be ashamed of yourself.
this is fake news. disinformation.
"There's more supporters for access to abortion then there ever were for Benedict Donald.

Let that sink in."
"Too bad you're numbers are no where near what you claim. You will lose, just so you know. Now."

best news ever stop killing babys
I completely support abortion even know You actually are killing a baby. 👏🏻👏🏻

"If you're a young woman in Texas, good luck."
Most voters are morons. It's a terrible idea to put such important policy in the commoner's hands.
"Ben Franklin anonymously published ""The Poor Planter's Physician"" in Virginia in 1727. It was a guide to living in the colonies without aid of doctors to treat a variety of things. In it, there is a section to treat the ""suppression of courses"". Entry states that it was an affliction to mostly unmarried women and included a recipe for a treatment used by the Greeks for contraception and termination. Where are the historians calling out these idiots using the founding against women?"
Leave women alone and neuter these men
And these said people that are going to get voted for who are running for congress Etc what's going to stop them from lying just like the Supreme Court justices?
Just another example of how the GOP crazies hate women. They hate everything that doesn't look like them walk like them talk like them or agree with them. Question I have is who died and made them think they are God? I don't think any of these Bible Thumpers actually read the Bible! What happened to God's free will? And isn't this between me and my judge... god?
Texas should go independent … problem solved.
Public Service Announcement: Don't feed the Bots in the comment section.
I am sick of people trying to control women's rights.
"Abortion is health care issue,  if it were not for religious influence we would not be having a debate about it"
"Yall think this will be expensive? Wait till the ""college bailout"" charges hit our wallets."
"Christine = most hateful group 

Hate and discriminate anyone with a different view from theirs.  They use the name of Jesus to hate."
"Irresponsible abortion legislation will lead to the deaths of mothers, the lengthened suffering of terminally underdeveloped infants, increased number of children suffering in the foster care system, and increased crime including murder. Abortion, unlike murder, is nothing but healthy for society and can only be painted as evil by arbitrary moral or religious arguments. I don't really care about personal morals about abortion, mothers should have a right to get an abortion just as much as mothers have a right to not get an abortion. At the end of they day it's the mother who has to live with any sins, society bears no responsibility for her actions."
"Unfortunately, as someone who lives in a country where abortion is illegal, it is very hard to show actual evidence to those people who are fervently against it.
They will celebrate when a woman dies in a backlash abortion, they will demonize her and call her death justice.
And as the many comments showed here: they will deny the examples of women suffering from the repercutiam of these laws, they will say those examples don’t exist, minimize it and say their suffering is justified.

It is sad how good humans are to demonize and remove the humanity of actual living people. Those things are easy to do when you don’t view women as humans anymore"
America's really going backwards and so many people are trying to fight forward towards a better future.
We should start suing every politician that has voted for this.
The world is laughing at you..
"Am I glad I don't live in the US, if it turns out that I'm incapable of carrying a baby to full term because I'm too sick, I at least get to live and to adopt and care for all the babies and older children me and my partner want."
It was such an insanely stupid and short-sighted decision to overturn Roe.
"Seperation of church and state, self autonomy and revamp the supreme court..."
"I feel like even women didn’t really appreciate abortions until now. Based on what I’ve seen on social media and online, this is probably the first bad thing to happen to them collectively in years. They’ve had a nice run and now people are starting to actually think about where all this is getting us. Low birth rates low marriage rates. No one needs a man. So why tf do I care? They aren’t having babies with guys like me. So why tf do I care?"
Republicans are clowns🤡 they just like controlling people
"just saying, there was a reason why we okayed it in the 1970s a time when the nation was (by admission of todays opponents of it) was much more moral and grounded. if even they knew it was something we needed to allow, than why cant we figure it out? we just have to see for ourselves. and this is the problem with people who cant move forward, they forget all the bad things of their glorified past"
This backfired for the Republicans beautifully.
Prohibition will always cause trouble.
I don't know why anyone would listen to this old woman with purple hair.
Both sides are wrong on this. Abortion is not about cleaning a woman's womb after a fetal death. Abortion is killing a fully functional baby in the womb. It is asinine to say it is only the woman's decision.
"I hate abortions, but the fact is, they're necessary.  What we will see happening more and more are, dead or abandoned babies left in boxes, garbage cans, side of the road, and in parks, because people cannot provide for them.  You think the cost of abortions were high, just think of the cost of court cases will be, and the cost of finding homes for these abandoned kids. by the way, God hates those who turn their backs on the needy."
Pro Life people have created a religious tyranny.  They never meant to help women with unwanted pregnancy.  SCOTUS is nothing but a religious extremist court.  All GOP and conservatives that voted for extremists laws banning abortions need to be voted out.
"I think the G.O.P. now stands for something like ""Gruppen ObersterFuhrer Partei"""
It took 8weeks for all this to happen… I
"For every woman who dies from not be able to get care during a pregnancy where they could die from complications, the governor of Texas and those who banned abortion should all be held accountable and prosecuted for each death."
"there should always be an evidentiary test for any ban or law.  it should be unconstitutional to take away any right without that.  just as assault weapons bans have no basis in evidence to show effectiveness, banning abortion has only emotional arguments; it is utterly stupid to ban either.   there are better solutions for both."
"abortion isnt banned you twits, its just up to the states"
Poor women being forced to have unwanted children is going to lead to a huge increase in the crime rate in red states fifteen years from now.
Kudos to corporations like Walmart that are providing transportation and time off to its employees seeking abortions.
The president this country elected put justices in the supreme court. And now they don't like what they've done? Oopsie!
"She's talking about extremism! 🤣😂🤣. These clowns are so unhappy they can't go on killing babies, boo hoo! 😭🥺😭. I guess they don't call killing babies extreme; just another sign of the degradation of our country and all the values it holds dear… I'll bet when their children get married and then get pregnant they don't hold fetus showers; but I wonder why not, after all it's just a clump of cells… they should hold “clump of cells” parties for the unborn! 😁😆😂🤣😂😁"
"All the cope in the comment section, because women can’t sleep with deranged drug dealing psychopaths and murderous, godless degenerates anymore without true consequence.

Who would have thought holding women accountable for who they sleep with would bring so many tears. Lmao let’s go Brandon."
TRUMP 🇺🇲 stopped Hillary Clinton from becoming a USA president...Trump  gave us  ( 3 ) excellent Supreme Court judges  in one term 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
All this because a bunch of delusional cultists have convinced themselves that zygotes are people.
"Im a religiouly conserative person but I dont agree with this at all.  These people are forcing their religious beliefs on others.  I am happy to resectfully explain why someone should not end a life and the biblical reasons for it,  If they dont agree thats up to them and their conscience.  but I dont feel like forcing it on someone without there consent is right at all.   what if the reverse was true,  what if they ban religion because they did not agree with it.  forcing them to be secular, How would these people feel then?  God is our judge, not humans.  Stay out of other peoples lives if they dont want you there."
"Don’t let these Republicans make you (women) into a “Handmaid”….  That is what the Supreme Court see you as (JUST A BABY FACTORY) and not a human….

REMEMBER REMEMBER NOVEMBER ROEVEMBER!!!"
"Regardless of how you feel about abortion, the bottom line is if you’re not the one who is pregnant then it’s none of your business. It’s that simple. If you’re against abortion, for what ever reason, then don’t get a abortion. 🇺🇸🗳 Vote in November"
"The government needs to differentiate  between an abortion and a life threatening circumstance. Getting treatment if the mother or baby would 100% die or if the baby is already dead is NOT an abortion, and these lawmakers need to guarantee that right to health care. Other then that specific circumstance, then yes ban all abortion"
"Get out of Texas now, younger women leave while you can."
Vote blue!  Stay safe.
"I can hardly believe how stupid Americans are. Even if I support the ideology, I can't possibly think that the law with no exception is ok. They will rather let their women die then end their pregnancy...if a woman is dead the child in her womb is also dead, makes no sense whatsoever. This is insane situation. No exception to protect the health and life of the women sounds like a dystopian novel coming true."
Pro-lifers who care for the unborn while hating people who breathe.
Crazy religious zealots have caused this ban on abortion to happen. Religion  poisons everything. You have to be really stupid to let religion  guide any decision.
These laws about medical necessity are so vague. Medical practitioners are delaying lifesaving medical care because they don't want to risk going to prison for life. Poor women are disproportionately affected by these laws. This is despicable and there are likely dictatorships that have more sensible abortion policies.
Or why idealism is moronic.
If no one goes out and votes then the right doesn't care. Keep that in mind.
"Republicans will now have to provide. Provide healthcare, provide whatever it takes to raise a child, provide for what the ""father"" refuses to do, provide for the ignorance and disdain Republicans have for their fellow Americans. That's going to take a lot of money states won't have. Republicans really know how to screw up their own country. There's nothing like it you can see in other advanced and industrialized countries. US conservatives are the worst curse that has ever happened to this country."
"SUPREME COURT NEEDS TO PUT BACK ""ROE V WADE""

HOW CAN CITIZENS BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE LAWS IF THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER ITS LEGAL OR ILLEGAL BASED ON CONSTANT CHANGE OF IT..."
Its hard for me understand how other women going along with this abortions laws.
Who knows! Next they'll be wanting to bring back coporal punishment in the schools! Oh...

"America got what it deserved when it put special interests above the people. It's easy to blame Republicans, but Democrats are just as much to blame. Lunatic Trump would have been cast aside like the joke he is if his opponent wasn't Hillary Clinton. This stupid choice doomed the country."
"Remind Republicans of this error years later. 
""Hey. Remember that failed experiment where you banned abortion in red states and it had dumb consequences?"""
"Abortion is a life-altering event that will affect a woman for the rest of her life whether she has one or not. She will have to live the consequences all of her life. I would not want to trust a Politician to make such a decision for me. I am quite capable of making my own decisions, thank you very much. Perhaps the voters need to elect new State Legislators who will accept the advice of a Licensed, Trained Physician rather than some Fascist who wants to take away a woman's right to direct her own life."
There is no reason women should not have power over their body especially how society says men can treat them.
"Abortion is killing a human, alive baby in the womb."
"Republicans are out in force out voting the Democratic Party. We saw this in the primaries where the majority of Trump supporting candidates won. If we want to see a change, Democrats have to get their butts out there and vote. I just don’t know if they will."
"enough out in the streets to fight maga Civil War.  Lock him up, lock him up."
"Nah, it hasn't even come close to showing the true ramifications of these bans.  Wait about 2-6 years, when all those forced kids are now taking moms out of employment, because they can't find or afford child care.  Wait for the social safety nets to really strain at the seams, for Welfare, SNAP, WIC, subsidized housing, smart start, school free lunch, and health care.  Wait for Ob/Gyns to flee states where bans are in place, and women who WANT to have babies can't find doctors to deliver them.  Wait until those forced birth kids become school age, and everyone's taxes go way up to provide for their education. 

Most of us never wanted to see huge numbers of abortions.  But there are much better ways to fix the problem.  This is nothing but a final failure in a long list of failures."
"The women in federal, state, and local government, as well as the Supreme Court judges that implemented this nonsense, threw half the population under the bus."
"Umm, we already knew what criminalizing abortion does.  It kills women who most often are already mothers, leaves children without their mom and families without a loved one. Have we so quickly forgotten the image of the young mother killed by her married lover when he tried to play surgeon in a motel room and left her to die alone as she bled out. Ms. Magazine published that photo."
Excellent!!!!
"These male lawmakers really haven’t thought this thru.  Pretty soon some of them will be in a disastrous lose-lose situation.  How long before one of their daughters has a life threatening pregnancy?  It already sounds like a woman has to be in great jeopardy for a hospital to treat her.  If that happens to a law-maker they have two terrible choices.  Run the risk of using your influence to run interference contrary to the laws and risk having the press find out, or having your daughter die.  In the first scenario the daughter will be inundated by the press and all those families who lost their daughters in that circumstance.  In the second she will lose her life.  You can bet in both scenarios that he will be cast out of his family by his wife and all the other women in his life. His political career will be over bc he will either cause a huge firestorm by being a hypocrite, or he will be the guy who let his daughter die.  Chew on that."

"The desire, the will, the goal is to never have a loss of life BEFORE ITS NATURAL FAIT. But reality is that we as humans have not evolved to that point, as yet, and as unfeeling as it may appear abortions come under that category. You have to look at the human condition as a whole. You cannot separate abortions into a different category. Politicians have twisted and used abortion purely as a political tool. The day we evolve and there are no more unnecessary loss of life is the day when we don’t have to bring laws to stop abortions. That day will happen, but not as yet."
"First off NO UTERUS NO SAY SO, oh yes, secondly thirdly etc."

Mandatory vasectomies.  Stop abortion at the source.
Texas is ran by Bible thumpers.
"Women. Stop sleeping with losers.  You abort when they don't want you and/or the baby.  Use your power, make choices before he dumps on you."
"There are so many children ALREADY in ""the system"" (e.g., foster care) and so many children ALREADY that are in homes where they are unwanted and often abused....it boggles my mind to see how this will be exacerbated. That's who I think of - the children who aren't in homes where they are loved and wanted. I don't think of the people who are pushing their own agenda and telling women, ""I care about you""? Do they really? I'm wondering if they care about anyone but themselves. They're clueless about what's going on in the world around them and most likely have never had to work with an abused or neglected child; it's heart wrenching. Let's ACTUALLY care about each other."
"99 years in prison?
That is ridiculous and republicans need to go ."
This guy really asked for the “silver lining”
Murdering an infant should not be allowed.
Blacklist Season 7 Episode 7
"Ya'll are so dramatic, and nonsensical. Medical procedures are not your right🙄. They were developed/invented. And now it's simply discontinued."
"Their is a path forward for women and that is voting. You have to ask yourself if your a republicans, democratic, independent or a child of God and your body is yours.  VOTE"
"""Man, those guys in Texas are extreme. We're impressed!!!"" --The Taliban"
All due to the US’s own Taliban.
"I was horrified when Roe was over turned.  Abortion won't go away, it will go under ground and women will die, like they did prior to the 1970s.  Women are now suffering because doctors are no longer allowed to logical calls!!  The Supreme Court has made women second class citizens!!"
Banning abortion would create more Maga Republicans so of course the right wants to put a stop to it
"If I was in charge,  I wouldn't have allowed travel for an abortion. Make those people in States with illegal abortion vote the elected officials out. If you elect those people you should have to live by their rules"
Think of all those babies saved.
Shame on all mother effing Republicans!!!
"So much bad information on this video. Do your own research. Abortion is illegal in Texas. Treatment for miscarriages,  ectopic pregnancies are not illegal in Texas. The confusion comes from the doctors."
"I’d be curious to know what plans are being made to care for all the unwanted babies that will be born next year?
Are the anti-abortion states prepared to house, feed & give the babies medical care for years to come?
No-one seems to be addressing that issue..."
"Technology changed in the blink of an eye
yet her legs are stil up in the sky
while the nurse tells her to 
slide down lower
and the doctor holds his 
vacuum like it's a damned hoover

It takes a seed and his came by the thousands and it's her who they want to send to prison because she's free
but not really and it's her body but not really
so she can't drive and she can't vote and high school's feels like a damned joke
but here she's got a doctor's note,
and she is holding her doll
with her belly starts to poke

it's not your fault, baby girl
and it shouldn't be your burden to carry
when his sentence is to force you to marry
 your abuser and the state
will accuse her
 because it's her body
but not really and it's her right 
Don't be petty
 when his seed comes by the thousand and he still gets to walk freely.

She watches witch burnings on tv
and she hides in the alley not wanting to be seen
a hanger in one hand and a needle in the other
she's not ready to be anyone's mother
and it's her life but not really
it's her body don't be petty
he held her down like so many others
it's his seed one in thousands
Must she die to save her child
who will care for the millions
he walks the street feeling cocky
claims his innocent like it's his destiny

he walks into the office he claims his seat at the table
he lives his life like Cane met Able
it's his seed one in thousands
he feels no shame and no restraint

so who is trapped in this economy
when all the world loves new technology
should she bear society's hypocracy
when it's her body but not really"
America is going in the wrong direction after abortion ban.
Vote blue in November  so we can codify  roe v wade
"As per your headline…. The REAL meaning is that innocent babies will be born and not murdered. In the meantime keep your pants zipped guys, and your legs crossed gals. It has worked for centuries!"
"Understand this, the Bible is a fictional book…FICTIONAL! Everyone has a right to turn to which ever Faith they so choose if they choose to, but it has no place in the rules of modern society. If the Bible was used to make laws a father would be allowed to murder his children if they dishonored him and if his wife cheated on him or disrespected him she could be stoned to death or murdered by her husband. These are not concepts that should be applied to laws and rights of a modern society, not to mention that in this country we have freedom of religion which means that the ideas in the Bible are not the beliefs of the majority of people on this earth, they’re not even the majority of people in this country. That book of children’s stories does not mean you get to tell every single woman what she can and cannot do with her body, or allow her to die because you miss read or misinterpreted a fictional story to suit your own needs. If you think that an abortion goes against the teachings of the Bible and goes against God… then don’t f@*king get one! That is where your contribution to your faith begins and ends. Keep it in church and not in our hospitals or our courts. Oh every Bible thumper is as bad as every other religious extremist, that’s why they’re called beliefs because you choose to believe that they have no place in a modern society."
"It's not banning abortion, it's TAKING RIGHTS AWAY, that's what it is, and sensible Americans do not want a political party that is living in the dark ages to be in power."
What ever happened to using ways to prevent pregnancy?WHY are there so many unwanted pregnancy happening?
"Another consequence of the abortion ban is all the unwanted babies who will be born,  and an increase in the number of people on welfare.  And they will mostly be minorities, which the ""pro life"" people hate, so they should have thought this through more clearly."
"So they are banning abortion on a state and federal level but don’t medical students learn how to perform a DNC in the case of a miscarriage? If the procedure is taught it is for a reason and I’m going to assume that reason is to preserve vital life…what the federal government needs to concern themselves with is the homeless pandemic, hunger pandemic, gasoline pandemic, social media pandemic, because COVID blew the lid off of the real issues that aren’t being dealt with and making abortion illegal isn’t going to solve homelessness, hunger, or any of the other thousands of issues this country has. Banning abortion but doing nothing about the foster care system in place in America…I mean make it make sense!!"
They didn't ban abortion.  The SC made the logical decision that abortion was not in the Constitution and sent it back to the states.
"That 56% number does not say what about abortion will be an important factor.  ""I'll vote for anyone who will promise to make abortion legal"" and ""I will vote for anyone who will make sure abortion keeps being illegal"" both trigger that ""Abortion will be an important factor."" The 56% number means NOTHING."
Map is wrong.
I see this as a problem of Politicians letting their feelings determine their policies.  Religion and state are supposed to be separate right?  So why do we let all these political leaders stand on religious platforms and not call them out on it.  Religious zealotry should be something that makes it harder for you to become a politician not easier.
"Teach your children empathy, folks"
"So what?

Stop killing children.

Is that sinking in yet?"
The Supreme Court is going down the Donald Trump road of crimes. With Trump in office there won't a need for a Supreme Court.
"This has nothing to do with ethics of abortion, never did. This is goverment enforced breeding and mandatory delivery laws, as well as direct assault on people's medical safety regardless of the aspect of pregnancy alone. It's yet another decision over people's lives, actual existing living people. It will hurt wanted pregnancies and the safety of the wanted children and especially mothers way more than it will ever restrict the alleged harm of abortion itself. Once again, America, if you keep telling yourself you are the ""leaders of the free world"", start leading in example and not showing the rest of us the worst case scenario. Alternatively, mandatory vasectomies could be beneficial, in the meantime at least, just an idea since you're making people's medical decision for them now."
"Women of America, you outnumber men - if every women voted for abortion rights, it would be a slam dunk, especially when there is a large number of men who agree. USE YOUR VOTE TO VOTE FOR YOUR RIGHTS !"
"Just stop no one is buying the bs, We know when an abortion is right and when it is wrong. Stop playing games you trying to make it so that everyone can do it for no reason other than ""I don't want too"" "
America is going back to a Neanderthal Age🤯
"I guess I need to avoid having a kid and putting my wife at risk. This is sad, and I live in Texas"
"I’m a 73 year old Catholic… abortion would not be my choice if it wasn’t a necessary pregnancy.  That being said, each and every person & situation are different and NO ONE  should be told what to do.  That decision is between the woman, her doctor, and her creator."
"Biology is way messier than the average ignorant christian thinks. In their heads, every sperm+egg results in a perfect baby."
"Expontaneaus Miscarriage is not same as abortion. A miscarriage as painful as it is you are not going to bleed to dye in most of the cases. (Thank God, now Drs have to explain why the miscarriage occurs or if was poison)
Abortion is not a woman family planing thing ..but very irresponsable medical options if it is. Abortion is destructive,mutilating, killing,against humanity,.(specie). dreams,future... Etc"
Wonder if Abbot would send along some women wanting or needing abortions with his migrant busses?
"to Samual Flores"" for some reason I am being blocked from responding directly to you. Start with Exodus 22. God ordered the sacrifice of every firstborn male child as well as the firstborn of every clean animal. The firstborn human could be redeemed by replacing the baby with a lamb. Or by the payment of 5 shekels to a priest. That is why Jesus is called the lamb of god because he redeemed the sins of man by his sacrifice. there are a few verses dealing with this. God also said that humans were no better than the beasts of the field, just more arrogant."
"Monsters can't control us woman, we are not animals nor their slave's.🚩🏳️‍🌈"
GOP were projecting bigly when they complained about Obama's imaginary Death Panels!
"America is now in decline due to the combination of half the population being uneducated as well as religious zealots, a perfect storm. 

For years Republicans have chipped away not only on Abortion rights but also democracy itself. And now you’re seeing those factors come to fruition effecting America’s standing as a whole. Hence the US is in decline, it’s turning into Gilead from the Handmaid’s Tale."
"Ladies you need to vote these creatures out of existence or they will just keep coming back and you'll have to deal with them again, give the Democrats the numbers they need to put Roe v Wade into law. Everyone needs to vote, they need to win the House and Senate with enough seats to get things done."
Why do Americans  die  when the Republican Talaban is in charge????????????????
Banning abortions is so dangerous…so many things could go wrong
"As someone who saw the abortion stories in the news in the 70s, I'm expecting we will see a lot more stories given social media."
"None of the men involved in passing those laws have mothers, daughters, or wives they love. Clearly. Disgusting"
"As the old saying goes, ""people tend to not appreciate what they have until it's gone""."
It's so stupid.  Women will get abortions.  Abortion in our state is protected by the law in our state.  Women are travelling here to get abortions.  There is more to terminating a pregnancy than an unwanted one.  So many medical reasons.
"the same people who melt down at the thought of government-mandated vaccines and masks that SAVE lives want government-mandated pregnancies, births, and maternal deaths. go figure. seriously, folks--let's teach EMPATHY, especially to republicans."
I don't want to hear any republicans complain about this.
Dark Brandon will abort the republican agenda.
"Anti abortion is a terrific way to make sure the poor get poorer. And the people who are anti abortion are the same people who want to end social security, ssdi, and other means of helping people to thrive. Dictators know that if a population has to struggle to put food on the table, a roof over their head, and clothes on their backs they won't have enough energy to protest the regime that's in power. North Korea is a great example of this."
ROEVEMBER!  VOTE BLUE!
A bunch of baby killers.. REPENT!
"You know who else wants more children? RUSSIA. 

WOMEN SHOULD DO WHATEVER THEY WANT."
you have the right to choose what you want to do with your body but that baby inside you doesn’t have the right to live cuz the baby can't talk on cam neither protest on the road.
"Republicans on Covid: My body, no vaccine, not mask.
Republicans on abortions: Not your body, not your descision."
This is what happens when you awaken the sleeping Giant The sideline voter
Imagine the irony of the women who supported these laws dying from miscarriages because they can't get medical help.
"I think the reason this is an issue is because people think it's murder.  It's not about women's rights.  There is no consensus on when life begins and those for abortion feel life doesn't begin until the fetus can survive outside the womb.  Those against abortion feel life begins at conception.  You have to resolve that before there is a chance at resolving this whole issue - not that it will really.  But, if there is law that states life doesn't begin until (blank) there will always be this stance."
Well Let’s HOPE this inspires the democrats !!
Why am I not allowed to post in comments?
"I don't think it's the act of abortion per se, it is the government telling women what they can do and not do with their own bodies."
"Lol, YOU elected these old azz rapists. Eat that pie."
Well the good news is getting dragged into a global war will bring y’all’s domestic focus on such nonsense as abortion issue into appropriate priority. I’m sure the Russia/China/Iran alliance is enjoying the destruction from within the US. Makes their takeover of the Western world so much easier. And they won’t give a rats a$$ what pronoun you prefer in the encampments either
"I am 78 yrs. old and don't like even thinking about abortion, but it is a woman's private life.  It's a woman's decision to make.  If you don't like abortion, then don't get one.  What others do is none of our business!"
"The Republican politicos that pushed the anti-abortion movement in the first place, never took ""pro-life"" rhetoric all that seriously, as we are seeing: abortion in the US still exists and is available, if you are willing or able to pay for it.   It was all about dividing the working class vote."
All the protesters that know one wants to have children with
"Taking away womens rights and endangering womens and girls lives is NOT democracy or American, THIS IS FASCISM. It must be stopped."
Republicans already lost the November vote with women coming to vote in masses.
"The ""Abortion is murder,"" rhetoric is a red herring. I don't care if the fetus is curing cancer or writing poetry, it doesn't get to use another's body without their permission, in the same way you don't get to take my kidney just because you need one."
"This is what FASCISM LOOKS LIKE. Texas is controlled by FASCIST, the GOP has become a FASCIST DICTATORSHIP CULT & MAGA DOMESTIC TERRORIST."
Abortion is not murder. A fetus is not a person. It's just a blob of cells. A fetus is not worthy of having rights since it's not sentient nor does it have emotions
Extremism is murdering babies.
From the outside - it’s hard to feel sorry for American women when they vote radical conservative policies! They have a choice! Elections have consequences- how’s that working for you!
"It's abysmal that rule of law and democracy in the USA have become fragile and vulnerable as they are under attacks by domestic terrorists in the shape and form of the so-called Republican Party. The world is watching the syndromes of the American Experiment degenerating into chaos, anarchy and threats unleashed by Fascist elements against democratic and Federal Government institutions and Public Civil Servants within the USA! The rot and stench of a Republican Party turned Fascist is there for all to see. The Orwellian spectacle is ominous. The world is watching Gibbon's Decline of the West."
None of your business. It's a woman's body her choice period.
It is really about women getting access to reproductive health care. Republicans don't seem to care about health care services. Funny how Republicans are NOT emphasing changing abortion laws.
How did the supreme court get taken over by the American taliban?
GET OUT AND VOTE! Period!
"All baby killers or anyone that facilitates the murder of a baby should get the death penalty.
Eye for an eye."
"Oh now people are seeing what happens when women can‘t abort. People sure don‘t like to remember the past huh. Like, it‘s in textbooks and even on the internet how it was in the early 90‘s for women who had unwanted/dangerous pregnancies."
"Greg Abbott and other governors are taking medical decisions without medical licenses. What's the consequence of that? Can anyone practice medicine without license and with no medical schooling and training? 
Looks like it's possible in US"
"My self or you self,   True or falless?????"
Say1 Say2 How is it enough for you???????
There are call state of USA?

I don’t understand why there even needs to be a law for or against abortion. It’s a medical decision that a person and their doctor make and under HIPPA they have the right to keep that private. It’s no one else’s business period.
"Can we sell Texas to Mexico, then they wouldn't have to waste money on a wall!!!!!!!!!!"
"Unfortunately there is a population shortage crisis happening. This could be the government's decision to grow the population. Unfortunately I've always been against abortion , thats my moral decision. I understand emergencies, also believe women can choose what they want done within their bodies. God will decide in the end who to address."
Well at least we can sell our nuclear codes to Russia! That's really all that matters. Who cares about women when we can sell our nations security?
Maga Reps: Vote for us and you will never have to choose again.
"The states that have banned abortion and made draconian laws have made it very risky for any OB/GYN to practice in their state. When women on either side of this issue are no longer able to find a doctor willing to manage their pregnancy, it will be too late. OB/GYN's will have moved to a safer state for them to practice and no political posturing, rhetoric or finger pointing will change the fact that their state is no longer a safe place to live for women and girls of childbearing age. Which I feel they've already done. Politicians have zero business making medical decisions or imposing religious beliefs on the citizens of their state."
"Let´s hope the logic and intelligent people understand to vote out the Republicans everywhere. There is nothing more damaging for a country than to have a Trump as President. He brings (un-understandable fear) among his party members. He makes them behave like headless puppies. Like Hitler, he has the power to blind the least gifted and poorest among the people. He has created his own SS. The Oath keepers are his troop's leaders. When Trump lies that the election was stolen, they believe him and storm the Capitol, end of story! Trump has tried to destroy Democracy in so many ways. Send him to jail today, use the document story if needed! But for me, his talk after losing the election, and before the storming of the Capitol, is in its self-evidence enough to put this Dev** behind bars until he dies."
"as a canadian, the rest of the world is losing all respect for the united states"
Imagine if the government stepped in and decided what men can and can’t do with their reproductive organs...
Long live babies!
This is a consequence of religion...
Hai re hai  poor ppl...
"Women have had control over their bodies FOR MILLENNIA. We don't need Roe or any man's laws. We will control our own reproduction, regardless. Abortion will continue because women's lives depend on it. Don't like it? TS"
Women go vote blue save your uterus
"Abortion is murder, and murder is bad."
"What's next? Will they find a loophole to eliminate our right to vote?  Are women going to lose the right to own property?  Will we once again become enslaved to others?  These are all legitimate questions. I am willing to die to prevent this from ever happening again. I only wish there are others willing to stand with me. It's time to fight for our rights, before they take them all away."
Give us back our right to choose.
Never forget that the Democrats want to murder babies -- even after birth.  They've said so.  Remember that extremism when you go to the ballot box.
"Some people care, but most of the Republicans don't give an f about anyone but themselves,  and only know suffering when it effects them personally."
Funny how I’m being censored on here a bunch of baby killers
Babies live!
"Americans rave on about being active in fighting for their rights and how politically aware they are but that is all BS. They don’t have a clue. While they vote Republican their rights will reduce. If you want more rights, vote in Democrats into every post. Stop banning and burning books. Stop using GodFilla to fill holes in your knowledge. Check your beliefs, your word definitions, and demand proof of whatever people claim to be facts. If you had checked Trump’s claims, you would have found nearly all of it was BS."
We need to rise up and get rid of the fascists in our government who are out here making insane decisions. Replace the entire house and senate
"Remove them from Office, no more! I'm sick of this obscurantism."
"Women want to roll the dice as many times as they like without ever losing and want patted on the back when they are finally satisfied.....you don't deserve a pat on the back, what you deserve google won't allow me to say.....it's very similar to what those babies you like to call ""mistakes"" experienced, difference is, you will have earned it."
They will never starve they will eat  each other.
Smart people will not risk a pregnancy. Republicans you have stop population growth in America.
"Baby killers take all the respect or reverence away from ""good mothers""."
"So, I just have one question. How come you all make this about the woman's right to choose to end the pregnancy or not, then these same people turn around and say that you have no choice whether or not to take a vaccine or not? Take the shot and shut up, if you don't you are shamed and ridiculed for making the obvious and right decision."
I didn't realise the GOP took their public health policy from the Taliban...
Doctors need to stop providing medical services to Republican elected officials
Republicans are the bane of humanity
Too bad they weren’t aborted.. so ironic.
Roe roe roe your vote blue..... No republican vote until they understand who is in command... We the people....!!
Pro-Choice is the only choice in the US. The Democrats are the real Pro-Choice Party. Vote Blue in 2022.
"Dropping Roe was literally the worst thing Republicans could have done, and now they're trying to bring back assaulting children in schools with bats.  Way to really fire up your opponents ya morons."
What makes the people banning abortion any different than serial killers whose motives is because they hate women and want to remove as many people as possible from voting?
"Just ignore all those ignorant people who believe a fetus is a baby. 10 week old fetus is only 1-3 centimeters long, call that a baby again lol. Put that fetus in someone's food and they won't even notice it."
"They want to ""protect all life"" so they will let the women die. Forced birth is NOT protecting Life. These laws must be changed and given back to the doctors and the women involved. This GOP insanity must end before more women, girls or even ten year old children die. Criminalizing pregnancy is NOT ""protecting life."" What is wrong with these people who voted to do this?"
The GOP is a cult enough said!!!
Well its hard to see or hear  the people who got aborted...
No bans on AR15s or abortions.
"The desire, the will, the goal is to never have another abortion. The same goes for any other loss of life. BUT, we don’t live in a perfect world and death occurs all around us. Therefore abortions are required. The same as executions and wars are required. You cannot have it both ways. To pick on women this way is wrong when THE FAULT LIES WITH ALL OF US IN THIS IIMPERFECT WORLD."
One dumb country 🙄
Vote BLUE problem solved
This is why you commentators will never know power.
"Ironically it will be conservative women who will ultimately return us to some level of sanity with regard to abortion and bodily autonomy, bit by the predictable consequences of their own rhetoric. It's already happening."
Well then men should not be allowed to be treated for  prostate cancer or erectile dysfunctions.
“We hold these truths to be self evident….” Except for defenseless unborns.
Vote vote vote for life not the insane
"This is mid evil torture to have lawmakers change laws when we the people are going to work and are paying taxes. Stop trying to get us to believe in a fake false Illusion. This is absolutely absurd and barbaric to deny tax payer their rights is disgraceful distasteful, unconstitutional, inhumane and unacceptable."
There is no changing the Supreme Court's mind. A crisis situation is a very small percentage of abortions. North Carolina will be put in its place.  She is lying through her teeth and he doesn't care.
We need to be vigilant in everything. There not gonna stop there. They’re gonna strip people from every facet of their rights while still calling this country the greatest country where your free and have opportunities. I wonder when we’ll decide to just say enough is enough. They’re pushing and pushing and eventually everything is going to go belly up at some point. Control seems to be the objective. There are too many laws within bylaws to even keep up with that I’m sure people are breaking them without even knowing.
You can aways see the baby murders in politics.  Just listen to this old bag
"Remember that when there is a new law put to a vote that limits your right,  and when  others don't like or feel the need for that right they'll vote against you. And pretty soon everyone is going to loose their freedom. Really think it throu ✌️"
"Just like when they tried to ban alcohol, Prohibition!"
Come to California and we will happily get rid of your bad choices. You can take monkey pox back for free.
The Republican leaders don’t care how many women and girls they hurt or take the lives of with this. They need to be voted out.
Religion should play no part in politics. It does nothing but cause harm. Religious people should never push their religion on other people. What about those women that don't believe in your god? Why should they not get to choose?
"How effing political for the liberal media to leave out the following:

Embryo - an unborn or unhatched offspring in the process of development, in particular a human offspring during the period from approximately the second to the eighth week after fertilization (after which it is usually termed a fetus).

Fetus - an offspring of a human or other mammal in the stages of prenatal development that follow the embryo stage (in humans taken as beginning eight weeks after conception)."
"Indiana didn't get a chance to vote.  Our supposed lawmakers voted for us.  At least they had the grace not to claim it was the will of the people.  They know that if they had given the voters choice, it would have been another Kansas, or even a greater margin for freedom of choice.  I woulod tell you what I think of our lawmakers, but YouTube would block the comment."
"Didn't GOD destroy Sodom and Gomora according to christians. How many innocent fetuses died in that little operation? In fact if you believe that event then what about the flood, how many innocent fetus's died in that ""world event"". GOD wasn't worried too much about that, was he ...??? I can start hearing the double standards or host of other weird logic ready to burst."
Roevember….vote!
"Better wake up White Republican Women! You sat quietly while your men has  screwed over every one else! Now it's your turn! How does it feel? He wants you bare foot and pregnant with a house full of kids, so he can feel Superior and not become a minority in this country!!"
Anti-abortionists always wanted people to die.
Funny the ones screaming loudest about abortion are the ones least likely to get pregnant
NO UTERUS = NO OPINION
Crusty old white men who know absolutely NOTHING about a. Being a woman. B. Being pregnant. C. Giving birth. D. Caring for a child. Yet these crusty old dinosaurs are making LAWS on ALL these issues which they know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT. Absolutely mind boggling.
It's going to require a Constitutional Amendment to set this straight once and for all.
"The Republicans are about to reap the Whirlwind, serves them right"
"Ban viagra, also"
I never thought we would see Taliban Mentality take a hold of the Largest Democratic Nation in the world. America is no longer a democracy. Old White Republican Males will have women in Burkhas next. Christians and Wealthy people are self centred people.
These people make it sound that EVERY woman that gets pregnant will want to abort it and if their state bans Abortion. Maybe they should be looking at less invasive forms of contraception than ripping a baby from their womb because they couldn’t control their sexuality
"We are going to see increasing instances of girls and women dying from pregnancy complications because doctors and health care systems in general are too afraid of or too hamstrung by anti-abortion laws to provide timely care.
You know, just like we did before Roe V. Wade's decision. We have completely forgotten the horrible things that just suddenly didn't happen anymore once the decision to terminate a pregnancy became the domain of the pregnant person and their team of medical professionals."
"A dead corpse has more rights. 
You can not use any parts of the body of a newly deceased corpse, to help another person stay alive, without strict legal permission - given pre-death ""organ donor permission"" - from that now dead corpse.
So a dead corpse has more say over what happens to their body, then a women does."
Pregnant women need to move out of state until they give birth or they might die.  Even cats die giving birth.   It is not simple.  Men are stupid idiots.   Women need to be in office to protect pregnant women from death.
Give it time. Republicans will start blaming Democrats for not stopping them when they (Republicans) started stripping rights away. They will never accept responsibility for their bad decisions.
"These laws these abortion laws and the penalties are unreasonable unwanted and unconstitutional to even be on the books they should immediately be expunged never to be repeated again and automatically we ought to put roe v Wade back into effect and make it a law proactively 
The supreme Court is fixed it is a primarily conservative supreme Court and that's not fair and I think that rovie wage will be overturned in time but I'm I'm really starting to think that these Republicans need to be taken out of office and never be allowed to go back in"
This is why the fascists don't want us voting. When we vote we negate their agenda.
Women need to change this in November! Do they have power or not? Let's see if they listen to old white men or if they call their own shots.
Okay you can still get abortions it's up to your state okay nobody is going to ban abortions it's just they're saying you can't have an abortion when the baby is fully developed and if you think that's okay then you were inhuman
The USA is a nation of religious violence. No wonder Christian USA created Islamic fascism. They are one and the same.
Lives to be lost that will never be conceived because getting pregnant is too scary now
Some extreme legislators what to impose travel bands on their citizens trying to control what their citizens may do in other states.  Insanity.
"I love all the comments about “VOTE” or “vote blue” etc… good luck with that!
No amount of voting blue will change the discourse in the US, it won’t get the church out of your life or out of your body.
Not when there’s political hay to be made by subjecting the masses to such inhuman conditions. 
If only there was some other option besides R or D but it’s a 2 party system… both full to the brim with people that are the same age, old, the same color and basically the same insane views. Here’s a shocker for ya… none of them care about you at all, at most you are simply a vote in their eyes.
Can’t we all just enjoy the descent into decline?"
im glad i live in the uk where for now sanity prevails and abortion is easily attained
"If 1 shoots and kills a pregnant woman, double murder. Even if she had an abortion scheduled for later that day.  Sup with that?"
"yes, their androgynous god Moloch is displeased and demands the infant sacrifices continue"
"Register and vote, ladies. Register and vote, vote, vote. FANTASTIC that women will be the ones who finally squash the arrogant, overreaching, authoritarian GOP."
It seems that the Texas Taliban cares more about their ideology than women's lives.
"Keep in mind that this is about power. Keeping women pregnant when they are not doing well, or don't want to be pregnant should be up to her. Vote. Vote for women's rights."
Our abortion is more liberal than China or Europe. You talk about abortion like it's some walk in the park.  It's a mom sitting in a bed with strangers that come in and remove a baby. Now people are fine with doing it late term? Or after.. I see society just wants conveniences rather than morality. The fear of God is no longer in style. It's selfish society that terms their own rules. What's next.  Msnbc you are so wreched. God will and is protecting these children. He has stepped in bc he heard the blood that is crying out for justice. Moms that have abortions don't walk out and have an ice cream afterwards.. if they do then their conscience is seared
"I was born in Soviet Union. USA is quickly becoming like Soviet Union. There was provision is criminal code, due to which non-traditional sexual orientation was punishable by 5 years in prison. I had been arrested there for being Autistic. USA is getting there. When it does, I will leave. I do not need another Soviet Union experience. Those republicans that shame communists ARE communists."
Should be banned. Killing babies is not a good thing. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY is a good thing.
"Surely every thinking human being is anti abortion.
no young woman or their mother ever sets a goal to have x number of abortions 
by the age of 30."
I find it ironic those who support Abortion are already born .
women will vote republicans out  Roman Emperors each and every one
"America are always shouting about free speech, free Will, a Women should be able to do whatever she wants with her body, I mean this is going mental, their are over 100 genders(supposed) now, the world has gone mad, I'm just happy in ma wee house in beautiful Scotland 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🍀"
Love that this woman is filing lawsuits on behalf of women’s healthcare in abortion. Women are being treated like we are controlled ….by the Taliban!
This is all a bunch of manure and riddled with lies. .Anything to protect sexual immorality.  .
Roevember is coming and it’s going to be HUGE!!
Ooh Jesus. Look at all those baby killers
"January 6 the supreme court.. why not, you'll be patriots according to GOPers."
I agree it should be your choice to opt out of pregnancy whether it's for personal reasons or medical reasons....your life not mine who am I to judge. I can only make my own choices not others but I dont get that option because I'm a male whose opinion doesn't count just like every male in this debate because ladies made it clear its THIER BODY the only thing I can do is make sure my DNA stays in my body lest someone besides myself uses it against me
One good thing about Trump is that he exposed how stupid the Republican party really is.
"Judges made it dangerous to get pregnant or be pregnant!! Good way to slow population growth then destroy Social Security because less people paying towards it. I see that shell game !! They also harmed/destroyed Privacy Rights, doctors oath and safe practices, HIPPA law, besides destroying Constitutional Rights and Women's Rights...all in  one judgement call by rogue Judges builds Authoritarian culture and also races a 2 party system towards anarchy. They all need to be charged treason and obstructing our Constitution."
Things could happen...get rid of those Judges  now! Lock them up for harming women!! They LOST credibility. They are dangerous and biased and merging religious belief and destroying Rights. Can't wait until they decide to destroy more Rights.
"It's not to early to get stickers, yard signs, and t-shirts for November that read: ROE ROE ROE YOUR VOTE.  Get that message out in every community,"
We need to execute all these right wing terrorists trying to destroy the country.
All that is forced into having the baby should just give it to the state once the state gets the thousands of babies they will figure out it's to expensive to raise these kids until they are 18 then they may change their minds
"As Meidas Touch T-shirts say, ""Roe, Roe, Roe your vote!"""
"Abortion is just the present day Prohibition, pushed by religious people to try to make society better and more “moral”. What they don’t seem to realize is that it will play out exactly like Prohibition. People going to jail, being killed, cartels that control the product will rise and thrive, everything except actually getting rid of the product they are seeking to ban."
"If Texas were to jail all the doctors and women that they want to jail, it wouldn't work too well.  For varied reasons."
It’s not just about abortion. It’s personal freedom without Big Brother intervening.
"Theres a procedure that is used post abortion but also stops bleeding. Dr will let u bleed bc they fear the procedure being reported as an abortion. That means sepsis, death, or blood need. Banning birth control also is an issue. Ppl use b. control as a meds to cut pain due to other Med cond."
We particularly don’t want old saggy white men telling us how to run our personal health rights.
"Meanwhile, in the country that officially hates women.... 🙃"
That's good no more murder of babies
It means whores are out in droves...
If you call your self a Christian you must be mad to be among this woman.♥️
So the children of God is among this woman that is absolutely madness
"What it really Means is, far less Babies being Murdered by their Mothers! End of Story"
Don’t forget to sign the Petition to impeach Clarence Thomas!!
When all this happened I really didn't have any input one way or another! I could have never conceived the notion this could effect me or my love ones. I have a young family member who is married and they were trying to conceive.They did and we as a family were elated! They were 14 weeks and went for a ultrasound and they couldn't find the baby's heartbeat. They ran all types of test and imaging. Ultimately they had a  miscarriage. It's been two weeks and the doctors are trying to figure out how to proceed because the process of removing or anything is treading on the lines of abortion. I don't understand how because there is no longer a heartbeat. Why should a woman have to be subjected to the mental anguish of this situation? How do you move forward? I'm really confused on who this helps? One size does not fit all!
"I'm pro life and choice, but you need to know your choice, you child will likely be 'named', if aborted their spirits live on and are likely to spiritually and typically sexually enslaved by people running the clinics, and people running Msnbnbc, ze Vanderbourgh 😭"
"If you don’t believe in abortion, then don’t have one. Do not dictate to me what I can or can’t do with my body.I will deal with my soul on my own."
"If people were not getting abortions 'just because' I doubt this ban would have happened. Imo this is a reset. No abortion and then slowly lift restrictions so that we all agree on when its acceptable. Saw a woman post a video a year ago about her being 7 months pregnant, her bf left her, so she nonchalantly was going to get an abortion and start over with someone that wants to stay with them.

Why not just save up the carcasses of the entities that are removed from women and pile them up in a public area. Just leave them all out in the sun to rot. Let the pile grow and then if anyone wants an abortion they need to go and see that pile and sign off that they are OK tossing their own lump of cells onto it."
"Pure propaganda democrats... what about inflation, the illegals, what is democrats plan for that! Trump 2024"
When the Democratic party hangs it's hat on abortion --killing your own for convenience - that is sick to see us fall this far ..
"A so-called principle of right to ""life"" for a foetus should never be upheld and enforced over the rights and desires of human beings who are real living. beings.   Since this has happened, women are made slaves or otherwise held captive to their wombs.  The whole issue is so clearly religious.   Church and state should be separate.  I don't transgress your boundaries by insisting you abide by my religious beliefs.  You don't transgress my boundaries by insisting I abide by your religious beliefs  This is how we agree to disagree and still get along in society.  We agree not to turn our religious beliefs into political issues."
"I would love it if someone conducted a research survey on who and how many ‘objectors’ have had abortions in their families. This is the same with religious zealots, they spew God and violate every religious doctrine when it suites them. The hypocrisy is dripping from these people."
Over turning roe v wade shows the American people which party is really trying to take our rights and freedoms.
Oh look! Sexual promiscuity has checks and balances now for women the same way family court checked deadbeat dads. Live with your decisions unless it is from sexual abuse
"If you are a republican woman you should stay silent if you are angry about this for obvious reasons. 
To the rest of women when it comes to abortion…welcome to equality. Men had no choice financially even if he did not want the child. 
Women now have to live with their sexual promiscuity.
Sounds like equal treatment to me"
"People should wait until they get married and have a home established.   Then have children. This would solve many problems.  I can understand what some of the comments below are saying.  People would like to be loved and not feel alone in the bedroom.  They want to end the suffering. Condoms and birth control pills are the thing now.   

It really fires me up when I see Democrats using this abortion ruling by the U.S. Supreme court as a tool to attack Republicans so they can win in the 2022 midterm election.  I believe Chief Justice John Roberts has a hand in this.  I think Democrats got a hold of John Roberts and got him to put the abortion up for a vote.  Then when the other 5 republican judges voted for it.  John Roberts voted against it and said, "" It is not my fault because I voted against it'.   Even though it was John Roberts that put it up for a vote."
"""Republicans can't tell voters they represent very rich people& corporations so they have to use these cultural issues.""☠️ Noam Chomsky"
"""Texas"" & other like minded individuals/conglomerates don't care if the mom dies. An orphan under the right circumstances is easier to manipulate and exert an agenda upon.  That's good for them in the long wrong. Easier to brain wash ""Texans"" y companions to their point of view.  It's a long game...a long con if you will. It's effective. Look at any close minded group over time & you'll hopefully be able to see that. To All Good Souls,...thoughts, actions, & deeds matter in the long run. That is all. Carry on."
"Only person who should have any kind of say on a womans abortion, is her husband. But he can’t have veto power. Just “hey, can we talk?” Power."
Dear Dimwits. Don't blame the Supreme Court for something they should not have been involved in to start with. Go to the State Legislatures if you want change. BUT FIRST DECIDE WHAT THE LAW SHOULD BE! It's difficult to accomplish when you aren't sure what you want.
This is so wrong I mean these poor transwomen have lost access to safe and secure abortions
Assassinate the judges that did this
"Good old Texas.  It's been said that the state is purple, but the government in Texas is so vulgarly red and in bed with the Evangelicals."
"The USA cannot be considered as representative  of democracy, future mindedness and leaders of the world. The USA can be considered as an Apartheid state that actively and wilfully promotes intolerance, ignorance and irrationality."
You people are evil. No response necessary.
"I have never voted before, it felt pointless. I've already registered to vote, and will vote from this upcoming election onward. Religious conservatism needs to be removed."
Not exactly reassuring there’s so many baby killers out there.
"South Carolina, Republican state Representative Neal Collins recently said he is reconsidering his support of his state’s so-called fetal heartbeat bill:  ""That weighs on me. I voted for that bill. These are affecting people.”  Why, yes, women are people.  Thanks for figuring that out."

Trump2024
MSNBC is an abortion of journalism.
GOP is a death cult
"So giving states the power to allow people to choose is wrong. For over 40 years people didn’t have a choice. These democrats lie and inflate the numbers to scare people. Why do democrats want so much control over children? Abortion,schools,and raising of them."
"Yes, people are seeing what it means to ban abortion. It means: MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS. IT MEANS ABORTION IS NOT BIRTH CONTROL, AND IT MEANS MORE HUMANS ( ESPECIALLY BLACK BABIES) CAN LIVE."
this is a reason why religion should have no place in court decisions and even political arenas especially since texas and a few other states abortion ban laws pretty much proves our point on how far they can go by trying to shove their religion down peoples throats especially wen it comes to trying to control a womens body.
Looks like your tying to make people think there are masses of people but it’s a small percentage
It’s funny how you spread false information
"No, we are seeing just how much they want to MURDER FULL TERM BABIES!"
Put every wanted child on the steps of the Supreme Court.
"The outro says it all, ""this is who we are"" baby killers"
"If you see what these republicans did to ban abortion it created so many more problems and now laws. They should’ve just leave it alone and let people make their own choices, these republicans created a problem for women’s rights and choices that didn’t need to be addressed"
"So, everyone needs to take note of this. This one issue should let ALL AMERICANS know that the Republicans want nothing more than to become DICTATORS if they come in to power in the future!!"
This is straight up an attack on women
Look leftists think SCOTUS is radical republicans think and has proven the FBI is biased and favors the left.
Child killers big mad
"Ladies, don't date Republicans,  they don't want you to make your own reproductive choices."
"If a woman get into any legal trouble because she’s getting or got an abortion, the the man who got her pregnant needs to face the same persecution.  She didn’t do this to herself and we all know how babies are made. 
Then again, the majority of these laws were passed by male officials. They would probably never think to to that.  Would probably never think a man should get in trouble for having a good time."
"My personal belief is that so much more could be done if we stopped saying ""abortion rights"" and actually call it what it really is; women's rights!"
"Is having our breasts removed due to cancer, also illegal?  They are part of our reproductive anatomy."
This bias anchor needs to be fired. How can his opinion of being better off before allowed to be on here.  Propaganda fake news
"Continue protesting, but OBEY THE LAW . Great job SCOTUS.  Thanks again RBG for sticking around long enough allowing this to happen. Your legacy will LIVE ON !!!!!!"
I don't like the republican vision for America.
"i like the ""NO CHOICE NO CHILDREN"". this would be worse than abortion if it came to play.  stupid law and justice would have real problem on their dirty hands. PEACE."
"Frankly, this is a good side effect of Roe v. Wade being overturned. Even RBG wanted this to happen--the voters will have to mobilize to protect their right to abortion and not depend on some unelected judges staying alive until they're replaced by similar-minded substitutes. That's a ridiculous way to preserve what ought to be a constitutional right. Now momentum will build over the next five years for the right to abortion to be enshrined in federal law passed by the U.S. Congress. Lots of work ahead, especially with mobilizing the huge pro-choice voter bloc. The best part, the anti-abortion forces now have to defend their radical, fringe notions at the ballot boxes. And it's not looking too hot for them outside the Deep South."
Voters need to vote out all these politicians and lawmakers that supported removing women's rights to have abortions and vote for lawmakers that support abortion
All this nonsense because the white Supremacist want to keep the white majority!
VOTE BLUE!!! Because we want our Freedom to Choose BACK!!!
Amazing how y'all ignore Hunter's laptop and Sleepy Joe's illegal business partners from Russia and China!
"""Reproductive rights""  is that the opposite of ""Production wrongs"" ???"
Somebody should tell some of these women that there are forms of birth control rather than abortion !
Let those who have an abortion experience the pain that baby in the womb goes through. Watch what is done to that baby.
"If you have to watch people actually suffer at the cost of your belief system, your belief system failed and you should no longer be affiliated with it."
"You baby killers and supporters have no right to point your fingers at anyone, criminal, murderer, rapists, nobody. Your the lowest of the low."
Been murdering kids for the last 50 years in the millions upon millions and now they are exposed and want to keep doing it. smh
Hopefully more republicans daughters and wives will die because of abortion banning. KARMA
"I really effin wish that so many people weren't so keen on the ""FO"" part of ""FAFO"". How can one rationalize letting one human die of sepsis because they were all for criminalizing a medical procedure? How can one make excuses for tormenting people with uteruses just because of ONE of the many after effects of sexual activity? 
And I bet, dollars to donuts,  just like the height of the Covid pandemic, there will still be yahoos clinging to the flag and their Bibles to soothe that ever encroaching feeling of desperation because their mother or sister or auntie or any other family member died because they couldn't access an abortion and didn't have the finances to travel to another state for one.
This is a human crisis."
I hope women (and the men who support them on this issue) really flex their political muscles and vote in force in the midterms so hopefully we can get the Women's Health Protection Act passed to insure a woman's reproductive rights NATIONWIDE. VOTE ALL BLUE IN '22!!! You go girl!
The land of the free. REALLY?
"Take away all your human rights starting from Banning Abortion! Maga ultimate goal is a white christian nationalist (KKK)Church Run Slavery system! Women, Minorities, and children are properties of KKK! Banning abortion so white men can make any women reproduce like life stock animals !"
All through history anything the government touches falls apart: housing railroads industry schools infrastructure farms natural resources health care etc etc the list goes on. Now people! Just let us all do what we do best. And you guys? Well I don’t know what you really do. Go somewhere and sleep I guess would be safe.
I’m a British man and what is being done to women’s rights in America disgusts me. If I could I would be voting blue with you.
"Don't try to stop the scum of the earth from killing their babies. CNN IS THE MOUTH PIECE FOR THE DEPRAVED. I got news ,you are about to see voices and protesters for the aborted babies of america  and who do you think  will be more  dedicated ,those acting to save lives or those trying to take them?"
"WE ALL ARE REACTING TO THIS DEADLY NEW VIRUS - THE MORONIC AGENT ORANGE PLAGUE. .

"If this doesn't start it, I don't know what will"
This is why Supreme Court anywhere can´t or allowed to be political or interfere with politics.
Roevember will hopefully be one to remember.
"Did the GOP have a meeting and say, ""How can we guarantee we lose the next election?"""
"All ""pro-lifers"" should have been aborted. The world would be a much better place.."
"Even if you are firmly and immovably Republican, tell you representative that you don’t want womens rights stripped away.
If you can’t do that, you are a horrible person and your god will judge you for every woman who dies from a failed pregnancy."
Again abortion isn’t banned just left up to the states as the 10th amendment clearly allows 🤦🏻‍♂️God how people can’t accept this and just vote people out who don’t support abortion is beyond me.
It means some innocent babies won’t be killed by some doctor who makes money off of killing babies
"oh poor satanic baby killers, dont want a baby, use birth control, better yet keep those legs closed"
"If these states are forcing women to have children, can the women sue the to state for the medical and care of the child until they’re adults?"
Religion makes you stupid.
"That's a mere drop in the bucket.
Compared to what you will see over gun control"
"Republican,women think it doesn't affect them,but they just wait and see,unless their rich."
"A comedian named Hofstetter once said ""There was a time that widows weren't allowed to get married. Then one day, a really hot woman's husband died. The everyone was like 'this is a stupid law'"". The only time politicians care is when it happens to them. George Carlin also commented on this saying ""It's a big club, and you and I are not in it. They don't care about you. At all. At all. At all. At all"". According to the DSM5, one of the hallmarks of sociopathy is that a person doesn't care who they hurt or how badly, so long as they get what they want, and history has shown sociopaths make great cult leaders, as shown by Manson. The Oracle in Matrix 1 also commented by saying ""What do men with power want? More power"". Sun Tzu predicted this also. When you back an enemy into a corner, it fights hard and recklessly, for it knows its at death's door.

Also I encourage you to look into the college prison experiment. It was ended after just days when the guards got too violent with the inmates. They were classmates doing an experiment on themselves!


So what do we do? Keep pushing. This tyranny is about to break. It won't go peacefully so be ready for that. But talking, marches, Tweeting, these will not work. No tyrant in human history has ever, ever gone quietly. Yes, voting is the least you can do, but in times of life and death, do EVERYTHING you can do."
"The longer I've lived the more weird and twisted I see USA. WTF does anyone has to say in women own body!? Crazy, crazy..."
"Republicans pretend to care about kids but also don't care when they get shot in a school, can't afford food, or are abused by one of their catholic priests. 

Conservatives are hypocrites and liars, and it isn't difficult to prove it."
"Maybe Greg Adams was correct , why all the illegal immigration ? Because they have babies, lots of babies. The government is all about that."
99 years for abortion?  Meanwhile you could murder several people and not serve 99 years.
Keep the government out of people’s personal decisions.
Pregnant women in Texas are being hunted like animals.
See who is extreme  and vote them out!
What madness.
So if you're trying to say that you can have an abortion all the way up to the ninth month you're all sick and need serious help.
"Vote blue! Get rid of Abbott,  get rid of his cronies! Vote!"
"Why are Americans moving backward? 
The rest of the world looks at America and we see stupidity, bigotry, racism and truly uneducated and horrible people!"
republicans have sealed their fate. the blue wave is coming
Giving states power back is not extreme.  It would be more viable to argue the opposite.   She dumb.
"It's not really about Abortion.  It's about Freedom, Privacy, and Choice.  How can the government tell an American citizen what they can or cannot do with their own body?  In this case the Women of America! That's unconstitutional, and Un-American."
Using the word “extremism” does not help. Life begins at conception. Period!
"There are forms of birth control and the majority of women (and all low income women) can get them for free.  They need to use birth control, abortion is not a form of birth control."
Something to think about pregnant lady gets murdered they go for a double murder charge? If it's just a clump of cells why double murder?
"I don’t think ppl who voted for banning abortions care. Too many of them aren’t impacted by it. Too many men don’t care how the women in their lives are impacted by this, and they’re not informed on women’s health issues."
"Dead women and children giving birth is the desired effects of these bans. The goal is, and has always been, for more white christian babies.
Christian nationalism is quite an old term. Anerican nazi sympathizers and Klansmen used the term proudly."
As A Canadian I find this unthinkable that the government can decide what I think. I am so glad to live in a truly free country in Canada.
Roe Wade never banned abortions..... it's now up to each state to decide what their abortion laws will be..... so this channel is basically lying to the uninformed
Maybe we need to put a personhood amendment for women. As in you are fully vested in the same personhood as men and therefore have the same right to bodily autonomy
Don't Murder Your Children.
How 'bout people keep their legs closed instead of creating babies just to kull them?
.... Woman have a choice... and it doesn't involve murder. pretty simple really.
The only  pregnant woman a man should be concerned about is his own.
Imagine a man that thinks another man's wifes body and her  health is their business. Men should not even have a say in this.
"This matter was settled decades ago. The USA has bigger problems, like preventing mass murder. It is mental health, the very stupid continue to try to bring us back to a time that never existed."
The Founders never put abortion in the Constitution: abortion has never been a Constitutionally-protected right! Why would the Founders have wanted to violate the rights of the unborn by allowing them to be murdered inside the womb?
"I find it interesting that the Republicans/Christians are die hard supporters of Israel, a country that provides 40,000 abortions annually. We provide aid to Israel, they have Healthcare. Question is why do republicans deny their own citizens?"
"I don’t want to pay your loans or for abortions. Your not gonna pay your loan, don’t take it.  Abortion: outlaw this inhumane practice. Narcissism run amuck."
It's not a ban it's the right of states to legislate a ban.  If you don't like it elect someone else who you favor.
"How about the politicians focus on the terrostic threats caused by Trump and clean up that mess? How about focusing on worrying about our national security How about climate control? Things that affect ALL citizens, themselves as well and quit trying to take women's rights away, banning books, deamening the LGBTQ community etc. None if that affects them, except maybe on the next election. Let's hope. We can turn this mess around with the right people in office. Vote Blue in 2022 and 2024. That's our only hope  otherwise welcome to communism!"
"Thank you for everything you do, Ms. Nancy. I love you. ❤️"
"America is becoming South America, with it's harsh abortion laws, that ironically ranks among those with the highest estimated frequency of abortions administered. Abortions will happen, laws do NOT reduce abortion."
"No question
Wait until the "" important women"" are not able to get their abortions or become septic.."
Why do Americans have to put their hands in the fire to see if its hot.
Sad 😞 NOOOOO LADYS U CAN NOT MURDER YOUR OWN BABYS ANYMORE!!! HALLELUJAH PRAISE JESUS
Not to the Christian taliban who want to control women.
That Roe was not codified is a failure of leadership. I'm a one issue voter and I ditched my Gop in Washington State in favor of the Candidate who was pro choice.
As far as I am concerned wherever women have voted Republican they must own the consequences of their vote!!!
"Complete idiocy! American legislators have not learned about history! They just need to look at the 18th amendment to the constitution created basically 100 years ago, only to be repealed about 25 years later!
Now they have the same crazy ideology in dictating women what they have to carry for the next nine months and raise for the rest of their lives based on a religious belief, just like way-back-when, even though the first amendment clearly states: 
*Congress **_shall_** make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.*
My grievance to the Government right now is their imposing on, and suppression of, the freedom of choice for women to do what they feel is right for them at the time.

_Murdock v. Pennsylvania (1943)_ *Plainly, a community may not suppress, or the state tax, the dissemination of views because they are unpopular, annoying or distasteful. If that device were ever sanctioned, there would have been forged a ready instrument for the suppression of the faith which any minority cherishes but which does not happen to be in favor. That would be a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.*

Today, people — both the public and the ones in power — lack the lessons of history and seem to have lost their sanity again. I fear for the future of our country in what it is becoming — in what it has already become."
Are you telling me no one was aware that the ban of abortion would increase the oppression of women? And people think I am mistaken when I preach the failings of our education system... SMH

"Remember: Christians set people on fire, threw acid on people, and assassinated doctors to bring all of this about."
Men and women both should be terrified about getting pregnant and getting a woman pregnant. 🤦🏾‍♀️
But abortion is just the start and not even nearly as bad as what the far right nazis will do to the rest of our rights.

"Let's be real. Americans are being agitated by American news again, as they always are, when a war is on.
It's obvious the Democrats are in control of this new Ukraine attack, another Viet Nam, and Washington,
as fronting for the Pentagon, is making it easy to keep that military activity going, the Republicans driving
American voters to the Democrats, making them look as legit as possible. Problems with abortions. Not."
"Well, when 10% of those miscarriages causes death or 50% of them causes permanent sterilization happens, we'll see whether the GOP realizes that blocking your own population from wanting to have babies is a good thing or not (hint: It's not. China has already proved it.)"
Time to vote out the  vile slime that think they can take our rights. Drive them back under their rocks where they belong.

"Forcing each State to codify and strengthen Abortion Rights, we will have Barrett, Kavanaugh, and Gorsuch to thank.  Let that notion consume them."
Next Republicans are removing birth control. They are at it allready.
DO you not believe in God. Anyone who is for abortion does not have one bit of compassion for Life itself. WHo cares right? Your living your life to it's fullest so it really doesn't matter huh. What if you were the one being aborted? God said I formed you by hand in the womb. If you do not want the child I suggest abstinence.
Praise God! Abortion is an abomination thank you Lord for this correction!

"Ladies it is cheaper to borrow money to go interstate to get back your right to decide, than it is to borrow money to allow a fetus to develop into a child you could not afford. 

What makes the supreme court think the state government is better qualified to make this decision on abortion for you. What does the state governments know about your circumstances, that you don't know yourself. 

From the Supreme Court:- Dear Mr Abbott you know better than all these women, so you decide if they can have a termination. (a crippled man in a wheel chair knows better???) I don't think so !"
I belive a corrupt Scotus has woken up a lot of people and will hand the democratic a  big win in the senate and the house. I believe 3  judges committed perjury under oath and should be impeached.

Boohoo
This is why Christian cultists don't want people to have their voices heard because they know that they won't get the ability to make women second class citizens when it comes to full autonomy over their own bodies.

"Maybe it's just me, but I seriously hope that everyone who voted to take away women's rights to choose for themselves, dies in an excruciating way. 

It's 2022, and we still have people using religion and egotism as a means to write laws for other people that they have no right to choose for. I've had more than my fill of it, and it's enough. 

The US was never great but this just adds extra anchors to an already sinking ship!"
An individual's rights will only be protected so long as it doesn't conflict with the State. Nothing could be more dangerous to a society.
Why abort?
This is an outstanding example of why the individual vote counts —-  taking away the power of choice from half of the US population — is outrageous —  particularly as a separation of Church and State matter which is a basic tenet of our democracy.
If you are going to ban abortion then why not make a law to get every man’s should have a vasectomy - it’s only fair😏. This really shouldn’t be a political issue because it’s ridiculous. Just study the problems Ireland have had with this topic!
"From outside America, I saw in you news, a lady whose foetus has no skull, yet she cannot abort. How medieval is that you dinosaur judges."
"When law becomes ruled by ignorance and religious zealotism. Certain things should stay separate.

Experts should be consulted before dumb decisions are made, especially concerning something like this."
There was never a “constitutional protection” to abortion. That is why the ruling was overturned.
Thanks Nancy!
If I didn't have abortion rights I'd have 3 kids instead of one because men didn't use condoms because I was on birth control.

"With this, usa takes one step back. In terms of women's rights. Freedom of rights. Where? It just got taken away by the gop. So trump commits crimes, he does not jail, but a doc can get jail for 99 years, if an abortion is done to save a life, ??????"
"With the country awash in guns, thanks to the Court, I wouldn't want to be a gutless doctor, especially in Texas. Just think about what is going to happen when someone's wife or daughter becomes disabled or dies because the doctor gives up power to the Republicans and refuses care to the woman.  It will be interesting."
If abortion rights were put to a vote in each state individually none of them would pass this rediculous abortion ban period. The Republiquanon domestic terrorists party know that & that is simply a fact.
Give this time some  woman related to these abortion haters will die cause of these crazy laws. Lets see how these gop nuts react when their daughter or wife or sisters dies when their pregnancy goes bad and an abortion would save them. It will happen at some point and it will show they are using this for votes not true belief.
I am disgusted that men in power can decide what a woman can do with her body.
NOTHING HATES like American Christian love.
"It's clear that more and more people have begun to realize that 'banning abortion' isn't just a fun little game, but is actually an action that has consequences that might effect THEMSELVES (or THEIR OWN loved ones.)"
"25% of all pregnancy self abort, usually early on but not always. That's why its customery to wait 6 to 8 weeks before even telling people you're pregnant.  What are you going to do about those abortions? Arrest God?"
We need to codify our rights and take interpretation out of the hands of the judiciary.
Republicans will still vote republican democrats will still vote democrat it wont matter for 90% of people.

"I, also, wonder what would happen if mandatory financial support levels were set: it takes two to tango but np one wants to be the men actually paying support for children that helped create.

Killing babies is EVIL!
The lesson from Dirty Dancing was never learnt.
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe."
"The worst results of anti-abortion are yet to happen once again. Wait until a woman dies from getting a back alley coat hanger abortion, then the worst results will have occurred again and the reason pro-abortion laws came about in the first place. Pro-abortion is not about protecting rights but protecting the life of the mother. What gets aborted is not much more than a parasite when it happens, a potential of being a person is fact but at that stage it is just a blob of cells leaching nourishment off the host.

Abortion and medical technology is also being held back, in the future right to life could be a thing of the past when it comes to abortions. Parasite removed from the host just like a standard abortion will still exist but the parasite will not be harmed but transplanted into a electronic/mechanical womb where it will gestate into a newborn baby. Newborn baby without the pain of being shoved through a vagina but a tank draining with the same butt slapping to cause the amniotic fluid expulsion from the lungs. Mother 7-8 months prior already put the child up for adoption, she just didn't need to birth it.

And point being right to life should also include allowing abortions, the focus of the movement should be on the technology not being able to save the parasite though it saves the mother. An artificial womb is not impossible."
Abortion was used by Republicans to get Christian votes.
just get vaxd
If a state is legally responsible for a banned abortion then the resulting child should be the legal responsibility of that state. All costs incurred until 18 years old

"Easy solution. Most if not all doctors have enough money in the bank to do without work for 3 to 5 years. A general walkout by doctors from hmos and private hospitals should turn the tide. The ball is in the doctor's court. The money running the hospitals in America has sufficient political clout to turn Supreme Court decisions upside down. 
America had ample opportunity to keep religion out of government, they failed and religion got the upper hand. That can be reversed, Christian Sharia has no place in America. If that is not so, then what we call Democracy is b*******, and the US Constitution is little more than toilet paper."
its funny how many people are pro murdering babies.  sad state we r in
You know who doesn't care? The majority of republican leaders and the majority of the Supreme Court. The voices may reach them but it's easier not to care.

"Hello !
Every doctor swear to follow the Hippocratic oath :
The Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics historically taken by physicians. It is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear, by a number of healing gods, to uphold specific ethical standards. The oath is the earliest expression of medical ethics in the Western world, establishing several principles of medical ethics which remain of paramount significance today. These include the principles of medical confidentiality and non-maleficence. As the seminal articulation of certain principles that continue to guide and inform medical practice, the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value. It is enshrined in the legal statutes of various jurisdictions, such that violations of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oath's symbolic nature.

"Even children know it's wrong, but not you."
As the old saying goes be careful what you wish for.

Abortion is ending of a fetus life so that it will not result to birth because of various reasons. What are your reasons? May God enlightens us in our reasons.
Alito and the maga justices on the court should be aborted.
Giving the power back to each state was a fair decision by SCOTUS. It gives the people of each state the power to decide for themselves and to vote for the officials that align with their pro-choice or pro-life ideals. If you live in a state where you feel you don't have rights as a citizen then you should consider moving to one where elected officials and citizens alike have the same ideals as you. It is only fair that through voting the people decide their own fate.

30% of women are unable to terminate a pregnancy in this country! An outrage which will not go unanswered by people whose rights have been trampled by the GOP.
"The reality hit folks daily. Desperate women are seeking clinics for abortion. Demand clearly exceed supply. Anger and frustration will climb and spread among women, folks will die and drive women to vote. Midterm will be a nightmare for Republicans."
"As an ER DR., I like many physicians won’t do locums work in any state that criminalizes elective and therapeutic abortion. That means, you take your chances with adequate ER coverage. Hope you don’t get into and car wreck or have a MI."
"The republican party is a party of taking away. It isn't a party of giving. They wanna strip away your rights, your human rights. They are extremist. The republican party after Trump became president has decided this is the decade to show people who we really are. White extremist, who hate minorities and hate women."
"Let’s not forget that in the Republic of Ireland, even when abortion was outlawed, the maternal mortality rate average between three and four per 100,000 live births. In 2021, the maternal mortality rate in Texas was nearly 34 per 100,000. It’s not simply a matter of access to abortion. It is also a matter of women having access to healthcare."
The two things that have always made murica an idiotic country. Racism and religion. It's going to end you soon.

"It’s really pretty basic, if you were against abortion, and you strongly feel that your religious beliefs do not believe in it , then don’t get one, however you don’t have any right to inflict your own religious beliefs on every other American in this country, who may not share them, who may not belong to your religion, or may not belong to any religion whatsoever, that’s what’s protected in our countries foundation,  that anyone can practice the religion of their choice or no religion whatsoever."
"All are garbage.
xD"
What most of the anti abortion people simply don't know is that many medical procedures pertaining to women's health that run from infections to cancer treatments can and do come under the abortion umbrella. They likely won't know until it personally affects them or someone they know or love.  The religious right and political extremists don't make that known because they know it will make them lose supporters!
Texas should be another country.

It's none of your business is it?? Woman get fixed or take the pill like a daily vitamin
Seeing my home state of Wisconsin painted in Maroon as a total ban is extremely upsetting. I can't believe an awful pre civil war law was allowed to go back into effect the second RvW was struck down.

In 1919 Congress passed the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibited ""intoxicating liquors' in the USA.

The unintended consequences included speakeasys and gangsters, plus decreased government revenue from not taxing legal liquor sales.

In the same way, people will quickly realize right-wingers made a big mistake and repeal their stupid abortion laws."

"Had law makers bothered to educate themselves, interview women, interview doctors and other medical professionals, research before jumping to action, then maybe they would have been well informed enough to understand the consequences before they took action!

But ofcourse they did not do anything other than pick up the phone and do a 'YES-Man' routine when their Donor/Owners called about $$$$ in return for their vote against women's right to Healthcare.

"1. Women are not going to simply give up having abortions just it is against the law. (Think prohibition and drugs),

"Here is an idea!   If you don’t want to have a baby….DON’T GET PREGNANT!!   This is NOT “the old days” when women had no methods other than total abstinence to avoid pregnancy.  Things are DIFFERENT today!!  If you want to have a child LATER, take birth control pill; use a birth control patch; get an IUD; use spermicide.   If you don’t want a child EVER, get your tubes tied!!   Bottom line: There is no excuse whatsoever for using ABORTION as your birth control solution."

Now choke on it."
Why can't women just let babies live?  Adoption should be the alternative not abortion.

They are not concerned with taking the life of a baby that  could live if not aborted! It is murder any way you look at it.

"How would be the proposal?
Takes away a man's right to reproduce at any time.

Abortion is murder!  Thank God Roe was gutted!!!!
This is why I reject religion. It's oppression.

Fascism is cumulative. It begins in back halls and expands to nations.
We should give Texas back to Mexico.
"Would everyone be ok with abortion if it was only legal in very rare circumstances, say if the mothers life is in grave danger?"
i am well beyond reproduction ability but what this Supreme Court has done to Womens rights.  I cannot beleive what is happening to our medical institution.  And not to mention our rights as women.  What is next?
"Women, either use effective birth control or abstain. All the women I’ve known over the years who got abortions were just sleeping around."
That's funny because a lot of you voters don't know what your rights are so what rights do you think they're taking away 🤔
"there too many people on the planet, I just say that"
Yes democrats please dispose of your offspring.
"Didn't you guys just change the definition of a ""woman""? Saying this is an issue about women's rights is pretty transphobic, and you all should be ashamed of yourselves!"
"Nary a word about the 'terminated' having any kind of 'choice'; the majority of which were victims  of elective abortions, and not a threat to women's health."
"Abortion should be free and there should an incentive. They also be more available. Conservatives don't realize that abortion cuts back on poverty and crime. Imagin if one million less kids are born. It's like one less Baltimore or Detroit to complain about. Plus less population would mean better healthcare, schooling and public housing as there would be less to take care of.
There is enough people on this planet as is. There is no benefit to having more people. 
A mother of 5 gets pregnant. It's her right ✅ to choose. But picking abortion should be $$$$ in her wallet.


Obviously women should have a choice."
need more non-whites to make love to MAGA groups
Why is it the left ALWAYS wants regulations until we talk about abortion or immigration. Abortion is not a form of contraceptive. 🤯
"So people, it’s great that droves people are making their voices heard about keeping choice….but this won’t be remedied in a year or less. It’s going to take a few election cycles MINIMUM to make a lasting change. Budget on 4-6 years of activism. We need 60% in the senate to codify Roe. Vote! Vote! Vote! And help organize!!!"
Abortion is no more healthcare then the gas chambers in Nazi Germany!!
"This is a human rights issue, the right to life!! Abortion is pure evil, and so are its supporters!!"
Vote ALL Republicans out of office....period!!!
"Remember when Republican's were yelling at the top of their lungs about it was their right not to wear a mask to protect anyone from Covid! Ladies yell at the top of your lungs ""it's our right to have an abortion!"" Go vote Blue, keep your rights!"
"Time to take it to the streets 
Shut the whole system down 
The system is broken 
The fascists want the American women back in the alleys and in the Kitchen 
Under a men rule 
Unite or forever be enslaved and oppressed by big bullies lying politicians and deranged elite"
"If you didn't vote against Donald Trump in 2016, and you were old enough to vote, then you chose this !"
Dont worry...california will always have abortions....ALWAYS. I adore democracy.
Fewer murders?
"Yeah, but the Republicans are NOT allowing women to vote on it!! So the laws are not even legal not to mention it violates HIPPA."
Anti abortion people are idiots. They want to band abortion until what everyone was telling them effect their families. Now women cant get care because doctors are scared of jail.
Joe loved hot steamy showers with his daughter. Gross.
"Having been forced to have an illegal abortion when I was 15 and a half years old by my mother in 1966, let me assure people that abortion bans will not stop abortions. They will be done in back alleys, in some dirty office space by a quack like my mother forced me to have. I was saved when my father realized that my bed was covered in blood, I was unconscious and HE took my to the nearest place he could get help for me and that doctor saved my life. My mother had not told him what she had done to me. So you folks who think banning abortions will stop them are DEAD WRONG. What they will stop is safe abortion access. Moms will die, leaving young children without a mom. Poor women will likely die but then again nobody actually cares what happens to poor women regardless of what the ‘right to lifer types claim."
"It was about time that all this republican anderstand was the Republican party is trying to do.They are taking the right of all the womens and this is the begging for what they have in place. Look at Florida, Texas, and all the states that are republican. They are even changing the history of the USA in the schools and taking the books so they would not know the real history, this is how Hitler started .We can't let this happen to America. We are in 2022 not in 1940 we have to stop them before they do more harm to the USA."
"Abortion is the killing of a child, bottom line."
"Doctors need the page from the police handbook  - write a bonus account of the incident with misspelled & illegible language. ""I feared for my life""
Then a page from the republican handbook  @ I do not recall, I do not remember, I plead the fifth, the left extremists set me up, abortionGate, Fake News!!!!"
Seen where Arizona Republican erased his website's Antiabortion agenda. Knows he's losing so he hides his stance.
"Reproductive “rights” where is that in the Constitution? How about the child and their Right to Life which IS in the Constitution?
Selfish selfish selfish to choose your life over your child’s. When your friend miscarries and is sad do you console her with the words “ it was only a clump of cells, why be sad. You just got saved from a life of aggravation and who knows what else “ I DON’t THINK SO!! Or you friendship would be over."
"Vote out EVERY Republitard, judges, secretaries of state, Govenors, AGs, ect. With 60% control of Senate We Make Laws. Democrats force Supreme Court to enforce laws we as the majority want."
"I want to know how outsiders are getting medical records of these females 🤔 
How does anyone other than the immediate  medical team know the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy 🤔"
Not to mention the fact that ‘they’ want to send women to prison for having miscarriages
This is what happens when people place bumper sticker politics over human beings.
The people that wants to ban abortion doesn't have a clue what they are doing they are nothing but control freaks and blind with a one sided view without any knowledge of the risk and problems that a pregnancy can present it not the same for all women and every pregnancy problem do happen and will continue to happen that is why this decision should be between the doctor and patient  it would be better cheaper and more effective to help provide contraception and tubal ligation to women and those above the age of 35 that elect to do so but most definitely let it be a choice of the women
Guess White Males in Texas want all women to be Stepford Wives and breeders..
"VOTE BLUE ! ! AND VOTE AGAINST THEM WHO VOTED AGAINST YOU ON HEALTH CARE, A LIVING WAGE, GOOD PAYING JOBS, THE Republican Party HAVE CONSTANTLY VOTED NO ON ALL THIS ! !"
This is an easy call....Republicans are IDIOTS.
If ONE republikkkan IS ELECTED THIS CYCLE IT WILL BE ONE TOO MANY!!!
"Abortion will never be stopped no matter how hard the anti choice brigade try,illegal abortions will still happen,deaths of not just the foetus,but the woman as well,who may be the sole provider for other kids. Perhaps its time for compulsory vasectomies. It's a small operation and can be reversed,or is it my body,my choice for men?"
Vote BLUE.
Females keep your legs closed until you are ready for children. If you keep your legs closed abortion will never be an issue for you. Women have always had the right to keep their legs closed. Abortion is not birth control. Abortion is used by weak females who get impregnated at the club on Saturday night. Abortion is not birth control. Pathetic. Cheers!!
I don't understand why these people hate women so much. Why do they want to sentence women to die. Well they will learn in Roevember.
It shoud be called reproductive rights.
"The Murdering of Unborn Babies in their Mother's Womb has resulted in over

Vote Blue
"The extremism of allowing abortions up to birth and letting the newborn die on their own is beyond the pale. The Right wanted it to be returned to the states to decide, we got what we fought for, now the voters get to decide."
it seems everything in Texas is big but there  brains!
"Maybe if you raging feminists didnt throw the whole "" my body my choice"" into the garbage when it was convenient to fit your narrative,  the average person would have a little sympathy"
"Abortion rights is like screwing up and then make it go away. In life you can get away with many things, as long as they  are not found.  It also means they are illegal."
"What it really means is the U.S.A. has become a Theocracy under the rule of ""God"" and anything that threatens that is against what the U.S. stands for: A theocracy fueled by Capitalism.

Capitalism wants to own the means of production (literally and figuratively) to keep it churning. The more over-populated we become, we will resort to more poor working conditions, lower salaries, and even more uneducated voters.

Yes, the conservative front with their Christianity spiel are a threat to individual rights and freedom! Time to fight back and VOTE THEM OUT!!!"
"Vote blue,Republicans are all about taken freedoms away!!!"
"If the woman dies from being denied care due to the abortion ban, can supreme court justices be held liable for manslaughter?"
Enough of the redcoat republicans! This is our body not some old white mans! Vote blue!
"This is what block Obama was all about and in 2016  43% of registered Democrats refused to vote. 
They just couldn't support the DNC or Hillary Clinton for arbitrary and subjective reasons. 
Only 41% of registered Democrats refused to vote in 2020.
Not voting is more deplorable than voting Republican just to block our liberal agenda."
Republicans are doing God's work. It only makes sense to legalize raping next.
America has always said FREEDOM FREEDOM FREEDOM what a joke.
We also vote. We plan and we plot. Expect us at the pools. I feel RAGE.
"That’s cool murder babies and brag about it
Plan having a child and don’t use abortion as birth control"
Roevember people!
"Oh really. Are they now?
Would have been nice if they didn’t need to be self centered a**🕳’s in order to figure it out, but better late than never I guess"
"Women need to vote Blue!!! Laws in Texas and Florida are just outright Horrifying!!! Texas will not let a woman that is in danger of dying get an abortion. So, GOP Pro Life is B.S.!!!!!"
Shame they didn't see this coming as it's obvious it will if you let the Republican into power. I mean the Republican don't make a secret of this anti abortion stance and yet people affected either vote republican or don't vote. Same with low taxes for the wealthy and all the other antisocial ideologies. Vote Democrat before the Republicans get their way on other issues.
"Things have to change
They will keep making choices on how people can live"
I don't think the Magats understand what's happening in America right now.
"Canadians who are for the choice are with you American women! 
Don't stop your battle your sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters need you!
We are in 2022 not in the end of 1800...women fought for this right and every evolved countries in the world have that choice."
"Any Reproductive Freedom Act should Also codify men's rights into law.  It won't, and major networks Never discuss this.  Until they do, I don't vote."
"Why does Texas always come off as being so backwards? After enough women start dying in emergency rooms because a Doctor does not want to get locked up for 99 years, Texans are going to kick every stupid republican religious extremist out of office.  We can't have gun nut religious zealots who want to ban books tell everyone else what to do. This all boils down to a minority rule. It's got to stop!"
"Regardless of your position on abortion, if we elect our politicians on that single issue, its just bad karma"
1 in 3 women! Unconscionable & Unconstitutional. The religious extremists are harming citizens by penalizing their autonomy rights of choice! The are committing crimes of forced birth against women!
"""And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.
The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. 
Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone NOT FOUND written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire."" (REVELATION 20:12-15 NKJV)


Today, while you are still alive and able, may you repent from your sins, believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that JESUS CHRIST is your Lord and Savior, so that through Him, your name will be written in the Book of Life. 


""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever BELIEVES in Him 
should not perish but have everlasting life. 
For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved."" (JOHN 3:16-17 NKJV)

By God's GRACE ✝️ the gift of Salvation and Eternal Life is available to all. You can RECEIVE it. You can REJECT it. May you choose wisely.⚖️"
"I've seen more women then that , at  Trump rallies"
"It's not just the doctors at risk of prosecution. If a woman comes in to the ER with a miscarriage, is she going to be treated or be accused of ""self aborting"" and arrested?

Abbott has got to go! He is an evil bitter old man."
Misogyny is still misogyny!  It just goes to show you how some people have such a hatred and bigotry towards women.
Vote republican to force women to carry their rapist's non-viable fetus full term even if it kills them.
"Somebody needs to be talking about the mandatory inbreeding , it’s the law now ,if your blood relative gets a  Family member,  pregnant that’s called inbreeding."
This will bite GOP badly at the polls
FINE MARCH BUT …. VOTE VOTE VOTE  🗳 🗳 🗳 🗳 🗳 🗳 🗳
It's as bad your own doctors unable to dispense meds for Covid-19.  Being controlled and limited to what your told.
The red state regulation of women proves the GOP freedom bombast is a crock.
FTEXAS & The GOP TOO 🖕🖕🏻🖕🏼🖕🏽🖕🏾🖕🏾
No man should have to pay for a baby he doesn't want either.
"because people do not care about others' rights  your ability to vote will be next, this is no longer a nation you can trust by law"
How did this happen lol feel so bad for anyone needing an abortion right now
No one is going to tell me what I can do with my body.  I used to have respect for the Supreme Court but no longer.  Some how we let stupidity in to the White House in 2016 now it’s in the Supreme Court.
"looking at this logically.  the cutoff for abortion should be the same cutoff for forcing premature birth.  no matter what, a woman shouldnt be forced to carry an unwanted baby.  either give premature birth and put it up for adoption or abort it.  

the world record for this is born 19 weeks premature.  so whether the cutoff is 4.5 months or 3 months or 6 months, no woman should be forced to carry it to term if she doesnt want to."
"Yes, we are seeing. That's a whole lot of murder sympathizers. YHVH is also watching. He created the lives of the innocent being slaughtered. Woe be unto these killers."
Texans need to wake up and vote for a governor with a heart. BETO will serve us well. Blue 🌊
Reversing a women's rights to abortions was the final nail in the coffin for the Republicans as a so called political party .
"Please remember that YouTube comments don't win elections.

This is for people who were eligible to vote, but chose not to in 2016: Hillary Clinton tried to warn you about Trump-appointed judges overturning Roe v Wade.  

This is for people who are eligible to vote this November, but aren’t planning to vote: If you want to keep the rights you value, you need to vote (while you still have the right to vote!)

Whatever your values, it only matters if you vote."
Let's vote OUT as many of these fascist pubs as humanly possible in November. Before we start looking like 1930's Germany!!
Our loved ones are not F***ing property! And others should have no say in life altering decisions...as if it wasn't hard enough to begin with!
"Democrats must get Americans to focus on how RepubliKKKlans have used RepubliKKKlan-state legislatures to enact their 'non-existent' platform. A platform that is mainly a culture war. Attacks on women's rights, voting rights, minority rights, LGBTQ rights, and 1st amendment rights. They will make those barriers federal."
Women vote too. Maybe they are going to take that away too. The abortion rule is NO mistake a obvious control over women. That's the only way to look at it.
The myth was promiscuous women ( note not men ) getting pregnant and having monthly abortions ....the reality is a whole lot different
That’s the weird thing about most Americans: They only get it once they are PERSONALLY affected. 🤦🏼‍♂️ What’s so difficult about informing yourself BEFORE you make political decisions that have far-reaching consequences?
An observation from Australia like the FPOTUS the Federalist Judges need to be jailed. Judges should not accept money for positions in the Supreme Court.
This is how you know Anericans know nothing of history... They have to see the tragedy and suffering for their own eyes to fully grasp the situation!
"Well it's a good thing the people can vote on it.
Let each state decide not unelected judges"
The USA is not the CCP.
Coat hanger sales are through the roof. So are Bible sales.
If States let US decide
The turtle can see his chances of the top job in the Senate disappearing. And who can he blame? 🐷🐽💰
"It means women are not allowed to murder their children!
It means we stopped child killers!
It mean more babies will live!
It means Trump has save thousands of lives.
It means we have a good lawful Supreme Court!
It shows DemonCrats are child murdering Demons we need to vote out of office!"
Women will not vote gop!
Shame on all that identify as a democrat.
"If we can't turn these abortion bans around, far too many women, girls and their families are going to cruelly, severely and needlessly suffer!"
VOTE BLUE BECAUSE FREEDOM IS ON THE LINE...WE MUST SAVE AMERICA FROM RUN FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS...
"Voting is like driving a car: if you want to go forward, select “D”; if you want to go backward, select “R”."
Let's hope that Americans realize just how the USA got into this mess.Thanks to the GOP lining the Supreme court with right wing members of the GOP that Court is now just a political arm of the GOP and they will not have the best interest of all Americans in their decisions...Now the minority of America will rule instead of the majority and that is just plain wrong...
Make this a ROEvember.

If Texas sees a fetus as a human, can it be insured? I mean, if you have no choice can you at least make sure, should it go bad, you can afford to pay the medical bills? Or will they allow pregnancy insurance, so like after 9mnths you get a pay out for medical fees and extra things for this human? Real question. USA medical fees are crazy. Are y'all at least getting paid for the risk? You have to have the baby, did they at least increase maternity leave to at least 6 mnths? Paternity leave? What are the benefits of this law?"
The miracle of God and they throw it away like a gum wrapper it’s just plain murder
"More propaganda lies
Do your homework before you make up your mind"
Texas legislation is criminal!! What is wrong with these cretins!

Roe Roe Roe your VOTE!!!!
"It won't end with Roe v Wade, the GQP feel empowered now, and they will take away as many rights as they can, from We the People.  TRE45ON 🐀"
"Hello Everybody life is precious please take this moment and receive God in your life pray to God everyday for his help in life situations, read the holy bible everyday, believe in God more than you believe in anything else, Trust God more than you trust anyone else, praise God more than you praise anything else, love God more than you love anything else and remember with God help all good things are possible all you have to do is never give up also a great place for you to start in the holy Bible is (Psalms 1) and everyday after that read a chapter in Psalms till you finish all the chapters in Psalms then after that start on (Proverbs 1) then everyday after that read a chapter in Proverbs till you finish all the chapters in Proverbs and after that read every chapter of the Holy Bible until you finish it for it will change your life in the most amazing way"
It means 50-60 million babies every year worldwide would be alive?
"If the Democrats retain or even increase their control over the Senate, and if the expected Red wave in the House is a washout with the Democrats retaining control, and the post election data all points to the elimination of RoevWade as the root cause, watch how fast the republicans abandon their stance on a woman's right to choose. Vote, Vote, Vote!"
You guys love killing baby baby
"Doctors enmass in  the US HAVE TO go ahead with emergency care for pregnancies and proper DNC procedures now, and I know these States will back away from law enforcement of these legislations."
"Women have always been clueless, you want to see how a people destroy themselves with the majority vote, keep watching."
"For those who believe in God's will. God is the biggest provider of abortion ,15% of pregnancies are naturally aborted when things go wrong."
So called Christians forcing religious control over women's body is the same as Islamic Sharia laws
"Why would the Texas government want to imprison a doctor for 99 years, for doing what they have been  trained to do? That is to SAVE LIVES in a life or death situation!"
What's that? Pics of protests in Europe over stealing land from farmers? Or babies NOT being murdered by the millions as a form of depraved birth control. Or maybe it's the death of the elites sick evil form of eugenics.
No man dreams of putting a ring on the finger of a baby killer that can't keep her panties on. They are going to figure that out soon.
"This collective angry crowd is incredibly at least 100 times bigger than any of Trump's rallies. It's definitely bigger than Trump's inauguration crowd.
Funny how GOP's plan for total domination is failing."
"Bharani <--- learn about this and you'll learn why the thugs want to take innocent life is really all about, go do some yoga and meditate on that."
"I really believed a few months ago that Congress would be taken control of by Republicans. It happens basically every midterm of any Democrats first term in presidential office. The Supreme Court really poked a hornets nest by this BS overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Progressive base is not usually this excited during this time of the political 4 year cycle, but if we all go and vote we might actually give Democrats the tools they need to make significant change."
Yo ohuckkkk republicans and trunip supporterssssssssss
Those 5 SCOTUS members are gonna keep going until they get their bigoted evangelical paradise. The only way to stop this is to fight back and fight back hard.
"They are exposing themselves for who they truly are everyday more and more, excellent every man's eyes will be opened."
Republicucks screwed themselves by showing us who they actually are. Never again
I had to change my opinion on abortion after seeing the type of women protesting for it .  Do we really want that type of women to reproduce ???  I don't.
"Supporting and demand and cheering for killing your own children is not the path you want to take, that's all I'm going to say."
Random comment for channel interaction.
"Saying it for years and it fell on deaf ears, Racism and Abortion, the democrats bread and butter....funny how the two are also related."
Overpopulation people think about it we're already overpopulated
It also amazes me that they could even make a ruling like this.  Pregnancy is one of the most dangerous things a woman can do with her body.  Yes your body was made to do it but not all women can physically do it not all babies come out correct or develop correctly sometimes a baby dies during pregnancy.  And if you don't get that baby out you have a strong possibility of sepsis and many other problems.  This law is pretty much telling women that if they get pregnant they have no ability to protect themselves if there is a medical problem or condition with that pregnancy.  So for instance a 16 year old girl gets pregnant there's a severe medical emergency and the girl is going to die if they don't take out the baby but if they take out the baby the baby's going to die.  Now so that girl ends up dying then the baby has depending on the time frame how developed it is as you know a 20% to a 60% chance to live maybe even a 70 or 80.  And have a few kids later on in their life but how many kids could that 16-year-old still had so you're killing one person to save another person for what reason why is a infant's life more important than anyone else's.   And let's not forget for all you religious nuts out there God kills thousands of babies everyday why do we have to serve a 99 year term for killing one to save the mother's life.
"If you are miscarrying,you don't need an abortion. It will happen naturally.   Do people believe this BS."
The ONLY way to save the lives of women aside from voting is for the women in these states to strike.  Take women completely out of the workforce and their economies will fail.
Neither the elephant nor the donkey are capable of leading.  Vote independent
"*How did some women get so MILITANT that they put killing babies ahead of everything else?* Sky high has prices, soaring inflation squeezing family budgets, an invasion at the southern border bringing in deadly fentanyl which is the number one killer of our young people, and out-of-control crime in our cities! *Killing babies in places like New York right up to the moment of birth is INFANTICIDE?!*"
"I hope banning abortion, buries the republican party!"
"And you guys complain about Russia,  but not about Ukraine who has banned opposition political parties.  Ukraine Sounds like republicans who take away voters rights."
Do you actually expect the folks that pushed for this to care rather we live or die? This rolls back to when women were property. Men telling us what was what. I’m not sure the women who supported this thought was gonna happen. This means you can’t have a D&C if you mis-carry but still retains some tissues or products of conception….guess what? You get to maybe die. My Lord! I pray for us all!
"The  same people that were screaming ""my body my choice "" about wearing a mask now want to control women's bodies.  Vote for women's right to choose, civil rights, equal rights, voting rights,  climate change.  Vote for your rights and your children's future.  Never vote for any election deniers. Vote BLUE!  It may save a woman's life."
Looks like a celebration of life to ban abortion.  Go to blue states for infanticide; let that blood be on their hands.  Looks like judgement already on Democratic states.
"No one is stopping anyone from reproducing.  What it is stopping,  is killing what you have produced.  So disingenuous."
They really make no beans about it.
The Supreme Court and the Republicans messed up ! Bigly!👏🏾
"Protest for peace, and unity as well. Out with  Racism, and  not Equal application of the Law.With all the crimes Trump has committed, and he's still free, defaming, degrading, threatening, persecuting the FBI, which is under a ( New) reform..."
This comes down to money in the pockets of big business because they do not have to pay for abortions in the health care...
"LoL that pic tells it All !!! LoL
Many Stupid that don't do the Pill !!!"
"Make the lawmakers retrieve the dumpster babies themselves personally. None of this can be enforced, and there will be black market abortions, count on it, Government doesn't need to know you're pregnant."
"The fske propaganda cnn is at it again. Why lie to the people and say abortion was banned?? It's trurned back yo the states itself, not banned. So the people should sue yall for your propaganda lies."
"Do you really want your govenors making your health care decisions for you and your family?
Vote for women's right to choose, vote for civil rights, equal rights,  voting rights,  climate change.  Protect your rights.  Vote for your rights and your children's future. Never vote for any election deniers."
Lol we haven’t even gotten to the part of all these babies going to orphanages then over burdening the social system.
Women in America have now become second hand citizens. Wow. Republicans will lose the vote of all women under 40!
Just vote BLUE
"Once that child is born and added to the GDP, these terroristic shills on Capitol Hill and holding office, could care less about that child, If they cared, we wouldn't have child poverty and homelessness in the richest country in the world. Your oppression is their profession"
Is birth control illegal?
"abortion hasnt been banned. just returned to the states where it should be.
this is what democracy looks like. each state can make its own laws
in NY and California you will be able to abort your kid up to age 21"
It wouldn't be a problem if some of these females stop using it as a form of birth control!
Liar liar pants on fire it’s not banned it just means I don’t have to pay for it because you can’t keep your legs closed or use any sort of contraception.
The Land Of The Free huh?  Unless you are female.
"Don't let the scammers distract you.
Biden lures in millions and millions of illegal immigrants bribing them with freebies through the trillions dollar social programs while Americans suffering from Biden recession,, high inflation, and soaring gas price. Now you know why the democrats are pushing the ""Voting Rights Bill"" - ""No voter ID's"" the democrooks scam American people, ""Voter ID's are racist."" Something to remember in the November midterm. Democrats control WH, House, Senate and you get a trashed U.S."
"What right do these misogynistic old men have to force women to have children? America is not free , it has become a place ruled by extremists.."
"Go American women, how dare these politicians interfere with a womens body and telling them what to do, disgusting"
"Most of the ""horrors"" people are encountering now have been experienced before. This is history repeating itself. But this shouldn't not be surprising, given that it constitutes essentially a Christian crusade."
Extremism is KILLING BABIES as birth control.
"This is what you get with a totally partisan supreme court and the results of minority rule which goes against the position of the majority of Americans. Americans want to leave the reproductive rights in the hands of each woman, whether they themselves are pro-life or not."
Well all those rich people better start building more prisons.
"It's a ""mostly peaceful"""" abortion ban, right Mr. Velshi?"
Abortion is high on a list of concerns to me when I vote this year
"Now, the GOP and the Supreme Court have ""Woken"" the sleeping Giant.  Opps."
Abortion is legal killing period muff said lying thieving evil obama administration almost done Trump will be back real soon
We should have started castration back in the nineties
The religious people who think the overturn of RvW is a blessing don’t know what they’re talking about. How is being denied medical treatment for a miscarriage by doctors afraid of going to prison a blessing?
"I live in Washington state,so we're ok here for now..I'm glad voters in Kansas voted to uphold abortion rights! I'd like to think and hope that the majority and common sense always wins in the end"
Men won this issue
"Men have been wanting to control women every chance they have gotten!!  Just look at how women are treated around the world-!!
Don't go backwards,  vote for your rights  !! LETS GO GIRLS"
Make sure you vote these extremely religious politicians away in the upcoming elections.
"Why people are not having the same response to the Law not being applied equally. The handling of Trump's criminality, even taking compromise material... He's getting special treatment.."
The supreme court has f-----d millions of women over by overturning roe v Wade..we will not take this s--t lying down and women will not be pushed around
"A fertilized egg is NOT a person.  There are a million things that can go wrong naturally to prevent it from ever developing even to the point of birth, and in the ancient times that these religious nuts want to return to, it was iffy for it to survive after that.  An adult human being IS a person and takes precedence over a pregnancy.  Many pregnancies end in miscarriage through nobody's fault.  Many fertilized eggs are defective in some way and should not develop.  Or they land in a place they cannot develop (ectopic pregnancy) and become a serious threat to the life of the adult.  Laws are being made by hopelessly ignorant religious bigots that profoundly affect medical treatment for these well-understood conditions, as well as manhandling the ability of any woman to make decisions about her own life.  It's not about somebody frivolously ending a pregnancy on the toss of a coin, it's about millions of people's physical, emotional, and economic survival."
ABORTION IS MURDERING BABIES!  MSNBC HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A LATE TERM ABORTION?  THEY USE A SUCTION TO REMOVE A BABY IN PARTS AND CHUNKS!  A LIFE BEING SUCKED OUT TEARING A LIVING BABY IN PARTS OUT OF THE WOMB!
"For women that think the abortion law is good, I only have to say, this isn't about whether you think abortion is okay or not.  I tried to explain to my daughters, this is about having someone else (the government) telling me what I can do and can't do with my own body.  For me, it isn't about whether you feel abortion is good or not. That is between me and my religion, or what is right for me and my family, or the particular medical circumstances someone is in.  Just recently a woman was denied an abortion when the baby she is carrying doesn't have a skull.  This is absurd - it was a medical issue.  VOTE these people out!  I respect other women's decisions they make for themselves, but I do NOT want my state telling me what decision I can make."
"Yeah, some are. It means to keep murder illegal. It means to enforce that no one is above the law, and that if you play around and get knocked up you have to accept the consequences."
To all who believe in abortion.  Most of you if not all do not believe in God or bible. But that doesn't mean God do not exist or the Bible isn't true. But it is. And God is real and he is going to judge you and he will judge you. And he doesn't play politics. You people are murders with no regard for life and you will be judged as such.
Imagine a man not standing up for his wife and children’s healthcare? They are just as bad as politicians.
I dont get how anyone is this upset over abortion. Add it to the november ballot and let the people decide. All this crap over laws that went into effect 1920 and before should be thrown out until new ones are replaced.
No doctors are leaving dead babies in women who have experienced a miscarriage.  Stop lying lady
"As long as people who call fetuses 'babies' exist, this will never get sorted out. You cannot reason with people who are unreasonable. I think it's best just to ignore them, vote BLUE, then change the laws to protect women's rights. I'm done with these mooks."
"""Hasta la Vista, BABY"" is what comes to mind when I see this. The fetus terminator."
"A blue vote today, keeps the GOP's deadly laws away."
Remember to vote in RoeVember.
"banning abortion to be even more burdensome on non-whites and poor whites
nra- never replacing anglos- playing the game by any means possible, legal, moral,  or not' JK
certainly following the taliban  the game book for christian fascists"
"The same Judges that called Roe settled law, essentially lying, to get on the Supreme Court can do whatever they want and Biden is too worried about the Democrat's image to stack the Court.  He's already dropped the ball, for a woman right to privacy.  Let's see what else the Court has to undo, before Biden wakes up."
Don’t like abortion? DONT GET ONE!!! The government should have no say in your health care
Next they're going to say women can't vote anymore
"Why are politic stupid people saving what women can or can't do...It is not up to them..!!! !!They are disgusting,evil people......"
"The republicans want to control American women uterus’s! This is going to be a major take over by the New Democrats,  American woman are going change these authoritarian republicans for EVER! Vote blue ! Keep gross old man out of your wife and daughter’s Uterus!"
Vote blue or leave Texas!!!!
"Never forget, specially when you hold that ballot in your hand. Remember: your husband, pastor, slave master won’t see who or what you voted for. Don’t be afraid, don’t allow anyone to intimidate you!"
Republican = Taliban
Whats awesome is now blue states will keep killing their kids and not even having them to begin with while Red States will keep havings kids and thus more power.
"Texas really, really, really doesn’t like women huh?"
Oh yes. Less dead kids. What a terrible thing!
"Ditch the electoral college.  For federal elections, forget about districts.  ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE!  Majority rule.  True democracy.  The electoral college was designed to keep rich white men in power.  Imagine Gore instead of Bush.  Possibly no Sept. 11 2001 attack.  Bush family and Binladen family business ties....
Gore instead of Bush, possibly more attention to climate change?  No electoral college equals no Trump presidency.  No tossing out of Obama's pandemic protocol. The majority of voters know what's best.  Time we listen to them.  Get rid of the electoral college."
"If Americans are supposed to have freedom of speech and choice, how did this happen?"
"It’s interesting also that the majority of people that support abortion ”rights” are men. Because “women’s rights, bro”. Yeah. Right. They just don’t want the responsibility when they mess up."
Men come up with not taking a pill. When one is ready by fa. Men must take the pill.
"Killing babies is what’s extreme. Abortion can’t be a right. You have to ask yourself, “where do rights come from?” Hint, they don’t come from men with robes and pens."
"If you think your vote is too insignificant to matter, try sleeping in a tent with a mosquito."
The Republicans are setting us back 500 years
"America, where the only freedom of religion is Christian white Nationalism, where your only Liberties is our commands, where women and men are not equal, where justice for all is only for them. Get it? Welcome to our way States of America. There is no United anymore. Foreigners are not welcome here and your only allowed to be rich, if your a Christian. This is what America is turning into. Fascist."
The women will be voting democratic this year
Well that takes care of the vaccine argument.  People have a choice
a lot of women lost their human rights.
Libs stay doing nothing of course
Would someone please explain to me how 5 people get to decide the fate of millions of women?
Funny how the GOP says it's for smaller government but wants to tell women what to do with their own bodies and lives. Plus they refuse to help mothers and families in any way.
99 years n prison for a foetus over a human life??? I thought men and women were equal? Why is it that men are leading the way to deny women that right?
Your citizens must be of interesting intelligence when they only understand things that they can see?
"Are “they” really though?  I think just like all other topics, those that caused this to occur won’t ever agree they were wrong."
"It's not just about abortion. It's about treating women -half the population - as property again, unable to make decisions for themselves, for their daughters, without the approval of the mainly male lawmakers in America. It's shocking and shameful, and the supreme court needs to be adult enough to admit that they got it wrong, and change Roe v Wade back to how it's been for years."
"See, it's the dog catching the tire of the moving car it was chasing and is getting beaten to death until they finally let go of this issue of women's rights. DeSantis and Abbot are both very likely to lose their Governorship this Roevember."
"Alot of white babies and white women are going to die - but they didn't take into account this occurring as this is what happens when your politicians are out of touch with society and only go along with a minority group - just so they can feel loved and held in high regard by a bunch of SHEEP!  Baaaaaaa baaaaaa   - they only want the black babies to die, not the white ones."
"No, the dog has gotten in front of the back tire while the car is going forward. It is only a matter of if the car goes over the dog."
TexAss is a laughably backward state.
what the abortion ban really means is a woman forced to carry a fetus with no skull to term.
Contraception learn them use them. Don't tell me about the exceptions. Abortion requirements would be cut in half.
"I live in TN and we already had restrictions before the overturn. Now, we are just screwed. Ill say this until I die; IF YOU DONT HAVE A UTERUS, YOU GET NO SAY IN THE MATTER."
The Supreme ‘Church’ has totally lost the respect and admiration of the general population.  They are a backward draconian pack of Christian fascists.
"If your State is not allowing you the same protections as others, then SUE your State. We will help."
"It’s a woman matter, keep bollocks out of this"
"STOP BREEDING STUPIDITY, ABORTIONS FOR ALL DEMOCRATS"
You take our rights / we take your jobs. Just ask Trump.
"Women SHOULD be mad,  All women have a RIGHT to control there own bodies.  Don't let the anti-abortion radicals win.  VOTE BLUE ALL THE WAY IN NOV."
"It is like they had 40 years to think this through but, like everything on the conservative side, they make it all binary. You're either a ""baby-killer"" or not. But there are so many variables. And the American public has never been over 35% on ""absolutely no abortion any time for any reason"". The incredibly out of touch Supreme Court has its lowest ratings EVER now! But Clarence Thomas wants to go EVEN FURTHER-no birth control for any reason. Their ratings would be under 5% of they go there."
"For every woman who dies because of a medical situation where an abortion would have saved her life, that woman's family should  have that states governor, legislators,  attorney generals,  charged with MURDER of the patient! Then, SUE THAT STATE INTO BANKRUPTCY!"
"If your the age 18 n 50 ,    Vote   BLUE ,  Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue Blue !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fight for what You Need and going forward !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This is EXACTLY what Biden was talking about when he characterized MAGA extremists as “semi-fascists.” These people despise freedom, democracy, civil rights — you name it. They are desperate to impose an actual, medieval theocracy on America. Wake up!"
"Abortion is not specifically in the Bible, but lying is, cheating is, murder is, divorce is, fornication is, AND Christians everywhere, including priest and pastors break these commands daily. Go work on your pathetic selves and leave us normal folks alone."
🥴🥴🥴
"My first thought of this SCOTUS ruling was .. Welcome to the horror show.  And it's coming.  
We will all understand the difference between a ""red state and a blue state"".   I think there will be way more blue states soon.  The pendulum has already started the other way.  It will gain momentum.  Even McConnell see's it.  He will die in office before leaving somehow, 45 has decreed it by telling him to get out.  In other weird premonitions, I don't think Biden is gonna make it two more years, he will make Harris the first Woman President. But I doubt she is re-elected for a full term, she will lose in the dem primary to God only knows who.  By then, 45 will be on a never ending Court cycle."
See this is what happens when you get distracted by TikTok And Instagram and whatever Kim Kardashian is wearing
"Liberals stop killing babies! Meanwhile 
Under the Joe Biden economy Say Goodbye to Your 11.4% Social Security Raise in 2023"
Texas is currently being run by the Christian version of the Taliban. Expect to soon see women being publicly stoned for seeking an education.
Protesting is ok.  Voting is much better.  Get up and VOTE
"Yes. Millions of the innocent unborn, are saved from willful murder, behind the excuse of court - invented "" rights."""
Extreme Republicans are more than happy to accept dead women as collateral damage for their authoritarian control over them.
As a republican i just want to say i totally support abortion especially if the parents are democrats.
"Make anyone involved lose their political career, anyone whose election you have a say in."
Abbott sues his neighbor for getting crippled while chopping down his neighbor's tree illegally. Paxton proudly wears the white hood and bankrupts black businesses.  Yep. My state of Texas.  :(
"BEING LEGALLY FORCED INTO FOLLOWING RELIGIOUS DOGMA IS FASCISM!
END CHRISTOFASCIM!
VOTE THEM OUT!"
"It’s especially despicable that not only do some conservative women haters want children to grow up in situations where they cannot or will not be cared for, they also want to ban abortions in the case of ectopic pregnancies—unviable medical “pregnancies” where the woman is *absolutely certain to die* and the *not even* fetus will never develop past a lump of cells! It’s unfathomable."
"As a human being who still has hope for humanity, how can anyone sing the national anthem with pride and conviction. The land of the free? That's a joke surely"
"I’m pro life  it also believe EARLY ON  it should’ve an option, but this abortion thing is being horribly misused it’s not meant to be birth control, 600,000 babies a year murdered is ridiculous. Why are these people so blown away that other people have a difference of opinion? If the people of a certain state vote as a majority they don’t want abortion and you’re not willing to be accountable for your sexual acts then I suggest you move."
"In the very near future in the states which have the most serious criminal penalties, it will be impossible to find an MD in an ER who has been trained -- and has the skill necessary -- to perform the medical / surgical care a woman in an emergent crisis must receive in order to live.   Medical schools in these states will not teach these procedures on the basis that state law does not permit a qualified MD to actually perform them during an MDs medical practice.  

Women in a crisis, rushing to an ER hoping for the care they need, will, instead, be hundreds of miles away from an ER which is prepared for these events.  It's only a matter of time before news breaks of women dying in ambulances or during an air lift if, that is, they have health care coverage for those transports or enough of their own money to try to save their own lives.  

Those deaths will be but one consequence of the patchwork of state laws which exist now or will be extant across the nation in a matter of weeks."
"EMTALA protects women who need urgent care. Sue the state, doctors, hospitals, schools or anyone else that tries to prevent that! IT""S FEDERAL LAW! It supersedes All state laws!!!"
"If men could get pregnant, abortion clinics would be like Starbucks, one on every other corner."
"With Trump, and the sick extremists he put on the Supreme Court, we're going to see history being made in this coming midterm, ...the party in power sweeps its way back into power again! This disgusting criminal grifter will keep destroying the Republican party until there's nothing / no one left."
Ultra MAGA riding the massive RED WAVE IN 2022 AND 2024!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
"The anti-abortion movement is purely class warfare. Rich people will always have access to abortions, poor and working people dont. Nothing creates a more desperate employee willing to work for lower wages and under poor working conditions than somebody with a child. And nothing prevents poor and working class people from getting an education and competing with rich kids for jobs than a baby to take care of."
The Republicans are the American Taliban.
We need neutral Sup.Ct.Justices. IMPEACH THE JUDGES THAT LIED DURING THEIR CONFIRMATION HEARINGS 😡👹😡👹😡
This is the only program I have seen that dares to say one word about the families suffering unnecessarily. This is a travesty and unworthy of America. We are not perfect but this is beyond savage.
Totally not acceptable by republican leaders. It’s totally wrong to have government take away your rights. I’m voting to make sure we have more democrats in the Washington this November.
"People don't understand the meaning of ""total ban""? Maybe they just didn't think about the implications for themselves if they were to need pregnancy-related life saving treatment. Here's your death panels!"
Wait till the see what it means to be a Trump for President 2024 supporter. 100 times what you see here.
"When people vote, Republicans lose. Gone are the days of voter apathy. We all saw the disastrous results of that back in '16."
"Imagine a blue tsunami of victories across the board in 2022, then Biden gets re-elected in 24 with a 47% approval rating. Imagine the msg that would send & the panic that would set in with the Republican Party. They cheated & it didnt help, even worse, by 2025 & 26, 2024 Republican candidates are being arrested across the country for mass election fruad. If that happens, The last Republican to run for President would run in the 28 election."
"""Strength in Numbers""!!!!
To ALL dissenters; brave enough to take it to the streets.  BRAVA!!!! 🇺🇸👀"
Christian confederate conservatives just have nothing better to do 😆.  Not understanding how they are pro life and against abortion and also against welfare and support programs for single mothers getting government assistance. That's why voting red is like shooting yourself in the foot. Voting blue you just have to fight to keep your guns and gas prices low 😆.
"Yet releasing toxic pollutants into the air and water is ay ok! Drive through Texas in the small towns it's a toxic waste dump, a third-world country."
The answer is leave if you can.
"Apparently, it's got to the point where nobody can openly express their opinion anymore. 3:27 Women mask up to avoid persecution by Christian Taliban for taking part in a demonstration against abortion laws.
These are conditions like in dictatorial countries."
Wait tell they ban a womans rights to vote its coming Republicans are alot like the Taliban they own there wifes
Vote blue to save your rights !!!!!!!
Buy stock in condoms
"Yeah, it means less babies getting murdered."
Opus Dei paid $1.6 billion to buy SCOTUS to undo Roe. That's how much women and girls are worth to the holy mafia. End Citizens United.
Sounds more like an up graded trafficking scheme to me.
"If Abbot and his cronies don't want to obey federal laws about providing proper healthcare, what makes you think they'll go along with election results? Texas is a potential Jan 6."
It's not just about abortion.  Using their religious beliefs to control another persons life is violating our constitutional rights.  This is a religiously free country.
"If preforming or receiving an abortion is a felony, Biden needs to give a blanket pardon."
"""This could be kicked around like a political football"" - ""this"" being women's bodies and lives."
The Radical Right needs to mind their own business.😡
"If men could actually get pregnant this wouldn’t even ever be a Debate! It just wouldn’t happen, no discussions would be heard, not a single person would say or be able to say a Single word in regards to this situation."
Back off MEN!!!! YOU RULE EVERYTHING. LET WOMEN MAKE THIS ONE BIG CHOICE ON THEIR OWN.  HOW DARE YOU!!!
Land of the free denying human rights to half the population.
"So if it's up to 99 years in prison for a woman that has an abortion, then Abbott should face 99 years in prison for manslaughter for each and every woman that dies from not be able to get an abortion to save her life."
shows us how out of touch the rep. are with women!
"99 years in prison for seeking healthcare?  Why not just stone women to death?  Murderers don't even get that kind of sentence.  I swear, the GOP won't be happy until women are required to wear burkas and chastity belts for life.  American Taliban."
Some states are already talking about banning birth control. Missouri is one.
"Want change? Don't only VOTE, DONATE to a group that is fighting for what you want done, and VOLUNTEER to help. Peace to all."
"I think this goes into two different camps. The first is appalled realizing the unintended consequences of having a total abortion ban. And the second, doesn't care if women die. They are perfectly fine with that."
For 40 years the only thing you heard was right to life and my Bible says. Now they care suddenly about the rights of the mother…….this is your GOP base. COMPLETE LACK OF FORESIGHT
Abortion is murder
Who are going to take care of the millions of babies born in America after babies are rejected and abandoned in  hospitals across the country? Are they  willing to lock up parent for abandoning their babies?
How did the Republicans Supreme Court think this was a good idea!!!  Vote Blue America 🇺🇸 freedom for democracy 💙!!!
First vote in the Democratic primaries to ensure that we get candidates that will really fight for our rights and for what’s right 🤔☮️🇺🇸
The disgusting GQP MEN are holding American women hostage in creating their own personal wealth and societal growth.
PRO CHOICE IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO
"Register to vote, locate all voting places near you, and vote blue or kiss womens' health good-by. Then what will the republicans ban next? And after that?........"
It sounds like she wants babies to die.
Here in Texas they should let the people decide and vote on it. Abbott would never let that happen. We need to get rid of these republicans running our state. VOTE THEM OUT!
"ACTUALLY, not having access to legal abortions can get A LOT UGLIER. ........................... (I remember the sixties when this started to be openly discussed.)"
"I'm in Texas and I am so embarrassed by the Gov and others. Abortion Rights and voter rights. Infact, the state aborted voters rights to stay in power. Roevember"
KEEP YOUR THEOLOGY OFF MY BIOLOGY!!!
I suspect we’ll see most states pass laws putting abortion on a firmer state-by-state basis than Roe ever did and as the conservative Justices knew would happen. Within 10 years I suspect there will only be three or four states who ban or highly restrict abortion. These will be the four or five where there is a genuine majority against abortion.
He’s a handsome advocate.  Why does the media think all republicans are against abortion. It is a flat out lie.
The biggest problem with America 🤔 One country but in reality is 50 countries rolled up in one each state its own laws 🙀🤔 Who has the upper hand There Is NO UNITED
"Forcing your religious beliefs on someone else is just wrong, wrong, wrong.  What abortion law ever forced you to have one? Cite that law for me, please."
"ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS keep this in mind when deciding where you stand on this issue: If men got pregnant, this would be a total non-issue. Spoken as a man, who knows how power-hungry men like politicians think."
"Just Remember Texas, you voted for these people and in the primaries you voted for them again."
"Vote so there won’t be a need for recounts! 
We need to win by huge numbers so there’s no room for the GOP to lie."
She is absolutely right.
If these so-called Christians were REAL Christians they'd be healing metaphysicaly as Jesus did & told his followers to do instead of trying to force their own ungodly will on others.
Hyperbolic fear-mongering channel. Not news/sensationalism and propaganda
if you don't like abortion then don't have one.
"Red states are blocking abortion trigger laws!

GOP regret rushing Roe. They panicked over the hearings."
The meaning of mess around and find out
Vote vote and vote to all women let's stand together and vote all the the Republicans out. Republican will let us die.
the taliban is moving in
"Don't believe in abortion?

Then don't get one?"
"If Texas sees a fetus as a human, can it be insured? I mean, if you have no choice can you at least make sure, should it go bad, you can afford to pay the medical bills? Or will they allow pregnancy insurance, so like after 9mnths you get a pay out for medical fees and extra things for this human? Real question. USA medical fees are crazy. Are y'all at least getting paid for the risk? You have to have the baby, did they at least increase maternity leave to at least 6 mnths? Paternity leave? What are the benefits of this law?"
For God sake TEXAS!!! VOTE FOR BETO!!!
America so backwards
"3:45
If leaders dont support their constituents having access to abortion, it's obvious, 
the women (and their loyal familymembers) will vote someone else...
Dictators wont prevail in a democracy."
Christian extremism is as bad as any religious extremism! And Texas is becoming like the Centralist Republic of Mexico ruled by Santa Anna.
good grief. Texas: maternal mortality capital of the first world. So much  winning.
"""INFRINGED"" 🇺🇸 🌎"

America is becoming an extremist Roman Catholic nation in which women are not considered equal to men.
Personally think abortion is disgusting but don’t see as how you should be allowed to tell someone their not allowed to have one if they choose too.
How come we can't get AR-15's in California ? This is Ameruca isn't it ? USA 🇺🇸
"Republicans are, Americas Taliban."
Don't be mad if a pregnant woman is using the carpool lane.
"If Mary, who's child's father was absent, had had an abortion we would not have any Christian Evangelicals and the world would probably be a better place."
"Nope
All phony"
"What boggles my mind is that a) they forget back when abortions were illegal (or in other countries that have similar laws) and b) they have no long-term thought process: What happens when people are forced to carry children they don't want? People were getting backdoor abortions, which weren't always safe and hygenic, often dying in the process. Women died in pregnancy/childbirth because something went wrong and the doctors were unable to give them the care they needed. More babies with life-changing disabilities and problems are born, causing stress on a system that already has limited healthcare. Unwanted children are more likely to be mistreated or abused. The already problematic foster care and adoption systems become bloated with kids. Babies start getting dumped (even more so than they already are). And that's not even touching the issues we've seen lately where *children* are being forced to carry their rapist's baby, despite the danger to a body and psyche that is not yet fully mature.
Yep, that sounds like a *great* plan. /sarcasm"
"People couldn’t even understand a viral infección which was COVID, you want me to believe they understand the medical complexity of an abortion? Hahahaha 😆"
Roe row row your vote
"More and more what they do down there, makes me wish Texas had never joined the Union...sighs"
"Roe, Roe, Roe your vote…"
"School shootings, fact of life 
Police executing black people, fact of life.
Little girls being forced to (mis)carry to term. Now also a fact of life."
"Perhaps Thomas Jefferson's 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptist Association concerning the ""Separation of Church and State,"" should actually be added to the Constitution; to keep religious beliefs out of law."
Whether you agree with abortion or not it is none of the government's business. Health care should be between the woman and her doctor and nobody else.
Make it a blue tsunami in Roevember!!!
"So naive to think that banning abortion stops abortions. It hands it over to exploiters, drunks, extortionists, quacks, people who have lost medical licenses for a reason, and desperate teenagers. It massively increases the number of pregnancy deaths of mothers, the number of babies born damaged by medications and chemo (because mothers whose periods stopped during illness realised they were pregnant too late for these new deadlines) the number of babies killed soon after birth, the number of babies abandoned soon after birth, the number of babies born into massively dysfunctional families who end up being horrendously treated. And Republicans, be prepared for tax increases to support the number of people who will need total long term care because of being born with catastrophic congenital conditions."
🤧
All these ppl picking up cardboard never picked up a condom ..
People forget God flooded the earth killing everyone except one family. Even God kills.
"Think of these women who are waiting for the outcome of these lawsuit. I can't imagine their despair. Please, hurry up!"
We need to impeach Clarence Thomas.
We now live under White Christian Talibanic Laws.
"That anti-abortion 'dog' has been chasing that abortion car, for 50 years, and now it looks like the dog has finally caught the car.

"The horrors we will see.🙏😭 I work in L&D, and I am afraid."
"FASCIST ; PUTIN/ TRUMP, KKK , NEO-NAZIS , MAGA , NRA , JIM CROW , JIM JONES , FOX.
VOTE BLUE..."
One important difference between now and prior to Roe is that women and those who support their rights of self will not be silent. This is a critical difference and one that can make far reaching positive changes across all areas of our lives
"This is why ""all or nothing"" politics is the wrong way to go.   Compromise is necessary in a civilized society.  Lawmakers should NEVER vote on anything without knowing all the facts.  It is blatantly ignorant to assume you know everything about an issue you are voting for.  I personally need all the facts before I can form an opinion and I'm not making decisions that impact the whole country.  It blows my mind that citizens and politicians vote for bills they haven't actually read."
"Over the past 50 years, Roe has brought nothing but extreme promiscuity, depravity and  Mores decay; this resulted to the destruction of the family as we knew it. 

We didn't know things would get so bad when they promoted and encouraged abortion in the 70s, but now we know. 50 years ago, we could claim ignorance, but not this time. Passing a law that promotes or encourages abortion would undeniably be a curse this time, please men stay away from this. 

You don't have to be religious or a God fearing person to see how bad society has become.  As a man, if you don't stand up for something in life, you will fall for anything and everything. 

Life is sacred  we should protect it, and cherish it at any cost. 

Ty🙏"
What about the women in Texas and Florida who cannot afford to move to a better state?
I dare you to give a thumbs up 👍...Show your support for medical adoption...maybe one day it will save someone you love 💘.
Vote Blue in Roevember. Toss out these angry old white men who have no idea what they are talking about. No uterus? Then you don't get to decide for those who have one.
Any woman or anyone who assists a woman in soliciting an abortion who is arrested is a political prisoner.
"Absolute and utter madness! Put in place for political reasons WITHOUT DUE CARE OF WOMEN, IS ABSOLUTE MADNESS."
"💙Vote blue this November!!!💙🇺🇸
In effort to overreach the Supreme Court has awaken a sleeping giant!!! … it is obvious that the SC is absolutely out of touch with the millennials( bearing age) and the power of social media! They will find out in November! … 
all the ultra right has but, but inflation and gas prices… and the whole world knows that those two factors are a global phenomenon due to Covid19, Putin war, supply chain(shipments companies taking advantage due to greed), greedy corporations, greedy republican multi-billionaires and more"
"Which would result in more child abuse; forcing women to raise a child they don't want, or forcing the fathers to raise children resulting from ""having a good time""?"
"If you don't want your rights taken away, vote the entire Democrat slate in November."
The disclaimer under the video. Why not give us the exact details?!  Snap the neck of the baby while in the womb and pull it out.
"Another of America moaned about wearing a mask in a pandemic was taking their freedoms away, no a real issue of over turning roe v wade it really sinks in about what a freedoms are and how they impact you when taken away as you know it"
"Imprison D.Trump(his children), alike Republicans, Judge Thomas(Ginni), +, & Seize all Assets, Pensions, & Liquidate for The People, 10 Concurrent Life Sentences, +,."
Would the supreme court justices be like the president and are above being sued? Who would handle that as the 5 justices who voted to rescind roe should be held accountable for deaths related to THEIR decision but who would handle the case?
"To bad the abortion activists mothers didn't decide for an abortion.  It could have saved the rest of us from having to see such ugly, obese and  disgusting people..."
We need atheists in the Supreme Court. Evangelicals are cancerous and a threat to democracy.
Vote vote vote!!!!
Keep up the good work thank you for the fight women are awesome  abbot is out of his mine so is his knuckl head assist governor that want older folks to die for what ever he can go.
Stop the Christo-Fascist take-over of America! The World is watching and emulating this Fascism. VOTE Blue November '22!
Women will help vote them all out Traitors vote Blue
I can't believe that women have to fight this battle in 2022. Surreal.
"Message for Gregg Abbot, Texas governor: You want to punish women for having an abortion. You want abortion providers to serve long prison sentences and pay enormous fines for merely helping women. Yet you support the former president, who currently is the worst criminal in US history, having botched the Covid pandemic and therefore is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths. He incited the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection that killed five people, injured many law officers and did serious damage to our Capitol. Now he is under investigation by the DOJ for stealing classified documents from the White House that very likely has endangered lives around the world and caused great fear for millions. How you can hold any political office is a mystery to me, after your numerous failures, especially the Uvalde tragedy . I hope voters in Texas do the only thing that will make sense to most if those who live there: Elect Beta O'Rourke on Nov. 8 and send you packing, along with your corrupt enablers and sycophants."
"The history of Christianity - and all religions - should warn us against allowing them any control of us. Torture, burnings, castration of little boys to keep the childlike voices “to praise God”… anti science… don’t listen to religious zealots, religion is NOT good for you!"
Republicans can't wage war on women and still hope to win elections.
What bothers me most is that scotus made all women of America into 2nd class citizens overnight
Midterm manipulation to scam female voters
"These people have no regards for life , they love mutilation of the unborn"
"Women brought this bann on themselves with the 1 million abortions for 19 years straight.. abusing the system.. OVER 19 million abortions from 1993 to 2012...

MOST unwanted pregnancies came from Promiscuity NOT from rapes.. There needs to Be Access.. but it NEEDS to be REGULATED & TRACKED..

Noone should be forced to have a child but those that abuse the system should face consequences.. its not the Doctors.. its the Loose women making it bad for everyone.. like the Criminals in society make it bad for the rest of us.. theres always those that abuse the system.. even with abortions & that should be addressed nationally..."
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's crazy to me how mad people get about not being able to murder there offspring....
"Anti Choicers are ""Pro Life"" only until birth and then it's fend for yourself. Republicans are hypocrites. Unless each and every anti Choice hypocrite has a house full of adopted, unwanted children, they need to STFU. They have no right to tell women what to do with their own bodies. 
I think the SCOTUS should pass a law that all men get vasectomies so women stop getting pregnant. Men getting women pregnant has created this problem. If men didn't impregnate a woman, she wouldn't need an abortion. Vasectomies for all men."
Abortion rights are very important to me.
I feel like I'm living in Afghanistan the misogyny in this country is insane
"The issue here, you have those pathetic justices, Republicans states that have decided that woman don't have any rights, that is pathetic. Don't want any pathetic Republicans infringing my constitutional rights.
Leave your Cristian believes on your rear end.
Your are there to protect our rights. Shame on all of you."
"I can’t wait til the day a daughter of a right wing crazy gets pregnant not intentionally 
Then there will be change 

But we just need to vote out the nuts"
You wanted Biden you got him
It is now in the hands of the states to decide. That is how our country works. Don't like it vote or move..
"Denying a woman a life-saving emergency abortion does not protect the fetus. If the woman dies, her fetus dies too. Republicans don't seem to grasp this."
This is crazy
Biden has tough enough time choose what for breakfast shouldn't be make decisions that affects people lives when Republicans defeat u Biden hope they put u and your son in jail
"I'm so glad I had a vasectomy. Already got screwed over once by a woman. Wasn't about to ever let that happen again. I wish they would make it mandatory for all men. No sperm donations, just snip and no more kiddos. Then women can focus on complaining about everything thing else in their existence."
I hope this inspires people to vote.
👊
"Repugnitians need to be disbanded after failing the Country so BADLY ...
T rump Mr.Disinfectant killed over 4500 directly ....
Tge his faliure on Cocid lead to TO THOUSANDS MORE DEATHS ..... 
THEY HAVE SO MUCH NERVE TRYING THIS REVERSE OF ROWE VS WADE ...
THROW THEM OUT ..
THEY DO NOT REPRESENT VOTERS CLEARLY."
The Majority of the states that banned abortion supported slavery during the Civil war.   Just saying.
TIME FOR FORCED VASECTOMIES.
"We must absolutely gain an overwhelming majority in both the house and senate that makes it possible to codify the right to choice and right to abortion PERMANENTLY into federal law in a way that does not allow individual states any leeway to override it or the Supreme Court to nullify it.

It should have been down a long time ago."
"Margret Sanger the founder of planned Parenthood. "" Negros and other undesirables must be eliminated."""
"Register to vote, and vote out all the people who want to control 52% of the population."
"So, what you're saying  is -- even though a majority of women were protesting, making their voices heard, Republican slammed the door in their faces and ignored them. Now, the small Government party, has put the Government directly in the bedroom of every woman and disenfranchised half the population, and they are surprised about it??
Here's something - if you are opposed to abortion, then don't get one."
"⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆⬆
VOTE for your RIGHTS
VOTE the authoritarian republican party OUT
Authoritarian...Enforcing strict obedience to authority, especially that of the government, at the expense of personal freedom."
"Texas is what lack of separation of church and state looks like. Note this quote from their constitution, the last part, you can be excluded from public office if you refuse to acknowledge the existence of a supreme being, it's appalling. How did they get away with still having that in there since 1876? ""Sec. 4. RELIGIOUS TESTS. No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office, or public trust, in this State; nor shall any one be excluded from holding office on account of his religious sentiments, provided he acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being. (Feb. 15, 1876.)"""
"Only in America... You guys voted for those republicans, voted for Trump to tip the balance in SCOTUS... and now you are crying about the damage that is done.... Shouldn't have let those persons come to power in the first place.... But still... you all proclaim to be Number One and The Best in the world... Good Luck with that... Nobody believes you anymore."
Save the babies!....abortions is a sin!
"As a disabled US Army Veteran and Christian, I don't understand why other ""christians"" think they have the right to force thier beliefs down the throats of others! This is not Christ-like behavior and thinking.
    It's pretty simple, If you're against abortion then don't get one! No one is forcing ANYONE to get an abortion! I served so EVERYONE has the right to make thier own choices...even if they may differ from mine! Freedom=CHOICE!!"
"And the elderly, disabled and Vetrerans.  The worst aspect, is that they lie about these issues.  That's the ""crazy making"", which is the ultimate destruction of a society."
I had no idea 15% of pregnancies result in miscarriages. Aren't miscarriages god's little abortions?
There is a similar country that enforces laws such as this. The US was there for 20 years.
Why aren't pro-lifers handing out free diapers and formula...if they 'care' so much?
"People see what happens when religious people have power, aka voting for Republicans."
When pro-choice became the law  Support for pro-life have gone to so many extreme measure including murder.
This is creating a HUGE BLUE 💙 WAVE!!!!!
Calling a woman who has an abortion a murderer is like calling me a lumberjack for plucking an oak seedling from my lawn. Anti-choicers are absolutely ridiculous.
Denying emergency healthcare to women experiencing miscarriage is egregious. Vote these mofos out!
"You accept...
Life starts at conception ..
 Not first breathe as Adam was birthed?
 You agree, God numbered our days when there were yet none of them?
Then TRUST GOD & Forgive as you have been forgiven."
"Woman are going to take down the republicans for this.
Never underestimate the power of woman."
I have never been more grateful to live in Washington State than I am at this point in time.
Save America vote Blue 💙
"1:15  ""Texas doesn't want to comply with federal law that says you have to give emergency care to pregnant women who come into a hospital in a crisis situation.  They don't want to do that until she's on death's door.""  The one key word that has been inexplicably missing from all of these discussions is MISOGYNY.  This needs to change, just as Biden has now found the courage to say the F-word, fascism."
"The Sext-reme Court is out of control, or maybe we're going to be under their control. 
These catholics are Neo Fascist christian Nationalists and will, if they get a chance, force us all to have to participate in their blood magic rituals and death cult theology.
I will NOT drink the blood of someone, or eat the body of someone (even an imaginary one) just because old white men in dresses have the audacity to say they they KNOW what that made up being is."
Why is it illegal to smash a Condor egg? It's not a Condor.  Bird eggs have more rights than human babies.
"Tell that to the babies that were aborted. I bet they  kind of took that personal, id imagine."
"I think you forget the FACT that the only thing ROWE VS WADE did was move the decision back to States where there is more ability to hear and put into law the will of the people. It requires an answer from medical doctors, ethical contemplation, and social considerations. The killing of the most innocent amongst us is a community decision regardless of what any one person feels about it. If there is a point where the mother is at risk due to her pregnancy then intervention of a medical doctor is of course available so let's not misrepresent or lie about that fact! When you lie on your news in attempt to trick your listeners into your narrative you lose all credibility and it exposes your insincerity in the matter you are discussing. It proves how little you care because you are lying about it and are not operating in the reality of facts because your real aim is to control your listeners for a political narrative. That is just a display of how little you care about anyone."
"It was a sure-fire way to get everyone to vote AGAINST Republicans, silver lining...."

You mean, ""baby rights"""

"""People Are Seeing 'What It Really Means To Ban Abortion'"" so let's otherwise ""Convince It Forward"""
The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.
Fake Christian fascists have taken over SCOTUS and the country.
Religion in churches and at home. NOWHERE ELSE!
It is time to crack down on religion no more tax exempt status and a nationwide education program teaching people how truly ignorant and evil religion is.
It's the turn for juries to have a voice. Let Republicans whine when juries refuse to convict.
The fact that the father doesn't get a say in whether his child is aborted or not is unconscionable.
Where is abortion banned?
"Just like 1980's Moral Majority, our radical right-wing extremists are very immoral, and they are definitely a minority! Put ALL our issues on the ballot, and let's have our ""representatives"" do what WE want them to do!!!"
Letting women get close to dying while doctor's are on the phone to their lawyers because they are worried about going to jail is the result of this ban.  This is ridiculous!  How is this health care?   Ninety-nine years to life as a punishment?  Murders don't get that.
FORCED MOTHERHOOD IS FEMALE ENSLAVEMENT....
"Just wonder who would accomplish most, protest from baby killers for birth control that work at McDonalds, or protesting farmers and truckers that transport supplies?"
Religious zealots are the worst.
"Abortion bans harm the most vulnerable; POC, poor people, and children. Children are vulnerable, especially according to RAINN statistics; *every 68 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted. And every 9 minutes, that victim is a child. A person can get pregnant as soon as they get their periods, there are children under 8 with periods. Heck, the youngest I could find was an 8-month-old girl who was reported to have had period blood in her diapers. It disgusts me because I am a survivor of childhood sexual violence and I'm shocked at how common it is."
"More like the car running over the dog's head, it seems to me."
Does it mean that you need to be responsible for your actions? Or drive a little further? Or use a safer alternative method of skirting responsibility?
The Right evangelical neo-fascists now control the reproductive rights of 66% of all US women.  Donald Trump’s gift to the Right via SCOTUS appointments.
"I don’t understand, how is voting going to change this law back? Biden and all the Democrats have an opportunity to increase the court now, but they don’t . I’m not sure how voting blue will make Roe v wade reverse."
"The silver lining could be that some of the women who are going to experience these emergencies are going to be the ones who supported making abortions illegal. That will be a major eye-opener (or an eye closer, if they end up losing their lives because of it). But stubbornness can be a strong force and martyrdom is applauded by some. Time to vote!"
"Jazz how scary, what a crazy country the US is! It's so sick in so many ways."
"No matter how strict Republican men make abortion legislation, they still cannot get pregnant. No matter how hard they try."
Hypocrite Republicans like Lauren Boebert who is OK with having abortions herself but will vote to deny other women has no place in politics.
"Joe Biden on the cutting edge of 'boomer politics' . . watch out, kkk gonna get yer mama!"
"Banning abortion is impossible. Only legal, safe abortion can be banned."
I like to how women feel that the states owns there body ??????
Definitely bigger crowds than the rallies of the politicians responsible for the overturn. Bigger than the insurrection itself. I’ll bet they hate those pictures of peaceful protest. They should be very worried. The insurrectionists are in jail or convicted and can’t vote. Most MAGA are liars about actually voting. These protestors and women WILL vote.
These self-righteous self-serving evangelicals act like the most oppressed people on Earth where they're trying to push their religion on everyone else keep your religion that you mixed with your politics out of women's uteruses apparently they want small government the Republicans small enough to use women and tell black people know your place as every Republican is crying to bring back the Glory Days of white Christian nationalism
It’s time for all to rise above this political madness! I will vote 🗳 for woman’s health! We must unite and fight this injustice! We need more kindness & grace! 🗳✌️💙
So if you have cancer & get pregnant you will have to stop your cancer treatment unless it harms the pregnancy!  That's worse than having cancer!
Yup and we still want to say the Lord's prayer in a natural disaster. Goodnight!
"Solution to problem:  *Say ""No"" to men's advances, and keep your legs together.*  Or is that too much to ask of today's women?"
VOTE
"Republicans don't care about women's lives.
All they care about are tax cuts and power."
Women now have the same rights as men in a case of pregnancy. When privileged people get treated equal it feels like oppression.
"Even the so call god, believed in abortion. 

Numbers 5:11-31"
They wrote these laws against abortion to be as cruel as possible because that was the point and this was never about a life this was about control and these people want to control their property quote unquote back and what is their property you ask everything women and anyone who doesn't share their skin tone included
I stand for the people who require care and rights for their own body because they are more important than a bunch of cells.
"Nice try msnbc, pushing the abortion issue isnt going to help the Dems. Lets see,what else can they run on?  Apparently nothing."
"California has a measure on the November ballot to make abortion access normal in our state.  It is Proposition 1 and money against it is again being poured into our state to undermine 
women.  We must vote to normalize our health care and take care of the 50% of the population that is female or pregnant possible.  My abortion was in 1965 & it was very expensive & difficult
to arrange.  But it was a very simple surgery and I have no regrets and no guilt.  Never have had.  Has anyone looked into what it is to be an Opus Dei catholic?  All 5 of the justices who voted to
overturn Roe are Opus Dei Catholic, recommended by the neo fascist Federalist Society."
"I live in Missouri, and I hope that the women and men in my state wake up and vote out the politicians who banned abortion in my state. How many women will suffer and die because of this? Why do these Republicans want to see women die? Vote blue this year!"
"Religious people need to keep their beliefs to themselves,  and keep thier noises out of others lives. Until the clump of cells can live on its own and not leaching off of the womans body, it's not a person,  it's a clump of cells,  just like cancer is. And if the person doesn't want a clump of cells growing in them and leaching off of them and possibly costing them thier lives, they have that right to have it removed.  Any person who believes that they have a right to control what someone does with thier own body deserves a trip through maximum security prison for a few months,  they can experience what not controlling what is happening to your body feels like."
You say people are finally seeing what happens when you outlaw Row versus Wade but people already know what would happen if you're outlawed Road versus Wade because it's happened before anyone old enough to tell you the horror stories of relatives who had to get back out abortions but of course these men who lived through that time said we should do that again
Unfortunately the American Taliban in the SCOTUS can't be voted out.
"Enough already, the Supreme Court didn't ban abortion!"
"AN ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC SITUATION FOR THE AMERICAN WOMAN...

"Evangelicals who say they're ""good Christians"" because they care about the unborn baby, but then don't support funding for healthcare, food stamps, and other family welfare programs sure are awful Christians."
What it now means is Democrats will keep control of Congress. 😁👍
"Doctors have to check with lawyers and politicians about a medical procedure that is a private matter. Congratulations, America! You are now officially a backwards country. How about throwing in a witchburning while you're at it?"

WTF!"
"it would be interesting if Margert Attwood handmaidens tale, and Anita Diamant who wrote the Red Tent, had a conversation and what would that sound like?"
1:33 You’re wrong they don’t even want to do it when the woman is on deaths door these people think that a dead baby is more valuable than sentient human woman’s life who has been using resources for decades. They want a bunch of babies they can mold into being illiterate race baiting taxpayers.
"If you don't want a child, use birthcontrol !!!!!"
Baby murder.
Remember when Red Hats brayed that all people would care about was inflation and gas prices? 😏
"""From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."" Matthew 4:17

The lines are being drawn!
"States that enacted such draconian laws will soon get a response from the women of this nation.  Actually, there will be two major responses.  One this November 8th and again on November 5th, 2024.  I will stand and vote with the women of this nation."
"Where are you?  You have killed 63,000,000 American children because you did not want them to be there.  That is where you are.  That is more homicides than took place in World War II, the worst war in the history of the world.  You think you can get away with calling me extreme because I do not want to participate in your political party activity?"
"Does anyone out there remember being a fetus or being born? Abortion is necessary. Needs to be reformed not just have the baby and see what happens. Too many circumstances involved. Poor quality of living if complications, mother could die, or zero nurturing."
Just tell republicans that you feel that your baby is a democrat. theyll let you in...
"Abortion is not a right, and 'just staying out of peoples' private lives' is an inane argument that ignores the moral recognition of human life within the womb. Pregnancy should end with birth and life respected always."
Looks like a Big Blue Wave.
"Here's something Republican Jesus Freaks may not have thought about, which is people can, and often do, say they believe in something when they know there won't be any consequences (it's a big reason why so many claim to be religious).

But with abortion now there will be consequences, and they will effect conservative women just as much, if not more so, than any other group.  And we're already seeing signs some of them are now thinking, ""You know, maybe I don't really think abortion is murder after all."""
BUT HER EMAILS!
"There are 18 states that allow abortions.  Oh and Washington D.C. too, I almost forgot.  It may be a further drive but saying it’s banned is kind of poor reporting, especially since it’s obvious that there are states where you can have this procedure accomplished."
Once again the religion posions everythin
Roevember is coming
Oh yeah demsrats the party oh killing babies
Why aren't all the doctors protesting and striking???
"That´s what happens when religious wackadoos have influence on society! People get hurt,killed and made to suffer! Think the Gop has stepped in it this time and they are starting to realize it! Show them the door,give them the boot come elections! Get rid of them,kickém to the curb! HARD!👊"
"Please start covering the origin of this story, a corrupt SCOTUS, which was illegitimately stocked with Right Wing Extremists, not Good Judges of anything apparently."

"One book actually worth burning?  The Handmaid's Tale.
It was meant to be a cautionary tale, instead the GOP is using it as a ""How To"" manual"
I was thinking about buying shares incompanies who manufactures birth control since abortion is or no longer be an option in many ststes.Any opinions?
"If Republicans only would have known women demand the sovereignty over their own lives, they would have asked the Supreme Court to wait until after the midterms. Who would have thought women don't want to go back to the dark medieval times, when they were part of the possessions of men? Not Republicans."
"These radical nutcases need mental health evaluations BEFORE they are installed in governmental positions! If they were later deemed to be lying, they need to be terminated!"
This is what happens when you mix religious beliefs with biology/science/reality!
"Roe v Wade wasn't decided because people loved abortion; it was because women kept dying, so the system changed. It'll go back. Just have to see a lot of women die first."
"Put it on the ballot in every state.
Let the people decide whether or not they want abortion in their states.  Get the government out of the abortion issue!"
"And Texas will Reelect  Abbott  and those pushing this because  they  put party over what is best for themselves.

Christian Taliban strikes again!!!
"I wouldn't drive my uterus through a fascist fiefdom. They might not let it leave. Also, I wouldn't risk having to buy 50 cents worth of gas and giving them a penny of tax support. These are fly-over fiefdoms."
Isn't is funny how quickly liberals decided that men couldn't get pregnant and have abortions after all?
Two political parties... One is trying to keep this nation together... The other one stormed the Capitol and stacked the supreme court

"Texas Attorney General,  Ken Paxton, IS STILL INDICTED for fraud by selling securities with out a license 🔥‼️‼️‼️"
Well women are second class citizens.  It would be interesting if women end up losing their rights to crossing state lines let alone drive by themselves and have to have a male family member in the car and if crossing state lines women and teen girls have to pull over and step in a out door bathroom and take a test to prove she’s not pregnant and get questioned as to why your going to your destination.

Old men have no right telling women what they can or can’t do with their own bodies.
The Republican party has spent the last 50 years working up to the point where they could gain control of SCOTUS .......and overturn Roe ..........and during all that time they never realized they were on the wrong side of 80 % of the voting public ?????   That's kinda like Trump surrounding himself with a circle of would -be felons .....and surprised that someone dimed him out on the stolen docs .....!!!!!!    Color me shocked !!!!!
"I still believe it was bought.  A conspiracy to distract Americans while we're fleeced by the oil companies and the corrupt system/ politicians who allow them.  Something to fight for INSTEAD of fighting the higher price of oil.  Even though the demand keeps falling with every EV sold.  Like I said, just a conspiracy I believe.  Why else would they do something so blatantly stupid if it wasn't for money?"
"Democracy is on the ballot

"I am against abortion in general but there are certain circumstances that must be considered. DeSantis needs to be gone, his purpose is purily selfish. He has gone way overboard with everything."

"This is a horrible situation for the women of America. 
Incomplete miscarriages cannot be medically treated until the life of the woman is in danger.
There are no humanitarian considerations happening in these circumstances and the quality of life of these women going forward is in serious jeopardy."
Conservative today means we need to go back before the Age of Enlightenment. Say maybe the Dark Ages.
Republicans know that the only way to get elected is to cheat. So what do you expect them to do?
Roe vs wade disappears under joe biden’s dictatorship😆
"If the democrats, women as well as men, can’t see what the republicans are trying to do to 50% of American citizens then I feel very sorry for women in the USA! You all have a chance on November 8 to make sure that this will never happen by going to vote in masses! You can’t let it happen! VOTE! VOTE! VOTE!"
"Far right christofascist goofballs went too far in banning Roe. Women are now showing up in droves to vote for the Democrat. If enough win this November, Roe will be codified into law. Vote Blue. 💙"
"Roe v Wade didn't ""fall"".  It was executed by Trumpublican Christian Nationalist Nazis that lied, and deceived, under oath."
Agree 100% women should have right to do what they want not to be tell by the GOP who what all male white nation.
"We see more media propaganda. 
    Abortion is not banned. The Supreme Court examined the Constitution and found that nowhere within the framework of this document is there any mention of abortion. They came to the realization that Roe was an improper decision and they corrected it.  Now the subject of abortion or abortive procedures goes back to the state legislatures where it should’ve been in the beginning.
    It is now the duty of activist on both sides of the issue, both sides of the issue… Pro-choice and Pro life, to convince their elected state representatives to do the job that they were elected to do.  Some states will allow abortion and aborted procedures and others won’t. What we are seeing is democracy in action. We need to support democracy."
"That's a hideous and fallacious analogy with a  dog hitting a car. Clearly, you and Katie Phang have a contempt and disregard fo dogs. And moreover, the analogy is fallacious because the differences are greater than the simliarities."

2022 GOP blocked a bill for women right to travel to another state like slaves states did in 1800 to prevent slaves moving to FREEDOM owning them under that state law Think about it

Keep ur sins from our laws.. abortion is not constitutional..God overturn abortions..teach God's laws n they won't need abortion

"Aww look at the desperate trolls trying to convince the other 70% of the population that anti-abortion is more popular. You trolls are laughable at best, but pathetic would be the more accurate description.

SCOTUS and Republicans sealed their fate when they went after women. New voter registration among women is at an all time high. All polls are shifting, and popularity for those who are in support of a woman's right to choose is off the charts.

MAGATS better get their Kleenex ready, because you're about to see what happens when you motivate the voters. We outnumber you Neo-Fascists by A LOT. By a whole lot."
People are seeing the result of democrats failing to protect and codify Roe for the past 40 years.  Turns out campaigning on the pledge of protecting rights - and the fear of losing rights - is preferable to actually doing something that would have prevented this.
Red Wave coming to congress
"Republican candidates will ""pay the piper"" come Roe-vember💙"
"Fun fact: Nobody anywhere opposed abortion until segregationists realized they couldn't win running on segregation.
Racists invented abortion panic."
Women are second class now!!
We told them this would happen!  Codify a national right to healthcare including abortion care!
Well I am happy the women are rising against the man system to make the females baby factories..
We must come together and vote out all communist Christians. They are the very false witnesses that the Bible warns us of!!!!
"Democrats are obsessed with abortion, why is it so hard for 21st century women to prevent pregnancy with easily obtained birth control?"
"This is to distract you from the fact that Hunter's Laptop and Ashley's Diary are not ""Russian Disinformation"" like they told you which means Joe is a Pedo.  Democrats constantly lie and report it as truth."
I guess they never need kids just unborn baby they don't want.
imagine trying to convince the voters the main issue to vote on is abortion rights and not the rising cost of food
Covering up for Dem*entia Quid pro Joe's blunders
You don’t have the “right” to an abortion paid for by someone else.
"And here comes all the maggat trolls and bots to WAH WAH their little maga tears LMFAO 
🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤮"
It means reproductive rights are in tact and life is valued....
She thinks this is an own. Haha
I want to salute all these people. You guys saved so many life. Keep doing it peacefully. Just offering support from a distance can help save lives and I mean for both mother and daughter.
"This large, wide, and strong women shouldn't have to worry. No one would want to grape her."
Abortion is wrong it is murder. I am thankful these men are standing up and trying to get through to these selfish women.
It is sad how people get singed of as creeps for trying to stop the killing of a child
"Abortions ARE, and always WILL BE, one of the most SICK and WICKED acts one could commit (smh)🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢.

Once I researched and SAW a video on something called ""Partial Abortion,"" I realized how CRUEL and AWEFUL abortions truly are 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮❗️❗️❗️

People SHOULD stand in front of clinics, such as these, and protest  🪧🪧🪧🪧🪧👍❗️"
"GODDAMN, these people need to GET A LIFE."
It is so so sad that it is necessary to have escorts in order for women to make their own choices regarding their own bodies 😢
"Before a child is born these people are so eager to protect it, but after a child is born,  they leave the child into the world to suffer. Substandard elementary education, substandard high school education, no healthcare, no free college, no parental leave for parents and no government aid. I think abortion is a lot less cruel than letting the child come and live in the USA"
"4:12
And 16280000 lives were lost to abortion since 1977."
I busted a gut when she said this is life risking work.  No kidding.  A life gets terminated almost everyday in this work.
And dont forget the psyco senator's. 😮
Mostly old white men. Vote Dems.
"Well, my grandmother raised me, but I sure am glad my mom had me but you know Women do you have the right to close their legs…."
She’s probably just jealous because well it look like she’s probably hang had  many offers…😮
"They're not ""protestors."" They're ""harassers."" nothing better to do."
"Why can't these pro-lifers care about kids who are actually alive? Like the kids being killed in schools? Get a job. Stop harassing people outside health clinics. And of course it's all men. You can't call yourself ""pro life"" if you're threatening a clinic."
"...Hey, wait a minuite.
No possible way ""Shelly"" is an escort. None."
"When we were a young broke couple my wife had female problems and needed a partial hysterectomy. Planned parenthood was the only ones out there that stepped up and would help with it all.  Every visit we had to walk through these people calling us names, not even knowing what we were there for. They made me a lifetime supporter of PP with their “protests”."
They are hypocrites. More religious women have abortions then everyone else look it up
Government needs to force vasectomies.  Eliminating the need for abortion.
Abortion is murder common sense. Hypocrite evil selfish human beings Repent Or perish Jesus Christ is God Almighty manifested in the flesh for mankind's sins Hallelujah forevermore AMEN 🙏💗🔥
"This video is so freaking bias!! If they were telling the truth they would say that those embryos/fetuses have a heart beat, brain signals, feelings and pain! That they are brutally killed alive in their mothers’ womb while they have each of their members pulled, twisted and pulled until it’s dismembered off their bodies, each arm and legs, then the body is pinched and pulled to achieve the same goal - rip off everything into pieces - until only the head is floating around into their womb and then the abortionist crushes it down with a tongue tool and sucks everything left with and intra vaginal vacuum. Minutes earlier though there was a happy and peaceful baby protected at his/her mother womb, the most sacred place they could/should be! 
And ohh, before I forget, they also forget to tell the women that she’ll most likely live forever with emotional and spiritual and/or physical damage - things that can vary from like hating men and having hard relationship issues, way higher chances of all sorts of cancer, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and tendencies, having their uterus perforated during the procedure, having a hard time trying to get pregnant again in the future when it’s desired, having nightmares with that lost child, feeling empty and hollow like they are only existing and like there’s no life left for them and yes, even dying!! 
So yes, while you all celebrate and fight for the right to kill another human being - a powerlessness one - while you celebrate this oppression to the weak, this ability to kill the most pure being that you’ll ever face, that one that can love you like nothing else, cure your heart and bring you strength like only God can, you deny the fact that your killing your soul in the process and that you’re losing hope for your own self! You’re getting cozy in hell! Good luck and keep finding excuses to let the Devil slowly carry you down to denial, as you say to yourself “all is well” but you know you can’t even find the light switch of your own existence anymore. 
I hope though, that when you realize that your inside of one of the darkest and the deepest hole that you could be living in, I hope you’ll know and remember that there’s One that died for your sins and that He’s waiting for you with open arms, with immeasurable love and peace that He’s the only one capable to offer. I hope your path into repentance will help you to find healing together with your real self while enjoying the real freedom that living with Christ can only bring. He lives!"
Thinking it’s ok to murder an unborn child is sick.
How many of these hypocrites have adopted kids
So you make killing babies easier by volunteering weekly to stop people who want to help.  Makes sense

"I am fed up with fake news and people who think killing innocent human beings is a right. 
29 year old female here. Go shove your pro-hate and pro-killing agenda. 
Abortion is murder. How about u stop pushing your morality on people in the womb."
If a woman chooses to have an abortion she should never be allowed to have children again
"Baby Inside🫄👶
Oh, baby inside
Soon will not be able to hide
What will I choose
If baby lives, will I lose
God help
Can’t decide-
My deciding to engage in the physical

Oh, to go back to decide again
Now will I choose to take away life
Or will the life I save be baby’s and mine

"Women, the way to take control back from men is not to have sex with them if they don't want to legalize abortion.. They have a right to their body, but we don't have a right to ours."
Combine adoption with artificial wombs; would there still be a need for abortions?
Hey abortion protesters what about my right to choose what is best for my life?
"Believe 👏 your 👏 delusions 👏 I 👏 don’t 👏 care 👏 
But don’t force other to believe 👏 your 👏 delusions"
"If people appreciate the value of existence, then they should realize that life will be faced with hardships, both expected and unexpected. When faced with a decision, women should understand that whatever decision they end up making, there will be scorn either way. Is there a tie breaker? Yes. Whichever leads you down the path of honor is the path you should take. Then whoever scorns you will have nothing but empty words because they’re angry you didn’t take their advice. 
Final word, those women who have love for their fellow humans should realize they can’t kill unborn children because they didn’t ask to be created, but they would ask for a chance to be human like you."
"You guys are delusional . All the hate and anger comes from the abortion side . I had an escort on Saturday say the most foul things to an elderly women that was with me . Call her a filthy cun* and that she stick her brochures up her cun* and wished death on her and her grandkids . This was a 20 something male speaking to a woman that way . Where was the feminist females ? Laughing as he said it to her . Hypocrisy at its finest . Apart from the God you know exists you have no bases to call anything right or wrong without appealing to Gods law and absolute morality 
Repent and turn to Christ that you may live . 
Grace&Peace"
"Bombs? She just made that up, so everybody thinks anti-abortion protesters are violent. I haven't seen any violence, maybe the only violence is the babies that are getting killed. 😮"
There are zero reasons for killing a human in the womb.
These NO LIFE people who push their beliefs on others. Why can't they mind their own DAMN business. Get a life. Stop bothering people. Trump is the reason Roe Vs Wade was pushed through. These Maga republicans are the most horrible people. Anybody who supports Trump are crazy people. These people love Trump. I can't wait until Trump is convicted and sent to prison with his 91 felonies and 4 indictments.
Man abortian is evil. She is quite mean and confrontational tho
"I don’t believe in abortion, but I don’t believe everyone should be allowed to have a kids. I believe in eugenics . What the pro- life people don’t understand is we have a lot of useless and worthless people in the world."
"I'd be fascinated to see how much ""help"" they'd actually offer if a patient walked over and asked for help..."
Abortion should only be allowed if the fetus consents to it.
"""What is this?"", asks the escort.   This idiotic escort can't appreciate that many people view abortion clinics the same way they would view the gas chambers at Auschwitz. If they feel strongly that abortion is the murder of an unborn child, what should they do?  How should they be behaving?  Like it's no big deal?  Frankly, given that many view abortion clinics as baby-killing stations, I am really surprised more clinics are not burned to the ground."
0:33 take a gander at yourself 🤣
"When protester scream murderer and ask if your interested in signing an petetion thankyou for my interest inthe abortion clinic protesta my desire to know more about these protesta im familiar with all of these sir,."
The bottom line is abortion is killing a gift from God.
let’s go. this old man knows what’s up. #keep babies alive
40% of women who get 1 have more than one.
Baby killer NPC
Why does she look exactly how you think she would look
Why do these moms feel so bad about getting an abortion?
"All cellular life is sentient, it's just common sense theory of Cellular bias of Consciousness...

the main argument for the termination of human multi-cellular life, is that the fetus doesn't feel pain...

well there are multiple ways to terminate Multi-cellular life without being pain involved... for instance Captive-bolts are absolutely painless, because the brain has no pain receptors, and the brain is destroyed before the brain can receive signals from pain receptors...

vegans constantly state plants don't feel pain so it's okay to eat them, well the brainstem the hub of the nervous system doesn't actually feel pain either it interrupts it, destroying the nervous destroys the argument it's immoral.   

if it's acceptable to terminate any cellular life form on the bias that it doesn't feel pain, that's a Pandora's Box that should not be opened..."
It ain't no cookie cutter solution. Humans lead difficult and complex lives. Don't matter which side your on Pro or Anti. Hope we all can come to a middle ground.
Abortion is not reproductive health care. Especially for the innocent unborn babies.
I hope the Army Of God finds where this is
"lmao as if making tiktoks is going to change shit, these pro- “””””””””””””””””””choice“””””””””””””””””””  people are hilariously idiotic."
I love that she has the same name as a legendary jazz drummer.
"I'm sorry I'm pro choice but third trimester? That's a bit much unless there is a serious health threat to both the baby and the mother. Not going to judge the guy or the mothers, not my place but whoa."
A BOMB?
Good for that man!
"The devil is very respectful and nice.. very kind believe me 
What make you think that Jesus was stupid ?? 
God defend and make justice to this man that are praying for this innocent souls.
You women.. shame on you 
Ofcourse evil CNN will support you.. what is new 
Disgusting CNN and this women you are not doing any help..
You are guiding people to a eternal tormented hell"
"I'm kinda surprised that people feel the need to stick their noses into other's businesses. Yes, abortion sucks, but we can't deny that it's necessary at times.

We can always do the one thing some tend to do: Shut up, because it's not your place to judge. 

We can also... find solutions to to the problems that lead to abortion. Ideas anyone?"
As a protestor please know that you are litteraly harassing people over there with your opinion. Well turns out people can have different opinions about the same topic. Learn to respect it.
Men need to use contraception all the time
It would be nice if these busybodies actually helped the people they are trying to bend to their will with financial support if a patient ever decided to keep their baby.
It's always the men who can't find the cl*t and/or never made a woman c*m outside of these abortion clinics.
Good job joe ! GOD bless you brother.
For people who say the pro life why would you shoot somebody 😂
"She is a hero. We need to network support for people who help us keep our rights. Both of those individuals, the doctor and the escort, are truly amazing people."
The anti abortions are the same people who shame single mother
"the mom from Detroit rock city said "" im here to support the mothers right... to choose life"". 100% chance she hoards cats and calls it a rescue."
God wants unsullied warriors. He gets them from abortions. Do you want Satan to win?😮.        Why else would a all powerful god make pregnancies he knows will end in abortions ❤
"This has become the hearts of people, cold, abortion is murder: Revelation 9:21"
Abortion is Murder
"I'm pro life, but actual medical abortion,  as in one that is needed to save the life of the mother is obviously something that has to be done. But apart from that I don't agree with abortion.  If you don't want a child use protection. What gets me with the whole ""pro choice"" people are the way they dehumanise unborn children.  As a father who watched my son grow throughout the pregnancy,  saw him in the scans and watched him being born on what was the best and proudest day of my life, to then lose my beautiful baby boy at 2 years of age.  The past 2 years have been hell for me, but its taight me that every life is precious,  an unborn child is very much alive and deserves protection."
"1. Why blue some of the posters? Do they show disgusting acts done in the clinics?
2. I’m not saying that there have never been death threats, but lots of people in the comments are talking about them and how much screaming the protesters were doing and how violent it was. From this video, which is obviously edited for maximum drama by CNN to only show the worst of what they saw, all I saw was passionate people pleading with women to not make the terrible choice of murdering their own child. They offered help, and they tried to inform. The escorts were yelling just as loud; everyone wants their opinion to be heard.
3. These violent attacks/murders all happened before 2009 from what I can tell. Most in the 90s. I cannot justify these attacks, of course, but crazy people exist, and when a large group of people believes innocent babies are being murdered legally, violence is going to happen. This is not a threat; I would never do this and I strongly disavow anybody using violence in a movement that is supposed to cause peace and life for all people, but when a system like the one we have currently is in place, it is one that breeds violence by default, so maybe it’s time to change the system. I’m surprised there haven’t been more deaths honestly. Furthermore, in the past 2 years alone (so this is recent), there have been hundreds of attacks on pro-life churches and pregnancy resource centers. These include firebombing, physical assault, and more that aren’t counted like the murder attempt of pro-life Judge Bret Kavenaugh. I’m not saying because there is violence on both sides that that excuses violence on one side (can we all agree that all of this violence is bad?) but please stop trying to paint an entire movement through the actions of a few crazy people in the past 30 years. Again, statistically I’m surprised there aren’t more crazy pro-lifers who are willing to murder in this large time frame. Also, why pregnancy resource centers? I kind of get churches, although that’s bad too, but why attack places that provide a bunch of resources, help, and love to women in need (everything except murder basically)?"
“The right to life!!!” You mean the right to forcibly use another person’s organs against their will? That’s not a “human right”.
"Forced birthers: we want to kill people for having abortions

Me: i DEFINATELY dont see the irony here"
Lol why are these pro abortion woman always the last woman any sane man would want to knock up
VOTE BLUE! It is our only hope.
"Abortion is murder. You don't want kids , keep your legs closed."
"I find it funny that the far left can get through their thick skull’s that even though abortion may be illegal in some states, it doesn’t stop people from getting abortions in those states, but they can’t comprehend how making guns illegal will not stop criminals from obtaining firearms. The irony is ridiculous."
The bloke in the red coat your god hates you
"If prolife people are so sure they are wait, they should wait and let god be the judge"
Killing people kind of sounds like the opposite of prolife to me
Prayers don't pay the bills
"A baby being able to suck its thumb in the womb is a reflex. All animals have reflexes. Therefore, we can equate a fetus to the level of an animal in terms of its development at that point. If prolife people eat meat, they shouldn't have a problem with abortion unless they believe in the bible."
"I think maybe i should protesting outside of pregnancy crisis centers telling women ""don't let them talk you into a choice that isn't right for you"". Maybe they will finally realize how annoying it is to not let people go about their business."
"Come on
You're being extremist with this false portrail of the anti abortion activists
If they are anti abortion then they believe they are being anti killing & anti murderer 
They will not hurt anyone 
They are just giving a chance to mothers to reflect 
Had you, leftists not been aware that you are dis-empowering women & robbing them their rights
You wouldn't have been so scared of dissent
I am not pro not against abortion,  & at the end of the day no matter what you or your opposition try to either push for abortion or prevent abortion 
It is going to be the parents call
Not either one of you
Can decide 
But you leftists, 
Your fear of opposition is what alarms red lights on my side
Dictators are afraid that their subjects realize they are being oppressed 
Dictators are afraid that their subjects will wake up one day
& overthrow them
That is what makes them afraid of opposition 
& that is what make you (leftists) also afraid of opposition 

Guys what I am trying to pass to you, is that
Your handling of the matter
Shows that you are
A bunch of
Dictators"
Welllll 🤔 to tell you the truth the violence shouldnt have happened but i dont feel bad for the people who were killed because they were the ones helping kill hundreds of innocent babies. In a way it was karma. 🤷 I see them as stupid people that allow the Devil to use them because theyre not smart enough to see thw truth or the fact of they just dont care. 😢 I feel sorry for the people who have tht mindset that abortions are ok.
"Abortion is murder, and anyone who does not see this is subhuman."
She is doing gods work thank you thank you thank you  🙏🏻
Abortion is MURDER
"repent, abortion is evil watch an animation about what goes on during an abortion or even worse a late term abortion"
We arent going anywhere.
"And Jesus (supposedly) said “and if they don’t want to hear your message, shake the dirt from your shoes, and move on.”  These so called christians clearly don’t experience the love of the christ as he thought. 😢"
If I lived in that town I would burn that building to the ground b
This woman is pathetic!!
That walk should be hard... 2 go in alive.. 1 comes out ..the innocent baby murdered.. it doesn’t matter their story.. there’s no excuse for killing babies.. and this lady is evil.. she would of been assisting Hitler.. it should be hard.. you killing babies.. babies.. BABIES!!!!!
Thank u for showing the world we are trying to save babies.. your a demon and you just exposed yourself.. why don’t u protect the babies your helping murder.. 🤔.. u think?
"More people dont have an idea of what happens INSIDE the clinics. Most women who face how sick it is end up changing their mind.... seen dozens and dozens of accounts, multiple personally."
Bro she's a bouncer for a fuckin abortion clinic 😹 Jesus Christ
"Abortion should not be available to the general public, only to victims of assault or to those whose lives are actually in danger, and those are a small portion of the population."
"Imagine how many directors and workers have to suppress their thoughts, feelings, and consciences after seeing what they see of what goes on inside. Suppression is a major key here."
1:20 OMFG She literally has to scout for bombs because of radical Pro-Lifers. I need to look for some real radical Pro-Choicers if there are even any out there if i'm to civilly conversate with Pro-Lifers.
Dan is going to be disappointed when he just dies and rots in the ground.

"I KN.EW YOU WH.EN YOU WERE IN YOUR MOTH.ERS WOMB,JESUS SAID, PR.OOF THAT UNB.ORN LIVES MAT.TER."
Why don't anti-abortionists start with labs that create embryos for IVF?  At least attack labs before women!  I have yet to see a bunch of these people picketing labs.  It's a desperate play to control women that comes before actual love for life.
This woman is brave and committed.  Thank God for people like her.
How many abortions should a woman allowed to have ? I have done this myself and I really regret it after loosing my 15 year old son
"0:16 ironic she says that. I FOR ONE think folks don't have a knowledge what goes down INSIDE the abortion clinic and their history.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A16gzm9eaa8

Planned parenthood aint interested in yo ass. They literally had a history of forceful/tricked sterilization of minority groups so they can't have babies, and these are the people women goto to abort kids. They were first established with sterilization and castration for men and women in mind. Don't let the cute name fool you look up their dark history. And even with that 1% shouldn't be an excuse for the 99%. People need to stop using something as bad and horrific as rape to push their agendas. Sure rape and imminent danger to the woman's health are good reasons to abort. But the reality is in a good chunk of pregnancies the women are in ABSOLUTELY no danger just giving birth but they still abort. Heck abortion has WAY MORE danger and complications than just giving birth, kill the kid and risk moms life. Abortion is not contraceptives' and shouldn't be used as such. They literally giving out day after pills etc... etc... for free go use some."

What is so wrong with just keeping your legs clpsed? I just dont get it
If kids didnt want the baby they shouldve never gotten pregnant. But when the baby is killed they go to heaven. This is like the same when jesus was born when the soldiers were killing babies.
The people abortion need jesus and its wrong killing babies
What a brave woman!
"Are you seriously trying to have me empathize with a fat, abortion loving women who thinks disagreeing with people is ""life saving work"". I sincerely doubt someone advocating for execution is someone to empathize with. Also 5:16 - For those who are not aware assault by mutual consent is defined as ""an application of force that arises out of a consensual fight cannot be an assault because both parties have consented to the physical contact"" - also known as she was also responsible for engaging in violence but, CNN wants to make it seem that she was victimized."
People need to mind their own business
THESE PEOPLE NEED TO GET A LIFE.
"I wonder how men would REALLY feel if the child they made, INSTANTLY became the full responsibility of the FATHER and he then owes big bucks for pain, suffering and permanent physical disfigurement and also future mental anguish of mother AND child when that child comes around to be mothered ect.? Oh, lets not forget to RIP open THEIR tiny hole 20Xs bigger on their sexual organ N make them gain 20X pounds on their abbs. never to come off again...stretch out their  pecks to sag, all that fun stuff they judge us on.  Also its the end to working that good job w no paid leave but expensive child care and loads of chores for 16 years  Just saying it takes two to tango so why is it only the mother that gets all the pressure ?  Wheres insurance paid MALE birth control ? Afterall Viagras covered by insurance.? 😢😢😢"
Those anti abortion people who target abortion clinics should be put into the gulag express train and make them work hard labor and teach those prolifers the harsher consequences for making woman have miscarriages and forced pregnancies.
"Assault by mutual consent? Really, do you think the poor woman trying to protect these clients consented to the assault? Sounds like the ""authorities"" in the area are sympathetic to the right to life folks. What a load of shit!!!"
I dont agree with that doctor being murdered. All murder is wrong. 😢
Kids are being killed inside but let’s joke around
Stop killing the innocent babies. If you're so pro-choice let the choice making begin before the sex occurs
good arguments on both sides tbf. That's why it's such a dividing issue. I feel like its left vs right with every issue tho.
Goddess Bless these brave escorts doing the Lady’s work protecting these women from the abuse of anti abortionists.
"Everyone has the right to life, no one has the right to live at someone else's expense. I'm quite certain that every-ONE of these protestors do NOT want someone else to make a major decision in their life for them. WHY then are they so insistent on making decisions for others?"
Apparently the doctor’s killer was home sick on the Sunday they taught the commandment “Thou shalt not kill.”
The main lady in the video giving me communist Karen vibes lol
What's a little funny is that a only 11 adults have died in the last like 20 years. Just imagine the thousands of babies killed in that time.
Just walk up and ask them to adopt the child. That will stop them in their tracks.
"How is it not illegal to stand outside an abortion clinic and yell shit at people? I would love to see all these ""protesters"" thrown in jail. They're literally just there to harass women."
"THEY ARE NOT CHILDREN OR BABYS ITS A CLUMP OF GOD DAMN SEELS IS YOU LISTENED IN SCHOOL THEY FUCKING TEACH YOU THAT (sorry for the spelling mistakes english aint my first language) and also why just why what do benefit from doing this trumatizing YOUNG woman. ok yeah you can ""pUt It Up FoR aDoPtIoN"" what do you do when they come to look for you what do you say you cant just say ""oh yeah i didn't want you"" thats heartbraking for the child. what do you do when you got SA WHAT DO YOU DO! keep the baby NO FUCKING NO you dont want a reminder of what happened to you like who wants that. these people are so selfish saying its ""wHaT gOd WaNtS"" like no one gives a shit NO ONE."
"My grandmother is pro-abortion. She gets mad when a woman has lots of babies, but then goes on about a woman's right to choose, and a woman's body. I guess that only applies when you want to murder a baby, not have one.

Pro-choicers don't care about women's rights. They care about murdering babies."
You will eventually find out what side you should be on…
"The ignorance of Anti abortionis kills women. Some of them bomb clinics and attack people, others are voting to ban abortion. Maternall death rate in abortion ban states is at least 25 percent highter than non ban states. 
They have no idea of the health reasons for abortion. 
When pushed about the mother's health they back track and try to make exceptions. At the root they are about slut shaming really."
Your ignorance of reproductive difficulties killd women.
Men who have never had s cimplicatec pregnancy telling gjose who have they cant have an abortion.
"Goodjob pro choice or should i say pro infanticide. Wow and the fact that the pro choice woman forces the camera is the face of a poor grandma. Also, why is she insulting the peaceful protesters so aggresively like walking up to them and yelling. saying that your adding humor is just messed up when your talking about murder."
"Men have no right to say ANYTHING. Plus, who thinks the choice is an easy one??? These people who help the clinic and the patients and amazing."
"I wonder how many of those probirthers have filled out paperwork for adoption, or have actually adopted."
Notice that its mostly white males leading these protests.....who gave them the right to make decisions about women's bodies...?
I wanted to hate this but the comments says i shouldn't i still don't know if I hate this or not
"During the third trimester, your fetus continues to grow in size and weight. The lungs are still maturing, and the fetus begins to position itself head down. By the end of the third trimester, the fetus is about 19 to 21 inches long and weighs, on average, 6 to 9 pounds.

That ""Dr"" murders babies."
"Some men and women are too stupid to be able to avoid unwanted pregnancy, so we have to allow the murder unwanted children before they are born"
"How do they know they weren't married women who had an affair and got pregnant?! According to the bible the husband is supposed to make her get an abortion!  Oh what great christians we have in this country!....reserving judgement for god alone, murdering doctors and nurses and staff, harassing peeps, littering, and not helping out the poor.....bet they didnt give away their possessions to the poor either.......bet they've never adopted a baby so they could be a part of their own ""solution"".  I believe the men had even shaved!!!! BAD CHRISTIANS! Thats not allowed in the bible!  Women had ears pierced, which is called defilement of the body.   ""Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself"""
"""Whatever help you need, we have.""
Birth Control, Paid Leave, Child care, Food Stamps, Social Security and Medicaid?
""Fuck You."""
"Matthew 6:5. ""When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on street corners so that others may see them. Amen, I say to you, they have received their reward.""

Learn it and throw it back into the face of any uppity Christian you come across, they probably don't even know that verse or have ever read it to be serious here. If they couldn't cherry pick their religion they'd have nothing."
"God bless those men and women encouraging 🙏 and praying for life. Children are GOD'S GIFT, not a burden. Our Constitution names our God given rights as unalienable, LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Without life, there is nothing else."
"Notice the differences between prolifers and prochoice. Prolifers think they have the right to enforce their beliefs and opinions onto others. One woman who would rather die than abort expects all other women should agree. Um hell no. Another woman who would rather die than have a baby wouldn't expect anyone to agree with her. Prolifers stereotype abortion as being evil and those who have them are evil sluts. One woman chose to die so her baby could live. The baby was never taken off life support and only lived 17 days. Not so much being noble as it is senseless and futile. If someone else wants better than that for their baby how can they be faulted? People have debates between length of life vs quality of life in hospice, it's no difference for beginning of life."
Shame on these religious fanatics who persecute and bully vulnerable women.they have no right over women's bodies and shd mind their own business.they shd be put on prison instead
"Pro-lifers, killing and making death threats. Who would have thought. 😂
Amazing how they are completely blind to this equating to exactly what they're protesting against."
Simple way to get rid of them is pressure them with adoption papers
"On my pack of cigarettes it says “smoking can cause my unborn child to die”. If anti-abortionists are serious about saving fetuses, then they would also have to treat smokers like criminals. That would mean no more smoking in the red states like Kentucky and Virginia where the tobacco grows.🤔 Just another example of Republican hypocrisy?"
Oh is he is for a BIG SHOCK WHEN HE REALIZES THAT THERE IS NO ONE THERE.
"Lady you are a SAINT, or better still you are a good HUMAN BEING."
"They so called pro-life and anti-abortion they take away abortion rights but then after birth of the child they will do nothing when the kids are killed after starting their  K-12 education, its like a delayed death yeah we support you being born but when you start pre-k bye bye baby."
Abortion is a violent and barbaric act. It has no place in a civilized society.
"Dan, when were you pregnant? Did you have an abortion or did you give birth?  Were you ever forced to become pregnant and then forced to get and aboprtion? No, never, etc...then MIND YOUR OWN F-ing BUSINESS."
"MY BODY MY CHOICE.  Thank you to the escorts, you are sadly needed but women are eternally grateful for your time and effort. THANK YOU"
They respect life but will on occasion kill someone involved in receiving or assisting in an abortion.  Very Christian of them.
Sad to see these comments you people need to take responsibility when having unprotected sex.And CNN shame on you for thinking abortions are harmless
"Yep
Turn the spotlight on them
Their ridiculous platitudes
Their lack of compassion
Their ignorance of basic science"
"Bloody good on her! These people are criminals, not to mention hypocrites. They really couldn't give a shit about ""unborn life"", they only care about their money and their guns. Put them in maximum security jail!!"
"I'm glad these guys are trying to do the RIGHT THING. Have any of you seen that video of the BABY in the process of being aborted on the ultrasound trying to fight off the big scissors? The baby is trying to push away the tool by which it is murdered at the hand of an abortionist. It's heartbreaking. These ""doctors"" punch a hole in the skull of the baby and suck out the brains depressing the skull to KILL THE BABY, how can anyone supporting this procedure call themselves human?"
"I've been looking so much of this and it's so horrible and depressing that people think it's okay to murder their children, in the end it's God who will judge these injustices and Jesus will come and wipe away every tear and I'm happy to know that all the babies who were slaughtered are In heaven, Jesus come soon"
"Sick to see women believing they are some kind of heroes. Truly shameful that they are so immoral. They waste the time the should use to go on a diet, lose that fat, find a man, go to church and build a family for the betterment of our country and the world. It's tragic what has been done to the young women of this generation."
Who ever thinks they have the right to tell someone what to do that is none of their business and  if you really believe in God and meeting your maker when you die and paying for your sins what you are doing is making no sense at all because who ever chooses to have an abortion will have to meet their maker when their time is up but there’s nothing you can do because it’s not your sin to confess so why do you think you have a right to take choices away from others because you are not God! We are all living the laws of this free country to make our own choices and in this case these choices have nothing to do with anyone except the woman who should be able to make her own choices whether anyone agrees or not so If you disagree with them choices that’s fine but it’s not your choice in a free country to make decisions about anyones life or choices. Instead of ridiculing them or yelling at them maybe just pray for them and let God be the one to judge their choices. I know God would not condone the violence being used to make a point either. Let’s not forget who ever does these violent acts which in some people got hurt and in the end these people will also be judged. This is my opinion on this subject.
"The doctor said if women cannot have access to abortions that ""...women will start dying, which is horrible....""  If he thinks this is ""horrible"", imagine the absolute horror of having all of your body parts literally torn off of your body one at a time while resting ""safely"" inside your mother's tummy. He can have compassion for the women dying but not the babies dying, where is the logic and morality in that? If we take the baby's right to life away, it is only a matter of time until that right will inevitably cease to exist for the remainder of us. This will undoubtedly lead us down a path where if someone decides in the future that your life doesn't matter, they just take it away from you and you cease to exist. Is that the kind of world you want folks?  

The doctor’s last statement is “I just pray that it wakes people up.”  Ironically, the one who needs to wake up the most is the doctor.  I do not think God would be pleased with anybody who takes the life of an innocent person and especially those who make their living slaughtering innocent children.  If the doctor is a truly praying man, he would be wise to repent from his taking of innocent lives and to pray for forgiveness that God might be merciful on his soul.  That doctor is in his sunset years, and it won’t be long now until he will stand before God and will have to give an account for his atrocious actions."
"These people need to sign a legal agreement to give 20% of their income to sustain these women in dire straits, and to place their hand on the Bible and swear to God to fulfill the agreement."
This is terrible what if you were aborted
I wish people stop talking about this stuff. This society hates anything truthful.
Shelley sums up the pro-death image; looks like a bulldog chewing a wasp!!!
How many kids has Dan adopted?
The sad people who believe that their views should be forcefully imposed upon others demonstrates their fanatical tendencies.. the deeply held belief that their have the right to scare and intimidate others show that they are akin to Nazis..
I wonder how many of those self righteous religious extremists have adopted?
No not to choose life. Your not letting her choose her life.
Whatever it takes to save a life!
"""we're here to help you---we are praying for you...""  but would you adopt my baby, or help pay for prenatal care, or help support me so I can stay with my child?  Unfortunately, all these dimwits can offer is ""prayer"".   They won't spend one dime and vote for political hacks that echo their baseless ideology."
https://youtu.be/SV-xjH2qG-Y
"So since 1977, at least 11 people have been killed in anti abortion attacks. And people claim to be pro life?"
"I support abortion if a woman/girl got pregnant from r@pe, or if giving birth will kill the mother. But having an abortion because you just don't want a baby?? That's selfish and inhumane.

If you don't want to get pregnant then just don't do it in the bedroom, if you end up getting pregnant then that's on you. And the sad thing is that near 97% of women who get abortions do it because they feel like it..."
Thank God for the amazing men and women who oppose the murder of innocent children... shame on those who support abortion. Repent and follow Jesus Christ he will forgive you and give you peace like you've never had.
"Since this seems to be a religious issue, has anyone asked the anti-abortionist where in the bible it says abortion is wrong."
We don't know their heart we don't know know their story. What we do know is they are murderers. 11 people have been killed at abortion clinics. More than 60 million fetuses have been killed.
The reason for shouting is the patrons are murderers.
I see that if people die because they should abort and the state should be held responsible for ALL DEATHS. Open the court. Imagine killing a doctor. May all repub's that ignore a death of a pregnant women rot in jail. It is now the blame of anti abortionest if a woman dies.
Abortion is evil and you don't have the right to kill your child.  No one has the right to kill another human being unless it is self defense.
That one guy had been doing this since 1973? That is a mind that has been unable to alter its position in 50 years. Geez...like living in a cave.
"So, They're anti abortion but think it's OK to Murder someone who's just doing their part to keep women safe. You'll find that the women who choose Abortion usually don't have a choice. Leave them alone and live your own life.."
Looks like the average street anti-abortion protestors are on Social Security or unemployed.
Making money by butchering small bodies what a shame
"I would literally I volunteer for this job.  These people will harass people over their beliefs, which is absurd.  I would love to use my sarcasm against them.  Every day, I drive past a planned parenthood in my town.  They have protestors, any they don't even perform abortions there.  They send you off-site to another town.  The planned parenthood in my town provides many other important services. Again, they dont even do abortions there, but they stand out there with their signs protesting their beliefs.  I would just let them hit me and laugh."
Why are pro abortion women always the ones that don't have to worry about it.
God bless her
"Until those abortion protesters do more to alleviate social injustice, it is clear that their real reasons for their stance is they want poor women to have their babies so they can have soldiers to defend their standard of living. They don't give a fig for unborn babies in any other country."
"They say it's hard to them to do their job as a Murderer of a innocent chilld. 

I know this isn't right to say, because maybe they have their own reason. 
BUT REMEMBER ""IF LIVE BECAUSE OF BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS, YOU'LL DIE BY THE SAME THE BLOOD IN YOUR HANDS."
Sanctimonious murder
"Shelly, Shelly, Shelly! You are not humorous at all! I wonder how much humor you’ll find in Hell. 

She said “this is literally like life risking work”…. HELLO!!!! NO SHIT SHERLOCK! Risking the lives of innocent children. Wake up Shelly and all you naive people!!!!"
Woah Such Empowerment We Are Killing Baby's Yay
"You can't pray and  perform abortion,praying is talking to God, He doesn't give consent to kill He said thy shall not kill"
Shelly is a hero
Pro life moms got birth to all of this pro abortion activists. Irony ha?
Did She filmed her Mom on Tiktok too?
".08% > of women have health issues from having birth,.....my daughter told me,....that she support abortion,..1 TIME THEN  her name goes on the whore list! Also the whore needs to pay the bill,...not tax payers!"
The irony of these people crying about 11 deaths at abortion clinics no one you literally murder babies everyday
I know those evil men who you know care about babies being murdered and she should be more concerned with the fact she doesn't have a neck. Diabetes and heart attacks are in her future.
These are strong people protecting babies and protecting the lives of people that cannot protect themselves. I'm actually surprised that there has only been 11 deaths compared to hundreds of thousands of dead fetuses. There is no excuse for people that do this to other human beings that are born in the so-called greatest country in the world and say that their life was not going to be good. Just a bunch of excuses
"Should carry a sign asking the pro lifers if God is pro life then ask them to answer. Except Noah's family God drowned every man, woman, child and fetus..  Doesn't sound like pro life to me."
All the forced birth ppl here is sick
Who has this much spare time to protest against someone else's choice 😂 their body their choice
these murderers
People outside the clinics protesting pro-life need to foster babies so many that they need help. You are so pro-life then take care babies in need of foster parents. Instead of complaining and protesting outside clinics and praying occupy your time taking care of babies.
why is it that most of them dont need to worry about getting pregnant anyway
"Chossing to get a abortion is a painful enough decision, without putting up this judgment and endangerment, if you don’t believe in abortion don’t get one’, but please don’t hinder everyone’s rights"
"Personally, I don't like the idea of abortion BUT people have no right to decide what someone else wants to do with their life, we are not the ones raising it."
What is this land whale talking about?
What a dog. Leftie women are all ugly. Only good looking people deserve to have opinions.
How you gunna fight for somethings life that ain’t even alive than kill an actual living person 💀💀
Why all ways prochoice look like LGBTQIA’s ++ gender fluid cat’s whatever they call them self !!!!
I pray for these protesters in Jesus name. Great is your reward in heaven❤
There is deadly violence at abortion clinics every day. It just doesn’t matter because those lives don’t have voices yet.
i don’t care who you are. but if you don’t make ANY exceptions for SA victims then you’re disgusting.
Zog propaganda
"I loved the very loud leaf blower!
Let's get this straight if these ppl think it's ok to murder ppl who help women get a abortion they are the worst type of hypocrite! It doesn't matter if they use religious beliefs as justification or if they are simply saying all life is or should be protected once they commit murder or advocate for it then they are doing the same thing they accuse the clinic employees are doing. No man has the right(either religiously or morally) to take another life!"
What people don't have a realistic picture of is what happens IN AN ABORTION.
"People need to understand that these people don't need help from prayers or gods, they need help financially. How are you supposed to raise a child when you get minimum wage and even if there is a way to raise said child what will they turn out to be? Prayer doesn't help it never does, sure praying makes you feel like someone is helping you but that only strengthens your will"
The reporter at the end is so misinformed.  There has NEVER been a Constitutional right to abortion.
"Let's not act like everyone that goes to the clinic has been r*ped, 90% of them had sex and didn't wear protection and now want an abortion because the baby is an inconvenience... I understand people that get raped ... But most of them are sl*gs that have been normalised in society..."
Don't worry sweetie. You will never be in the predicament to gave to choose to murder your baby
"What a line. Graphic and violent messages? No way. Why would someone do that to people wanting to tear babies apart piece by piece? And proclaim it as a right? You really shouldn't be trying to guilt-trip other people for responding to your heinous and atrocious actions. And fyi, violent protests come from your side of the aisle, not mine."
These people are decrying murder while facilitating it.
"A baby shouldn't have to die so u can be a 304. It's wrong. Don't care what the trolls say if u add up rape and incest it accounts for less than 2 percent so ur argument is trash. Everyone in support of this disgusting procedure should sit in and watch. Watch little faces being put on a table. Arms, legs, brain tissue, etc. Then tell us it's not a baby. You are some vile, disgusting people. It should be illegal it's murder plain and simple"
Thank you for helping women
Wack conservatives
She's awesome. She must feel really good helping out those womsn kill their babies.
We should be using artificial wombs. It would give people far more options and the parents wouldn't have to make the horrible decisions. Ask all women what type of birthing they would prefer. I bet artificial wombs gets chosen first. If you explain it correctly.
The baby is alive. Give it up for adoption. Its murder. Satanic murder.
How about the rights of the baby you are murdering
Abortion is murder end of story
"""this is literally life-risking work!"" yeah exactly, risking the lives of the unborn"
"Once again to people that get abortions, the baby inside,..the unborn baby is in your body it's not your body if it were your body, you would be the one getting aborted."
"I mean yeah these are abused by people alot and do need to be closed. People use them as ""magic eraser"" factories for disposing of humans in some legal round about way. Whether people want to hear this or not. Most of this comes with irresponsible choices and very few from seemingly legit unchosen decisions. But at the end of the day. The human growing inside of you. Didn't get to chose the circumstances as to how they appeared and formed inside of you. You chose to make them and then destroy them. Such nice people."
What a hero! Wow! She risks her life to help women end the life of the innocent baby.  It is a tragic death of those involved in the premeditated taking of thee innocent.  Women are dying and maimed in the process of abortion. Every day babies die at the hand of the these people who will answer to GOD.
Third trimester abortions should not be elective expect in very rare circumstances such as a baby developing in a life-infeasible way. I am more pro-choice the farther back into a pregnancy but if a baby can survive outside of the womb I see no reason it should be ok to kill it. That third-trimester abortionist is disgusting.
"You can also look for the telecommunication lines going into the building.  Although electrial wires are likely in thick conduit, telecommunications are lines that go to peds next to the building property lines.   It only takes a second to cut the lines and to disable the building."
"Hey if the protestors want to make it difficult for abortion clinic to function, there is a very simple fast way to do.  Wait until dark when the clinic closes and quickly apply super glue or Epoxy to all the door locks.   The glue will harden making the locks impossible to open."
Shelley is only helping selfish women. She is not helping babies to live. Abortion is the most extreme form of child abuse.
Can we not normalize killing babies ? I understand that certain situations are sensitive but most are just inconvenienced by a baby. Just don’t have sex lol
Even especially if the woman is raped she should have the right to have an abortion
It should be a woman's choice to have the abortion 100%
Of course she was a rainbow vest😂
"Finally a rational  comments section. Feels like coming home after fighting a battle out there. 

You're doing amazing work! Keep it up!!

All of you here are amazing and I appreciate each one of you 💜"
Performing 3rd trimester abortions is murder. No one should be murdered including staff.
"I'm against the murder of unborn babies to but NO ONE likes protesters. This is why so many people don't like groups like political groups like ANTIFA, BLM, LGBTQ+, NO OIL. These groups dusrupt the community and don't care about the people that they are supposed to be supporting."
"Why does it matter to these ""pro-lifers"" what someone else who they do not know in any way shape or form do with their bodies? They will never see these people again! The fact they get so involved for literally 10 mins and then move on to the next person to scream at is despicable. Jesus would not be standing outside these clinics, and they believe they are following in his footsteps. Pro Choice literally allows pro lifers the ability to have their babies and not abort them, but they want to take that away for everyone else? Give me a break. Theyre a bunch of clowns hiding behind this veil of being a ""good Christian."" there is nothing holy about the torment they are giving the most vulnerable people."
Those protesters stop the support after it's too late
Those protestors LIE about abortion
"All humans babies to adults have a right to live. That’s a god given right, and no one should take that away from you. Protect all lives, protect thy unborn lives. But good thing the anti abortion support grows. More n more younger generations are actively protesting against abortions. More ppl waking up. God bless America."
Funny how most of these pro-abortionist are the ones least likely to be pregnant
I really can't wrap my brain how anyone who thinks they are christian would think that taking away my freewill which was given to me by god can possibly think they are doing gods work WOW
I'm proabortion as long as they destroy the vessel during
"""life risking work"" yeah not your life tho right. Just the babies."
"How many fake ectopic  pregnancy storied can there be? And no pro life doctor, pro life  hospital or state would allow a woman to  die due  to an ectopic pregnancy. It's silly. That's all you pro baby destroyers got?   The ectopic stories are just not true."
These same people (protesters) are the type to death threat someone’s trans child… maybe even they’re own.
"Because she’s so likely to get pregnant, right?"
"instead of encouraging people to kill their poor little baby, why don't you hop on the treadmill for a bit help yourself first"
She is not a hero.
Your killing a innocent baby the Bible literally says their innocent people are stupid and you women that has had an abortion you are disgusting and a horrible person for killing a innocent baby your literally carrying the new generation in your stomach be more responsible because abortion is disgusting and you are disgusting
That’s honestly disturbing to lighten the mood that much about death. You don’t have to get political or religious to get the feeling or sense it’s morally wrong to kill any living thing.
I don’t think she EVER has to worry about getting pregnant.
Its always the crazy religious loonys.
"They need to get a life,mind their own business they have that crazy
look Evangelical nut look.Not one 
looks normal I believe they all have
mental issues just look at them tell
me I'm wrong."
THIS IS SO FUNNY OMFG HE WAS ON A LADDERRRRR
"Let the WOMEN decide for themselves whether or not to carry the seeds of the evil MEN do to them. I will agree to ban abortion only if  they also pass a law
that will allow the court to order the castration of men who commit the crime of rape and incest."
"Yeah, this go is SO HORRIBLE saying things like ""you are wonderfully and beautifully made"".
What kind of horrible person would try to convince a woman from murdering her unborn child?

Abortion activists are SICK.
This woman should look in the MIRROR and ask :""what is this"".

Lady, YOU are the big mouth.  These people are NOT on the murder clinics grounds.
The fact is she just cant STAND it when someone holds a position that she disagrees with.

Lady, you are a sick, horrible person.  You should be ashamed of yourself.
Or better yet, track down those sickos the vandals and arsonists who terrorized and firebombed crisis pregnancy centers."
"Since May of 2022 there have been 99 attacks on pro life organizations and facilities, just thought I'd share that."
I wonder how many adopted children all these pro lifers have?
"Can someone please explain.

If a 15yr old has been raped and Dr’s say that continuing the pregnancy will severely hinder her chance of children in the future, when she is  physically and mentally ready for motherhood. You demand we follow your minority view based on a fictions gods book. 
My thoughts are towards the pregnant child’s life and I make no apology."
Resorting to Tic Tok says everything
Shelly shows up to protect the business of treating the unborn as just bags of money making parts.
A rubber fetus. REALLY? And the liberals claim they know science?
A rubber fetus. REALLY? And the liberals claim they know science?
"O Lord, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth! Rise up, O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve! O Lord, how long shall the wicked exult? They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast. They crush your people, O Lord, and afflict your heritage. They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless; and they say, “The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive.” Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise? He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see? He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge—the Lord knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile. Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O Lord, and whom you teach out of your law, to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked. For the Lord will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage; for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it. Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers? If the Lord had not been my help my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence. When I thought, “My foot slips,” your steadfast love, O Lord, held me up. When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul. Can wicked rulers be allied with you? Those who frame injustice by statute? They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death. But the Lord has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge. He will bring back on them their iniquity, and wipe them out for their wickedness, the Lord our God will wipe them out. (Psalm 94)"
Abortion bans on demand and without apology.
"And now NYC has abortions up to 9 months , wow now we murder a full term baby"
This pitiful woman. I hope she realizes soon that by supporting abortion she is supporting murder.
"Lol, kinda an overreaction to protestors, these people ARENT protesting abortions out of survival, nor miscarriages. The recording was fine, It was mean blowing them with a leaf blower, they’re allowed to speak their mind without getting leafs and dust in their face and eyes. Anti-abortionist who commit CRIME are CRIMINALS."
"what a pathetic job, abortion escort, a new low in humanity"
"Pro Life call women irresponsible and stupid for ""not keeping their knees together"" and getting pregnant. By their logic are they expecting irresponsible and stupid women to also raise a baby?"
Murder is murder.
"NO TO ABORTION! NO KILL BABIES; don't be killers. When God's judgment comes, what will you answer to your creator?"
"There’s a difference between needing an abortion and willfully killing your baby because of selfishness or irresponsibility. The child is alive no matter what you tell yourself and everyone knows it’s wrong to kill. People rationalize evil practices in today’s world. People who are against abortion are there to help people really think about and be honest with themselves about what they are really doing before they make a decision they’re going to regret for the rest of their lives. Don’t listen to the world, listen to your heart and listen to God. God is that small still whisper inside your mind and heart that ultimately knows killing your child is not right. That’s hard to do in an evil world that promotes and standardizes evil."
"So in the last 45 years 11 people have been killed by unstable people claiming to be right.  Okay.    Taking away your virtue signaling point.  Yes those 11 people did not deserve to die.  They deserve justice in the prosecution of their murders.   However, that stat along with your own video and claims of how prevalent protest occur, suggests that the vast majority of those protestor are peaceful, even when being antagonized."
this lady is EVIL beyond belief
THEY ARENT WASTING THEM  THEY FEED THEM TO THE PRISONERS
PRETENDING YOU HAVE A MAKE BELIEVE FRIEND IN THE SKY AND PRETENDING THEY TALK TO YOU MEANS YOUR  NUTS !!!!!
"Women know what they do.. we are not incapable of making decisions.. and we know the full consequences of abortion. We are not children, we can decide .. and until this fetus ""child"" is in my womb..it a part of my body.."
Lies
Biased report from CNN.
Baby killers
*BABY KILLERS MAD* 🤣🤣🤣
That moment when people have a problem with killing babies 😡
"The murderers in the abortion pretend to care with their lies, without realising the utter hypocrisy and insanity they speak!  
3:49: ""This is literally like life risking work..."" Can you not hear the hypocrisy of that, and how laughable that sounds? 
YOU are helping to END the lives of innocent babies in that ""clinic"", so you can't talk! ""Life risking work"", oh what a joke!

There is absolutely ZERO reason for abortion to exist. Abortion is murder, which leaves mental and physical scars, and you'll have to give an account of that on the day of judgement! Murder is NOT a ""right""! You'll find that out the hard way when condemned to the torment of Hell if you don't wake up and REPENT!"
"If you don't agree to the possible consequences, then you shouldn't have it."
"The people comparing ""your right to abortion""  to property rights and stand your ground laws 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡"
The baby has every right to be there (as it's a natrual stage of human development for everyone)
"She needs to learn to accept different opinions. Liberals always want to preach tolerance, but they are intolerant themselves."
"Why are people always bringing ""God"" into this? Im not even religious wtf. Leave me and my body alone. I make whatever decision i think its better for myself."
😂😂😂
"That protester says ""when he meets his maker....he hopes the good Lord has a lot of mercy"".  He should hope for that because he's going to need it.  He is not treating his fellow humans with honor or dignity and he spends his time in judgment of others which is not his place.   He will be judged harshly by his ""good Lord"" for being a lousy human along with the rest of the protesters."
These people are delusional.  Let these people be and let them get their Healthcare in peace. Mind your own business.
according to science when does life begins?
That clearly is a demon woman. She will escort you straight to hell.
"abortion clinics are mostly in poor black areas....
everything else is rascict but not that?"
"in Islam religion the abortion is not forbidden before the 40 days of pregnancy if the woman raised her child that better for her but if she doesn't want it she can do the abortion before the 40 days of pregnancy in her womb but she must understand something very important if she do the forbidden adultery she must stop ✋ after that sin and if she was a victim of a crime rape if she doesn't remove it that is better for her because the great God will give her great boons after life because she was a victim innocent woman but if she was married she can't do it it's very big sin but sometimes the doctor says to her your baby in your womb is to dangerous to your health care we must remove him before he kills the mother and that happened rare in life that happened because some women's have accidents like when she falls into the ground or she have accidents in car or anything else etc , why I said before the 40 days of pregnancy because the great God doesn't put the soul in the body of the baby in his mother womb but after the 40 days of pregnancy the baby became a human with a real soul in his body that is not my talk or my words this is in holy book holy Quran not me ."
"I have a friend who is a volunteer to escort people into abortion clinics. She has a few pairs of noise canceling headphones (she can link spotify for any music) for those people, so they can't hear anything the protestors are saying."
"Republicans be like: 
War? YES! 
Torture? ABSOLUTELY! 
Guns everywhere? YOU BET! 
Abortion? NO I’M PRO LIFE."
How much do you want to bet these “pro life” idiots ate bacon and sausage McMuffins on their way to the big “pro life” rally.  😂
A more attractive woman would be an easier sell...just some helpful advice.  You have to make the face of the campaign someone a man would actually want to impregnate or else it's just not believable.
I wonder if any of these “pro life” losers are vegan or if they only care about specific kinds of life.
"Why do all the women who appear to be the loudest pro abortion voice also appear to be the ones least likely to have to worry about ""unwanted pregnancies?"" It's a trend I can't help but notice, haha, they really are some BIG UGLIES, am I right, though? 🙃"
Big respect for these people risking their lives to make people able to make the right choice for their life
The piety makes me sick.
I want to be this woman when I grow up.
Ignorance is loud and wisdom is louder through silence 🤐
Never seen so many low IQ sky wizard worshippers with a hot line to GOD knowing what he wants and doesnt want.....
I'm so glad that I live in a civilized country. I pity citizens of the USA.
Delusional fake Christians
"Any one of those obnoxious protestors butting into the lives of those unfortunate women, if they get too close or in the way, should get the firehose -- full blast.  It's why God invented firehoses."
"Bottom line , women choose what you have to do , but DONT use it as birth control and think the rest of the country will pay for it !!!!"
This video is downvoted into oblivion I’m sure
Yea it's wrong to tell  pregnant women to tell a women not to get an abortion due to rape or insects but what about the women that gets pregnant due to there own actions with there partner but still get the abortion and they can keep up on doing that bc it's normalized now adays but we don't want to pay attention to that part of abortions just the ones from rape are insects smh.
"So what ,think they care about TikTok lol"
"In Australia, it’s illegal for these Christian extremists to protest within 100 yards of a sexual health clinic"
"Love this lady. These idiots believe in a so called all knowing, all powerfull god who foreknew the outcome of everything that would happen and chose to create that world. He could have just as easily created a world where abortions didn't exist."
"The sheer arrogance of these bible thumpers. ""I'll pray for you""? Save it for someone who cares, you are no better than anyone else."
"Weirdos for Jesus, did you see the size of that cross, I, love God too, but these people are extremist."
They say pro-life but vote against funding foster care and jails to house all the unwanted kids.
I support pro life advocates with my heart and soul. Good job escorting them into the clinics. I feel for those who were killed in their line of duty.
Thank you for your work at the clinic. You are a heroine!
"They are sad, bored, lack attention, have strange friends and most importantly
...in desperate need for serious mental evaluation."
It's all fkrd up... sadly is early years...men were pissed killing mother's father's and such because of dangerous work... education...the other fkrd up thg is ...too popular for the other...fame fortune...Looks... amenities as of extras to provide...the all too infamous booze pharmaceutical.... another demeaning is fame fortune... moving on with a better career... divorce married...the infamous latter stepping...the sickness goes on... wooing to some fandom oof delusional realities... ambience and VANITY... alongside perversions with Ill intentions with Walt Disney facade etc.  Giving these ideas for children...
"So, the anti-abortion/PROLIFE people MURDERED someone...a pro-life person MURDERED someone. Listen to how that sounds."
Do these people not have jobs? How are they there every day to harrass these patients?
"when he gets to the pearly gates God will ask him, who died and made you boss?."
"Well done walking woman with their unborn baby to dead 
You must be so proud 🤮"
Why do these assholes think they have the right to force their religion on others. It's not their body and not their choice
As a Christian I believe it is a sin   to have an abortion. But every one has a right to choose their own fate.
"Here in Greece we don't have specific clinics, hospitals have to provide all sorts of healthcare. So those lunatics would have to stand in front of a normal hospital and try to guess who goes visiting a relative who's had a heart attack, who is having an x-ray and who's having an abortion."
"This woman is so brave, protecting women who have a already suffered enough mentally (and probably physically) before even getting to the clinic ❤️❤️ ❤️❤️❤️
My response to half of the anti-abortion protesters is “If you weren’t born with ovaries and a vagina, then STFU”
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬"
What a country we live in that those people spend all their lives harassing women.
A lot of these folks are paid to protest at the clinics.
Abortion is a crime. Don't kill babies! Abortion cannot be a choice like murder cannot be
God Bless Shelly!!! You are doing what is in the Bible. An abortion is LEGAL in the bible. Life doesn't even start until a child takes their first breath (Genesis)
"""Its a tiny rubber feotus"" !!! That's exactly what they are. And between a patient and their Doctor will always win since 78% of Americans are Pro-Choice and NOT ANTI-CHOICE!!!!"
"Shelly is an Angel!!! She is helping people with difficult decisions, but who have made up their mind. I respect her Pro-Choice stance!!!!"
Notice they're all men
"It pains me that these self righteous jerks do not understand that abortion is necessary to save the lives of women whose pregnancies have gone horribly wrong due to no fault of their own. 

I knew someone who nearly died of sepsis when a minuscule hole in the amniotic sac allowed germs to infect the fetus. The fetus was already doomed, but the doctors could not do an abortion until the fetal heartbeat stopped. 

My friend was lucky that they were able to bring her back from organ failure. Considering that this was the 1970s, she was lucky indeed.

When abortion is banned, women die. What sense does it make to value the life of an embryo or fetus over that of the host, without which the embryo cannot survive? This is religious tyranny as far as I am concerned."
"They have no right to stand there and yell at women ! 
No right to hold pictures and posters. 
These protesters say they have responsibility to do this.. ......they are not helping.
They could help by providing baby clothes , diapers , formula , changing tables , baby bath tub , car seats , pay Dr bills , give maternity clothes , nursing bras , maternity underwear , baby blankets , provide transportation , housing , childcare , daycare there is so very much to do to support new life and the mothers ! 
What they are doing out there , now , is useless !"
"How those shitheads protesters will help women that decided to have an abortion? Will they provide them for 9 months ? And then take the baby away and take care of it?? Yes , IT !! If it's not after birth creature it's not a human yet"
"Those protesters look lunatic , who doesn't even understand what they talk about and should get their heads out of strange women's wombs lol"
These protesters don't give a damn about the born
"all this yelling and protesting when they can DO SOMETHING USEFUL by actually helping kids in foster system, kids in the streets who are homeless and hungry... and not actually be judgmental which is ironic for them to do when they say ""pray""."
"Obama and Biden had 8 years to pass roe vs wade federally………….but they didn’t
They had the White House, Senate and House and promised they would pass it"
Religious nutbars pushing thier shit on everyone..they should put their energies to the poor.
Just like nazi killing jews in ww2
I'm sorry third trimester abortions this is disgusting to me that's to far along
Doesn't the bible actually command one to abort a pregnancy if it's from adultry? Why does nobody ever speak about that.
"Men have no business speaking about abortion! It's not their body or their baby! Dan, the person you call your maker is also the only one that judges! You or no one has a right to judge anyone! Read your bible! ""You who have not sinned cast the first stone!"" You have no right to judge anyone. Only God has the right to judge!"
They look like lunatics.
At least 11 people have been killed by anti-abortion activists. Gotta save those fetuses but it's okay to kill fully grown living humans.
This is why abortion care needs to be something provided by every OBGYN so that you don't need to go to some weird place that announces what service you are in need of.   It should not be legal to try to interfere with a medical procedure.
How is this allowed? Can they a restraining order?
"11 people… seriously, 11 people a day/week die here in philly over stuff they had nothing to do with now thats a real problem foh 11 people… cant be serious"
What is it with these ridiculous men?
Was there ever a bomb? Why sensationalise like that? My goodness.
"Are they going to help pay for the pregnancy, birth? Daycare? Food? Hmmm that’s interesting how this is so important that they spend their time harassing women than volunteering and donating at food pantries and shelters and funding free healthcare. How bout just mind ur own business."
Of course they support the unborn because they aren't a burden on pro-lifers.  They don't require money they don't require caring they don't require anything until they are born and then they are no longer unborn and that's the moment when pro-lifers don't care about that child who could now starve and die in swallow and strife.
"Thank you, Shelly for being there for women in their time of need. You are a terrific and noble person."
"You are there for woman when they need help most. The protesters have no interest in helping anyone they get a high off of feeling superior. They don’t adopt ,they don’t vote for health care,education,housing they just terrorize women at their most vulnerable"
"These men need to really go sit down somewhere. Dan, God doesn't like it when people get in the middle of other people's business."
"No man should ever have a voice over what women do with their bodies. As someone who is not female and does not have a womb, these male idiot anti-choice losers have no rights to have any say in the matter. If I was a cop I'd sit outside that clinic and arrest all those fucking protesters for harassment and abuse."
"If ""pro life"" activists really stood by their words, they need to take fully economically, social and emotionally responsibility for both mother and future child for the rest of mother and child's life. I some how doubt they are willing to do that. If not, -they are nothing but self rictus hypocrites."
Well you'll find your muclh and theres nothing bug darkness dan.
Christianity is pure EVIL!
Tell God when you see Him. It won’t go well. Abortion is murder.
Everyone for abortion has been born
Abortion is baby killing.
"yeah, those idiots cant hate, or kill you for who you are, unless you are born.  They just want more death, more inmates, more abuse, more poverty, more homelessness, more unemployment, more of us forced to obey their personal religion.
I should stand out front with pictures of murdered clinic workers, and mothers forced to carry babies with no skull..or raped & abused children forced to carry babies at 10 years old-  
 how christian.   right up there with nazis, sadists, and other psychopaths."
"Funny how they want to take my gun, my freedom of speech, my freedom to think what I think. Not what they think. But take the option of abortion off the table and the freaking world is ending. There can't be that many white girls getting abortions. The whole reason democrats loved abortion was to keep the black population down."
"Adding an element of humor anout killing babies… yeah, so brave…"
"Thank you escorts for what you do for women and girls obtaining abortions. Let’s focus on why a woman needs an abortion: rape, incest, poverty, illness, ectopic pregnancy. Does making abortion make these causes go away? No. So the need for abortions doesn’t go away neither will abortions. They become dangerous and even deadly. Trust women to make decisions for their lives."
Oh I can't wait to see this!
"""At least 11 people have been killed"" Pro-life huh?..."
Trespassing is illegal
"Shooting, bombs and threats of death?  These  anti abortion hypocrites  are not pro life. They are pro control."
If you have to remain name less. You really don't believe in what your doing. Why not just wear something over your face while your at it. And who are you to push your beliefs on someone. When most Christians break the commandments probably more so than non Christians. I think the clinics should release all names after verification that are Christian women that had abortions. I'm  sure their are millions. And if you think not then your plain stupid.
They want to force mothers to have babies but help with taking care of said babies no thankyou. They say we are pro life but turn around and kill doctors that could have saved more lives or kill people they do not like . sounds like they are only some pro life.
"A bunch of ignorant religious nut jobs,who are they to tell a woman what to do with their own body."
"I will decide what I do and/or do not do with my body. These self righteous delusional religious hypocrites can stuff their bibles, their crucifixes and their bullshxt up their backsides and then they can fxck right off to somewhere very, very far away."
Obviously somebody needs to tell them that prayers don 't feed a child...
"Wow! So brave! Enabling the murder of the unborn isn’t an easy thing to do, but faking compassion while doing it is even harder!
Stunning. So strong. So beautiful."
Sadly these guys think we all need their personal approval. Dman them.
What accent does the narrator have?
"Sure, you're walking next to a patient RECORDING WITH A CAMERA! They must love that!"
"These protesters, supporting life, are doing the right thing. 

Sad about the doctor, and the 11 people, who lost their lives to extreme protesters.

Sadder still the millions of babies who lose their lives to abortion."
"I'm watching this again and I have a question: those women who died because they couldn't get an abortion, the bombings of the abortion centers etc, I think the same people who banned abortions should be made to pay for all the destruction they caused. Thoughts?"
She's a legend
"PRAYERS don't buy diapers, PRAYERS don't pay for pre-natal care, PRAYERS don't buy food to feed your little ones, PRAYERS don't give you a job, PRAYERS  don't put food on the table, PRAYERS don't help with your post-partum depression, PRAYERS don't help you live in a safe neighbourhood.....etcetera, etcetera!!! Stop the government from funding Viagra, MEN HAVE NO SAY unless they have: uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina!  MAKE VASECTOMIES MANDATORY FOR MEN AS SOON AS THEY CAN PROCREATE and have it reversed when BOTH want a baby. My Body My Choice...!!!"
You are fake News and everyone knows it so we can not believe a word you say and it's called a staged interview and murder has always been illegal and turns out it still is it's just so very very sad that a judge had to tell grown people that murder was Rong so nice try but most American people are not stupid ask Liz the truth will set you free Lonnie ray
"I agree woman should have control over thier bodies, that's why intelligent women use precautions before murder. If you can't control your body than get sterilized. Abortions are for health, mental, incest or rape purposes only."
"All I see is some people concerned about abortion, pretty calmly trying to talk to people and convince them to not get an abortion. Most shown here aren't angry, aren't yelling aggressively, and aren't getting in people's way, burning anything down, threatening or killing anyone... They're not taking over half the street, occupying the building, or anything crazy.

Maybe stick to showing only the worst of the worst anti-abortion protesters, because showing the typical ones that aren't that bad is really exposing how overblown people make this whole ""OMG PROLIFE PEOPLE HARASSING ME"" thing is. Maybe try showing the ones offering tons of money to help support the child, adopting the child, etc, too. There's a million other options out there than to choose abortion, most obvious of them is to try actually using birth control methods. Some people don't even make the attempt."
"What a wonderful woman, protecting women about to murder their babies from a crowd of old people.  Is she a saint or what?"
Men!
"How come all these anti abortion protesters are all altacocker men?!  Maybe women should start voting in laws restricting their bodily functions, like banning viagra, for example ..."
THey look like friggin' ZOMBIES !
What's so upsetting is that the Republicans sided with the terrorist the logic of that is beyond me!!
"Imagine if American women were legally allowed to forego motherhood through abortion and adoption, without being legally responsible for child support; yet American men are unable to legally forgo fatherhood without permission from women and are forced to pay pay child support. Double standards and female privilege are fun kids. Hands off their bodies, Hands off our wallets"
How about the protesters give that attention to homeless veterans?
Shelley is a freaking superhero! ❤️❤️❤️
"When they aree so pro life why they not protest against guns, protest for free healtcare, free childcare, free education for all children, payed parental leave from the company, the right of home and other things to help this woman and kids instead of threaten them!"
Especially crazy anti supporters
Let's lighten up and help people feel more comfortable about killing babies.  These protesters are very polite and kind.  They are PROlife not prodeath like the escort is. This is so twisted.  I pray your minds and souls will be healed.  May God have mercy on you.  Very sad to think what will happen to this escort after she goes to the other side.
"If my mom aborted me in the womb, i wouldn't care because i wouldn't be conscious enough to know and also i'd be dead so i couldn't have cared. 
Why are you all so obsessed with human life to begin with, honestly? Obviously it's cause it's self serving. Though we don't like to say that. No, it's gods will, or whatever. So noble.
Where is god when all these unwanted children are being forced into the foster-care system after having been born to parents who can't have them or don't want them? Is he too busy turning a blind eye to kids being raped and forced to go through with abortions? Too busy giving people cancer? But praise the lord! Praise him from the dusty old book written by people 2000+ years ago. 
Did anyone ever play that game of telephone? How did it go? 
Oh but the bible is as true and untainted as the day it was written right? god bless. 
If a woman want an abortion let her have it. Life is too short to have it dictated by people who think only their opinion is right cause their god has a bigger dic than your god."
Abort and Sterilize
What sort of evil is it that would kill a baby in the 3rd trimester. I just can't believe how twisted you would have to be. Those predominately fat ugly man hating cat women that guide people in are exactly as I would imagine they would look like.
Future GOP candidates.  I’m not joking.
"Abortion is sometimes a necessity! It should be a woman's choice, government needs to stay the hell out of everyone's business. My body my choice!"
He wasn’t yelling at anyone 😂
99.9% of us are ok with early abortions for convenience.  Let’s negotiate a gestational age. 99.9999% are all in for abortion to save the mother at any time. We got used to you reducing life to a “clump of cells.” You lost most of us when you try to claim abortions of convenience are for “health” and went far left looney for convenience abortions until the moment of birth.  Men getting pregnant and not knowing what a woman is didn’t help.
the protesters seem to be extremely respectful. what a bunch of pro baby murder propaganda
"You don’t have to listen, they have a right to be there. There not going in the clinic. Don’t want to listen to them, walk away. Simple"
Yet another pro death propaganda piece
Abortion escort? That's a thing now?
notice most of these protestors are older men!!! and before anyone comes at me yes I see there are women there too I am just making a point. I am a survivor of minor sex trafficking severe child abuse and CSAM(child sexual abuse materials) I work with minor victims of trafficking these young girls are usually around the ages of 12-17. after coming out of trafficking they need so many different services. they need time to process and heal. I had one girl who was 16 she had a child with her trafficker who had taken her when she was 14. when she was rescued she was 5 weeks pregnant again by her trafficker. She was so lost and didn't want another child with the man who had kidnapped drugged raped and sold her for 2 yrs. imagine for a moment being this CHILD because she truly is still a child. put yourself in her shoes. also ....think of all the children that are out there in broken systems all over the world.
Absolutely mind-numbing how many people in this comment section are insisting that patients in with life-threatening pregnancies are not being denied appropriate medical treatment due to these new laws. YES. THEY. ARE. Take responsibility for the effects of your extreme ideology in action.
This is TOTAL fear mongering. So sad.
"*- A letter from the voiceless-*
Dear Mom,
  I want to start by saying I love you, you were my first connection with another person. And I hoped I would get to see you face to face, hear your sweet voice sing to me sleep, But that never happened. Whatever I did I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you or cause you any trouble, I just wanted you to be my mommy. What I went through physically hurt me, and I hope no one ever has to go through that again. But what hurt me even worst was the fact that my mommy that I love so much hated me. So much that you wouldn't even acknowledge that I was alive(lacking the ability to breathe unaided), you called me it(a clump of cells). And after all that you threw me away(like garbage), you wouldn't even do that to a pair of old shoes. Now it's to late for me, but on my behalf can you try to stop this from happening to any other babies. PLEASE!
                        Love
                  The Unwanted

P.S. I forgive you."
a hail of gunfire...hmmm..so much for Pro-Life huh?..hypocrites...all of the so called Pro-Life cultists..
"See the problem with the anti abortion lot is it’s mainly made out of men.Men who will never get pregnant or have to have the child, and so suffer none of the hardships.Women should be the ones to decide if they want abortions or not, since it’s them who get pregnant, them who have the child, them who would have the majority of childcare problems if they did have the baby.
I just find it funny how women don’t seem to have a single say in the matter, despite abortion being for women not men."
"Pro-abortion protestors https://youtube.com/shorts/sa5wZjshIjg?feature=share.

The sheer degeneracy is palpable."
I'll save the suspense: This is about a security guard at an abortion clinic
"Dr. Leroy Carhart, yes, he's the victim here. Making money by bullying the unborn with his scalpel."
"In the 90's, I went to Planned Parenthood and ran into these type of people. They didn't believe me when I told them I was just there for birth control. They kept saying things like ""I was going to hell"" and ""give up my baby instead of killing it"". Their faces were priceless when I walked out holding up the birth control for all to see. Only one of them apologized."
"nasty to escort woman to kill a baby,it no differnt than leading a slave in 1800 to be sold at auction"
"Sad woman can't hear about those woman who die at the abortion clinic's getting their abortion and Realize abortion is Murder, That ALL Lives are Made in God's image and a Gift from God and should be LOVED by mom or someone else, if the Mother isn't ready to be a mom, people protest Black Lives Mater, Yet there's more abortion clinics in Black neighborhoods killing and has KILLED more Black's since 73 than ANY 1WAR IN HISTORY Or COMBINED, people get their Souls in the womb,all these Souls that were aborted, are crying out for Justice ⚖️ 💙 ❤️ 💔 in Heaven. kid's could have grown up to be doctors to save people's lives or a firefighter or be President, their Future is Gone Forever. God will have mercy on the children for being innocent, Look up the Great Tribulation. God's Wrath on Earth for All the Evil, that has been done, it's not to late to Repent and be saved from what's coming.if you have a contrite heart when you come to Emmanuel Jesus and ask for forgiveness, He will forgive You.Confess your sins, what you have did wrong, to him and he will take them away, He will set you Free."
This is what religion does.
And then went home and ate a dozen donuts
Now you may notice everyone that is against abortion is a crazy brainwashed catholic. Non separation of church and state anymore
"I do not believe abortion should be used as birth control. If you have sex, be prepared for consequences. If you don’t want kids, use birth control or get fixed. It really seems extremely simple. No need to kill an unborn child."
His maker is the most prolific abortionist of all.
They always look like that
This is insane
We need a woman just walk right up to them and ask for money for rent and diapers
"Funny how most people that are for abortion like this tiktoker,  are usually people you wouldnt want to ""F"" in the first place 😅😅.   She butthurt because aint nobody wanna do her lmao 😅😅"
If abortion isnt murder then why do people have funerals for miscarriages?
"All very sad, and poor unborn children that will never get to take a breath. This person walks babies to their death. she must be very proud."
"Why is Al Qaeda more compassionate than pro-lifers?

The 9/11 hijackers got to die instantly."
If you don’t like babies why do you make them? Just don’t make them. How easy is that? Seriously!
The greatest challenge of the human race . Getting the pale face to mind his business
Assisting in the murder of the unborn doesn’t make you a hero.
That's another CNN producer acting in their own story
Abortion is a business to people they make money off of killing babies but there going to end up in hell for eternity
The good lord is not letting you prolifers in heaven. That’s a fact.
Every man is pro life until we get the wrong woman pregnant.
Wow. What genius she is.
"“prolife” people are all about choosing life, yet they are violent ????"
Shelly is awesome
I was 15 15 when I had to give birth 15 when it was married off to somebody who beat me for the next 10 years you don't know what the f*** is going on in people's lives mind your business God gave us the right to choose that right was taken away from me and I'll be damned if I let it happen to anybody else
The next idiot that tries to pull hate into this just remember God gave us free will God give us the right to choose God gave us our bodies and they are ours
God gave us free will God gave us the right to choose those are our god-given rights
For every Marjorie Taylor green we have we need about a hundred of you sweetheart keep it coming mad love mad respect we have a right to choose this is our body women are losing their rights we must stop it now vote against Republicans that try to take our rights away thank you woman thank you for everything you're doing
"These ""pro life"" people send death threats to people.  How pro life is that."
"The killers profess to be ""pro-life"".  They're so pro life they killed people."
"It's ironic she uses ""self righteous""."
Abortion is not a constitutional right. That is why it should be up to the states.
"It breaks my heart to see how degraded the world has become. I feel like I have been watching freedom and empathy slowly slip away, like sand through an hourglass for so long. People are worse than I've ever seen. Filled with hate, envy, ire and SO obsessed with control. They could be spending their short lives doing what makes them happy, making choices that affect their own lives. Instead they choose to lash out at others, strangers even, for disagreement. At this rate, I would guess 2 to 3 years before we are completely overrun by the true depths of human depravity."
"ALL ACTIONS  HAVE RAMIFICATIONS .   Once pregnant it’s no longer JUST your body !!!!

If you go out , on the turps , have  an unprotected “Wellington boot ” then  fall pregnant ,  your actions have results .  Such as having a living child under your care / protection .   Adopt the child out 
It’s not the babies fault , a woman uses abortion as contraception.  

What about the father ?  It takes 2 to tango 

Abortion is infanticide -  before an abortion , mummy must be shown an abortion video

Planned parenthood was started by KKK member, Margaret Sanger . 

Abortion is only permissible if the mothers life is at immediate risk due to the baby . EG - Ectopic pregnancy  - Only physical risk , not mental health, therapy can combat that issue snd is treatable"
"when those lazy protestors start praying for you, it sounds like the 'thoughts & prayers' white male domestic terrorist's who don't think twice about murdering innocent children. so spare us the phony lectures about protecting babies because you are going to sit back and hear about priests raping children and republicans murdering them and vote to cut food stamps, health care and education. go do some voluntary work that counts and that literally protects children.."
Well at least these folks aren’t burning the building down like janes revenge destroying pregnancy crisis centers where they do help women keep and take care of their child.
I hope you are as concerned with the babies after they are born
Maybe if this people wher aborted we would be in a better place.
"👍Great job Shelley for helping women with their RIGHT TO CHOOSE, you're awesome 👏💚. Those anti- people have nothing better to do than harass that clinic, pathetic, if they want to save a ""life"" they need to start with their own. Jesus did not force his truth on anyone and neither should they! 💚"
"Hey, at least these scums are doing their part and showing people that there is still good/hope left in the world"
"She shows up to the same clinic to protect the women from the protesters who are violently screaming at them ""you're beautiful, your baby is beautiful, they deserve to live""................ and then they offer to help

This lady is pretty cringy"
Im not personally against abortion on occasion but think it’s good we keep it discouraged and frowned upon because at the end of the day it is cheating life.
"Seriously people … if you do not want or cannot afford a child, please do not put one in the oven . Just like you wouldn’t put a pizza in the oven if you don’t like to eat pizza, get it? Be responsible. Ask your parents how not to get impregnated. Not hard!"
"Has ANY woman EVER changed her mind due to protesters like this? 
Because I've never seen it happen. Just saying."
"Deep in everyone's heart, everyone knows, abortion ends a human life."
"I’m pretty sure not a single one of those protestors have any adopted children. They’re not pro life, they’re pro fetus."
Abortion is absolutely no men or f.....g religion's business!
"But what I wonder always always is that why do this pro-abortion people see it as a right for a woman to have as many abortions as she wants ""cause cause it's her body"" but when a woman wants to have a lot of children they forget the right that it's her right and her body why?
Some even call for legislation on the amount of children a woman can have which clearly goes against their principle of ""it's the woman's body and she can do whatever she likes"",some even go to the extent of looking down on this women,why?"
Let them defend what is right. Also not news worthy.
"Shelley, you are an angle some of us have prayed for to protect our loved ones during one of the hardest times in their lives.  Bless you."
The so called pro-lifers 3:59
I wish anti-abortion protesters would stop bringing religion in their arguments and actually bring up stuff that can be proven
This lady doesn’t have to worry about abortion
"I appreciate the escort's patience and good natured approach, which is beyond me.  I am irritated just listening to this harassment.  Good on you!  I can see women are in good hands with you.  Much respect!!!"
"It's weird to hang out outside of these clinics and yell at people. These ""good"" Christians need to go practice their faith in a way that's not harmful to others but they can't help themselves."
Why don't they build a security fence and have people buzzed in by appointment?
"One of the reasons I get sick of entertainers politicizing everything especially musicians and actors is their overall cluelessness about how things work. ""Heres my obligatory Pro-Choice PSA"". Whether Children of the 60s who attend Woodstock or weren't alive during GW Bush's presidency or are Cuban immigrants who don't understand how a real democracy work.  How the system works. Its nice ""for women"". Yeah whatever the fuck (proceeds to post clueless observations on Twitter). I've stopped listening and following a huge chunk of various forms of entertainment due to their stubborness to constantly push personal political views on their audiences."
I applaud the escort's work. It amazes me how removed from humanity the anti-choice group is. They believe in faeries and wizards that don't exist and ignore the realities of people and life.
"Where does a woman’s right to choose end and the unborn child’s rights to life start? In my opinion, that’s the question that must be decided. It’s a sliding scale that as each day and month passes moves from the mother towards the unborn child. I don’t believe that just because the female is the one carrying the baby it gives her absolute rights over the life of the unborn child from conception to birth. In my opinion, after looking at medical information, after the first trimester, the child has its own right to life. Now, this could and should be debated, but somewhere in the time between conception and before birth the child’s right to life takes precedence over the woman’s right to choose. The physical health of the mother and possibly rape or incest are exceptions that should be debated.
Why is no one talking about using condoms, contraceptives, and even abstinence until you are ready to have a child? Yes, it requires more effort but doesn't the prospect of aborting or bringing an unwanted child into this world make it necessary? And women because you will have to bear the burden, your first Choice is refusing to have unprotected sex until you are ready to have a child.
Also, access to contraceptives must be cheap, if not free, and easily accessible. Child care has to also be cheap, if not free."
All men protesting should get mandatory snip snip. Then they would be doing their part instead of telling women what to do with their body's. Fair is fair.
"Why do women wIt
 after3mo 2 get an abortion?"
If women got 2 c a picture  if their fetus they wouldn't get an abortion
Most of the ones protesting look dumb af honestly lol
kill babys at the borders but dont kill babys in the womb
Why can't they put up a privacy fence?
so many bigot retards in the USA (you don't see that anywhere else)
"If women can have an Abortion without any input of the man, Then a Man can walk away without paying a dime! that's equality. 
Women ""my body my choice""
Men ""my money my choice"""
Dan should be protesting at the pub to remind the men not Rosie their seed and keep their junk and sperm to themselves
Its a protest they are excersing there american right people died for
"Great Dan, we'll drop off all these babies at your house  for you  to raise then? You and your uterus got then ?

Were you graped 🍇 your moms latest boyfriend/ ""uncle"" they  brought home? By an actual relative that supposed protect and nurture you? By somone that was supposed to be your friend? Have your boyfriend leave you once they find out you're pregnant and say it's not theirs and you're a sl*t that slept around? Have fetus die inside you?
No? Well Dan maybe you and your non-uterus ought to sit this one out."
Maybe we should adopt a non religious view point. Also for you snowflakes that are anti-abortion. This country is not your church. Don’t force your religion on to other people.
Shame to all REPUBLICANS!!!!!
Abortion was created by the KKK to EXTERMINATE minorities. Margaret Sanger was also a DEVIL WORSHIPPER!! STOP STABBING BABIES IN THE VAGINA!! SMDH
Pro lifers are mostly Christian men saying the same arguments and being a thorn to all women
"Hey America, welcome to the middle ages!"
So are you supporting the women that have to have the children Dan? Oh Dan gives us our daily bread by your hand we are all fed...
"Shelly Man’s job is to prevent women from hearing any other option. Last I checked, a “choice” requires at the very least two options."
God bless these anti-abortoin protestors. They're trying to protect the vulnerable unborn babies.
I'm not into butt sex. But I don't go out every weekend saying it should be illegal.
"If you were really ""pro-life"", you would want these babies to have healthcare, housing, and education after they're born. You would want to help their families provide those things for them. But you don't. You don't even want to help the women who have to carry those babies to term, or help in the smallest way in their postpartum recovery by providing adequate paid maternity leave. You're not pro-life. You're pro-birth. And after those babies are born, you could care less. What you are is anti-choice, and anti-woman."
"Most of them are men,take note. Also how are these people pro life, when this woman has to search for bombs. Makes no sense! These are old retired folks who are also sinners, with nothing to do."
If men shouldn’t have the right to talk about women’s bodies I also feel people who are not parents should not talk about parenting
I want this job. Do you need help?
"Why do you ''''WANT'''' an Abortion?          WANT it so bad you act like it is a Wonderful Choice in Life. Not the unborn life that's for sure.
If you NEED it, I am all for you getting it. Otherwise, hell if your WANT it I wouldn't want you to be a parent either."
All I see is peaceful protest unlike George Floyd BLM ones.
"Babies Lives Matter .
Evil satanic lost souls chanting to abort babies."
God believes in free will
We will emancipate the unborn. Just as my ancestors were released from their chains - we will stop the Democrats (yet again) from denying the humanity of others to fit their political agenda.  We must end abortion nationwide.
Could you imagine planning for a baby then you have a medical issue and it dies so you need an abortion you go and are greeted by men shouting don't forget your baby is it a boy or girl like dude she wanted that baby and your out here making it seem like she's murdering her child screaming at her. Not only that but imagine being raped then going to get an abortion and your greeted with men telling you your awful for not keeping it. I don't even know how that's allowed to be honest. It's just sick and wrong. These women are being punished for things they can't help. And they are going to die because of things they can't help.  What is wrong with these people! Funny how pro lifers protest to save life then have no problem killing the mother when the life saving abortion she needs isn't allowed. I think they forget women who want their babies need abortions too.
Yall a bunch of baby murderers
"My body my choice! also lets give the medal of honor to Dr.Mengele. also anybody that doesnt put a covid vaccine in their bodies are terrorists. 670,000 murdered babies per year in the usa. that is the biggest silent holocaust. The prosecutors should arrest the doctors that dissected whole babies from the mothers wombs and charged with murder. The Mother also."
And now with it being illegal… woof.
Imagine telling a little girl to carry her child when she doesn’t want it or can’t take of it- referring to the 10 year old Ohio girl
My body my choice but not vaccines ..  I don’t care about women dying .
Third trimester abortions are infanticide
You don't have an Accurate picture of what goes on inside an abortion clinic. These abortion clinics sell your baby parts to pharmaceutical companies. Are they cutting you in on the profit.
This is why I hate free speech
If it wasn't for abortion women might resort to plan B 🗑🚮
If you were a meme. You'd be a great one. Keep up the awesome work. Fk the protester's
They sometimes protest outside a Toronto station. They are loud and have no consideration to any children that are passing. Disgusting mostly old white men who have no right to say how a woman chooses her healthcare. Revolting to try and force their religion on others.
So much drive and tenacity to comfortably walk up to peaceful protestors. So brave.
"CNN is downplaying the significance and immorality of abortion. They are making the pro-life party out like they are ""uncool"" or somehow primarily linked to insane people who just so happen to be ""pro-life."" Most liberals aren't smart or wise enough to realize that they are just being manipulated."
"It is a simple math equation: 

alive + human = has rights

Once you begin adding more to this equation: 

alive + human + sentient + autonomous = justification for ulterior prejudices"
"Make contraceptives, sterilization and reproductive rights readily affordable/ accessible. Killing babies should not be available without medical reasons. It will wake people up to not have unsafe sex and to protect themselves as much as possible. Hook up culture should die down a ton because of this. Sex makes children it is for procreating biologically. If this becomes a landslide into making birth control illegal that is NOT ok at all. Women need those things to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies to begin with."
Good for her.  I don't think I could stomach those loons all day every day without beating the shit out of them.
This woman is a hero!
Can we hold up signs in protest with the riddled bodies of children that have been shot with AR-15s
Anti abortion law should accompany with mandatory Male vasectomy (atleast over 40y old men).....then it will be more sensibles.....
Why ppl don't understand that abortion is women health issue
Does anyone know where to find data on how many unwanted pregnancies would be avoidable by making better sexual choices and how many are simply unavoidable like ectopic pregnancies and drastically changing situations after wanting to get pregnant?
She was fed up with them so she focused on them!!
since 2007 11 workers have been killed and also over several million humans as the direct result of abortion.
"""this literally life risking work"". yes idiot, that is exactly what it is, its abortion, it is literally risking the life of every human with intent to kill."
"""that walk is the loneliest walk if you are by yourself"". those women do not walk there alone, they only leave alone, thats what abortion does, it kills humans."
"All the way from Norway, full support for you and your pierce Shelley!  
I cannot wrap my head around these morons? Pro-life? This is christian fanatics with the narrowest view possible! 
No sense of the real world, and what is going on! 
This is deplorable!!"
"I started trading with forex trade late last year and till date have made over 12.7 Btc even with the ups and downs since the journey . With forex trade help I no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin , you can easily get in contact on my channel."
I don’t understand why an unborn fetus is more important than a woman’s life. Give people the opportunity to choose what they want for their body
Good for this lady actually caring about other. Not like these dimwitted fucktarts who harras families who are dealing with reality.
Shelly is an evi person l. Abortion must be  stopped.
"And if any anti abortion activists assault me, you Will end up in the ER"
“If there’s something here that looks like a bomb 💣 “ 😯
"These antiabortion protesters need mental health assessments, they claim to protect a Fetus, but in doing so threaten the lives of those protecting others. Their Religious beliefs show they don't care about other people either, false prophets."
"What's wrong with them saying there's help and other options than killing your family member? 🤔 They said deadly violence but there have been bombing at pregnancy centers. There has been violence on both sides. The facts they try to present are horrible. Women will start dying?? We've been dying, since the womb. Especially us black women. Women's rights start in the womb."
"Just like people can protest for abortion, they can protest against it. I think everyone is being a bunch of idiots."
"Ridiculous, wouldn't scare me at all. People have the right to make their own decisions as to what they'd like to do with their bodies. Assaulting folks and threatening to kill them? Does your little black book encourage this behavior? Is God sending you DMs asking for violence towards innocent people? Bullying people into submission will never work, you'll encourage folks to give you the fight you're looking for!  💪"
"My favorite is when pro abortionist say “it’s a fetus” do you know what a “fetus” is? It’s the third phase of the first stage of the HUMAN LIFE CYCLE, look it up. You terminate a fetus you ended a human life, it’s appalling that you’ve dehumanized the HUMAN LIFE CYCLE to support your perceived right to end an innocent human life. History is full of people that dehumanized others Hitler did it to the Jews America did it to the blacks and now y’all do it to your own children."
Religion does this to people.
"Pro-lifers don't have a damn life, ironically."
"Ride dick, get pregnant. Run from your responsibilities ."
it's so funny how it's literally just old men💀
Haha I got an ad for TikTok before this video
What I want to know is how many unwanted children have these anti-abortionists adopted?
What child gets to choose life the mother's choosing death for the child every single time. Want to talk about the inter workings of Planned Parenthood. Show the baby being aborted at 9 months.
"These hypocrites aren't pro-life. They are anti-choice. If they were truly pro-life they would care about what happens to that child after he/she is born. Is that child going to get proper care? Is that child going to get shot with a gun? These hypocrites have no moral standing. They have the right to believe what they want, but they don't have the right to force their beliefs on everyone else. To them I say 🖕"
Conservatives have a fetus fetish. The bible states that a fetus is not a child until God breathes the breath of life into it. Unfortunately the anti choice folks ignore that and think they are above God. They will try and force their beliefs on God and everyone else. These are not good people.
This woman is really sad😔
"The utter arrogance of the protesters is mind blowing. It's like they believe their own preferences should be the forced upon others. And, that their chosen religion should be forced on people making a very hard (in many circumstances) choice. The utter reprehensible hatred of those protesters is vile."
"*If one day they changed a woman's mind in abortion and then that woman casually ask them to take care of the child, do y'all think they would accept that child!? ABSOLUTELY NOT.  They will definitely not do anything to that child and leave it to the mother, after a pro-life movement that can't even take care of a life in the real world.*"
"Only in america, killed by pro life people"
Nebraska?!! NO NO!! I am in Kansas that is so terrible.
"keep this thought in mind if its not beyond your comprehension when someone walks with the real Christ they never have to look back wondering when someone is going to grab or harm them, live in the world and do these heartless cold blooded murders of children or twist their minds with sodomite perversion you will live everyday wondering when someone will obey Gods laws and commandments and send you to judgement, its time to quit being puppets and open your eyes to the wickedness and heartlessness around you and either take a stand against it or burn with them"
I do believe my body my choice but what about the baby's choice? 💔😣
Bless her & those putting their lives on the line to protect & defend these women!  Only God knows what’s going on & their needs/reasons to make the decisions they have.  ❤️😔
"I wanna butcher babies !!! 👶 
Come on ???!!"
What a gutsy and courageous person. & that doctor deserves credit too. What’s happening to my country?
So I get pulled over for doing 5 mph over speed limit have to pay a $210 fine this guy man assaults a woman and gets a $50 fine what the f***
That poor old man first of all the Bible is phony there is no such thing as a god so he's an idiot there after that he's just a fascist
It's killing a baby it has its own DNA it's not your body it's a babies body
It is always better to force women who don't want children to have babies so they can neglect and abuse them for many years during the most influential parts of their life which makes them who they are as a person.  It makes for great human beings in the future who are very appreciative of being put through that.  It's also better to have women go to illegal abortion clinics where unlicensed physicians can perform them or just do it themselves with hangars and then rush to the hospital afterwards bleeding internally.  Go Pro-Life people!
"The problem with ""pro lifers"", they focus on their zealous beliefs and not the children that are born and are in horrible situations.  Once the baby is born they wipe their hands of any responsibility and thought.  They should mind their own damn business and stop pushing a fictional book with antiquated beliefs on to others.  I hate religious fanatics.  Practice your own faith to yourself and to anyone who wants to listen.  Not everybody believes in the same thing.  Most people who claim to be Christians are the least Chris like people I know.  Rarely do anything productive to help people."
She'll never have to worry about making the decision
Lets talk about why you're so guilty. So instead of making amends and repenting. You decide to harass innocent people
Boy that virgin Mary couldn't get any paler
This just brings back memories of the people begging me not to have the abortion I was having to save my life. They are so incredibly selfish and thoughtless.
Pro-'life' anti abortion protesters killing and assaulting people in abortion clinics speaks volumes of their christian convictions
I drove a friend to a clinic before there were escorts & it was INFURIATING! They mobbed my car!
"Shelly serves the devil. Killing gods greatest creation is not the answer. God forbid anyone use contraceptives. Humor about killing babies? Shelly promotes sin, and she's worried about a meme? Show your narcissism Shelly! If you don't change your ways, you will not live for eternity,  just the moment."
"Who’d want to knock up Shelley???
That big f’cking wildebeest!!
Mrs. Mann!!!
She should have no need for an abortion, that raggedy-ass pro-choice walrus!!"
"“Women will die”. Every state allows women to get abortions if birth risk her life. Scare tactics. Most abortions are just another form of birth control for the majority of the women. Women Close your legs, men keep it in your pants, or both use protect. It’s really simple."
Look into how much these clinics make on the sales of the body parts of the unborn they murder to labs for studies that’s on top of the price they charge the mother to murder there unborn……….. can’t you see it’s a business and the mothers are the incubator for the product and that woman’s rights to be used as a cash cow and incubator for a product they sell ?
Why r they showing her and the location?
"How come none of y'all are saddened and hurt and distressed over the terminated babies? Or as y'all like to call them, fetuses!"
I rode my bike past protesters outside of an abortion clinic. Across the street was a huge billboard with a picture of a child and the message that 60% of American children live in food insecurity. Do these protester even care what happens to these children after they're born?
This subject is between the woman and GOD ❣️ 🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸
"Anti-abortinists need to understand that the Bible has two iconic characters mentioning use of the abortion pill, “bitter water” (Joseph and Isaiah) divorce during trial-marriage (Joseph offering ‘honorable separation). Until the 20th century, most societies allowed ‘forced birth’ aids until ‘the quickening’. Whatever, these types of self-proclaimed saints of their Judeo-Christian “God”, will stop at nothing to be violent."
"Their religion  and its dogma are irrelevant on that soil. Find a pulpit somewhere, but this isn't it.

Notice there sperm is past its expiration date and so they are upset."
"You never hear about these anti-abortion people adopting children, or starting foundations to help pregnant women who feel they are too young to have a child. You know how many children already suffer abuse and neglect? How overpopulated our planet is? Which contributes to negative impacts on the environment, poverty, the economy, etc. They don’t want women having children to be on welfare, but that’s what’s going to happen more if you force everyone that gets pregnant to carry to term. These people are all about making a woman have a child, even if she was raped, or if carrying to term could kill her, but once the child is born, nothing. They care more about an embryo, than living women or children. Religious hypocrisy! You never see pro-lifers protest to get better childcare, or better options for women who don’t want a child, but also don’t want an abortion. This is why there is a separation of church and state. People should not be affecting the lives of everyone, because of THEIR religious beliefs!"
Judge not least you be judged. Christianity is so selective these days.
They want to keep bringing more children in the world and tell women on what to do with their bodies but the children in foster care or live on the streets they don't care about! Explain that
they should arrest these nuts preventing people from heathcare
She's extremely snobby and forces her unscientific personal emotionally charged views. The pro life community ate offering help. Why is that being demonized? It's a baby they ate trying to save and saving the mother from murdering the defenseless baby.
Once born they all could care less
self appointed saviors.   doing GOD's work apparently...because god needs them doesnt he......only they decided that
How many kids have these clowns adopted themselves? Ya...that's what I thought
"MEN! instead of protesting at clinics, GO VOLUNTEER FOR A VASECTOMY!!!"
I demand that you can’t have an abortion and also that every lunatic & psycho can have as many guns as they want.
THESE WOMEN CHOOSETO GO OUT AND ALEEP WITH EVERY GUY THEY SEE AND EXPECT AMERICANS TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THET DONT BELIEVE IN .I GUESS TO MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEMSELVES
Be more outraged by the overturning of Rowe v Wade America!! This is The Hadmaids Tale. It here. It’s now. Be more OUTRAGED!!!
Killing babies is not okay
Thank you
"These bloody 'Pro-Lifers...' offer to 'help' these poor women with 'thoughts and prayers' (but bugger-all else,) send death threats to escorts, and have even KILLED medical staff -- but noo, *they're* the saintly ones, caring about a fetus that, even if it DOES survive its birth, will most likely struggle in poverty and/or a potentially dangerous home environment. These nutters need to stay out of other people's business."
Im pro choice but what irks be is “activists” who make it out like its just like going to dr for a normal surgery/procedure. A life / potential human is most def being killed and that ie HEAVY shit . It should be like a last option kinda deal for woman who are raped or their life is in danger . It bothers me who some woman just be huge irresponsible hos and use it as a form of birth control and then brag about it as if its some kind of activism.
"If you're going to take a life and it's not an unborn baby what makes you better leave people alone and live your own life, everyone has their own cross to bare, it's not your business"
"I would happily escort women safely to their doctors in these cases. If there's one thing these women need, it's not a group of self-righteous elderly bigots screaming at them outside the door. They need a kind, compassionate ear and guaranteed safe entry into the clinic."
Shouts out to the escorts! You are doing amazing!
"When he meet his maker, he’s going to ask him when did he hire him as his hit man. And killing people at abortions clinics? Way to go pro-lifers. Way to go."
"Dan and the other protesters could actually help the children.... living ones... like foster children. I bet that would actually quench his ""guilt""."
"These clinic escorts are such wonderful people, thank you for protecting women💚💚💚"
Raising a child is a heroic act. But should never be mandated.
Anti-abortion is completely misogynistic. WAKE UP LADIES .
"Right to life should start with the man not dipping his wick, and end with a young person not dying in a BANKER""S WAR."
Poor lady to stupid to know there standing up for her rights to if they get by with this next time it mite be her voting rights
"always using god as their backbone, there is no god, its just a big scam"
"People are literally attacking people going to church and firebombing pregnancy centers and trying to kill the Supreme Court Justices but the terrorists at CNN want to talk about crimes that happened in the early 90s when I was still a toddler as if they are relevant today.

Leftists are irredeemable monsters who know they are going to hell and that is why they want to cause as much chaos and destruction as they can before they suffer the karma they have wrought upon themselves."
"Does she broadcast them on TikTok so they're up on a social media platform for everyone to see?  Pretty awesome right? It's kinda like that person that posted content of people that, in their OWN WORDS we're saying all kinds of radical stuff. What was the name of that??..... OH! ""Libs of TikTok"" it's called!! Yeah. Wait,...CNN you hated it when they did it/do it. But, ya think it's great when this person does it? So, ya have zero moral compass. Just follow an ideology and if you agree with someone doing it, It's amazing, stunning and brave. But if you disagree with the person doing it then it's awful, deplorable and they should be deplatformed & maybe threatened or intimidated. Ya see where this train is heading right? Not much of a leap to go from here to ""throw em in jail if they disagree with our po!itics/ideology!"" & 'seperate rules & punishments' for people based on political stance. Ya know how this movie ends. ""Throw em in jail!"" becomes hurting/killing based on politics."
It’s crazy how u trying to show this women as brave and doing the right thing when she’s actually trying to justifies killing potential human beings!! there is no excuse  u can utter that can justify giving anyone the right to kill. Stop sleeping around and stick to ur families and drop that feminist way of viewing the world.
Thank you protestors! You make such an amazing difference! There have been countless women that changed their mind due to pro-life advocates and ended up choosing life!
"I love this, Don't worry women won't stand for this much longer and Abortion will be legal again...
-we should pray hahahahah.. too soon?"
God bless those fucking assholes.
These escorting employees are so appreciated! Thank you so much for all that you do protecting these women and their right to choose!
I wish i had 0 issues and free time to make someone else problems mine
Abortion is murder!!! Repent and turn to Jesus Christ!!
When you meet your maker he won't ask you about the sins of others. You've lost the plot
They are praying for you. Give me a f........ng break.
Why do these people think only their opinion counts.
"The Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia is in the gay section.  There used to be weekly demonstrations there.  I remember watching one and I loved it when these activists were saying “don’t kill your baby, don’t kill your baby” to a man dressed as a woman."
All I heard is I've been harassing people since 1973.
There’s a good reason that there are only a few doctors left in the country that will perform third trimester abortions. And it’s not because they’ve all been killed off. Most doctors know better than to think that killing a 6-month old fetus and beyond is just “terminating a pregnancy.” You’re seriously mistaken / delusional if you think this man is a hero for what he does.
Dr. Carhart is a hero. I hope that he finds someone to replace him.
get an air horn
"""I've been in this movement since '73"" - awesome! So, how many parentless children have you adopted and raised in that time, Sir?"
"Wow, 11 deaths don't really seem like much when you consider that over 1.5 million babies were sacrificed last year alone."
Amazing woman!! Keep up the fight! We shall overcome.
i love her so much thank god for her
I would love to know if any if the anti-abortion people adopt? Cause if ya dont' you are NOT doing the work of our Lord Jesus Christ....you are working for the other guy.
"Don't these folks that have nothing else in their lives to do. Like protest the
BIGGER PROBLEMS for our world."
Adding an element of humor...she says. Abortion is nothing to be humorous about. Let's  not forget abortion is a big business. Follow the money. Just look at how many people they have escorting the clients.
How is 3 trimester abortion not murder when all of these fetuses are viable
"Pro life and Pro Choice is all about divide. No one is listening to the victims. After listening to 50 testimonials from girls/women that had an abortion, some of those were SA and are minors. I can say for one is that these beautiful females did suffer mentally and emotionally, most of which is guilt. Most of them could not let go of that strong bond with there baby despite there circumstances they have faced. Some of which lasted for a period of 30 years or more. Simply saying abortion is health care is a far cry what it really is. 
Some of you on both sides and I don't care which really need to listen to the victims of abortion except really having your own opinions. 

If I could try to explain the connection between human beings of experiencing unconditional love.
It's like this, my friends had a new born baby...I didn't have children at that time and they told me ""you'll never know what love truly is until you have a baby"" I was like yeah what ever and it didn't matter what it meant at that time. A few years went by and I settled down, she is 2 and half now and now I understand what it really feels to love unconstitutionally. Something I cannot explain. 

That bond if taken away, even if earlier...I would not be the same person, I feel for these people that chose abortion. 

I hope you all find peace in knowing that your baby is back with God."
Anti abortionists are right ... abortion is murder ... why bash chritians ?  They have to blame someone ...
She not exactly easy on the ole eye..
"Hey cnn instead of posting this old video why don't you interview the elephant after the roevwade decision , I really want to see it cry on live news , like all the other unhinged sjws of tiktok."
Pro-life activist embarrass me as well as the other behaviour made by pro-choice activist. And the fact that the 'clinic escort' is trying add humour to this very sensitive and sad topic. How tragic is it that people are fighting for the right to kill fetuses.
Our souls never die
Screeeeammnmm mm
"The pro lifers, also like to complain about ""poor people"" and how much money they get to support a child someone couldn't take care of."
Absolutely disgusting that people stand & yell at people who are often making the hardest decision of their life.  They don’t need some pro-lifer yelling lies at them or “praying over them”.   Leave them the hell alone!  It’s none of their business.  Really sad that escorts aren’t necessary
It’s sad that normal people are being terrorized by religious zombies.
Y'all are messed up
if you need an escort that would be a wakeup call for what I'm doing
"You do not need to kill to have a good life. You may opt for an adoption to give life for the child. However, if it means a life and death situation though, so be it."
Would you ever abort your cats or dogs.?? Why humans then??
"I'm sure the ""help"" they offer is to send you to welfare and sign up for the circle of never ending poverty."
this lady is a monster. the doctor is a monster. how horrible of a person do you have to be to take a job were you kill (or help kill) defenceless babies?
3rd trimester abortion are you people nuts...that's capital murder.thats a fully developed baby.it can live outside the mother in the 3rd trimester.may God have mercy on your soul
Desperate!! Sure because shaming those crying over babies being slaughtered is so much more righteous than shaming those slaughtering babies to keep from having to raise their own.  Choice begins at consent.. after that I still call it murder!
"Maybe men should stop getting women pregnant. Go into schools, talk to boys about birth control, about treating women with respect. No women gets pregnant on her own."
"You people expesselly the men how gullible you are, a women can choose but a man can't choose no child support.wheres the equal rights.my wallet my choice. You know why women cry at abortion clinics hummm because there killing babies"
"I am not for abortion, but let's be honest, no one can force his or her believes on anyone that think otherwise. God gave us the right choose our own destiny. Love thy nabour as you love yourself. 😢😢😢"
"They are crazy, it's it harassment ?"
"Anti abortion idiots are dangerous, violent, imbecilic, and need to be arrested."
"All these protesters should have to sign a legal form....for all babies that are born unwanted, for them to each adopt one baby.  Start saving now..
.adopting is more than you think. How many of these protesters would agree?aybe a third....at the most. The rest go back into the system. So 
 are these protesters willing to stand for the unwanted babies?"
Good thing some of these are about to pass….
"What a stupid thing, people are so scared of kids getting murdered at school but not afraid of babies being murdered before even being born."
"Send all those anti-abortion activists to the cities and tell them to take care of all the homeless people. Instruct them to instead tell a homeless person that he or she is beautiful, to feed him or her, and to make a lifetime commitment to continue doing so. THEN - maybe - I’ll take them seriously."
These protesters could better spend their time adopting or fostering children.
Pro CHOICE
"Conservative extremist: "" I'm pro-life. it's wrong to kill another living being."" 
But will support the death penalty. 
Conservative extremist: ""government mask mandates violate my freedom and rights, my body my choice."" 
but have no issues with the government telling a woman what she can or cannot do with her body. 
Conservative extremist: ""Cancel culture is ruining our society.""
But will support a man who uses social media to incite hate, division, and bigotry. Regularly attacks people on social media and demands they are fired or ruined politically/ financially for disagreeing with him. 
Someone, please help me understand the dichotomy that is the Conservative extremist. 
(Conservative Extremist aka Trumptard)"
"How do u sleep with a 3rd trimester abortion on ur hand really, the world needs to end coz we r becoming mad too mad"
Thank you. You do a incredibly tough job that I’m sure is mostly thankless. Our country needs  more people like the patriots in the video.
Cnn is a demonic antichrist channel that needs to repent
"""I believe these children are being violated....""
I wonder what he thinks about the 10yo from Ohio who was raped and impregnated.
Would he have been outside the clinicnshe had to go to for services when she couldn't go to one in her own state?"
I guess everyone missed the fact that God will judge them .
"This is just harassment by self righteous lunatics, nothing more. There should be a safety zone of at least one mile around any abortion clinic where harassment like this and protests are not allowed."
"I went to a clinic one time where protestors were constantly out front.

I went in to ask some questions and get some information about the services they provided.

I wasn’t doing this because I had any involvement at all in a potential abortion.

I did it because I wanted to be informed .

As I pulled into the parking lot, the protestors started yelling at me. Presuming I was someone going there for some nefarious reason instead of just trying to educate myself.

That speaks VOLUMES about these protestors."
Keep your legs closed
How many kids have they adopted? How many are foster parents? How can you be a “Pro-Lifer” but racist at the same time?
Try to take a gun away from a Pro-Lifer and see how that turns out
"Escorts to protect people seeking health care? Wow - the USA is a sick country. You have no idea what it's like to see the insanity of that country when you come from a freer, saner, safer place."
I guess I don't understand why those same people care so much about the unborn but don't protest gun violence that is actually killing children in schools.
"None of these people have permits to protest there. Why aren’t they forcefully removed by the police,..?"
"There’s nothing more Christian than shaming, threatening, assaulting and killing those who doesn’t share your view,..? 🤔

Say it together with me, people: Christian extremists!!"
"In the city I live in there are laws (with real punishments) that excludes people from protesting with 500 metres of a clinic.  But we have legal abortion here in Australia and I doubt that will ever change.  No illegal abortions, no backyard butchers, no rabid Christians shoving there bullshit beliefs down people's throats."
The USA are such a strange place...
"All these anti abortion protesters should just be asked, How many children have you fostered or adopted, Rj in Oz"
"Shelley is a new hero of mine.  Thank you, Shelley.
And HEY, anti-abortion cruds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You are concerned about human life?  Fetuses?  Then how do you justify killing abortion clinic workers?  Or not providing child care and paid leave for new mothers in red states?
Since when is THAT ""pro-life""?"
Is. Dan going to take responsibility financially and otherwise for these children
Those religious nuisances are the American Taliban!
That's exactly what we need to do
Them people are amazing theyre trying to save lives
how can I donate to the Clinic Escorts. How shameful those people screaming are.
I remember my abortion the Planned Parenthood I even went to initially didn’t do abortions I had to call different doctor. I didn’t want to have an abortion now these ladies he’s harassing wants to have an abortion it’s a need it’s a necessity for me it was life or death this man is despicable and disgusting and his maker will probably condemn him if he actually took the time to read the fucking Bible he’s throwing everyone’s face at and forcing upon everybody else maybe he would realize what it actually says.
"Dr. Tiller was killed in a church, just down the road from me."
God bless these people for fighting those people who need their service.  It’s not anyone’s business.
"They're pro-life yet they kill and hurt people???lololol Such hypocrisy, these pro-lifers are stupid."
"Anti-Abortion protester,,, I am here to help you...... but I won't give you my name."
"What even sort of bullshit charge was that? ""Mutual consent"" that says something about how messed up the law is. I hope Shelley and all abortion clinic escorts stay safe. They are doing depressingly necessary work."
I have been watching her TikTok for quite a while. I think she and others who do this are amazing people. They deal with the pro-birth people days so women can get healthcare.
"""we're praying for you right now"" = we're not doing anything."
"Her reactions are gold. “Joe, cmon are you done?”"
What a hero she is.
"""Imma take a little break from escorting ""😂 😂"
"would  any  human being end up with these guys , for sure not. that is why abortion is invented on the first place."
"I love reading these comments complaining about not killing babies,by ""people"" that are alive and breathing because their own mothers allowed them to live.... stupidity much?..why don't any of you take one for the team,take yourself out if life is so meaningless to you?..one word.. HYPOCRITES"
"I volunteer to be a honker. 
I am SURE I can drown out those protestors."
Didn't God send the angel of death to kill all the first born sons? 🤔
The Taliban has a a's new Heartland
Till all these poor people are forced to have children and their taxes ho way way up to pay for their welfare. No one looks at the long picture.
"Already saw this video. But yeah, Anti-Abortion laws and Protests are not gonna work if there isn’t a healthcare system in place to solve all of the fundemental issues related to struggling and vulnerable mothers and children."
"THANK YOU to all the protectors who stand with clients going to the clinic. 
You are so brave. You make a huge difference.
(And countless thank yous for the medical professionals who chose to take on this work and put a target on their backs. You are all heroes)."
"They could be volunteering in the community, with kids who need attention. But no, spend your time harassing people trying to access health care! I’m sure god will be so pleased with how you chose to spend your time…"
Do they think women who have scheduled abortions should go to prison for life and/or be executed? Because those are the typical punishments for 1st degree murder. (I’m sure some extremists have this view but the vast majority don’t - because it could always happen to them or someone they love.)
"Story time: I was 7 months pregnant and donated time to PP for election call purposes. It’s important to mention I love being pregnant, I love my children, I’d even consider being a surrogate, however I do believe in a woman’s right to choose. Anyway, driving in to PP I was harassed and almost blocked from getting in, it was scary and very overwhelming. I wasn’t even going in for an abortion and still felt the weight of whatever emotions the women/girls feel when going into the building. I guess the moral of the story is that “abortion clinics” are used for so much more."
"These escort women are amazing, 
The protesters should be  ashamed, they have no idea, the men especially.
Hypocritical sods. They have only followed their own agenda, not the truth of suffering. 
Jesus said, never to judge others, or you will be judged.  Don't look at the stick in someone else's eye, look at the plank in your own.  
Be strong ladies, your doing a great job."
😂 seems odd the only females protecting abortions are the ones nobody wants to get pregnant in the first place 🐄 🐮 🐷 🐖
"Truly abortions should be available right alongside other care.  Then for all these wackadoos would know, they might be heckling a women on her way in for a tonsillectomy. Joke’s on them."
Love this woman.
"So these anti abortions kill people … and yet they protest about “ pro life “

This is what happens when stupid organize religion takes over !

We need to DESTROY ORGANIZE RELIGION!!"
I don't think that people understand what goes on INSIDE an abortion clinic!
"Amazing that derelict men take no responsibility for the fruits of  their sexual abuse, violence or exploitation!"
"Thank you so, so very much for the work you do, Shelly!!! You are an incredible human being! 💚💚💚"
"I’m watching ‘The Handmaids’ Tale’ and looks like that book/series is slowly becoming a reality. Starts here… so scary America, so scary!"
"I think when a minor gets raped they should implement law with death penalty for rapists. Other methods should be castration, or injection for infertility for the rapist. If the woman is adult she should decide what to do with the rapist s life  since her free will was taken by force from her I think he should no longer have free will. If she decides she wants to marry him, he should comply with her demands and be forced to work and be a provider for her and the baby."
😂😂😂this country should be purged they have people ok with killing babies but get mad for people who don't support them😂😂😂 blessed be the God of Israel please show this country no mercy
Yiu dont care about women!! You just love money!!!
Imagine a group of people being so dangerous that people make a living being protected from them...
"I dink the male does terrible job . 
Abortion is a sin"
Men need a womb !! Nobody's business !!
The religious extremists huddle together like bowling pins. sure would be unfortunate if the incoming patients just… 🎳
"Mostly men and a few brainwashed women
Hmmm

EDIT: The fact she has to look for bombs every morning is beyond disgusting"
That was brave of Shelley.
Why is it almost all old men 💀💀
"Why do they not offer to adopt the children if they care so much? And that's IF they could even be able to support it properly. Unfortunately we DO live in a world with limited resources... well who am I kidding it's the greed why the resources aren't enough more than anything else. But if they want women to stop having abortions, they should go to the root of the problem. Start protesting against greed and then against abortions."
All these crazy religious people are ridiculous. The irony that they want the “baby” to live yet they’ll attack the mother & clinic. These people are full on narcissistic crazy people
Stop pushing your religion on to us!  Not everyone is a Christian! Not everyone believes in God!
Funny how these god soldiers aren’t protesting in front of Walmart because their starvation wages create child hunger. Guess they don’t care once your born
"Studies show liberals have a smaller amygdala..,you can stick a plate of rotting meat in front of their faces and they won’t react as badly as a conservative would. Liberals are not biologically capable of feeling reluvsion at things that disgust a normal person."
They should put headphones on the clinic clients when they get out of the car and also have a covered “walkway of support” or something.
"God will be the Judge ! NOT men and women !
I wonder, will they be there to raise the child for 18 years ?
House the child as it grows, feed, educate, pay for Medical care ? 
When does the commitment begin and end ?
If it happens and is followed through! 
We never seem to hear them ... other than, ""We can help you"" !
Yes, perhaps carry the child and then be coerced to give it up for a so called perceived life with an adopting family ! Who may or not give the child a better life !

Or, as I stated, help the mother raise it to 18 years old !?"
"The fact she has to inspect the surroundings for bombs every day, says all you need to know about how far these self righteous nutjobs are willing to go to push their extreme christo fascist ideas onto the rest of society."
She acts like she's walking sometime down a red carpet.. but she's helping to kill babies!! And she's so proud of that. Hate to see when she meets her maker!
"My sister had an abortion a few weeks ago.
The cells stopped dividing and wouldn't implant but also not spontaneously abort on itself. So she had to if she didn't want to risk a sepsis.
I'm glad we live in Germany where it wasn't an issue as soon as she found a doctor"
Thank you to the brave people like Shelley who stand up these sanctimonious zealots. And male anti abortion protesters have nothing to say on this topic. Power hungry control freaks. Please go home and stop harassment of women already going through a horrendous ordeal.
"Thank God I was a Christian before I heard of these so called right wing Christian anti abortionist.  God has told us that killing is a sin whether it's those who do abortion or the murderer who kills the doc who does the abortion.  However, we can't get away from the fact that sometimes aborting a fetus is necessary for whatever medical reason. God is the ultimate judge and if he does not strike these people dead why should a human kill them. These people are the same type of Christians who use to lynch blacks after church on Sundays. Now that past time is forbidden they must find another cause celebre to exercise their violent traits. Sad that the name of Christ is misrepresented and vilified because of these people.  God is love."
Why are there men protestors? Sorry what do they know? Speaking of a man myself.
I miscarried conjoined twins. I needed to have a an abortion afterwards because my body could not pass them. It’s called an incomplete miscarriage. They died. I saw a ton of specialists. If I would not have had the procedure I would’ve become septic and died.
You don’t give a crap about those kids once they’re born why aren’t you fighting for those ones? The kids in foster care? The kids who are looking for people to adopt them? How about the mothers that are basically forced to have babies they can’t afford and can’t feed? What are you doing about them? Instead of wasting your time doing something that isn’t going to change a thing don’t you go and do some thing to actually help. What is your God gonna say to you about the fact that you’re judging other people when his word says not to. Not everyone has to have the same beliefs as you. Also it depends on what version of the Bible you believe in. In original versions it talks about The fact it is not all life until quickening which is moving around four or five months. The worst part is there are people out there who have genetic mutations and illnesses that can’t have kids Because their children would just suffer and die. They would never be able to even afford the care for these types of children. Yet these people are forcing them to be born to suffer and then bitch about the fact that we the people have to pay for them. These people are so two-faced it makes me crazy
"Last week, my wife and I, had a scan for our baby. Yes the scan is lovely to see and hear the heart beat and find out the gender. But that scan is also finding out if the baby is developing properly. It finds out if mother and baby are healthy and the birth will be safe with both surviving. If not... if one or both may die or live a horrible life, then an abortion needs to be talked about. If that happened to us, we chose life, but an abortion is what would happen."
"My girlfriend in 1977 had an abortion when she was 17. A few years later, when she was ready, she married a man and they had two children. She's a grandma now. My mother, born in 1918(!) knew women who used coat hangers, and she was pro-choice before there was such a thing. Glory be to a woman's right to choose what is right for her own body!"
"These protesters are stalkers, and they are sick."
It's 2022 and since 1977 11 people was killed I'm not saying I have no sadness in my heart for those people who has died that is something that never should of happened but do you know how many children are denied the Chance just because there mother's decide there not ready to be a adult and take responsibility for her actions even if it's under the situation of rape or father left what is another example of someone choosing to stay a child instead of taking responsibility for there actions abortion is never a good thing if you was raped or the father left and you can't take care of the child on your own give it up for adoption the only time the practice is a good thing is if the mother and the child is going die if you don't terminate the pregnancy if there is a possibility of saving one of those lives you need to take it if you can save the child's life by getting it all the mother's womb as quickly as possible but the mother will still die then you need to save the child's life but if there no possible way of saving the child's life and you can save the mother's life then save to mother's life but other then that it is never ok to take a life
So WHY does the Supreme Court allow this type of harrassment at legal medical facilities but expect   freedom from protesters at their homes?
"I wish they would do a piece or all the clinics posing as Medical Facilities provider ,when in reality they are religious groups. How is that not against the law? If I set up a stand outside and say I’m a Medical Provider I would be arrested in less then 30 min!!!"
Thank you for your service to our rights.
God bless these escorts goddam the evil protesters. They be overturned Roe but they won't be satisfied even that
These peeps protesting are wasting their precious lives trying to save some
She is a bad ass.  Thank you Shelly.
"Yes, praying for them is the biggest help they'd get from you to raise a child they can't afford to. And money & time just falls from the prayers."
I do NOT agree with 3rd trimester abortion. That's a full grown baby. A person has plenty of time to get an abortion before the 3rd trimester.
I didn't think the walk was lonely at all. There was no way I was giving life to my rapist baby who probably would've been a rapist too. I also needed to protect my son from the monster! It was 26 years ago & I never regretted it!!!
WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE!!!! IF YOU GET AN ABORTION AT 6 WEEKS ITS NOT EVEN A BABY!!! LET MEN TRYING BEING PREGNANT WITH A BABY FROM YOUR RAPIST!!!
Baby daddy’s don’t pay child support or approve insurance
"Hopefully no one trust this child murder to watch their children, because she would rather see that child in a trash can/ dumpster instead of a crib or paying games"
Shelley is a literal angel xoxo
The difference between the 11 deaths by anti abortion and the babies whom have been aborted by pro abortion is a huuuuuuggggeeeee difference..... I'm just saying  .. it's a touchy subject but pro abortions aren't any better then the ones whom have displayed any acts of violence on others..
"If only they would stand infront of orphanages, group homes, homeless shelters to help the children who are already alive."
The protestors don’t offer to adopt the unwanted children nor do they offer financial assistance for unwanted childrens welfare. They are all talk.
These anti abortion protesters sre nuts.  Im not crying crocodile tears over an direct action that happens against them.
4:15  only 11 people killed in anti-abortion acts since 1977??!?!  thats sounds 100x safer  than being a teacher in school.
"A Message to Evangelical Radicals..., ""Be Not like the Pagans who shout and pray on the streets or in the open market."" 
(NIV)"
More men telling woman what they can and can’t do American freedom I don’t think so
"""And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.  So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."""
This picketing kind of reminds me of this s*** those westboro Baptist Church bastards do.
God bless you keep the faith
If you are a man you have no responsibility of being there.
Wow they say choose life but they kill people  now isn't that an oxymoron and and hypocritical
Funny the lady in the video says she wants the choice of life but that kids are a choice if you can't have an abortion then you don't have a choice if you're pregnant and living in one of the backward states.
"The escorts are heroes to people seeking abortion. Protestors think they’re doing good work, but they’re just making a nightmare situation worse. No one goes to an abortion clinic without being in a very tough place in their life. The shouting and guilting is awful. It’s her body, her choice. End of story."
I just never knew what venue I could use get to young women living in Red states.  But Get out now.  Get to a blue state you don’t have to live in big cities but there are a ton of medium cities with job opportunities and reasonable housing.  Save your money get on a bus and get to a Blue state and start a new safe life.  Do not be controlled by a man who loves his gun more than you.
"OMG, I would probably beat these crazies with their own placards.  Notice they offer nothing for the women who are seeking abortion."
"""We're here to HELP you! Wait--what? Your baby is born? Ugh. Get lost, chump. You're on your own. I've got kids of my own to take care of."""
"I'm sure she wouldn't oppose the illegal protesting at the houses of Supreme Court Justices. That's not harassment or disturbing the peace, that's women's rights! She should record Jane's Revenge and Ruth Sent Us firebombing crisis pregnancy centers since Roe being overturned.

That being said, many pro-lifers use the wrong approach (imo) and any person who physically attacks these women or kills the doctors is a disgrace and should be locked away."
"Instead of standing and saying they're praying, why don't they donate that time to a homeless shelter, lots of young women with children! Do they really think God will be proud of them for harassing women who are making the hardest decision in their lives??? That behavior is not the God that I love."
So your anti-abortion but you're willing to assault or take people's lives? WTF! How about all of the children already here that need to be adopted or are in foster care? They're definitely is not enough people helping and providing homes for them. Why not spend your time doing something that could really make a difference in the life of children?
It’s not cool because I didn’t have insurance when I was 17 and was going to get a check up at plan parenthood and had a bottle thrown at me I wasn’t even pregnant I was just there to get a pap done so they don’t know why girls go in some of the time.
"I had an abortion almost 40 years ago and later an ectopic pregnancy that almost killed me. I have 2 grown daughters and no regrets over the 2 I lost. These protesters are fools. If it was their child who was raped or had a pregnancy complication,  they'd be getting it taken care of (most likely hiding and denying it)."
Anti abortionists should be ashamed. I don't see them stepping up and taking care of unwanted children. They are not righteous they are selfish. That guy Dan in the video I have one to say... How many children have you adopted?
You can see why they're anti abortion. They look like the ones that probably should have been aborted
"Of course CNN makes a hero out of the abortion lady and mocks the people that would like to save lives. Discusting CNN, mirder supporter"
I would LOVE to be a clunic escort. I'd be screaming at these people to get a hobby or go to work
Prayers are not going to help these women who need medical care.
God given right to be ignorant. Though it pisses me off they choose to be willfully stupid! 😮‍💨😤
I'm just puzzled at what antiabortion protesters and clinic bombers are going to do with themselves now. Will they find a way to keep living? Or is the spice of life all used up now.
These are probably the same people complaining about babies on the border getting formula.
"The hypocrisy in the US! It's revolting! ""I HaVe tHe riGHt to oWN a Gun beCause it's My FreEdom to DO What I want! But YOU don't have the right or the freedom to choose for yourself and your family. You have to give birth to that child woman, or else I'll kill you with my beloved guns because I'm sooo pro-life and goes to church every sunday like all good christians! Not MY problem that the child I force you to give birth to is raised in poverty because you are in debt after paying hospital bills because the US healthcare system are a joke to all other civilized countries. Not MY problem that your child that I forced you to give birth to ends up being shot in their classroom at 8 years old. GunS DoNt kiLL PeOple, PeoPLE do... Background checks you say! Nooo,that is treading on my freedom! My right to own a gun even if I am a raving loony toon is my freedom. Freedom to walk down the street without being afraid of being shot you say? Never heard of him... Thank f**ck that I live in a civilized country that gives a sh*t about their own people and not ONLY about money and power. Disgusting!"
I love her
I am so sick of listening to all these religious zealots force their beliefs on others.
They’re all pro life until the baby is born…
"You wanna protest? Show me how many unwanted children you have adopted personally and are raising - one for each woman you've harassed. And any number under 50 doesn't count. If YOU don't live what you force down other people's throats, you don't count."
Moral or religious protestors which have more of and which group is more aggressive? My guess is there are more moral protestors and the religious ones are more agressive. that would be my guess. I could be wrong.
She is awesome!
The abortion choice whether it be a sin or not is between the woman and their God.  NOT self righteous pieces of crap that have nothing better to do than pass judgment as if they can walk on water as Jesus did.
These religious nuts are just living in their own lonely fantasy world. I bet they don’t even get along with one another. If you talk to them they are really hard to relate to. They are so lost and looking for purpose. Just lonely crazy people. It’s kind of pathetic.
"You know what I find so funny about this video is that Liberals have a record of NON PEACEFUL protesting and have a history of causing so much damage to property and especially physically hurting people.  I'm sure on the pro-life side, there are always gonna be people who do not protest peacefully, but the side that mostly causes damage are the liberals, which carry a majority of pro-choice advocates.  Look it up.  The pro-choicers are known to protest violently.  Recently, a pro-life institution was burned down by protesters."
People need to mind their own business….”we’ll help you”😂😂😂 these people don’t give a crap about the child after it’s born
"At least they aren’t firebombing and destroying the property of family planning facilities and their mobile vans, like the pro-abortion extremists. Do a story on jane’s revenge next, cnn!"
"I believe is a women’s right to make her own decision but, waiting until your in your third trimester should not be legal."
I'd setup a big screen tv or projector that plays something really loud on loop to annoy them. Maybe a biology lecture or a heavy metal band.
Why don't these  people adopt children and care for them in their home instead of this...... more importantly...... now what do these self righteous freaks do? Are they at home looking for another cause?
"I'd say, ""okay, give me your address. As soon as I give birth, I'm leaving it on YOUR doorstep and YOU can pay for and raise it""."
What do you think will happen when these self-righteous people meet their maker and are asked: What gives to the right to interfere in someone else's life?   Didn't you trust me to handle my children?  How do you know that I didn't give them permission to have an abortion?  They all prayed and asked me what to do and I referred them to a safe medical procedure and forgave them.  WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE?????
None of these men look like they even BABYSIT. 😒
"I don't think people have a realistic picture of what happens INSIDE of abortion clinics... Please, SHOW US!"
Hold on.... let me get something straight..... so if someone murders a pregnant woman they are held accountable for 2 counts of murder because 2 LIVES were taken. One for the woman and one for the fetus REGUARDLESS of what stage if pregnancy the woman is in.... BUT..... it should be ok to go ahead and kill your own baby and not be held accountable for that life..... yep makes perfect sense. Now youre thinkin.
God gives you the right to choice.
"Baby killers justifying their existence. Looking for bombs, As if anti abortion people are the killers."
"An omelet does not kill chickens.  Abortion prevents life but doesn't take life.  If these pro-lifers want to save children why are they not protesting gun companies that kill 1300 living, thinking children every year?  Why are they not protesting car companies for the 1000 child deaths every rear?

Today, 12 million American children do not get enough to eat.  Why aren't they protesting that?   These pro-lifers do not give an ounce of effort toward the quality of life the children that are born will face.

500,000 children have their lives ruined by sexual abuse _every year._  Why not protest state administrations that have weak abuser laws?

In 100 years that one fetus if taken to term will average 32 additional people on the planet.  What about population management?  Do pro-lifers think about how to feed all these new people?  3 billion world population in 1960.  8 billion world population 2022.  The population will grow an average of one billion people every decade.

Pro life isn't about life.  It's about the noise.  It's about morality.  It's about religion.  It's about putting their noses in where it doesn't affect them.  It's meddling.

They are pro-birthers.  Those lives that are lived doesn't matter to them."
Thank the clinic protectors. Those Women are just getting health care.
Revelation 2:18-26
"Anti abortion means anti science , anti democracy , they go hand in hand with that group of goons. Why wait go meet your maker in a history museum . Australopithecus.  Oh , wait the goons think the planet is only 6000 years old  and some guy gave e rib to make a woman. Brain dead people are very dangerous."
"Crimninal murders are ""Pro-life""... how ironic these Republican PEASANTS are?"
Hold on you murder people who have families and friends and responsibilities but want to stop abortion to protect fetus !!!!!! Why some the can grow up have a family have friends then you can murder them?
Oh I want to do this... but the restraint it would take not to choke out these nutcases!
Omg I can’t stand Christians. Always a pain
They don't show up with their checkbooks to support children.. they rail about welfare..
Our society has become so sick…that the elderly man who is trying to protect the life of an unborn child is looked at as the monster and is confronted by grown women trying to protect the women who is about to walk into an office to kill her child. Like WTFFFF
All this energy could be spent helping kids that are already in the system instead .  How about their lives?
The people that call themselves religious are the first ones to criticize single mothers and block them from any help or resources.
"This is really yet another crazy, uniquely American thing ....
Mass shootings, school shootings, anti-abortionists who call themselves ""pro-lifers"" .... until the unwanted child is born."
Thank goodness for her. She's an angel. The protesters can go to hell
"Abortion clinics should be eliminated and all reproductive healthcare done at the hospital, that way nobody outside would know where the people going in are going.....  No more protesters...Ridiculous that someone had enough time to waste to sit there outside of a clinic and not mind their own business.   If you don't believe in abortion, don't have one,  what give's you the right to know what's best for someone else?"
50 bucks for assault? Welcome to Saudi America.
You have the choice to close your legs or use protection… any one who abort is evil
Imagine your life is so pathetic you stand in front of an abortion clinic holding a sign all day.
I love how we have people  running  around killing  kids and random people  with guns but yall got energy for this. Like what wheres the gun control? U would  rather save this life so they can be killed  later in a classroom/or anywhere  else they are not safe i would  rather not have a child  suffer  that at all. And god forbid its a girl because  it looks like we are going  to be living  like the hand maids tale soon in this bitch. Also lets not not forget the fact we are killing  our earth. They wont have a place to live anyway. And with the cost of living  shit rising damn i can go on forever 😒
Shocking how it’s mostly men w their ranting. Such a joke. Ok so she keeps it & than those men can pay for that child for 18 years!
"America, isnt it time to not have dedicated abortion clinics which are just begging to be targeted? Have abortions in regular clinics and hospitals (like in my country), so the woman gets anonymity!!"
"This lady's attitude is so bizarre...but you know, she may be another Abby Johnson in the making."
They supposedly value life and then murder people ... the hypocrisy just astounds me ... maybe anti religion protestors should counter demo 🙄🙄🙄 (there are many arguments against organised religions ... wish i could do it damn my 'original sin!!!')
"Just mind your own business. Is your life so perfect that you really have the time to involve yourself towards a PERFECT stranger for living theirs how they see fit?  My belief is simple. Do you! I will do me as I see fit. That goes for religion, abortion, your sexuality, for everything that does not DIRECTLY effect others. You don't believe in abortion, don't have one and don't push your agenda on others! ."
"The amount of hate American have for each other, is sad to see. I hope one day, you forgive each other and live peacefully. 💙💙💙❤️"
"People are sick, in their minds thinking they have the right to dictate to people through their ""god"" ."
"Miss ""Withheld Name "" I want U tell children that have been raped that got pregnant to keep the baby because it´s a beautiful gift of life .. tell them that !! ... Tell that to the girl in Indiana who was 10 and denied ..

Let women or young girl have their right to choose what it is best for them !!"
It would not make much sense to plant a bomb. If they want to save life’s!?
This is the woman's choice.  Leave them alone.
"Quick question, all these 'pro life' protesters that murder doctors, sick women, and occasionally healthy women seeking non-abortion-related prenatal care like cheap vitamins, how many of them have been killed? How many sign-waiving pedophiles and terrorists have been gunned down by heroes defending women?

None. Huh. That seems.... strange to me."
"Every single one of those protesters should be arrested. Each and every one is a rapist and a pedophile, and should be locked away from civilized society."
"Jesus wept.. every time they use knitting needles.. and the US is exporting this trash policy.. I'm not happier with my mum's illegal abortion in hospital, not on the corner shop lady's place. than anything. I'm Norwegian. there's no way someone can convince me my mother made a bad decision, regarding her abilities to carry out a pregnancy. .. what we have now, .. information, free access and freedom WITH responsibility.. is so valuable. .. no child should be born unwanted. Or families experience the tragedies that follow unwanted... what solves this is.. short decision times and long preparation periods."
The supreme court should now hang their heads in shame.
"It seems to me that these protestors are engaging in intimidation and it should be stamped on. They are ignorant self rightious bullies, they should be moved on, in fact banned from doing what they do."
People should stand outside regular protesters homes on public property and yell things at them non stop.
^  ^ I can tell you what it is...... psychosis in American society and religous fundamentalism Now its happening in Scotland {Alba} UK. We Scottish people will not tolerate it ! Foxy Pagan love fae Scotland VVxx
If you're pro life then just don't get an abortion.
America is soooo f*cked holy sh*t 🙈
Equal protection under the law and a right to privacy ought to be the legal basis of reproductive rights.  Instead we have a bunch of nuts on the street and idiots on the supreme court telling women what they can and cannot do.
"I am glad that The Pro-Life Movement has protested against that clinic in Nebraska, and everywhere else in this nation. Thank The Lord that The Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade. Thank The Lord that the institution of abortion is now illegal. The next tasks that The States must do now is to: 1) Make all abortion illegal and punishable as a the horrendous crime that it is. 2) Finally, make abortion pills illegal as well and aggressively pursue all people who dare sell those horrendous, horrible pills."
Abortion is healthcare. Telling people someone got an abortion is against The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
"Thank you. We need more people like you, who are willing to help people, who NEED the help."
It's ironic that Dan worships the most evil character in fiction.  Poor delusional Dan will never be able to ask God why he had 2 she-bears savagely kill 42 children.
"I am SO sick and tired of the religious sects coming and trying to push their religious mumbo jumbo agenda on everyone else. If it’s their choice to be anti abortion- cool! That’s your choice as that’s a deeply personal choice to make. I cannot believed this choice was taken away for all women. I don’t believe in God and just because these people do, doesn’t give them a right to vote away EVERY womens choice. But they did. Now here we are. Another big WTF America. I seriously struggle with my daughters future here now with what little rights she has with her own body and the safety of this country. Truly disturbing and sad"
Anti-abortion protesters are just bad people. They’re completely full of themselves.
This is good propaganda.
She's a hero and so is that Dr.
She's a hero and so is that Dr.
"If you are anti-abortion, don’t doit, it’s your right. However, don’t tell other women what we can or can’t do. Mind your own business and back off!"
"What really pisses me off about anti-abortionists is their hypocrisy. They say that the babies should be born, but once they are they don't give a damn anymore."
"Democrats have not been this angry since we took away their slaves. Those who worked to abolish slavery were called fanatics and told to keep their religious and moral beliefs to themselves. Shelley is no better than a slave auctioneer. 

God bless Larry and every person who spends their life trying to protect babies. 

Also there are 36 families waiting to adopt for each baby that is put up for adoption. So stop with your lies about how people who are pro-life don’t care once the baby is born. We care. We adopt, we donate money, supplies and time. 

If you are pregnant and know you can’t parent reach out to a pregnancy center. They will give you free medical care. They will help you realize options so that you and your baby can have the best life possible. ♥️"
"I'd say ""so what? Freedom of speech."" if they were just standing outside with signs, but harassing everyone who goes in is just a crappy thing to do. Plus, how do they know they're not badgering someone who has to terminate because they won't survive the pregnancy? I saw a video of some protesters who did that to a woman who was heartbroken about having to abort. Her husband ripped into them, and rightfully so."
"I would love to see the reaction for all those people protesting when their daughters tell them that they got pregnant by minority man !!! 
Those same people protesting will be the first ones to fly their daughters across state lines and get an abortion"
"These people are so hypocritical they are making death threats  to harm a living person 
Self-righteous people are the worse !!!!"
Man Americans are creepy and so effed up
Sheroe 🦸‍♀️
"As this report states…11 people have been killed in anti abortion attacks since 1977.   That is 11 people too many.  However, how do all the supporters of this video support the over 800,000 U.S abortions that occur Every. Single. Year?"
I don't understand why the pictures of the aborted upset people. If you believe in abortion why do the pics bother you?
"Life is a gift from God. (Genesis 9:6; Psalms 36:9) He considers all life to be precious, including the life of a child in the womb. So if someone intentionally kills an unborn child, that amounts to murder."
"""when I meet my maker""
If he and the book you read is real it looks like he will turn you away from heaven and send you to hell for your sins of judging others. According to your specific religious beliefs, you, not everyone you run across, but just you are not to sin. It's not your job to judge everyone based on their decisions, nor is it your job to tell them what decision they should be making. That said, I don't think your religion is reality nor is god, but if you feel the need to save kids so much, spend more time in church with signs that tell your priests to stop molesting the kids. A clump of cells can't feel pain, nor does it have a brain at the first trimester to register pain, that clump of cells will never know it was eventually going to be human, nor will it feel pain. On the other situation I spoke of, those kids do feel pain from what is being done to them as well as the psychological damage being done. That ruins the child's whole life. So ask your God if he exists when you get to the pearly Gates why he helped some people with cancer(because you know it couldn't have been the medicine, doctors, or your body doing it, it had to be god) but he never stopped kids from being molested in his house? That means either he doesn't exist and that's why he can't help them, he agrees with it and is fine with pedophilia, or as most Christians think, it's all part of his ""plan"". So it's either a waste of time being religious and praying because he doesn't exist, or he is ok with pedophilia in which case he isn't worthy of worship at all. Either way, I'll never waste my time on this disgusting religion that has stupid people who don't know their history thinking we were founded on Christian principles (we weren't and most of the founders thought Christianity was disgusting, were atheists, agnostic, or deists.) Rant over."
MIND YOUR BUSINESS! GO TO A HOMELESS SHELTER AND USE YOUR ENERGY THERE OR FOSTER AND ADOPT. JUST LEAVE WOMEN ALONE.
aye that’s down the street I didn’t know that
"Where do I sign up!!! These ladies rock! I remember the taunts and yelling when I went to an abortion clinic in my early 20’s. Having an abortion was the last thing I wanted, but having no money or family or support left me alone and scared. I didn’t want to be another single mother who then needed to turn to public welfare. I was young and alone and the father sent 1/2 the abortion money from 15 states away and went on his business. It’s not that easy for us. I wish men understood that, the pain of an abortion and the pain afterwords not just physically but mentally. I still feel badly for having to make that choice but I’m not upset that there wasn’t more support. Instead of trying to take woman’s rights away why not make it easier and more supportive as a country to welcome children in. Stop punishing woman in the work place just bc ur worried they may get pregnant! Make health care and child care more affordable! Hold men accountable! How is it fair that men are the ones that get us pregnant but they can ghost u and their responsibilities until what??? We track them down and force a dna test at our own cost while raising their bastards without help. No wonder the birth rate is at an all time low! Men are crazy out here murdering their kids and wives. Smh. Woman need to start building ALL WOMAN COMMUNITIES (vaginas allowed/males under 14) This world is only going to get more dangerous for woman BC OF MEN."
"My 6'7"" stepdad is a clinic escort. He's not had too many problems so far. I'm really proud of him 💜"
"To whom does he ""have a responsibility"" to be there?
Does he feel guilty about forcing a young gf to have an abortion?"
Creepy old men 😢
"These overly religious people doing everything ""in the name of god"" are pathetic."
"Classic, a man telling me a women what to do with her body 😒"
Interesting that those who are pro-life don't mind KILLING YOU if you don't agree with them.  Hm.
"So the old guy claiming he hopes God has a lot of mercy on him because he’s doing this… He pretty much just admitted that he’s harassing these people because he wants services from the Lord. If you really believe in a cause, you do it because you believe in it and not because you want good favors from up above. He’s pretty much harassing these women because he has nothing better to do with his life. 🤡🥴"
It's cold...squirt them with a hose then turn on a large fan.
"Black Lives Matter sign at abortion clinic. Well til your 4 years old and can’t go to preschool cuz ya’ll cut the programs, or they need food. Just shut it."
THANK YOU . IN 2018 I WENT ALONE AND PROTESTERS REALLY REALLY WERE IN MY FACE AND NO ONE WAS OUT THERE TO HELP
"I was born to a very poor family that was unmarried, dad was on drugs, mother was a very young single mother. I wasn't planned for, born prematurely & we lived in substandard housing.  Some might have said I wouldn't have stood a chance and that my mother was irresponsible to put a child through such circumstances but my mother chose not to abort me. As an adult, I love life! I for one am greatful to be living & not to have been torn apart & dismembered in my mother's womb. There are too many other choices than to kill a child. Abortion is infanticide."
Those anti-abortionists are truly vile and wicked people!
Blow leaves in someone’s face you get what you earned b****
It’s funny how the “heroes” that CNN was trying to push came off as worst then the guys saying they care about the women and children
men telling women what to do.  that's the gop cult
"The left can dish it but they can’t take it.
These are the most benign prostesters.
The rainbows are funny you can’t get pregnant during homosexual sex"
"“Abortion is wrong so we’re gonna take it away and cause multiple people to die bc of it, I’m pro-life🤪✌️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸“"
GOD BLESS THIS LADY
"""We will help you,"" yeah until they are born. I adopted from DCFS and seen how bad it already was, cannot imagine how the foster care system will collapse after this. The escorts and doctors are amazing."
Professional Protesters….many they should direct their attention to the foster system.
Im not anti abortion but 3rd trimester??? Thats murder. I had an abortion at 22 years 4 weeks along. I would never have one when i can feel my baby move. I now have a daughter.
"I think we should throw used tampons at anti-choiceers in case we spontaneously abort. They can raise them as ""children"" since that's what they believe clumps of cells are."
Old Men have no place in pushing their views on young women who are generations younger than them.   Enough!
"I have a feeling all these people who waste their time most days begging women to not get abortions, are on government assistance. Regular people can't afford to stand around all day for a cause that does not even concern them or affect them."
Sneaky but their actors paid for fake news
Notice how most of the protesters are men? Creepy bastards. I was so grateful for my escort. These protesters can be very intimidating and in your face.
They hang around clinics to so called save a life just to take a life. Make it make sense.
"No one is asking these people for help or their opinion.  For those men, when you have the ability to carry and birth a child then you can have your opinion.   Girls and women who get pregnant from rape should have a choice!!!!  These freezing evangelical are nuts!!!"
"funny how they are not protesting outside IVF clinics.  if life ""begins at conception"", then why are they not protesting the disposal of extra unneeded embryos left over after IVF treatments are done. 
The fact that they don't, demonstrates how it's NOT about the ""unborn"".. it's about the control of women and slut-shaming them..."
"I actually feel sorry for these religiously brainwashed people. They have been culturally conditioned for all of their lives to believe in something that doesn’t exist. They honestly think they are doing a good thing, all the while hurting so many around them. I know about this because I used to be a fervent Catholic, and now I feel ashamed at the ridiculous things I thought were reality."
"And they say they’re pro-life !! 11 murders !! Jeez the hypocrisy is sickening!  Well done to this woman, she’s an angel for these women .."
Hypocrite Christian Fascists.
Why would she literally broadcast how to end appointments for a day?
People need a damn life!!!
I honestly didn't know about the escorts before I found her on TikTok. I love what she does and her videos.
women should have the right to choose. I wonder how many persons who are against a woman's right have adopted or assumed the responsibility for unwanted children?
Ya gotta love when other people tell you how to live
"Dan (from video), how many foster kids have you taken in or adopted? Or do their lives stop mattering post womb? How much have  you donated to planned parenthood to help young women get birth control or is that bad in your eyes too? Can I be a fly on the wall when you meet your maker?"
These abortion people how come each one don't go and adopt five children children that need homes thank you very much
I think Dan is hoping his maker will look past his lifetime of earthly sins if he harasses enough woman and children. 🙄
Lol certainly a problem She or her or wtf ever will not need to deal with anytime soon. Unless of course she's at border bar with unlimited tequila shots. And a morning after chew your arm off coyote on stand by. Imo
My Body My Choice?  The Baby has no say because you are selfish and only thinking of You!  And You are willing to Commit Murder. I'm sure that Baby would love to enter this World.  Stop being a bunch of Sluts.
"I wonder how many of these “pro-life” folks have actually adopted children, or at least have foster kids."
Let me get this straight- they want these women to have children but if said child grows up and is anywhere on the LGBTQIA+ spectrum all of a sudden they're an abomination and should have never been born? Sounds to me like they don't actually know what God wants or how it works (I'm a Hindu and we dont believe that Brahman (God) is a man or woman but rather encompasses both energies (masculine & feminine) and not these human biologic labels).
Walk up to each one of them asking for money to feed said child… that’ll get em to shut up 🤐
What help are they offering? Where are these people when the moms didn’t have an abortion and they can’t afford to feed their kids? Are any of these people foster parents or adoptive parents?
She's obnoxious and self-righteous.
I think education needs for some American.
"Let's be charitable to the anti abortionists. You have to realize it takes at least 5 generations of inbreeding to get to be this dense' , stupid and incapable of logical thought. Most anti abortionists have gone thru the 5th grade but because they are the product of brothers having sex with their mothers,sisters and other female relatives. They also cannot stand up to the world so they usually like to b molest children. As in anti abortionist men who want sex with their own daughters and expose themselves to children. Let's pray for them"
"The idea that women just change their minds and decide to abort so close to giving birth to a fully developed healthy baby is simply an anti-choice myth used to anger people. 2nd-3rd trimester abortions only happen when something is terribly wrong. I have a friend who was unable to find a doctor to terminate her pregnancy after the 20 week mark. She gave birth to a baby that didn't have the top of its skull. She started to show signs of mental illness after the anatomy scan and it became progressively worse with time. By the time she gave birth to the baby and watched it pass away in her arms with its brain showing, she was never the same person again. She became distant from her other children then turned to drugs. Long story short, she is in recovery now and clean. Still traumatized though."
I have os o describe her display of self righteousness.  Like getting hit in the gut.
Boomers🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sad. These people dont help. They just feel better about themselves judging others. Once the child is born they do nothing but say get a job take care of your child when they have no idea how the baby came to be...despicable people...its only their right to choose not to wear a mask...deplorables...
Good for you lady
These men are doing great work! I’m thankful they are standing up for life. Just a matter of time until Abortion is banned nation wide! The Pro-Life Generation will NOT be silent!
Nobody is helping me with my children.
I just hope the protesters are for childcare and other programs that are set in place to help mothers and children.
Not all hero's wear capes but she deserves one!
“We’re so pro life we’ll kill you”
The same anti-abortion protesters who wouldn’t hesitate to unalive an actual child in an exorcism and blame the devil for it.
"""Absolutely not, nobody asked you."" 🤣 She is so respectful and calm."
"To all those self sanctimonious twats who think they have a right to someone else’s decisions on their body… the frelling foetus is a parasite! It’s not a human being! If you really want to do something wonderful, go an be a mom or dad to a child that was forced to be born into poverty! Stop eating meat, and killing insects when they bother you! Get your own frelling house in order first. And then, just maybe then… if you think you are holier than thou, may you possibly be in a position to dictate to a woman on her rights to her choice. I want to remind you that this insane comment about women using abortion like contraception is NOT the norm… women have abortions because they were RAPED, or they are not financially in a position to look after a child. You might even say ”she should have kept her legs crossed then”…. Well how about the men keeping their dicks in their pants??? There are also situations where the FOETUS dies in the womb. Do you really expect the mother to carry this to term and give birth naturally??? Seriously? So again… to all those stupid ignorant people standing outside these clinics spouting crap about pro-life… YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ANY OF THOSE WOMEN!!!! So stop judging!!!"
"I'm pro-choice but I don't care for Shelly's actions here, as they do increase the likelihood of altercations. This is selfish of her, making her political points when she's supposed to be there for the patients, who don't need to see or hear about confrontations at the clinic."
"Just ask them how many kidneys they have.

Either you have sovereign ownership of your organs or you don't. Their opinion must be that you don't and they can save a person's life by donating a kidney. The operation is very low risk and actually comparable with the risk from pregnancy.

Maybe they think women's uterus is uniquely not owned by its owner?"
These people belong on Fox opinions network.
"American “evangelicals” seem to be bent on proving that they are the complete antithesis of what Christ commands us to be. No one in my church or family behaves like they do, and we love the Lord and try to share His love, mercy, and grace with others. Also, not our job to judge. We are all sinners (in my faith that is our belief…that everyone is equal). On the other hand, they (AEs) completely foil the work the rest of us out here in the world are trying to do, and they chase people away from the message of Christ. It is so infuriating. If they want to do something positive, stop voting for a party that refuses to support vulnerable citizens, and especially single mothers, with a robust social safety net…healthcare, food, shelter, education, child care, fully-paid generous parental leave, mental health care… . But they refuse to support the babies that they think they’re saving. It’s not saved if it lives in poverty and has no healthcare. Such narrow minded selfishness."
"Jeeeeze, theses people are weird..nuts.. ..they should be off the streets.."
"Am I the only one who sees the irony of ’pro-lifers’ killing and injuring people? If they were really pro-life they would adopt unwanted kids, and give money to families in poverty… but no… killing doctors and nurses and harassing women is all they can think of doing. Sad, pathetic, digusting humans!!!"
"Here's a reality check: 
#1 NONE OF US ASKED TO BE HERE!! To assume you did, thats not tethered to reality.
#2 It's A LOT of moms who will take to their graves how if they had a chance to do it again, a lot of y'all wouldn't be here. It's mother's praying for the strength to deal with the circumstances as they have unfolded outside of her initial intentions.
#3 Ppl aren't gonna stop their sexual activity or fulfilling their desires. Trust if a woman don't wanna have a baby.... She AINT gonna have it, laws or not... Period 🤷🏾‍♀️"
"Completely respect their point of view… 

That being said….those same protestors are welcome to spend their resources on raising all those  unwanted “beautiful gifts”"
Bunch of old men with NOTHING productive to do trying to control young women. That's rich. And the self-righteous pro-lifers murdering abortion doctors? That's even richer. I guess these people are not really religious after all.  They are just self-righteous sinners.
How can women be okay with forcing a 10-year-old to have a baby cuz that's what's happening right now because of the stupid anti-rovy weight stuff we're forcing little babies to have babies like it sounds like some type of weirdo pedophile b******* to me
Shelley is great! I’ve been following her for a long time. Her work is important. I worked at a clinic when I was 18/19. The things I saw changed me forever. We have to keep this legal and safe for anyone who needs this medical care. Please! And the lengths protesters will go to is gross. They have no souls.
I just love men who think they have a right to speak on a subject that has nothing to do with them smfh MEN PLEASE STFU
Its gods will that they abort those cells
How can you support them? Go fund me or anything?
YOU GO GIRL! Fighting the good fight! #mybodymychoice
😂😂😂😂😂😂
There is goes their motivation. They want to be save by their god when they die. Due to their own sin(s) . The only for them yo get rid of their guilt is by judging others.
I want to know how many unwanted children these protestors have supported.
"I wish there was an in-between. I hate the idea of abortion but ultimately it is a woman's choice, and I don't think anyone has a right to choose for her."
"So the anti-abortion folks are there to fight for life, even though they possibly could be placing bombs in places where it explodes and take lives. Curious, just curious."
Ask Dan what he thinks about kids getting shot in schools and people being shot anywhere and everywhere
"If you don't care after, you never cared before🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨"
"Let’s be honest, by the looks of her she will never need an abortion"
"🤦
People are dumb."
But they’re ok with everybody and their mom buying an AR15.
"This is a form of eugenics. For the first time in the entire history of the human race, even of all life, Women can now choose with whom and when to have their baby. Women did not have to be forced to accept their fate. It was up to them whether or not to start, continue, or cancel the process of childbearing. So they can stop that process, rather than have to endure an undesired pregnancy. This was a decision that never existed until recently in our evolutionarily timeline. Now, we are one again set back by primitive thinking, forced unnecessary to accept one's fate, rather than having control of their own lives.
Religious lunatics thump their Bibles and cannot come to terms with how technology has changed our world."
Anti abortion zombies are the worst of the worst. When they turn up in hell they’ll be totally surprised that their shallow selfishness wasn’t taken as holy.
"People need to stop. Abortion is wrong if it's not a cause of rape. To abort a child just cus you wanted to have sex is just wrong and if it inconvenience you then so be it. There are a lot of f up mom's...for real. Some people would love to adopt a baby or two, but you have itches that wanna abort innocent lives. I don't feel sorry for any adults murdered , a life for lives. Yeah...sorry I don't care. If it's not because of rape or health issues, then no. I don't care cus there's birth control etc., These are grown responsible women upset cus they can't abort a baby and go back to whoring or whatever...no that's just wrong."
Why don’t they spend their time screaming at men not to impregnate people?
Register to vote to stop the GOP from making this country worse and shape it in their Handmaiden’s Tail like draconian society where white old men dictate how we should live.
"""Is that enough? Have u had enough  of feeling righteous today?"" _I ❤LOVE❤ her!_ She somehow says it w/o sounding confrontational or condescending. It was n a lovey, jokey way like when u tease ur fam!🤗✌♥️🌎"
"I am absolutely astonished that millions of women aren’t protesting constantly. The courts have made all women second class citizens, whether you agree with abortion or not, as a man , I would never be silent if the government took control of my rights! . It’s a national problem when fewer numbers of women, blacks, latinos turn out to vote than middle aged white men! Before this comment makes you angry, check out voting statistics nationwide!"
This clinic saved one of my friend's lives after her assault. Thank you so much to this woman and every single volunteer who protects those who are seeking healthcare.
"If a man beats a woman to the point where she loses her unborn baby , that man is charged with murder. If a woman kills her unborn baby by having an abortion it’s not called murder."
"How hypocritical, not to mention insane, is it to call yourself Pro-Life and then murder people?  And they keep invoking God but God says that ONLY HE can judge us so they are actually the sinners themselves!  Another woman’s difficult choice is none of their damn business!"
"Somebody should go up to them and say fine you can help give me half a million dollars to pay for the ruin of my life. Raise the baby for me. Pay off my student loans. If you're not going to actually help, stop lying and gtfo"
Exploiting the vulnerable
In the 80s I picketted a clinic with fetal info from the American Medical Association to give to clients-escorts lied and said the pamphlets were false!!! Lying murderers!
Speaking of life . . . these protestors need to GET one . . . WAY too much time on their hands!!!!
"She’s a national treasure.
We need more of her."
These people protesting are judging others which is something their God tells them not to do. They should keep their noses out of other people's personal issues. Thank you Shelly for doing what you're doing. #MyBodyNotYours
"These so called. Pro choice , are the same ones who oppose to death penalty . Hypocrites POS. Want to kill a innocent baby but want to save a scumbag from death… what you expect from CNN liars"
Sanctimonious bunch.  SMH.
Trash
Selling babies to wealthy families has always been a pro life agency cash cow. SAW THIS FIRST HAND
"None of these anti-abortion protestors appear to be very bright; have you noticed that?
This seems to be the only way they can feel powerful about themselves.
By making young girls miserable."
"3:58 they call themselves ""pro-life"""
"As a man I'd like to ask all 3,5 billion of us to just shut up and let women decide about their bodies."
"Would they pay for a child or even take the child(adopt)??? I mean how can people and politicans be sooo behind...I'm really sorry for you..and hope that there would be a other option that opens...but i think first they need to see what that does..and that, will be cruel."
It's the longest walk from the car to the clinic because it's the walk of shame.😔🙏
They're the creepiest group of geriatrics I've ever seen in my life.. I'd be soo ashamed to count myself as one of these anti-abortion ay-holes.
Abortion of turtles are punishable by jail time or a fine up to 100k. Let that sink in.
"""After fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being...[this] is no longer a matter of taste or opinion, it is not a metaphysical contention, it is plain experimental evidence...."" - Dr Jerome LeJeune, Professor of Genetics at the University of Descartes, Paris, discoverer of the chromosome pattern of Down's Syndrome, and Nobel Prize Winner"
A bunch of religious nut case who has too much time on their hand ✋
I don't have a problem with people wanting to protest abortion. It the way some of them do it. Protest the practice not the patients. The Protesting in front of a medical facility should be illegal. Don't force yourself on people who want nothing to do with you.
"These same people were willing to kill grandma in 2020 so they could eat at Applebee's.  
They don't care about living people."
So much love from these protectors of life.
"Protesters impede citizens and they don't work?
Parasites!"
"Those anti-abortion crazies are just going to get more violent in states where abortions are still legal now that Roe was overturned by the lying Christo fascists on the Supreme Court. It’s terrible what women who need this procedure will go through, and like the Dr. said, many will die."
"They're just upset, there's not enough kids in the world to religiously abuse."
Dan I hope you've earned points to really meet your maker
Those religous fanaticss should move to Afghanistan....
Old men TAKE AWAY VIAGRA…
"Religious people are the ball and chain of progress and civil society. They are dangerous, vicious, and violent."
"Go to college,  read the Bible , get some sense... They refused. Now America is gonna continue to pay for the prolificacy of ignorance and laziness, for allowing a career conman become president, for voting for a party that continues to mislead and brainwash folks who continue to vote out of fear and hate rather than open their eyes and ears to the carnage of gun violence and physical and mental health importance of Abortion. 

Until the PEOPLE of America wake up and understand that the pretense of morality that's become the ideologies of the GOP and their faithfuls recognize that they been in decades long running con by elected officials who care more about power and money over their voters safety, the country is on it path of internal implosion. Republican senators, reps and supreme court justices have money and  access to security and abortion if they so need it. The rest of y'all can continue to perish ok the altar of their fraudulent ambitions"
Religion is a factor of the ignorance being celebrated as a virtue in the US
They need security at clinics
Thank you for this important coverage of women helping women
I used to work for  abortion clinic and the word abortion is the complete wrong word. From what I have seen the correct word should be dismembering or killing.
"""Pro-lifer"" killing people, that's just rich man. This stuff is so Hypocritical you couldn't make it up if you tried .."
"I truly want to go there just to distract the people protesting... lol 
Like pretend like I'm debating on the abortion so the real people they are victimizing can get in with out being harassed."
"For the abortion doctor that performs third trimester abortions, I swear if I get my medical license I will take on any position of yours necessary"
"Ryan State is currently passing laws to sue any medical worker, lawmaker, judge or executive official who put bans on any point in the abortion process"
"OK, prolifers are injuring people with guns. So I guess they just don’t give a shit about life or death after The fetus is delivered"
"First of all God‘s not real, Second don’t be an aimless douche and deny people quality healthcare, third it’s not a child it’s a zygote that’s not even a human yet, forth it is not wrong for women to make decisions about their body’s"
I really really really really really would LOVE for a woman to go for an abortion and to tell them aaaaalll the reasons why they are getting an abortion and calling them out for their bullshit
Maybe we should be able to make certain spots free drive-bys to get rid of the trash just a joke
"Are they gonna pay the medical bills? Will they care for and feed that child? Educate them? 
If not, stfu"
Like the women having an abortion haven't already had a hard time coming to that decision.
"60 million babies unborn have been killed since 1973.  Now it's your turn, the consequences of this sin are the shootings that are held weekly against civilians in schools, colleges, shops, discos, etc.  Let's count how many are killed."
I want to ask these pro-lifers if they actually think about the child after it's born because if the answer is no then you don't have a fucking right to sit there and say well we care about these children.
Send this video to all the right wingers you know.
That guy is right about people breaking the law and having abortions. Then people will not follow a law that says guns are ilegal.
"20% of my generation was aborted. If America were a family with 4 kids, mommy and daddy government would have to explain to the other 4 why they said their brother or sister couldn’t live."
If you can't speak for yourself. Democrats will kill you.
"When the guy named “Dan” stated he thinks the children are being violated and being murdered. By definition they’re not a child. They’re not born. They’re unborn. 

Do you think anyone of these women are doing abortions like they go to Starbucks? WTF. Be better!!"
She’s a hero for those women. Keep it up!!
My gf and i make 120k collectively i would love to have a kid but we cant afford the life a kid deserves in Seattle. Why should a forced birth be a thing if it would make 3 lives worse?
"Makes me wonder how many things haven’t been accomplished, how many  children are without a friend who could have been the perfect one for them! ALL LIVES MATTER!! And yes, I’m ALL FOR GUN CONTROL because human life, from
beginning to end…MATTERS!!!"
"""We'll help you. We'll help you right now.""  I don't believe it.  I wonder what they would actually do if someone actually said ""Yes, please help me.""  I bet not a lot other than useless words."
"11 anti-abortion murders in the US. 
50 million abortions since 1973 in the US. 

I like how people talk about anti-abortion violence like it happens often."
Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
Keep religion to yourself. 🙄🙄🙄
"It's not pro life, it's pro birth then it's all about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps when you don't have any bootstraps, forced birth is basically forced poverty."
"They're not pro-life, they're anti-woman. They couldn't care less about the baby once it's born."
"Want to see insane, unreasoning fanaticism?  Just look at any one of these delusional, anti-choice zealots."
I wonder how many of these well-meaning people are willing to take care of these children they’re forcing people they don’t know or care about to carry to term.
Alot of men are gonna hate child support
"ANY one that kills to stop abortion is exactly what they preach against! They only care about these fetuses until they are born then they could care less what happens to them! Get shot at school, starve, get abused, get sick, get rapped, get into drugs or alcohol,  etc. They don't care as long as they get born to suffer!"
I wish they could put their passion for life towards the living already here. They don’t give a damn about those babies once they’re born. And they look down upon the mothers. These people need to mind their own business or really help children that are already born.
"anyone who thinks abortion is a right should be eligible for euthanasia at the whim of anyone else, it's the same thing. You can end a baby on a whim, we can end you on a whim."
The good Lord is gonna call you a jagoff
"Germany has a liberal abortion law but also one of the lowest rates in Europe? Why? When it is legal you can get accurate statistics on age, economics etc, then you take action. Free contraception, free childcare, increase welfare, housing. These are proven to reduce abortion. Bans drive them underground so hypocrites can ignore women taking pills and traveling and pretend it's not happening. They never take the actions proven to reduce abortion do they?"
Get ready for hell Shelly. Because it's coming to you
These decisions of having a child has nothing to do with these people.
Too bad these people don't do some real good by volunteering at a shelter. I wonder how many of them have adopted kids or fostered them. I'd guess none.
All these people she is talking to are Tent Christians bottom feeders they suck the life out of communities for money and power!!! Patriots for a better America 🇺🇸
Thank you!
This woman is a hero to every pregnant woman who is a victim of DV or attempted murder. What people fail to realize is that the number one cause of death of pregnant women is murder.
"I like how she talks to them like they're poorly behaved dogs. ""Hey, hey, no. No. Noohhhh. OK? Stop."""
and they're like all men lol
SELF RIGHTEOUSNESS- that’s all that is. Shame on those people. Shame on those people for shaming women. Shame shame shame
The protesters have a right to freedom of speech and the clinic escort has a right to their freedom of speech
"Best feel guilty for interfering in the Lives of Unbelievers. Bible says not to do it. So, doing it is going against Gods word. Only people you need to be tellen not to have an abortion are the people in your church. And as for the unborn.    Ecclesiastes 4:2-3 So I congratulated the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still living. But better off than both of them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun."
"Wonder how Dan treat people of color? Are you an all around good person. God doesn’t look at one good action. If your granddaughter was raped by a beast, you’d want her to carry it, deliver it? Would you look at that child lovingly?"
2:12 He has NOT been in this movement 'since 73' lmao. Bc 'Pro-life' was NOT a 'movement' in 73. Lying clown 🤡
"Really is a shame when people fight so hard to kill babies smh.
Instead of telling people that are pro life to find ways to help children in foster care, how about learning to abstain from sex if you don't want a baby? That would also prevent more unwanted kids from going into foster care."
"I use to be ""Pro-Choice"" UNTIL I watched a 5-minute video on YouTube.  It's of an Abortion Doctor testifying in-front of Congress describing (in horrific detail) the entire abortion ""process.""  He's performed thousands of them.  That video completely changed my way of thinking!  I'm now ""Pro-Life"" and so is he!!"
The anti-choice protestors are the scum of the earth and you can't change my mind.
Pooor   people
both sides are lunatics. look at yourselves in a video.
For them to actually think that yelling at these poor women will change ANYTHING is extremely misguided.
I would so lose my shit when somebody like this would approach me .
"Instead of wasting your time protesting, adopt an orphan and make a difference."
"Anti-Choice thinkers are hell bent on controlling others as an escape from their own lives. The false rush of ""heroism"" they feel ""defending"" a cluster of cells is much easier and much, much, much less risk and sacrifice than *actually* helping actual children."
Communist media!
"It’s sad these self righteous anti women’s body choice will heckle and preach to preserving life while not help those thousands of children in foster care. Yes, all
life needs to be protected and cared for not just heckle people into their political ideology."
They are paid to be there. Sick.
"It's really dangerous, proceeds to show video from 1993"
"It's simple. If you believe abortion is wrong, don't get an abortion.
If you believe women should be forced to birth babies, then you should be more than willing to pay MORE in taxes, so the money you pay goes into social well-fare programs that help raise unwanted babies. Prayer doesn't pay the bills or feed children."
Self-righteousness is something else....
If there's any pro-lifers out there just know that part of being pro-life means caring for the fetus and the pregnant woman. Even if their decision is against your morality you're supposed to be respectful to every human being. Pro-life for all humans not just the unborn.
These doctors who perform late term abortions will be judged! We will all be judged!
Why don't they spend their time helping those who choose to keep the baby? Because a born baby is not worth their care anymore? Damm Hypocrites!
"Escort work. That is something I can do. It didn't occur to me. I'm large, scary looking and trained in multiple martial arts. I've learned how to project my voice to terrifying volumes. I can easily out yell a loudspeaker. I am going tomorrow after work and find somewhere to help."
Democrats live killing babies.
Shining the light of the truth on the cockroaches on the right. That patriotic woman made my day.
"Reproductive freedom begins in the bedroom.  It's YOUR  choice! Nobody's taking away your rights to have a baby  only your choice to kill your baby because mainly of convenience.  Be responsible and be accountable! Abortion is not Healthcare  unless life of mother and baby is at risk, in which case it's done in a hospital setting by your obstetrician, not a clinic Abortion doctor."
"""I think that abortion is terribly wrong; I have a responsibility to be here.""
No Matter What You Believe, No Matter How Strongly You Believe It; Under NO Circumstances is it your Right much less your Responsibility to try and dissuade someone from a life changing decision that is likely Already Hard Enough.
Get a life and stop interfering in everyone else's."
I had just say how crazy it is that you have to look for a bomb that may be planted by someone that is PRO-LIFE!!!! Want to kill u to what ?? Save lives?? How ludicrous
"100% the only reason these creeps do this is because they think they will be rewarded in ‘heaven’, they’re literally doing it for themselves."
Now fix the welfare system. Give those single moms with 4 baby daddies a pay hike. For they can raise their children well.
"I love how these people “speak on the behalf of God” 

Also, the “strongly religious” ones, if we could find out if the baby was going to be GAY, or TRANSGENDER. Would they be against abortion?

That’s what I thought"
"I'm cracking up at all the comments of people thinking you need a God to know it's morally wrong to kill a baby. How about we thank the 96% of thoses of you had those abortions for no reason other than convenience and thank them. the reality is that the 4% that actually did require that procedure like those that had miscarriage or a topic pregnancy or those that were victims of rape and incest like that little 10 year old girl from Ohio this week,had the 96% not misused it all  these people would be able to still have access to it in their states with probably hardly any pushback considering it's a lifesaving procedure. But I guess you're not ready to have that conversation right? we're just going to keep blaming all the anti-abortionists and all the religious nuts right? It most assuredly has nothing to do with the fact that 96% of women who had the procedure since Roe v Wade used it as a form of birth control and not needed it medically, just it was inconvenient time to have a baby. The level of narcissism it's seriously laughable and I'm literally laughing as I say all this because we're acting like that's not the case here we're acting like it's the other side's fault and not the pro-abortion side. You don't think all those videos of your advocates screaming they will gladly scrape their babies out and all those videos a father's crying outside of abortion clinics because they got caught cheating so the mother decided to end the pregnancy rather than try to work it out because revenge is always better that way I guess?. Or maybe it was the fact that 74% of abortion providers in America are men and they have been giving testimony before Congress for years now about the trauma they experience as a abortion provider. The fact that they see these little babies faces the fact that they go into great detail about how they are ripping babies inside the womb from limb to limb. But it's totally totally the anti-abortionist fault that this all happened they MADE the pro-abortions do all these things. And let's not forget that you can't have abortion and racism separately because the whole reason abortion exists was based off of racism and eugenics something that you can't cherry pick around. So be mindful when you're saying pro-abortion you're saying I'm pro racist I'm pro eugenics I am pro a master race because that was the whole reason abortion came into existence in the first place here in America on a mainstream scale it had nothing to do with providing women with birth control or alternatives it was to control the populace and remove the undesirables and for those of you that are saying well I'll go and get my tubes tied well guess what they also did that to 350,000 Americans that they deemed undesirable same industry but with the US government backing them. The fact that most of those that are pro abortionists have some sort of mental health issue makes them the prime candidate so you willingly doing it to yourself means that they don't have to go behind your back and do it you're still fitting into their agenda and a quick Google search would tell you everything I'm saying planned Parenthood admits to all this you all just don't read the first couple pages of their website. Stay woke"
Hey Dan your wasting your time there is NO god(s).
All these old men thinking they are helping people lmfao 🤣
Jesus (if they believe in Him or the Bible) would NEVER act like these a-holes. So bizarre. I will never understand.
“we will help you?”…. What does this protester do to help?
Keep it up Shelly. You’re inspiring❤️.
I'd really like to see pro-abortion people start   protesting at churches.
"Why would there ever,in the history of human beings,an acceptable reason for a third trimester abortion? 
With that said I believe in the right of a woman’s right to choose. But this isn’t a direct to consumer product. There should be limits. Same thing with guns.

The second were written when we were a fledgling country with no military and the weapons were musket loaders. Guessing no mass shootings back then."
It’s drives me crazy that People don’t realize that only 48% of the US considers themselves self religious
"Wait is CNN saying there’s something wrong with being against the killing of  b@bi€s? These leftists need to give it up. Life won! Murderers lost! Imagine living in a world where you have all these medical ways of preventing pregnancy but you lean back, chill , knowing you can just erase your mistake by taking a life. Well those days are over! Go do something and prevent pregnancy in the first place since you’re so against being able to give birth like a normal human being"
"Ask these protestors what Jesus said about abortion.  Anti gay protestors, what did Jesus say about homosexuality.  Of course they will deflect, but they can't give an honest answer."
"I wonder how many of those protesters would be willing to support that woman and her baby. Give her a home to live in, babysit while she works, buy food and gas. Every time I ask those people about the born children their answer is that it's not their problem. I've never hated these so called Christians so much in my life! All they are doing is turning people away from Christ and I hope one day they'll see his wrath. I hate to hate this much!"
How many millions and millions of mothers chose to kill their unborn children since 1977? A hell of a lot more than eleven. Tell both sides of the story.
Radical Christians are going to destroy this country... Not radical Muslims.. That's even more terrifying.
11 people got killed by pro life protesters?! 🤔.
They would be useful if they were at an orphanage helping but I guess that's not their problem.
Glad she’s getting our message out 🙏🏻 keep it up. Shame people are ok killing babies.
"How can you be pro-life, say that an unborn life has more rights than someone who is already alive? How can you call yourself a pro-life when you have no sympathy or care for existing life, and you are willing to kill that existing life to exert your selfish beliefs?"
I had an abortion while i was 15. I tried to kill myself first but then ended up in the emergency room. I was raped by uncle for 4 years. It is not anyone else's say apart from the mother. Period.
I think these people who work at the clinics should be able to shoot protesters if they get violent
"Can't believe that the US is regressing back into the middle ages. In a few decades, Saudi Arabia will become more progressive than the US."
These so-called pro lifers are pro birth. Not one of them will take one of these babies after they are born. The hypocrisy of pro lifers angers me no end. Why aren’t they advocating for things that will help the women AFTER the babies are born. They are supposed to be pro life but yet send death threats to people. I despise the lot of them. They are hateful hypocrites.
"Dan and the rest of these creeps need to shut it. 
I hope she get some people to whoop their ass."
"you can have your opinion, great now leave others to have theirs."
Thank you for what you're doing
The only person that has any say on wheather or not a woman terminates a pregnancy is the father( and if it is rape/incest his opinion doesn’t matter). The decision to carry and deliver a baby belongs to the woman
You’ll notice that the protesters are men!
"Killing people for the right to life - that makes sense, right?"
nobody's talking about anita bryant?
"Just like the mothers feel an abortion is the right decision, they feel being there protesting is the right decision.. I have a solution to this problem..

 I am a man so I really don't have a say so in this I don't personally believe that abortion is ever the right answer, but putting a kid through a rough life or even worse isn't the answer either.. 

If you're not ready to have a kid you should not be having unprotected sex no matter how good it feels you need to fight that.. Because as good as that feels, having to go get an abortion probably feels the exact opposite. 

 If you want to write to kill a baby without the father's consent then the father should be able to opt out of not wanting to financially take care of the baby and you, if you were to have the kid.. women trap men with babies and then take half but put maybe ⅛ of that to the kid..  The rest goes to her because she ""deserves this""."
Protest these protesters
"Here after Libs firebomb and vandalize a 3rd pregnancy help center in the  last week🤷🏽‍♂️ just saying it’s not about “safety of the mother” or “rape and  incest” when less than 2% of all abortions counted in the US(63M since  73’”
It’s about you affording that latte in the morning lefty, ain’t it?"
Call out Taliban terrorists and fascists for what they are! Complete criminal scum.
"No one knows when the soul inters a fetus,  the Bible never mentions abortion 
  I am for freedom of choice as long as it's early or life threatening or rape and insist. 
No one knows your story until they walk a mile in your shoes. 
  The Supreme Court is wrong on this one and we must fight for justice for all."
"How ironic that the lady at the beginning said their focus is the women and the children and their right to CHOOSE life. She doesn't even realize the crap that's coming out of her mouth. The whole point of abortions as an option is so that women have the right to choose what they know is the best choice for them personally. Without it, there is no choice. What a moron."
"Wtf she sounds proud, it’s my job, “it’s what I got to do”, I’m like this where we are as Americans I understand the society place for this but fast stop pop and go is probably sending the wrong message that reverberates long passed that sad lonely walk, please think about that? Or not and someone else will then what we should argue maybe more education maybe parks that unstable people can kill them self before turning on other’s or even better we mind are own business keep eyes on phone and never help talk or care for anyone but are selves, just saying slippery slopes creating dopes is so American God bless everyone I mean it I believe and I believe you do to."
It’s difficult to keep in mind that this is the 21st century.
"Numbers 5 11 to 5 31, god describes how to perform an abortion.. these religious fanatics don't know their own binle"
"More emotional manipulation. The anger and hate is on the pro abortion side. No matter how hard they try to condition your mind to soften and accept the horrific process of murdering a baby. This reminds me of the soft lies that lead the Jews to the gas chambers. The sick twisted mind it takes to believe you are doing the victim a favor, is unimaginable."
Those “protesters” shouldn’t be there! I don’t even know why they care so much but don’t/won’t go adopt or foster kids! Leave other womens vagina alone!🙏🏾♥️💕
It’s ironic to hear Dan say those babies are being violated. Individuals shouldn’t be violated by others. Do you think girls and women are violated when they are raped? Do you think little girls are violated when they have to endure the trauma of undergoing pregnancy or postpartum? Do you think women are violated when their government criminalizes their conversations between their doctors. I’m pretty sure all these things take away life as they knew it. Children are not citizens until they are born. Born children cannot make medical decisions about their bodies until the age of 18. Are we going to see Dan outside his elected officials office trying to fight the violations of these living beings? 2 guesses…
Goddess Bless this Woman.  She is a HERO.
I love Shelley. What an incredible women. Thank you
Typical one-sided CNN report. Eleven people killed in abortion clinics since 1977. How many millions of babies killed since 1977?
So the guy who said when he meets his maker he hopes god forgives him. Because he holds a lot of guilt for not being there more…..BULLSHIT. It’s because he did something in the past he’s trying to make up for period…
I think the 10 year old that was raped and had to cross state lines to get an abortion was violated three times..... first by the rapist second by the Supreme Court and third by the state....
The abortion doctor is an example of what to think regarding women's right to choose. Women will suffer the consequences due to the bans and all for what? Some cells.
Deathcorts
"She’s not the hero we deserve, but the one we NEED! Go Shelley!"
I love it when they say the right to choose life cause that leaves it open to the right to not choose life!
"Shes not even the good kind of escort...... is the irony lost on anyone that the ""escorts"" are dressed in gay pride colors and one has a gay pride umbrella.... its a womans right to choose is my personal opinion. That being said its extremely disturbing that we live in a society where people are more concerned with the rights to kill an unborn baby than the rights of the unborn baby."
"We defend life,God sides with those that protect children not those that out of selfishness demand the right to kill their children. You've got to be severely mentally ill to want to kill innocent children and think that's okay."
"I wish I was close by to help block these protesters, I'd just walk in front of them with a big ole white board"
"I don't see anything wrong with the protesting, but I don't think it's very effective, better to hand out pamphlets with information and engage in dialogue."
"The shear irony of pointing out the 11 people killed in anti abortion attacks, deeming them as extremists, then following up with an abortion doctor who kills babies in the 3rd trimester… when they’re viable…. This world is upside down."
Learn science you will find your maker
God kills more babies in one day than all abortion clinics have in 10 years
"Only 11 deaths sense 1977? That doesn't make things sound dangerous to me, they have more of a risk of death while driving there. I hate when people threaten others with different opinions though."
They all seem well intentioned just horribly misled
You're doing a great thing helping those women
"🆘️Your are in  trouble wih your soul Shelly.

🌍🕊⛪🙏🔥⌛"
The protestors are fighting for 'the children' but there are children who need abortions after being raped and they don't care.
"Pro life, pro death, all annoying af, took me a minute to figure it out"
"Bad logic. Saying people will do abortions themselves if we dont legalize it (for doc supervision) is like saying people will do drugs and wife-beating themselves if we don't legalize it (with doc supervision). So the logic implies we should have heroin facilities, abortion facilities, and beat-your-wife facilities."
"My heart is breaking for America right now.  How women are stripped away from their rights and forced to endure an unwanted pregnancy is cruel.  Pro-lifers don't value life.  They just value giving birth, no matter what"
Why is it always weird nasty looking old men that hang outside abortion clinics. It’s true. I’ve been there. This is truly beyond my comprehension. There’s something wrong with them.
Jesus told everyone not to judge or condemn others. To treat others as they would want to be treated. To love their neighbors. These people protesting are judgmental people who want their will obeyed. I bet they feel proud too. I know where that pride is coming from... They are not getting into Christian heaven.
I think the lady mad cus she can’t get a man.
Thoughts 'n prayers.  Votes on the side of guns guns guns for everyone.  Protests for the right to not wear mask during a global pandemic.  Protests to take away the rights of women to make a decision that only affects THEIR bodies.  It's severe and dangerous mental illness.
"They are killing, to save lives… what a bunch of crazy people."
Those protestors are from God.He will keep them safe❤️
"Welcome to the Unitedstan of Murka, when’re the Cristban are controlling their women, but at the same time are bombarding other country’s because they are controlling their women amd put them only in burka’s… Bravo you freacking bunch of hypocrites that are protecting preachers that are raping 10 years old little girls that need to get an abortion paid by the church to protect the reputation of those freaking pedophiles preachers. BRA… VO. This is why your country is now the laughingstock of the world."
"Oh no, 3rd trimester abortion?....that is so fucked up..."
"Catholics should believe prayer works, but that's not all we do. We have pregnancy centers to help those who do not wish to be pregnant. There are adoption centers. There are other options than killing the child, which cannot be blamed for being conceived. Blame the rapist, blame the drunk, blame the irrational actions of humanity. But do not blame the child.
Further, the people who attack pro-life and pregnancy centers and commit arson against them should be held accountable. Not because their views are different, but because they destroy public/government property. All they are doing is taking options away from people who might need them. I do not agree with abortion, and I can try to persuade pregnant people not to go through with it, but I cannot force them not to, nor is it right to bomb or destroy abortion clinics just because I do not believe it is right."
the crazies and nutjobs.
"Abortion is a terrible thing that nobody likes. Just like cancer! Just like heart disease! Why would you stop providing top of the line medial attention for it? Why would you ridicule someone for having to deal with it? Why don't you stand outside of an oncology clinic and harass cancer patients for being in their situation weather it's their fault or not? Because that's stupid. I will say it again for those with short attention spans like me, these woman and doctors/medical staff are not ""pro abortion""  just like oncologists are not ""pro cancer"" and firefighters are not ""pro fire"", NOBODY LIKES ABORTIONS."
I would just hose them down.  Give them a blast of water on a cold day!
Nothing is more entertaining than seeing upset leftscum!
"""Assault by mutual consent?"" It's not a boxing match. She was assaulted, had it on film and they were like yeah...but no.  The heck is that"
Who would ever know that a rapist would have more rights than a 10-year-old rape victim?
"The thing is they are Not ""going to help you.""  Despite what that protestor said."
"Stupid people, you going to financially support the woman and her child after birth ? Of course not !!"
Sick people!! The ladies made hard decision to abortion leave them  alone.
"Yet these people want to ban guns ""to save kids"" 🤦‍♂️"
They don’t care about the life; if they did they would do more to support children after they are born
How do I become an escort?
how can someone be “pro-life” and go and murder random doctors and patients ???😀
These holier than though American Taliban specimens from the shallow end of the gene pool are CREEPY.  This zygote obsession is just bizarre.
"Nothing as hateful or judging than christian "" love"" nasty bullies of the worst sort. They only focus on this one topic instead of the THOUSAND of others things that can help people."
Abortion IS healthcare!!!! That woman is a fucking hero. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I don’t think she has to worry about getting pregnant
"Is it too late for my friend to get an abortion? How late is considered a later term abortion? Is 37 too old for one? I mean, the kid is actually 37 and doesn’t know how to change the damn oil in his car, or mow his own lawn!!"
Those people need to get jobs. How do they have all this time to stand around and try to force their views down some poor women's throat. This is insanity.
Interesting that the only bombs have been left BY PRO-abortion folks. But no point in letting facts get in the way of good old propaganda.
Of course most of them are men.  They have no say.
"Can we drop off all the unwanted babies at the houses of the protestors? 

No? Because they're not financially or emotionally secure enough to handle America take care of a child? And it's not a good idea to force children onto prepared people?"
Why would you think the clinic for the procedure is the place where these women haven't yet made their decisions... clearly they have decided and you just don't redirect their decision and are harassing them to change their mind.  That's not what I would call a choice.  If you really care move your picket signs to politicians and ask for better funding for women and children- particularly people fleeing abuse. 60% of women that abort will have another baby later. Most people getting abortions are teens. Afterwards they go on to get educations and start families with people that aren't abusing them. Many people who sorry consider their fetus and the life they would have lived and decided that's not a good enough life for them. They know their decision best. 75% of reported abortions happen to lower class women. So if you REALLY care about women being able to have babies you would work to make sure the babies we have can afford to live.  There is a formula shortage. Babies are dying from a formula shortage. Common. We visit can barely feed the babies we have.
Tell them to write A check for 21 years of care.
"OMG these people!🙄 the woman in the blue jacket, Go Home and mind your own business.....The Escort lady is fabulous!"
"What you see are old men, former rapists and pedophiles, pissed because women didn't have to carry their unwanted zygote as a life long burden."
"The people fighting so hard need to be exposed! 90% are Addicts that get paid. Also if you ask a lot of people against it 9x out of 10 they had 1 or more abortions when they wanted it. But is against anyone to make that Choice! 
Alway remember the one screaming the loudest is the one with the most to hide!"
Protect her at all costs
Why always the anti abortion people are the ones you don't want to f#ck in the first place
"I would love to have this job! Every morning i could low key make fun of anti abortion jerks, while helping a women in a rough time? You dont often get to choose both renegade and paragon points. Neat!"
This guy is disgusting. He literally rips babies limb from limb. That is so truly horrific.
"Thank God people fight for the child. No one is killing them and protesting abortion. Their thought is to protect life, obviously they care enough to try and help the people."
Too bad they dont spend time with the foster children who are neglected instead of shaming women.
Who needs the Taliban when you have the Christian Right in America
Living in the USA is like living in Afghanistan
"If Jesus was here, he would volunteer to work as a clinic escort."
"Why aren't they protesting rape or deaths in foster care or working in a children's home or teaching the next generation or mental health issues... you know, something to actually help."
#SHERO!!
"Good for her! 
Vote OUT all anti-abortion politicians!"
"This is so fvcking weird, clinic protesters, really?? They're crazy"
Hypocrisy!”I think these unborn children are being violated having their lives taken away”? And they turn around and rape them? Why don’t these righteous “pro-lifers care about the already born children being massacred in mass shootings. I don’t see these pro-lifers picketing outside Washington demanding strict gun laws. “ protect the unborn” but once they are out of the womb they become a fair game.
The religious people who are anti-choice  forget how many pregnancies ended when their diety's flood supposedly wiped out millions. They don't read their garbage book close enough. Nothing fails like religion 🤦‍♀️🤣
I don't feel sorry for anyone performing 3rd term abortions. F them!
Hmmm didn't she say CHOOSE?
"It's so sickening that those so called pro-lifers killed doctors.

They're not pro-life, they're pro-birth.

Once the child is born they don't care."
The right to convince someone to not abort the unborn is as fundamental as a woman's right to deside. Codify Roe v Wade please so I can compel a woman she is beautiful and doesn't need money to have children. Boo on gal don't like it. WhoRa servants of life keep up good work.
What does your fake sky daddy say about this matter. Go read that good book? No god cares for the babies?
"So....now it is right for a person to choose babies live or die??? Think about it. Whether it is a risk to you or you're raped or whatever your reasons are, never justifies you deliberately killing an unborn child. And woman think its only their decision to make. Wow!!! We all have a responsibility to protect babies...or???"
"""Their right to choose...life"" asshats"
"Be mean. These people need to be told ""fuck you, get out of here scumbags"""
The pro life movement is a religious movement.
"News in the future: Research has shown that the ""God pill"" works. The Pill that was invented a year after Abortion was banned in America in 2022, and has now largely reduced worldwide religions, making the world a peaceful planet again. The religious fanatics who were responsible for so much suffering around the world will be given an option from now on; keep your beliefs in your home or face mandatory chemical treatment. The last generation of self-righteous god believers are expected to be died out within two years.."
Protesting loud and proud as long as they don't have to tell their names. It's a pathetic clown show.
All these Republicans arguing about the value about life...ok let's ban firearms that have been responsible for so many school and public shootings.  I can bet the caring of life stops there for most of these hypocrites.
Hahaha 🤣  Only 474K views 🤣 💩
Scary times were living in...
It's always people without the ability to give birth that want control over it. Those old men need a hobby.
"Yo, this woman will never have to even THINK about getting an abortion....nuff said."
What a wonderful example of strength and love this young woman Shelly. These people are so fixated on their self-righteous rhetoric that they can't think logically. I hope when we revisit role v Wade in the near future under another case the stop the protesting. Women on a federal level will have the right to choose again.
Lol what 3rd trimester abortion that is farked
"Those anti-abortionists may be well-meaning, but totally naive and deluded."
"Instead of these pro lifers trying to guilt or assault or cause bodily harm to someone making their choice to do something that isn't their business, they could be more productive adopting a child in the system that doesn't have parents. That amount of attention could shape a kid and be more pro life than this."
"Hey women!

CLOSE YOUR LEGS!!"
It made me laugh the opening was all men. I cant imagine these people change the mind of many people. Probably less than .00004%
They should show what the pro choice do to the pregnancy centers!
"If  ""Dan"" has such a problem he and his nosy friends should got to an adoption center."
Somehow these nutjobs forget the woman's right to HER life. What a waste of a life to stand and ruin someone else's.
"Don't these old, white men have something constructive to do? Maybe help in a soup kitchen?"
"More than 60 million legal abortions have occurred in the United States since 1973. 

Are you telling me the United States had 60 Millions medical problems and rape?

There is a different issue."
"Zachary King a ,'Satanic High Wizard' said without fail there is at least one Satanist in every abortion clinic!!!!!
I wonder if she is that one????"
The brainless goop has control over a woman's body
"To those Anti-abortion, please take all the homeless kids, abusive by parents of kids back to your home to raise them before to shoot your mouth on somebody else body business. Those idiots are not understanding raise a kid need 2 things ready before you want to have them. 1, mentally to be ready as parents, be responsibility. 2, financially has to be ready. Stable income for long run."
"To those Anti-abortion idiots, please take all the homeless kids, abusive by parents of kids back to your home to raise them before to shoot your mouth on somebody else body business. Those idiots are not understanding raise a kid need 2 things ready before you want to have them. 1, mentally to be ready as parents, be responsibility. 2, financially has to be ready. Stable income for long run."
"Shelley, G*d bless you for your courage, and for your commitment to women's rights to reproductive freedom and autonomy.

I was at an execution's-eve vigil outside San Quentin when I saw someone wearing an Operation Rescue.sweatshirt. I went up to them and thanked them for being there and for witnessing that pro-life means pro-life. Shooting at, injuring or even killing someone is not an act of love and compassion, but of rank hypocrisy at its vilest. You cannot be pro-life and support the death penalty. You cannot be pro-life and not be a pacifist. Or else you prove my thesis that the ""Christian Right"" are not Christian — not are they right."
"""their right to choose life"", isn't the use of the word choose ironic."
I love this young ladies drive and tenacity to stand up to those who want to impose their religion on a free society.
I wonder.. how many kids have these pro-lifers adopted?!
Funny how people have to worry about bombs from pro-lifers.
"Kinda wish these anti abortion groups would just mind their own business. Women going to these clinics probably have a reason to be there. What if it's a young 12 year old girl that was raped by a relative. Is she not allowed to have an abortion? Or a woman that has to have one due to medical health problems? These pro life groups dont know the story of that woman, and they need to leave them alone."
"Good for her!  An abortion clinic bouncer, awesome idea!"
This is sad
Crazy religious lunatics
"I wonder how many of the protesters actually help any of the children once they're born, since they're so concerned about an unborn child?  Do they help any homeless children or any hungry children, or any children who are being targeted by pedophiles and sex traffickers?  Do they do anything to help prevent all these tragic mass shootings that take the lives of innocent children, like the ones in Uvalde who were really just babies?  Just wondering, since they're so concerned about an unborn child's life."
Don't like abortion? Then don't have one!
Love this woman!!!
This gal is awesome!
The anti abortion protesters should be sent to do missionary work on North Sentinel Island.   Good luck.
It's female right to do whatever they need to do
"Amazing support.  Why are those men even there? It is NOT an easy decision for women to make, and they (only them) live with that decision.  Whether we agree or not with that decision, I bless those who allow woman this procedure SAFELY."
"Everyone is here to help until they have to actually do something. I don't hear any of them offering to adopt, or to pay for the kid? How many kids have they fostered, what if its sick? What if its from rape or incest - should they still think about their baby??? What about the little girls who end up pregnant from their own family members, should they keep it too? Yeah, these guys are just assholes, they're not helping anyone, and if there was a heaven, they wouldn't be going there, the only thing they do with their lives is judge and hate, kind of the anti-Jesus... >_>"
"“Not today Larry” 🤣😂🤣😂  I hope this sweet lady walking these women carries. I don’t agree with abortion, that’s my personal stance/choice. I would never be unkind to someone doing that lonely walk."
Abortion is murder
"Anyone who gives birth to an unwanted baby should give it to these people.
They might as well start taking care of these babies"
"So I'm wondering about those men out there who intentionally go around impregnating as many women as they possibly can? Are we going to start enforcing mandatory vasectomy's? I'm not trying to be funny or sound ridiculous. We thought not too long ago that it would be absolutely ridiculous to have any of our rights as women as human beings taken away from us. It seems that everything is our reality as women. Well what about men? How would they feel having there reproductive rights taken from and dictated to them.
But No, that would never happen.  That's TOTALLY different, isn't it?"
"I love the fact these protesters are men as if they can relate, they will never understand what these women are going through or what it's like to be pregnant. There's a lot more single mother's out there then single father's and that's a fact. They don't know what it's like and act like they don't play a part in getting women pregnant. Instead of protesting why don't they go help feed poor children or children that have been abandon in foster care. The foster care system is over loaded with children and these idiots want to stop abortions so more kids could suffer. Smart!"
"Im pro choice but third trimester abortions?, that's months 7-9. I hope these are the rare cases where the mother was at risk of death as that's pretty late in the game to terminate."
Men should not have any input in this issue. It does not concern them.
"""And their right to choose life,"" sounds more than a little backwards, lady... 
It's, ""the right to choose,"" period, now banned by cult politics so you should say, ""the legal obligation to choose life."""
"Help you do what??? Feed them,  cloth them, pay for daycare, educate them!!!! It’s a hell no! They just want you to destroy your life and abandon you and the kids!"
why are there no young protestors? hmm..
Why not have these protesters contribute to raising these unborn children? I believe that it would be beneficial if they could cater to all the needs(till the kids finish college).
"""At least 11 people were killed in anti-abortion..."" if you can kill people, people can have abortions. Because in your eyes, murdering ""living things"" are fine"
"What rights have those MEN have to say ANYTHING about a woman's choice? Women can say something about other women but definitely NO men...
Saw a reporter asking protesters about adoptions as their opinion.. 4 people holding banners.. not ONE are a adopting parent...
These people should mind their own business."
"Overturning Roe vs. Wade is not about giving states a choice, but about a small minority of people imposing their religion and their beliefs on the rest of us."
"Now that's the exact opposite. Six pro-life centers have been bombed. And 34 others pro-life centers have been vandalized. by left wing cults. 
Democrats!!! At least try to be parents.  let your kids know about safe sex. If your kids uses condoms. The only will they not get pregnant. But they won't catch a sexually transmitted disease. And it's easy as that. Be a real parent teach your kids the right things. Don't teach them to spread their legs. have sex with anybody without protection. We won't need these abortion centers if this happens. Quit being horrible parents teach your kids about sex!!"
These people just do not understand. Everybody is on team Life here. You are often asking a Mother of 2 to die with her fetus that will not make it to birth and will only Kill the mother of 2 leaving two children without a mother now all because you think you're saving a life but in reality you're killing 2 when it doesn't have to be. You need to get those images out of your head that women are just having fully developed living children killed off because they want to.
"When you meet your maker he will ask you ""who gave you the job of condemning women"" and ""why can't  you clean your own house before trying to clean anyone else's""!"
"This is just so sad.  The men out there have no idea what it is to be broke in a America and being ""guilted"" into having a child you cannot afford or maintain.  To judge someone for having an abortion is outside of the Christian faith.  This is not about ""saving lives"" it is about exerting control over a woman's body.  We cannot and should not stand for it.  Our country is going backwards and it is so disheartening.   You want to save a life, but are willing to kill to do so?  Makes absolutely no sense."
"I love this woman

I’m also very proud of the men in this country who have gotten vasectomies."
Lol so she thinks she is God around that baby killing building 🤦‍♀️
"I’m sick of these “pro life” people who clearly don’t care about life at all, if they did they would see the importance of abortion and the tie between abortion and saving lives. Not to mention the psychos who Claim to care about life who are killing doctors."
You're a monster you escort women into kill their children 👹👺
"""We will help you"" Suuuure you will. Liars all."
"All anti-abortion protestors should be willing financially to help all ‘mothers and babies in need’ programs (WIC, etc) if their so concerned about babies and life. But nope, 99% are pro-lifers who deny abortion, gun reform laws, mask mandates for covid, vaccinations. Up til birth will they care about the mother and baby. Then they kick em’ to the curb. Damn conservative hypocrites!"
She’s a rockstar
Your god won't let you into heaven by dictating what someone else does with their body
They are kind of like the US military. They go to foreign lands to teach that killing people is wrong by killing them.
"why do these republican anti Christs want women to die ..I dont understand , im so confused.."
I can hear Karen screeching from here.
"ABORTIONS ARE RACIST !!!
“We don't want the
word to go out that we
want to exterminate the
Negro population.""
- Margaret Sanger Founder of Planned Parenthood."
"This woman and all the other workers and doctors are all so brave and such bosses.  That 80 year old doctor, who's still working - I think out of a sense of duty is unbelievable in his dedication to the healthcare of women and their right to choose.  Also those demonstrators saying ""we'll help you"" - it's like, how?  Give me an abortion because I was raped?  Give me an abortion because your loving god allowed my father to rape me?  Give me an abortion to save my life?  Give me a couple million dollars for all it will cost to care for my extremely deformed / ill child?  What the heckin' heck?!  The US is now about a half step away from the Handmaids Tale."
"Not all hero’s wear capes, and not all angels have visible wings. This woman is a treasure 🤍"
"I'm really wondering 🤔...What's the percentage of ppl against abortion, that have ACTUALLY adopted at least 1 child.....and from this country?

ALSO...the stock price for the Plan B is going to soar!! If it hasn't already. Facts."
"""Nobody asked you"" should be the motto everyone follows. 

Before you say something, ask yourself, did anyone ask me? If not shut the fuck up."
"Imagine people willing to hurt or kill someone else and claiming to care about unborn lives!!
 Just sick!!! 😕😕"
Yes because this prayers are gonna pay for baby furniture and formula right ?
So a clump of cells with no brain formed get a choice but the woman it's sucking the life out of as it drains the life from her so it can survive while acting as parasite to her doesn't matter that she has a choice ?
Every family has an ancestor who squatted behind the woodpile with a sharpened stick.or a knitting needle and they are liars and fools to deny it. My great aunt did - a rape victim at 16 in 1949. Can you imagine throwing yourself down stairs? Drinking horrible things? A k  knitting needle. ? A butcher?
These clowns dont want abortion there are 400 000 kids wharehoused but the ones with the big mouths will not adopt any of these poor kids just all talk i am pro abortion and i have adopted 2 kids
"Men have rights, women have the right to abortion. Because slavery has been abolished in this country, we can not call this land the land of the free if we still own people's bodies. Women need to move to states where abortions are legal."
All Americans have the right of freedom of speech - pro or con.
No love like aggressive threatening Christian love. I believe in magic and want your rights taken away as a result.  That’s what this crap boils down to.
♥️🙏WE MUST ORGANIZE AND ATTACK THE RICH🙏♥️.  GET UP NOW PEOPLE!    THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE US FIGHT EACH OTHER !   ..WHEN WE HAVE TO FIGHT THE RICH
"Why is it mostly old, White men protesting? Also, it’s disturbing that they keep calling out, ‘mom.’"
"Abortion murders defenseless unborn babies.
There is nothing wrong with that right?
🤔"
This is ok but doing it to a Supreme Court judge doing their bidding isn’t? Horse rap!🤬
"There isn't a single anti-abortion ""birth center "" that offers a Denmark Box, much less factual information about $12,000 personal tax deduction per child, child care credit , head of household credit, & child support, eligibility for medicare, supports that these ""pro-life"" people vote against in every way while they slut-shame single parenthood."
Hang in there Shelley. And these stupid idiots must not know that it’s not only full grown women that want abortion to be allowed. It’s little girls that actually get raped or molested by older men that actually did the service. So keep doing what ur doing bc u know we need it.
What an evil woman! Everlasting hellfire with the satanic majesty shall be her only reward!
I wonder if the same people that protest outside of abortion clinics are also protesting after mass shootings...  I mean if it's about life then....
ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS!
"“We’ll help you” 🙄…😂 my rear end! Those crazy obstructers are most certainly not going to be helping anybody financially, they have no understanding of the dangers of what they are doing. And…😳 why is this old fogy Dan dude standing alone outside this clinic? How creepy gross is that? I’m thinking this old fart wants to coerce young girls to keep their babies under his care while he abuses them. Sick pervert 😝"
"They will help until that baby is born, then you are on your own…"
These people are disgusting. In the UK we have some legal exclusion zones around abortion clinics to prevent these people from attacking these women as they enter. They should all be arrested for harassment.
"WHY are some of the terrorist ""protesters"" allowed to hide their names? They are standing on public property, harassing and terrorizing women who are exercising their legal rights. WE deserve to know who they are - so that WE, the majority of American citizens, can go ""protest"" at their homes and businesses."
"Yelling out Mom is the most toxic, misogynistic garbage I can imagine."
The thing is all of these people are completely ignorant to the real ethics of abortion! Its pathetic and completely uncalled for! Read a effing book 📖 will ya's!
"Dan, instead of standing out there holding down the sidewalk for decades, why not do something useful like volunteer at an orphanage.  That is where these fetuses end up that you supposedly care about."
Don’t these protesters have jobs?
"I wonder how many women have said ""i will keep the baby if you protesters cover my medical costs?"" And how many protesters said yes? I these protesters wont give money or adopt the baby they aren't helping they are just doing it for their own religious purposes!"
"I wonder if the third trimester abortions are for medical reasons only,... I'm not anti abortion, but I used to work in a maternity hospital for a very long time, specifically on a NNU, and we treat babies from 24 weeks onwards, and attend deliveries from 22 weeks onwards just in case there may have been mistakes with the dates and the babies are older than thought,... I would find it hard being part of the medical team attending an abortion at that gestation unless it was on medical grounds, because I'm so used to resuscitating them and treating them at that age,... 
We don't do abortions in the UK over 24 weeks, unless it's on medical grounds,... I would however treat any mother with caring, gentleness, and understanding,... they are going through enough trauma in their decision, and don't need a load of moral crusaders shouting and screaming at them during such a difficult time,..."
I would permanently eliminate those evil protesters
"LMAO.  That one woman...""their right to choose life.""  YES, they get to CHOOSE....and it may be to continue the pregnancy, it may not."
It's kind of thought provoking that each of these protesters are a carbon copy.
"As a man, I don't get these men who only want to earn ""brownie points"" with God. As the one guy said, ""when I  meet my maker, I don't want to have any guilt"". He says this about a situation he has no business being involved with in the first place."
People with emotional problems trying to relieve their guilt and shame by projecting it onto others. Slinging their Christian mythology like a weapon against vulnerable women. It's preposterous.
All these protesters have way too much time on their hands...get a job and contribute to society...jeeze🤦‍♂️
She is making herself a target...she doesn't need to engage with the ppl who are out there. She surely doesn't need to be posting it on social media exposing herself to the dangers of the world. It's no surprise she was assaulted. Her job is to escort the women. Nothing else.
"July 4th means freedom for all.  This country is less ""Free"" than the rest of the industrialized world."
They should make a law where anti-abortionists are forced to give a $1 to orphanages. See how fast they change their tone when they have to take care of born kids.
"Women are 2nd class citizens in this country.  When a man talks about abortion it is in my opinion very boring.  Men have no idea as men will not get pregnant nor have an abortion.  July 4th apparently means freedom.  But freedom from what exactly.?  Tyranny.  Well tyranny is right here in the image of Greg Abbott & DeSantis, Clarence Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh.  All men.  Men talk about women's choices or lack of them."
"If you're not the doctor and you're not the pregnant woman, it's none of your goddamn business."
"Instead of protesting in front of the clinic, adopt an orphan child and raise him/her. You'll make his/her life better."
I can’t wait for those people to find out they get to go to hell and it’s the escorts who are doing what Jesus would do.
Follow these protestors home.  Stand on the street and scream at their houses about how their religion is such horseshit and watch them lose their minds.  Good times!
Ask all these protestors what they think of state's rights. Thent ell them these women are using the rights afforded to them by the state. Let them explain themselves
Those protesters should be allow to be there only if they give 90% of their income to orphans.
"I bet if the abortion escorts were 6ft 4in, wearing body armour and carried AR15s these morons wouldn't get in their face so much."
These people clearly think that aborting is killing . It’s not killing or murder . It’s a foetus . Most abortions happen in first trimester
The anti abortion protesters look like  cult members
I can see pro-choicers haven't dealt with their L very well.
Don’t these people have jobs? They stand outside abusing people for a living!!! Congratulations to Shelley.
Good for her.
"More bs in the name of a man made religion.

Tax religion to fund these clinics."
I like how men are against abortion 🤬🤬🤬🤬 gtfoh
Looking at the faces of anti-abortion is an argument for abortion. These people should have been aborted.
Really scary and creepy those screaming “protestors”!!
Sooooo happy to be european
A country where whackos are in the ascendant. Overall decline is obvious to all in the rest of the world.
The depressing irony of anti-abortion activists (who call themselves “pro-life”) sending death threats.
So doxxing people is the CNN way? Show videos of an abortion
🤮🤮🤮
"Anti abortion, pro guns 🙄🤬"
"To the old man in red, when you meet your maker, you will be judged. Let everyone else be judged when they meet their maker. Too many individuals trying to live their lives of others. Live your own life, mind your own business and stay out of the business of others."
These people only care about the unborn. Once they're born they're some one else's problem.
"A gift, really? Of course, you'd know that every girl wants the gift of a forced birth after being raped? You ""pro-life"" people  need a mental evaluation. ."
"I live about a half mile from this clinic and everytime I see these protestors my blood boils, they need to mind their own damn business and leave these women alone."
When you meet your maker the good lord will probably send you straight to hell for judging and sticking your nose in where it isn’t needed. Shame on them for being so cruel.
"This woman is amazing, and has an unfathomable amount of patience. These people are so creepy and make me so uncomfortable."
I don't give two shits if you put me on TikTok. So I don't know what that's supposed to do 🙄😆
Only in America land of crazies
So this is where the Proud baby killers are. If your pro choice. Go get sterilized. Then yall wont have an issue with someone trying to save a child from being flushed down a toilet. You are all evil people.
"""pro life"" people are ""pro birth"".  they don't care about the life of the mothers, or the life of the babies after they're born. they don't care about the lives of the millions of people living on this earth. they have one agenda, and that's to control women.  They do this to prove how VERY christian they are.  Look. we get it.  you're christian.  but... BUTT out off my bedroom, my doctor's appointments, my UTERUS! Women deserve to have control over their futures!"
We can’t see her placing them on TikTok in this vid.
Just wait till they see the Lord's face on judgement day.....
"Those creepy, horrible, completely wrong people hassling those poor women. Good on you Shelley, you are a hero."
"Killing babies is not cool, murderers, may she burn in hell"
What if her mom still wants to abort her?
"Remember that the littlest victims need an advocate. They have no voice. A mommy who doesn't love 💗 them to even bring them into this world. There's no 👶 babyshower for them waiting. There's a lonely 🙁 painful 💔 😢 😔 death in that clinic.
That guided walk 🚶‍♀️ is the walk to extinguish the RIGHT TO LIFE guarantee by the U.S. Constitution.
The advocates of life of precious babies 👶 💕 are there....in the hope of saving a few.
GOD BLESS THEM.
Q ❤️"
"I wonder how these Pro-life Christians can worship a God who ordered the stomachs of pregnant women to be ripped open, caused women to have miscarrying wombs, took joy in watching babies being dashed against the rocks, caused nursing mothers breasts to go dry: starving her infant to death, commanded that every man, woman, child and nursing infant in entire cities to be murdered, and killed Job's family just to win a bet."
"Notice it is mostly men against abortion. Men can,t have babies, and when one is coming by surprise, a lot of them get lost. Let the women decide how they want the rest of their life to look like."
defending killers yay scumbags
Maybe they should help foster kids with their time. That would be an act of love.
Why is always old white men protesting? It’s gross that they literally prey on young women! Yes prey.
These people protesting need to get a life and leave these patients alone.
You baby butchers are so insane‼️
He probably abandoned his kid. Someone look into that. He made a comment that seemed personal.
NOT TODAY LARRY
So theres abortion.  How about free health care and day care till 13 yrs old then.  How about free education to all levels then.  Fkn republicans.  SEPERATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.  THERES ONLY LIKE 13% OF U THAT ARE EVEN CATHOLIC.
Why are abortions performed in separate clinics? In my country abortions are performed at general hospitals.
"This sickness stem's all the way from the top,Reagan's trickle down theory at work, yes i'm talking about the way they are taking a crap on all of us , this shyt doesn't happen anywhere els, hell it diden't happen before Reagan, the 50's were an incredible time for the regular people, every one could obtain a bright future with a little hard work, Our government is broke, and i don't know if it can be repaired."
"Finally, the lowest of the lowest human beings can feel better than someone so ofcourse they won't shut up."
"Until they can prove that they have been helpful to  pregnant women by paying the bills, by adopting a baby or child, they really have no ground to moralize and judge others. Judge not lest ye be judged.  Wish the Supreme Court judges who overturned Roe v Wade had heeded that Biblical quote."
"Excuse me,  anyone with a penis, shut TF UP! There's no accountability for the sperm donor in this scenario, AT ALL. They can shoot their load  and walk away.;  Keep your religious BS  OUT of our vaginas, and our LIVES.  Thank you very much."
"It just kills these people to say pro life, because then they would have to admit they’re pro death. Ooh, what a brave move for this pro death women  to aim her phone and put someone on Tic Tic, because she disagrees with them. That’s true courage."
These people have nothing better to do than harass young women!
What’s her tiktok?
"I went to get an abortion in Dayton Ohio. I was 30 years old and in grad school. I didn't think I could even get pregnant.
Anyways,  people were really out there protesting. I didn't know this was a thing. I on my own decided to keep my baby after seeing him on the ultra sound (I was in my 2nd trimester- that was a surprise too). I instantly fell in love 😍. I don't know how to really explain it. I just fell in love. 
The screaming/ yelling and pleas from the protestors didn't make me want to keep him. 

My son is now 7 years old.  love him so much 😍.  I never got my $200 back but that's okay I knew it was  non refundable.

I truly understand both sides of the argument. 
It's a complex issue. I wish it was an easy right or wrong issue, but it's not because the woman does have to carry the baby in her body. Adoption isn't an easy option either. I would / could never ever do that!"
"""We'll help you!  We'll pray for you!""
Oh good. That'll do the woman a lot of good. Maybe spend less time on the sidewalk and more time backing up your promises"
Thank you❤🌹🙏
"Why are you weirdos pushing abortion on everybody? Stop it!!  Push prevention, there are multiple forms of birth control these days and a great Plan B at every drug store in every city. Pushing abortion is just a racket to get money for Planned Parenthood which is based in hatred for Black people and in killing as many black babies as possible.  Abortion should be safe rare and yes legal. But you guys had to push for abortion in the fourth month, the fifth month, the sixth month, the seventh month, the eighth month and the ninth month. And you want every American to pay for the abortions by funding Planned Parenthood and paying for any abortion requested.  That is F’ing ridiculous and unacceptable."
Do you fake religious freaks know what an ectopic pregnancy is? It's when the embryo develops in a fallopian tube instead of the uterus where it's supposed to be. After 8wks the embryo is now a fetus until birth. If the embryo grows it will explode in the fallopian tube causing the mother to bleed out and die. Get a grip not every abortion is their choice.
"I don't know how you define the word ""screaming"", but none of the people that you showed on here are ""screaming"" at them."
"Hold the phone:  he told the woman ""she's beautifully and wonderfully made"".  Oh no!  Not that!"
Another man imposing his belief onto a woman
Unemployed religious people harassing others.
"American Christians are brainwashed. Religion, all religions, just makes people DUMB."
"Oh yes and how are you going to help them? Give me a break, give people the privacy they deserve."
Dan needs to go to hell for his sins
Crack heads
"Metallica SONG_ ""...And Justice For All""

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking

Third trimester abortions that she calls rubber.  God is watching.
losers harassing people... nothing more. mind your own business.
"0:47 Their focus is on a woman's right to choose their view of ""life,"" not a woman's right to choose whatever her conscience decides, only to choose a pro-life stance. And they don't see the irony or duplicity of their statements?!?"
This woman and every woman's health clinic worker is a hero
"Third Trimester doctor... Scrambles the baby's brain and then gives birth to a killed infant. That's reality. Pro-choice, do you have any limits?"
Go Shelley!  My Motto....If you are against abortion...dont get one.  Keep up the good work!
She is amazing. Thank you for all you do!
Imagine getting up every day to slander people going to do what they think is right for them.
Do you plead for teenage orphans with no dad and a toxic mom on drugs? Do you plead for orphans constantly bullied at school for stuttering and having a lisp? Do you know what type of hell it can be to live like that? Do you plead when Ted Cruz cuts social funding and mental health funding for the very poor? Probably not you are probably to busy judging them.
Women have the right to choose!
Who are these old men who think it's their business to tell women what to do with their own bodies?
What about rape babies being adopted and molested by the rapist. Do you this God is disgusted? You people cherry pick the bible a lit. Do you protest against sexual harassment and sexual assault in the work place shelters ect. You probably are not bothered much if at all. The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Sexual immortality is the only sin against the body. God hates sexual sin more than abortion based on what I have read in the bible. Do you rail against female veterans getting raped at the VA. Do you.rsil against fully topless pictures of women bing in display at the welcome desk and make and female shared fake medical clinics. What do you think God says about lust fornication sexual explanation molestation oppression of the poor oppression of damsel????? Why do you just take on the one cause does doesn't require grave. A baby is easy to live but adult you can blame and judge and you still don't have to give them grave. When Jesus dies he dies because we are all guilty no one deserves heaven. You are supposed to pay grace forward. Why do you only plead for unborn babies and do you plead for any other part of their life their parents life?
What about female soldiers and veterans being sex trafficked
"Do they vote against food stamps, social assistance, female soldiers getting raped and retaliated against by chain of command, and female veterans getting for Ed to prostitute for housing education and medical benefits the EARNED with their service? Why is only the birth of a baby and that's it you are done?"
I hope Dan would suck his thumb and shut up. As if he should have any thought's on any individual woman's  personal choices about their health.
Help ? you ask him how many kids has he adopted how many kids have they fostered . How many social services programs he supports and contributes too because prolifers are the same Republicans who want cuts to welfare and social programs that help the youth they do full of crap it makes my blood boil
Okay so pay child support then $$$$$$ men
I just had an abortion today...I regret nothing..will do it again if I want to.
Abortion is murder ngl
"What is This?  Contraceptives for every occasion - No excuse for abortion at rate, Women are wholly irresponsible = killing babies in Mass is uncivilized, irreparable, an abomination.  Not in Mass, limited when and if necessary"
We need to start taxing churches in the USA 🇺🇸. They pay ZERO taxes but pay millions to get anti abortion legislators/judges elected.
The Catholic Churches ⛪️ could take care of all the orphans in the USA and still have enough money left to house all the homeless.
Men protesting abortions is like women protesting vasectomies.
Wow she is a HERO
"“That walk.. is the loneliest walk, if you are by yourself.”

That hit me hard."
"Shameful that this is still happening, I thought we stopped this years ago.  I would volunteer at a clinic. I'm not fertile anymore, but I remember being a young woman.  I have had all the children I wanted.  These women need the same support.   I don't think I could be quiet after dealing with these hate filled people every.single.day.   Okay, pro lifers, adopt them.  But you have to adopt ALL OF THEM.  Right?  All races, all disabilities, diseases and deformations.   If you agree to adopt every single one of them; we may have a possible negotiation.  We both know that isn't going to happen, so until we have a better idea, lay OFF!   Embryonic transplant (taking a fertilized egg and moving it to a new womb) is unfortunately still years away.  Perhaps we'll have the ability to adopt children BEFORE birth; but until we can, this is necessary."
I really wish God existed. Pretty sure he would tell his believers to stop being idiots and lend their efforts to people who actually need help.
but this is the same OLD WHITE MAN that votes against FEEDING/SCHOOLOING kids.
"Much praise for this brave woman and those who work along with her......Please, people understand that women who make this choice are doing it because they believe it is the right thing for them to do."
"All we want is the right to choose. You want to choose life? Great, you do that. But let others choose as they themselves deem fit."
Why can't people just mind their own business?
Abortion clinics think the focus should be on the women and the children?  Isn't that like Orkin saying their focus is on the customers and the termites?
Oh no not tik tok.
"Thank you for the work you’re doing, Shelley. Please stay safe. ❤️"
“She’s 10”
"I mean in Nebraska you were able to abort a baby at 22 weeks even if you don’t have a medical condition so, these people don’t know how far in you are and if ur aborting a 22 week pregnancy you probably should be heckled"
Imagine being so “prolife” you plant bombs that kill women and health care workers!
"This woman is a real hero!
And with a healthy sense of humor too.
Awful the kind of stuff she and others have to put up with, though."
Soooo abortion clinic attacks if that’s not the most hypocritical thing I’ve ever heard like 🤷🏻‍♂️ I thought whaa aren’t u here to save lives wth 🤦‍♂️
Bunch of f...ing hypocrites.  'Beautiful' gift of life is so 'beautiful' that these same phonies don't support programs after children are born.  Pro-life my A$$.  Pro-Birth only.
They call themselves pro-life when they won't put a mask on to save their own families.
"@2:29 I believe that. The ""here"" that he was referring to definitely wasn't the clinic though. Please don't try to make up for the regrets of your life by putting guilt onto anyone else. Do something meaningful with the remainder of your days Gramps... or just get drunk at home for the rest of your days.. it's better than bullying young women"
As a follower of the message of Yeshua (Jesus) I'm saddened by those that believe that message has become a club to beat others. The simple message is a tool for self examination and self empowerment. It is not a weapon for controlling others.
In most cases woman use abortion as a form of birth control.
"""Nope, nobody asked you"" 😄"
The crazies have nowhere left to go and the wealthy are loving the show
The same people that are using Christianity as an excuse in this video must forget Exodus 11:4-5. God literally killed babies. Just say you are an asshole.
I find it amazing how these protesters think they have any say over another person's life...
"How about “Stop the Sperm” movement! Or a mandate for condom use! Where are the men taking responsibility instead of protesting, violence and shirking their role. Women do not get pregnant on their own and many times not their choice!"
Focus on the Fetus cult members. Ridiculous hypocrites.
Choice 💜
GREAT JOB!!!!!
The reason fewer doctors are doing 3rd trimester abortions is because they know what they're doing is wrong
"yeah patients? euphamism for mother, choose life your mom did❤❤❤"
American the land of the free. Except people have lost the right to choose when to bring life into the world.  A baby is a great thing if you are able to support it. But if you can not sadly it can destroy your life and you will ultimately dispite your best intentions you can easily destroy the life of that  innocent child. Do t we already have enough seriously damaged and disturbed people in the world already
"What is disturbing or ironic about these protesters is that they ignore SO MUCH other horror going on to focus on this, but never realize that destroying our civil rights is a far greater horror and danger to our society than the reality of a few abortions. The 'forced birthers' won't adopt, vote for healthcare, support families at shelters, they do nothing for living children or families, it seems all they want is to punish women by forcing them to carry unwanted pregnancies."
The protesters are not the enemy
"Isnt it amazing that these ""right to life people""maime and kill people,threaten all kinds off the same"
It is the absolute height of hypocrisy that some of these protesters want to stay anonymous. Unbelievable.
🏥💉🦴👀
I'm sure these women are eternally grateful for everything you and your professionals are doing for them. You're sooooooooooo necessary!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
There are so many reasons people come to these clinics. I never thought I would feel intimidated crossing a line of protesters since I wasn't seeking an abortion. I was SO wrong. These protesters are an abomination.
"These anti abortionists are my heros, not getting into the rights and wrongs of abortion, they are sticking  up for what they think is right, very important in a democratic society. It's because people tolerated alternative viewpoints that society is what it is today. Yet when these same people, so grateful for free thinking in the past are now becoming the fascists themselves."
you people need to mind your own business!
So many commas missing on all those signs. One genius after the other...
They know that an embryo isn’t a baby. It’s about control. They don’t support funding to children in low income families. They celebrate the murder of minorities and immigrants at the hands of police. It’s about taking away personal liberties. The GOP only care about controlling people.
Every time a woman has sex she can get pregnant. Doesn’t mean she has to have that baby. It’s her decision and no one else’s. The Bible says life starts at the first breathe so it isn’t about religion it’s about control.
WOW these ladies are wonderful. How can ww support them?
"That clinic is decrepit and sad, just like what's going on inside! 😢🙏 The doctor is decrepit too!"
Leave people alone!!!!! Get a hobby!!!!! None of your business!!!!
Jesus would say mind your own f)cking business
"She’s doing the Lord’s work, which is why I fear for her life."
"This highlight the hypocrisy of the right assaults and murders justifiable as long as it is antiabortion activist doing it, a graffiti against the overturn of roe v wade, threat oh hate crime terrorism."
"Self righteous hypocrites pretending to care about children. 
Ask them what they have done to help single mothers or their children? …………..Crickets."
When the cops don't remove the anti abortion  predators/protestors they grow in stupidly & numbers
"Evil always mocks good. This is especially true when evil loses the battle.

Now that Roe v. Wade is dead, good had won a victory over evil, and evil women like this baby-killer are trying to protect their blood money.

I'm sure slave owners in the Antebellum South were no different."
She’s as funny as the plague
"Very good idea!

These sad people need to get their dose of attention! 

Let us all see how perverted they are!"
Anti-abortion? Really? But aborting the lives of doctors and nurses is not against their god's will...
Of course its the maga hat jesus freaks that are protesting..   they complained about having to wear a mask during covid but imagine being forced to having a baby..
"Wonderful!!! Anti abortion people are such hypocrites, refusing to vote for politicians who will help pregnant- new mothers with Healthcare, childcare, livable wages, better school funding, etc."
"I personally don't believe in abortion, maybe because I was never in a situation where I needed to choose, but that doesn't give me the right to choose for another person.  Every body have their own experience and need to make their own decisions.  Also, a lot of women that have abortions is because the father wants nothing to do with the babies and they can't support the child on their own. Is the law also going to make those fathers that don't want the babies to support the child when they are born?  or are the anti-abortion people going to take care of those babies when they are born? Do the anti-abortion care about a child that is not wanted and get abused, neglected? They only care about the now but what happens in the future after the child is born."
"But it's okay to form a mob outside the homes of Supreme Court justices and threaten their families, right? I don't see these anti-abortion protesters doing anything violent. If not for double standards, the left would have no standards at all. 🤨"
"its a health clinic, not an abortion clinic. Many services besides abortion are provided. CNN, do better"
Clinics need valet parking at the door & escorts in to the clinic.
I fucking hate them.
that's right. people killed in anti abortion attacks. the irony isn't lost on me. what a bunch of a holes.
"I hope these old man and delusional woman one day understand what they are doing! I don’t think they individually have adopted 5 or 6 children. Leave those woman alone they are having it difficult enough, because abortion in not a hobby.
Those loudmouth screamers should make themselves available for helping families who are poor and don’t know anymore how to feed the ones they got.
That’s in the Bible you know HELP it doesn’t say stupidly shout!!!!"
These creepy people are selfishly doing this for themselves because they think they are getting brownie points from their god. They are in fact quite evil.
God is dead Dan.
"""A developed country"""
Women in america have more rights over their bodies when they're dead then when they're alive. That's so fucked up.
Slime using their religion as a weapon
How tf do these people pay their bills and still have time to protest like this? Lolllll
Oh my goodness.  These idiots make Jesus Christ himself look bad.
Ummm why are they mostly men?
"This is a sadly divisive issue. Nonetheless, I cannot support either side of the controversy. Both sides have a point, but they also are way too dismissive of each other."
What a bunch of saddos who have no job or life and just hang out at clinics all day.
Something is very wrong with the DOJ.  I am really scared.  Why is Trump not in jail?  Has AG Garland been compromised as Bragg was in NYC?  Are we losing our nation to religious extremist ideologue’s?
YES! Watched her TIKTOKs from the beginning and she is brilliant respectful until they get nasty and then she puts them in their place! Love it!
Protect Shelly at all costs
2:50 imma call her Karen since she had her name withheld.
Bunch of old white people pushing Christianity.
"love how men, aka humans who cannot bear children, want to force women into doing their bidding..."
"People equating abortion with death is hysterical. People using violence and threats to stop women from getting an abortion aren't even disowned by their religious people to their left and right. And all these people playing like their religion is the reason they are against it is laughable since it's not in the Bible and Jesus never talked about it. At the same time these people talking about how when they go to heaven... 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂... they acknowledge the soul and yet know nothing about it or when it enters a human body. They don't care that the US actually killed over half a million kids in Afghanistan, they don't care about the very real starving and homeless children all over the US. They don't care about the countless babies killed by hospitals due to accidents and errors, and do nothing to create safe spaces with contraception for the youth so they may explore their sexuality without worry of being pregnant and yet they think that continuing to harass and berate other people about their choice is the way to go. Those people disgust me and are the worst form of blind, ego driven, soul denying, godly created idiots, that we have to endure. And when they die they will have a really big revelation."
Love how these cowards refuse to give their names. Spread their shame!!!
I escorted A friend who got raped into a planned Parenthood. Got a rock to the spine. Cops watching the pro lifers did nothing. Next time I'm going violent in return.
The fact that the government knows about this and does nothing tells you all you need to know.
"If only self-control were taught thoroughly at the home...
Then again, PP would go the way of the dodo."
If you understand the science you will have to accept that life begins at conception. Killing babies is always wrong. Do you really know what happens to a baby in her mother's womb during an abortion. Try speaking to adults who are grateful that they were adopted and had the opportunity to live their lives. Remember baby's right to continue to live. This woman is another crazed attention seeker.
Yeah but its us Atheists that are always so angry?
I swear to god I will be her California corespondent!
You do know 71% of americans disagree with abortion right??? Gtfoh libs
Let the unborn child have a chance to live.
It makes me sick to look at someone who rips fully formed babies out of mother's bodies heroicize himself.
So much for pro-life...so instead they kill doctors and advocates?? How does that make sense?
"Anti-abortion is specifically not Pro-life.  These kinds of protesters prove that fact every single day.  Standing around unwanted and unwelcomed day after day with annoying signs and shouting their thoughtless, scripted, shaming platitudes. at people they never met and will never know experiencing circumstances they will never care enough to try to understand."
"People like Dan is why abortions are needed, his mother should've exercised her right back then."
"These religious nutjobs are out early to harass people into submitting to their beliefs, they don't even know what's the reasons for a woman to visit an abortion clinic, she could be aborting to save her life from an Ectopic Pregnancy but they don't care about that."
May they all rot in hell but one’s killing babies
Isn't life precious no matter what age?
Don’t feel sorry for the doctor and nurses been killed that killing thousands of babies every year
"Daaang, I need new glasses!!
That thumbnail; I thought it was a picture of her - and a man with an axe behind her!! :O"
I’m still reeling from the striking down of Roe v Wade. I still can’t believe it.
I'm not in favor of abortion but the part that people mostly look over is the fact that now religion is strongly influencing government and not just in laws but also in the Supreme Court they're supposed to be a separation of church and state once you change that you change the government because whose religion will be over all others religious beliefs and when will it soon be that all other religious beliefs that don't make it to the top will soon be banned because the top religion doesn't believe in what the other religions are saying anyway this is where the line is now becoming blurry it's been crossed
Yeeeeeees...broadcasting people protesting the murder of unborn babies on “tiktok” will really tell them “what’s what” 😆🤡❄️😆🤡❄️😆🤡❄️😆🤡❄️
"To the protester: How about going and saving all those pregnant ladies who have to live where the war rages? They would love to give a safe birth and raise their child, but they don't know if they are going to live tomorrow."
Abort the protesters.
These protesters with all this time on their hands need to volunteer at a food kitchen or homeless shelter.  I would say they should foster kids...but they aren't compassionate enough to raise children.
If only they would be this vocal for the living.
imagine supporting abortion
"I would be a lot more sympathetic to the pro-lifers if they were willing to ensure that every child has the basic needs to function in our ""society"" met for them so that they have a chance to meet their potentials. Unfortunately it seems that pro-lifers stop being pro-life as soon as the kid is born.


F.Y.I. society was in quotes because of an inside joke, and we are all in it!"
"Hypocrites, don’t care about he kids after they’re born."
these women rip these babies apart with their body parts twitching on the table and gasping for air at 8 weeks
"Freedom of religion, should include freedom from religion…"
"I'm sorry..but when you start your entire point of your conversation off with claiming to fight for ""reproductive rights"" when fighting for abortion that is factually the right to not reproduce or ""non-reproductive rights"", not only do you try to use psychological manipulation and psychological warfare to give color of law rights to something that you know has no merit in the very fact that you call it something opposite of what it is to claim the rights of the opposite of what it is but you steal the rights of those whose rights you are trying to invoke as your own when they aren't such as the women in China who were forced to have abortions when they wanted ""reproductive rights"" and to not have abortions. When you have to make yourself sound like a victim of something you aren't, like a woman who may be sterile from a forced procedure or a woman who may have been otherwise injured from a lack of consent, you not only make yourself look like you have no ethics, but you actually don't have any moral precedents when you're the cause of injury to others from your reckless actions. To which, many of those women had forced abortions past any point under Roe v. Wade, that would constitute murder under American law, and being reckless enough to cause reckless homicide is a not just a civil wrong but a criminal offense. So justifying you are in the right when proven criminally wrong in both directions..you would think you would learn something by now and get a clue. There's no accidental after that point. No unknowing. Just plain intentional murder."
The irony!  They assassinate people working at these clinics while calling themselves pro-life!
"Our focus is the women n children & Their Rght to Choose Life..... Excuse Me BUT.... It's Their Rght to CHOOSE Whatever is Best for THEM because NOBODY KNOWS the Health or History of That Particular Women!!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 
MIND Y'ALL DAMNNN BUSINESS!!!!!! 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯"
"2:16 So these unborn children.... *WHAT?* the fetus is being terminated but in schools children are having their *lives* taken away from them by the inept gun laws and your inane belief in _ma rights_ to own and carry guns *everywhere.* Hey Dan, go protest outside a gun store because they are responsible for children's lives being stolen from them......nah, you won't do that will you pious hypocrite.

The clinic escorts are doing a great service and should be recognised for their stupendous work. Shelly and Ladies you are *CHAMPIONS* every single one of you! 👍👍👍👍"
"I don't believe in abortion, But I Also Don't Think I Have The Right To Tell A Woman what To Do with Her Body, But Those Damn Republicans Do 😡😡😡"
I praise this woman 💯!
Do you IDIOTS know what actually happens when you kill an unborn baby?
They shouldn’t make it such an black and white issue.Too many humans are made every day.There is enough of you.It’s nuanced.Some people should have the right to end their pregnancy.
"So why are these people not outside GUN shops ,shouting ""please don't buy guns that will kill people ."
The giant picture Dan has of a fetus is not an accurate depiction of an embryo  before 10 weeks.
"I love this woman! The propaganda surrounding this issue is unbelievable! I am so terrified for the lives of women seeking care in the future AND the lives of these unwanted children. 
I bet all these protestors go home and eat murdered animals even though their lives were taken against their will and with zero regard to their sentience. 
Interesting that the same people that are forcing women to give life are also forcefully taking it with for nothing more than a sandwich that takes less than 10 minutes to eat."
So she's an escort? Prolly no one buys her.
Love this woman!
Don’t want a baby don’t have sex or move to a state that allows this irresponsibility
"Thank you and all those who do what you do. Please know that it is NOT a thankless job. 
We all support you and send you love and strength. ✌🏻👊🏻"
Notice how they’re all old people who have absolutely nothing better to do with their lives 🙄
I think it's time that these abortion clinics start hiring security. Keep sending financial support to your local clinic to make this happen!
"Hmmm, yet there are 700K children in foster care. Most likely to ""age out."" These pro fetus zealots need to STFU."
"No Dan, you've been harassing women!! You're a bad person."
I love Shelly. Thank you!
"God bless the escorts, nurses and Doctors willing to help women."
Bitch don’t pray for me
Saw this 6months ago. How did it come out 6 days ago?
"HOW can you be assaulted by mutual consent ? ? ? ?  Suggest equpping escorts with tazers.  May be fun to print up some contracts for the protesters to sign.  They agree to pay X$, per month into a fund for the support of ""Mommies"", like those ""Save The Children"" programs, where they send you photos and progress reports on third world kids.  Hand out the break down of  expenses,; rent, utilities, food, clothing, medical care lost wages, etc.  Times that total by 18 ! !   Let's see how many protesters agree to make that commitment."
We are sliding back so far into the dark ages thanks to these horrible judges and politicians that soon enough we won't even recognize this as America anymore
Can anyone explain why the majority of abortion protesters seem to be old white men? A little creepy?
Hero. She is a hero.
Can I get a gate and a tall thick fence?
Most of those men protesting look like they shouldn’t be left alone with children. They look creep AF
MEN need to stay away......until they give birth....it is NOT their business
YES!
Ah women murdering babies in the womb what a story.
And where are you when they need real help
Their right to choose life? That's an odd way off putting pro-life
"Yeah, I'd be telling them; ""Uh, if you were REALLY serious about HELPING, you'd be out in the world HELPING WOMEN WHO WERE PRESSURED INTO HAVING BABIES AND THEN GOT STUCK WITHOUT THE MEANS NECESSARY FOR BRINGING UP THOSE CHILDREN. You REALLY want to make a difference? We're going to hook you up to volunteer your time ACTUALLY helping those that need help HERE ON THE PHYSICAL PLANE.""   ...  
 ""Oh, You don't want to?? Really??? Hmmm ... Interesting."""
"Some of us don't believe in your god, you ignorant, Christo-fascist, lunatic, assholes."
"""we keep them in our prayers"". You cannot pray for someone well-being and harass them at the same time."
"CNN, reporting all the racism and man hating it can find. Oh, btw, cAnCeL KuLtUrE dOeSn'T ExIsT"
Violence attracts violence. Abortion is an act of violence…is it not?

"Ma'am As a Nebraskan, Thank you for your work! Everyone should have the right to choose."
"May all the happiness in the universe fall on these types of people. I'd be catching a charge everyday punching those self-righteous, bigoted pieces of garbage in their faces."
"""when I meet my maker..."" he's going to be in for a rude awakening."
"Bless you Shelly,🥰...I am proud choice. A woman's womb is between God, her doctor and family. I had an abortion in my early 20's. I had my son Zechariah Wolf Orion at 37. I worked very hard in film editing. His father died of ALS, Christmas Eve 2005. At hospice where Terry Shiavo was finally unplugged brain dead."
What's wrong with what they are saying? We don't have the right to reason with people??
Knock that scumbag off that stupid ladder for a start
"Anti abortion protestors need to keep a couple of things in mind.

Life is hard.
Life can be cruel.
What happens to most unwanted babies if they grow up unloved?
What do angry isolated antisocial people tend to do?
And what people are willing to do if the population outgrows their resources.

Just some doubts"
11 people killed by PRO LIFE demonstrators.
“I don’t want to just be a meme” You’re not Shelly. I promise. You’re a f* hero❤️
"Religion is, and always will be poison."
😍
She's a HERO!!
"Maybe Dan should read more of the bible to discover that his ""maker"" has no qualms with abortion whatsoever, and even allows for it to be carried out. Also said maker despises people like him who protest in such methods while talking about God (as Jesus reiterated regarding the log in one's own eye when people complain about the splinters in the eyes of others)."
Can you Imagine the health and beauti can make more Youthful skin makeup all over your Face ….🫵
"it's so easy to advocate for the un-born isn't it?   they don't wake you up in the night.   they don't cost you any money.  you don't have to feed and clothe them.  you can raise up your arms and proclaim your moral superiority.   and THE MINUTE the child is born,  it is no longer un-born and you can just discard it and the mother as sinners deserving of God's scorn because they don't share the same beliefs.   anti-abortion activists are the height of cowardly hypocrisy."
He carries a lot of guilt that he feels he has to heap on the women he verbally abuses....
"What a hero she is, and the dude who had a lot of guilt, and more time to yell at women seeking abortion after retiring, needs to forget about meeting his maker. He's going to hell."
What about the lives of the women who are denied the right to make their own choices?  What about their lives?  What about those who die because they were denied a necessary medical procedure?
"I wish we could redirect the passion these protesters have to foster care. If you truly want to protect children, that's the way to go. This is not protecting children, this is hurting desperate women. An ounce of self awareness would allow them to ask themselves ""why would I pursue an abortion?"" edited to add: Why isn't this protected by HIPAA?"
Are these people going to fund the children for a minimum of 18 years or adopt? If not then you have no business telling a woman what to do with her pregnancy
I'm glad there are people like Shelly and the number of volunteers at clinics keeps growing.  You have my support and respect 🙏🏾
"As a man, I'm going to see if it's possible to get a prescription for the plan B pill so I can pass them on for free."
"I get so pissed when clinics that provide women's services are called ""abortion clinics"".  I am sure that other services are provided."
People should not be allowed to protest out side of clinic.  And guys outside just pisses me off. Most women don't do this lightly.
"I love toothless 60-year-olds calling young women ""mom"""
"Imagine being so ""prolife"" you literally murder people🤣🤣"
Shelly Mann you are a godsend. ❤️
Pro life people committing murder. Religion is the worst virus on this planet
That’s just ironic on how pro lifers go to an abortion clinic and kill people
"Are these people going to help you take care of your child, no they will not!!!!! They need to keep their opinions to themselves, they don't know why that person is having an abortion it could be from rape or the woman has a health issue, either way people should keep their mouths shut."
Why don't you have patients get there really early in the morning?
"Ben Franklin designed some of Americas earliest coins called Continental Currency that was minted in the Massachusetts Colony. On them was the phrase ""NIND YOUR BUSINESS"". Ben Franklin was one of Americas true Patriots. He helped Washington form the militia and not once was this true Patriot ever armed"
"🇺🇸Is USA partially a Taliban nation?

Cheers from Switzerland 👍🏻"
There are so many cases of women that will die if they don’t get an abortion- or who wanted a baby and had a miscarriage and can’t expel on their own and need to go to an abortion clinic bc they can’t get it done at a hospital.
Why don't they build a drive up awning to keep the harassers out of sight? They should start a GoFundMe.
I don’t understand why these anti-abortion protestors aren’t in front of NRA headquarters
"most of the protesters are old,white men. very telling. they just want to control women, they don't care about babies."
"Ah, religion is so lovely..."
Pro life - smh. They are NOT pro life. They are pro theocratic fascist.
"Yes, I've seen her celebrated online before.  Wonderful woman!!"
If this is a womans issue why do almost 50% not have an issue with it???
"I remember when I escorted a friend to have an abortion and got a brick upside my head, and the cops tried to charge me for trespassing lol.
ACAB every time"
Here's a way those protestors that have all that time on their hands can help. Go adopt a child and raise them in a home instead of the states foster system.
Shame on Her!  The God of Abraham...Isaac and Jacob...Our Great Creator...awaits this womans death bed...as she WILL STAND BEFORE YESHUA for sentencing for her Crimes against Humanity and YAHWEH'S Littlest Ones....!  One can already hear The Wailing and Knashing of Teeth....of those Crying Out in Unison from The Hub of Hell...in Punishment for ALL ETERNITIES......!
"Interesting that the rainbow makes its appearance in umbrellas, jackets ect.."
"In my city there is always a line of people yell at the patients just like this. The really sick part of this is that no more than six walking distance blocks from this clinic is a place called Home of the Innocence. This place takes care of the children that people didn't want, couldn't afford and or horribly abused. It is a hold over spot until foster homes can be found for them. Unfortunately most of the kids have returned again and again. Many rarely find a foster parent because of behavior problems or handicap. It angers me that the protesters are wasting time doing something useless instead of at least being an advocate for these kids that are already breathing."
Way to go Joe! Abortion is wrong.  You baby killers deserve the death penalty
Choosing to end a life because they're to be a burden... why not just make responsible life choices so as to not have to make that choice ..
Absolutely creepy these old men
"Everyone should meet a Joel...bless his heart....Dr. recommend terminating 
..Catholic Christian church thought otherwise...
He as lived in a crib +33 years and counting...mumbles wears & diapers..he has never walked a step in his whole life.
And no support from the church or state or the repukes...Total Misery. Thanks Supreme Court. Now ya all get ready for your slavery....
At least the mother had a choice. She choose life. Thank you Jesus.
My wife had two miss carriages...then medical doctor recommended for her age not to try. 
Boom tubes tied. It wasn't meant to be. I can imagine now how big brother is now going to get in people's lives.  All because they never walked in other people's shoes. So send Joel some money. Help him...
But all you hear is the cricket chirp..."
People should fix themselves before they do stuff.  These people are lunatics.  Vanity is the real problem.
"Like they said these lunatics sometimes shoot up clinics to kill people. Yet they claim they are for life. Such hypocrisy. They stand there all day on their high moral horse yelling at people. Maybe if you want to actually save lives, you can help the homeless or if you love kids so much like you claim become a foster parent or adopt. But why do any of that when you can stand all day yelling at people going through an already difficult situation.  These insane weirdos are trying to take over this country just remember that when it comes time to vote. We can not be ruled by these religious creeps."
Mostly guys. Idiotic ones.
People need to get a life and stop bothering in other people's business.
This woman is awesome.  Much respect to her dealings with and exposing these religious weirdos. Please be safe.
These are the same people that complain about to have to pay taxes to take care of foster children feeding and clothing them but yet they don't tell men to go get a vasectomy
My SIL HAD to terminate her pregnancy because they found out the baby had no heartbeat. So in that case what is she supposed to do? Of course she and her husband was devastated but it was necessary. BTW...they named her Moana and she would've been my BIL's first daughter 😢😓 Kudos Shelley👌👍
"How is it not illegal to harass patients outside of a medical facility? Sure, you have the right to protest ... if you obtain the proper permits. If someone started screaming and yelling outside a local hospital, the cops would apprehend them in minutes!"
Jehovah God has given us free will. We all choose to obey Jehovah's rules on the sanctity of life or we choose to live by our own standards. We all answer for our life decisions.
Maybe this moron should devote as much time to the needy children of America. Another Republican who is opposed to abortion who won't tell government to support young families or give proper paid leave to mothers and parents. Only big business have lobbies to get them tax dollars.
Oh man! I would start asking for CASH ASAP! 😂😂😂😂
How can you be pro life and kill those who are pro choice? Seems contradicting to me. Smh 🤦‍♀️
"The constitution doesn't GIVE us rights. It only prohibits the government from violating them. These rights are natural rights that you have from being a human. No one can legally take them away since they aren't given by law. They are not a legal right, but certain unalienable Rights given by their Creator."
"These hypocrites are so disgusting. Once born, they couldn't care less if the baby starves to death or gets sexually molested. It's ALL about feeling self righteous. It's all about pure selfishness."
When the men show up that's it.  Having some man tell me what to do with my body (i.e. the supreme court) is just looking for a fight (and I mean a fight).
"God doesn't force us, what business do you have then to try and force your opinion. Yes, opinion!"
"All these pro lifers are only interested in their feelings of ego driven righteousness until the babies are born....then they can justify ignoring their existence because it’s the mothers problem then and they have zero responsibility after that point, so much for their caring of life, it stops once breath is drawn.  Men should have no voice in this, no uterus, no say."
"Wow, this is just insane."
"Old men doing the screaming!  I would bet just one labour pain would bring them to their knees but they want a raped pregnant 12 year old or younger to endure a pregnancy and  full labour, terrified and screaming in pain.  They could do their bit by promoting vasectomies or better yet castration of known rapists and pedophiles now that would be worth protesting and screaming about.  Abortion has been around since men figured out what was between their legs and women as always have to take care of the end results, wanted or unwanted, banning it will change nothing, as history has shown, just more women will die from unsafe methods to have control over their bodies."
"Although I don’t agree , I can see how females believe in  pro life , but the men who get involved is very creepy and disturbing ."
Killing babies...sick
How do they not see that “deadly violence” at abortion clinics doesn’t make you pro life? How can you be so blind?
“Is that enough of feeling really self righteous this morning?” Perfect!
Dan can go protest outside Congress and let them change gun laws that kills 5 and 6 year olds at school.
Shelley you are a hero! Please take care of yourself. ❤
"Religion PREYS on children, not for them"
Those protesters are gonna burn in hell.
Good on her!! Fuck those assholes!!
"""Thou shall NOT JUDGE,"" you are only accountable for yourself."
"This woman should have thought about what was going to happen with a Trump Presidency. Democrats deserve what's happening, in this country, by not supporting, fully, Hillary Clinton. 
I hope you Democrats ""feel the burn""."
"No uterus,  no opinion on abortion. Period. I had an abortion after a failed tubal ligation. Every womans story is different"
"Sorry, you didn't do enough here. You should have dox every protester you had on camera."
"what about all the lives that ALREADY ""EXIST""?"
Why does the rainbow crowd think they have a dog in this fight?
are vasectomies next?
"if these anti-abortion protestors are so altruistic and thoughtful, I wonder how many of them have actually adopted children?"
"Planned Parenthood does so much more, than JUST abortions.."
"those ppl just wanna get creepy with those kids.. having FRAUDitors, & ppl like that getting the business to close (whether it's here, or at the DMV, or even the PostOffice) getting them to close IS A ""WIN"" to THEM.."
There isn’t “a right to choose life” if their is no choice
"My body my choice?
So what about prostitution? 
Why is it illegal? There is boundaries with your bodies. You can't go around killing babies through out your life."
"those EVILgelicals aint ""pro-LIFE"".. 🙄
    💁🏼‍♀️ they're ""pro-AFTERlife"""
"My comment is to all who are unhappy with this decision:
For over 49 yrs roe vs Wade mocked God our creator as creator of all life...finally 
some people came to their senses....
Thank you Donald Trump for appointing smart judges!!
The body of a woman and the unborn etc belongs to God not people. Just as premarital sex is a sin! Therefore abortion is usually a result because of premarital sex is most definitely a sin. 
Gay, Transgender lifestyles are also a sin against God. Those that practice such and not ""REPENT"" will not inherit eternal life. instead...God tells us in his word, that those that practice such, and not ""REPENT"" will be separated for all eternity. The warning is real and not some game as many play with God's word as a game and are faithless."
"pro-life = ""pro-TORCHER"""
Men.
"the right to choose WHAT? .. ""life""? wtf kinda ""life"" is THIS? our actual real live already growing CHILDREN aint even got the option to feel safe from GUNS, when they're at school, in our country, & they wanna add more mental health problems & deformities to the mix? NO THANX.. GO HOME!!"
"The bible mentions abortion once in the bible, along with instructions on a drink that should be used cause one if a man thinks it might not be his.
Facts."
"The American Taliban... the people who want to tell you what you can learn in school, who you can love and what control women have over their own bodies.  There is, unquestionably, a large segment of the American population who WANT their nation to be governed based on their extremist and warped views of the Bible... just like in Iran... just like in Afghanistan... just like in any other backwards theocracy that exists in the world today.

They aren't loving.  They aren't caring.  They aren't interested in your well-being.  They are monsters and they want to control you."
"Love this Clinic Escort, Shelly.   Be safe & keep up the good work."
Love the hypocrisy behind all that choose life talk when they want ro take away the choice.
"Freaks. Lazy activism. They choose the easiest, lowest intellect fight on the planet, where there is no voice in the matter from the unwanted child. This cause and these people are cowardly. They can choose a million other causes to truly save already-born kids, and they choose this. Lazy, lazy, lazy and fearful. Too chicken to show up to a true fight. In their last days, this realization will come back to them. They are doing Christianity all wrong."
Pure Evil 😈
"TAKE AWAY CHOICE FROM EVERYONE, INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO GIVE LIFE TO CHILDREN BY DONATING THEIR BLOOD OR ORGANS OR MARROW. CHOICE KILLS!!!"
"She’s great! So many women and men like her have put their own lives in danger since the 80s to keep women safe from harassment by the anti-abortion zealots in front of clinics. The anti-abortion movement terrorized women, providers and clinic staff. I remember the clinic bombings in the 80s and ‘90s and the hit lists of Doctors w/targets over their photos and all private info published (or doxxed in today’s terms), the assassinations of doctors, nurses, people who ran clinics. The anti-abortion movement was terrorized women. They don’t give a shit about ‘life’ or anything but the fetus… George Carlin was 100% right in his bit about right-to-lifers… The lives of women, and children - once out of the woman - their lives are nothing these zealots."
I wish someone had aborted them 😑
I wonder how many of these protesters have adopted children that were given up for adoption by mothers who can not take care of their babies.
Do they realize women go to these clinics who have already lost their baby?  And what their yelling does to moms who’ve already lost their baby?
"If you masturbate, your preventing life!  The tricky part about abortion is the line of when it is a baby!  
I find it ironic that pro lifers will hump to no end and contribute to over populating the world, but complain about abortion! 

It’s terrible when someone is raped and there is a baby on the way! Abortion for those should be legal! 
If you happen to be one of those who has say more than 3 to 4 kids, you are killing lives just as much as those who have abortions! The difference is your doing it slower! You are contributing to over population, starvation, crime, and disease! 

Those who have abortions just because they don’t want to have a baby are just as responsible for deaths! Many people would love to adopt your baby! 

Rape, young minors, and risk of death to the mother all should qualify for abortions no exceptions!"
Love her! (Why are there men trying to tell women about pregnancy? They've never even had a period!)
"Where are all these prolifers when the foster kids are abused? Where is their money to help these children who are unable to eat a decent meal? Where is all of their protests to help the kids that are living on the streets? Oh they don't care about them babies after they have been pushed out! Especially to those kids who may not look like them. Which one of them is helping? Who set up their homes to accomodate someone in foster care? Neither one of those fake Christians, I bet."
Also you idiots out there protesting if God wants a child to be born it's going to be born I don't care whether she goes to a abortion clinic or not God has things planned out when you're circumventing or trying to circumvent what God does you're just as f***** up as they are you just you don't get it you're out there for religious purposes obviously well I grew up Pentecostal I know that my God my savior Christ everything's planned out already so you being there is not going to do a damn thing other than bring a child into the world that's not going to have a decent life so you should be taking care of that child
If you're out there protesting you should be willing to pay for the child. Because do you really want that person that wanted to abort that child to have that child? If you do you're f***** up in the brain yes I said f***** up in the brain because no that kid is either going to be abused or beaten it's not going to turn out good in any way shape or form I believe that the US supreme Court should pay for the children in other words the Congress should make each individual judge pay for each child out there that cannot be aborted by the mother before it's born. And anyone protesting they should have to pay for the ones they're protesting against if a woman is walking into that abortion or clinic that provides abortions those outside should be held responsible for that child 100%
"Imposing your beliefs (often) based on your personal religion onto another person. Land of the ""free"" my a*s..."
"I spend my life harassing strangers seeking medical care because of my love for the unborn and fear of the sky wizard- because they ""say"" whatever I WANT to BELIEVE they say and they will NEVER contradict me like these evil women do!Cause life though."
Where are the protesters outside gun sale shops?
"4:10 And those people have the audacity to call themselves ""pro Life"".

""Pro Life"" my ass."
"Those men have such compassion towards unborn children, i bet his children don't even love them."
"Birth control and reproductive education is FREE for both men and women at Taxpayer funded facilities such as “Unplanned Parenthood”. Yet, apparently two people cannot figure out how to use it and decide to have unprotected sex anyway."
"Only third trimester service provider in the USA?! 
Oh boy. Not good. 

No reproductive health care privacy and providers will cause more problems, while not solving any"
"Don't have this sort of shitfuqery in Australia, and nor do want any of it"
"“Their right to choose life.” 

You have the right to choose what I want you to choose, is basically what she meant."
This makes me want to work at a abortion clinic LOL. I would love that job. I would make fun of those fucking protesters all day it would be amazing 🤩
"_Movement_ is the right word. Specifically, bowel movement."
Bravo to her 👏 🙌 👍 👌 ❤ 👏👏👏
Keep up the good work. God bless the anti abortion people out there protesting.
Shelley you are the very dearie! Thank you so much for your work!
"All actions have consequences. To be clear, people have the right to choose. However, if you choose to kill, you will suffer the consequences of that action. The question people need to consider: Is one moment of convenience worth that consequence? Furthermore, if you act on your right to choose to do something, others should have the right to act on their choice to prevent you from doing it or act on their right to choose to punish you for doing it. 

This is why we have laws and why those laws should reflect the highest moral standards of the society they serve. A law that simply protects a right to choose is not moral as morality is something that can be chosen. We can choose to follow the laws, we can choose to be moral, these choices can be arbitrary but like all choices, acting on them have consequences. An arbitrary law will not be just and by default becomes immoral. Law and morality need to be absolute to promote order and deliver justice, without absolute laws and morality, we will have chaos and injustice.

Abortion is not moral because it is both an action and a choice to commit that action. Abortion is in fact immoral because morality will determine that an unborn baby has the right to live just as you or I have the right to live. Therefore If a law protects that choice then the law becomes unjust and ultimately immoral.

This is a bit of logic wordplay and I hope it promotes some critical thought. Feel free to choose to listen to it, or not; but your choice will not change morality no matter how much you seek to justify your actions"
Notice the vocal ones are old white men!
"@CNN Why don’t you link to the TikTok 
Give the creator her credit!
I bet she would like the bump in views"
"Wow. A patient escort willing to put herself in harms way to protect women in crisis from cruel, terrible, vicious, ignorant bullies. Props to her. Really … respect."
"Notice how she said ""her right to CHOOSE life"""
As a rape baby myself I fully support a womans right to choose. My mother was raped when she was 14. I was born when she turned 15. This was in the south in 1972. So she was basically blamed for the rape. She she couldn't go to school. She was harassed. Disowned by half the family because they were all southern baptists. Had she had and abortion I wouldn't have given a shit because I was just a zygote at the time and it wouldn't matter. Her life would have turned out better with the abortion. Anti abortionists think that everyone should have to born into this madness we call the human race. They all seem to be ok with lies and murder and hate and war and on and on. You really want to bring children into this rat race? Anti abortionists are sadistic fuckers to say the least. Knowing then what I know now I would never have brought children into this world.
I bet not a one of them votes for policies that take care of the kids or their mothers. Liars. All liars.
"I wish these pro-lifers (but they really aren't) would just get out of other people's lives. The patient didn't just fall off the back of a truck, in front of an abortion clinic, and say, ""Well, while I'm here I think I'll have an abortion."" Ignorant, self-righteous morons is what these people are. Did the female protester act like she was a little too medicated? There's relaxed and then there's medically induced coma."
"Hmmmm what about black and babies?  Oh , yeah, those babies don't matter.  It's beyond insane white men pontificating on on women's healhcare which they know nothing they know about."
Anti abortion protesters… ONCE THIS CHILD IS BORN.. I NEED YOUR FINANCIAL AND EMOTIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.. is that being offered to these mothers and unborn children??
"These procedures should be done in hospitals, like in most places in the world, where the annonymouty of everyone involved is guaranteed. It's almost as if they've created these clinics so that people can be targeted."
"These people are literally disgusting. Not only is what people do with their bodies none of their business, they do not even try to understand the other side of the story. Instead, they just cover their ears, scream ""abortion bad,"" try to make it look like they care by saying something vague about the Bible, and make it everybody's problem. I'm not saying the First Amendment should be rolled back, but there is no excuse for there being this many people with views that are just factually inaccurate. America needs to try harder to educate its people on human biology, religion, and most importantly, the basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution. No more denying science. No more backing up nonexistent claims with ""faith."" No more picking and choosing when someone does or does not have rights. You cannot protest reality."
this ladys screen name is the deathscorts... thats disgusting
"I love how these so called pro life people like to talk about choice too like you can choose life not murder yet they are really just pro birth and don’t care about the kid after the fact they just want the woman to have the baby period with no other choice, we just want the body autonomy to be able to do whatever we want with our body, no one is saying to do one or the other, we just want the choice to be able to do what’s right for us

Those creepy people really referring to people they don’t know by mom and saying those things like that’s just really creepy and seems like they have mental problems"
everyone born of god overcomes the world. this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith.
Religion is a cancer on society.
"I want to know how many of these protesters are also involved in our foster care system, how many have adopted children, how many would be willing to give money or even do volunteer babysitting for these women??? If not then they can STFU and let these women make their own decisions. If she doesn’t/ can’t be a mom weather medical or by choice, she shouldn’t be made to, that’s why you have people who shouldn’t have children, have children, then when children have horrible upbringings no one wants to help the mother with her “blessings”."
The Lady coming up to them is actually the one who feels self righteous. She is a hypocrite. Just calling like I see it.
I have no answer for these ignorant BASTARdS
Abortion is murder. 1A.
I volunteered at a clinic while pregnant with my daughter and an anti-abortion protested threatened to follow me home and stab me to death. I was visibly pregnant. The Catholic priest beside him did not intervene.
"Yes women are dying 
Are they not people 
Think"
"People get killed by those who unjustly accuse others 
Not knowing what Äonen go through"
"If this clinic was in a ghetto, would those people be protesting there?"
I want to know what anti-abortion protestors thoughts are on rape and incestuos abuse? Oh and also fetus's that are already dead in the womb or mom who will die if they carry to term?
You have no idea what women go through
From one Shelley to another. Thank you!!
"Prolife, but they are ok with weapons that slaughter our children? It makes purrrrfect sense!"
"The woman yelling that ""we are here to help"" notice she doesn't offer to adopt the baby."
These women are real American hero's saving real Americans everyday.
Why is it you'll never see these protesters outside a urologists office that performs vasectomies?
"so, simple: the protestors are fearing God because of their own sins, and now they want to get points on other sinners expense.

the horror of religion."
These people need to mind their own business and stop brining God into their nonsense: God gave mankind the right to choose these nuts are trying to take that away. That behavior is not of God they need to look at their own sinful and flawed lives
#voteblue #votebluetosavedemocracy #votebluetoprotectwomen #votebluetosaveamerica #voteblue VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE
they want help and they are going to place to seek it you don't need to yell at them and call them mom...  which is not their name... and yell we can help you!!    EVERYONE MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!!!!! my brother died at age 21 of heart difficulties that were totally preventable but he couldn't afford the operation and wasn't eligible for medicare........       tell me how you can help me???????????   TELL ME HOW YOU CAN HELP ME!!!!!
It is not anyone's responsibility to interfere themselves into others lives. I always flip these people off at the clinic in my town & yell fuck off out the window. They're unsufferable.
"The sanctimonious man at the beginning is most probably the type who would pay the monks to bury him in the monastery or the church floorboard to improve his chance of absolution.  

There are homeless and sick to car for. Yelling his bias to intimidate pregnant women isn't going to tip the goodness scale. It's juvenile and desperate to consider that would work."
"So much for ""pro-life"" eh? These religious nut jobs are violent and hateful. #mybodymychoice"
"""Their right to choose life"" - the key words there are ""right"" and ""choose"".
They fundamentally do not believe in women's rights, specifically, they do not believe in their rights to choose to continue or to terminate the pregnancy. 
This is not a war on abortion - its a war on women."
50 usd?! You're sh*tting me?!
The reason you can't claim an unborn child is because the Government says it's not a person. Read that again.
"I was told only rioters had no jobs and should get a life, what about these people?"
The creepy old man calling a young lady mom 😖
Let's go Brandon
I had an abortion at 19. I was 4 weeks and 2 days pregnant. I took that walk. I was screamed at and called horrible names. I love that this is in place for girls and women who are making sometimes the hardest decision of their life. This is what I consider God’s work ❤️
"They should be wanting forced vasectomies for men...oh, wait you say they wouldn't want that?"
"I just happened to walk by a Women's center that I didn't even realize was there and all of a sudden like 5 people were all talking to me at once and it took a minute to figure out wtf was happening... they were all like ""Do you need help?"" ""You don't have to do this!"" ""What's your name?"" ... and I was just walking down the street. I understand offering help, and even trying to share your perspective... but at a certain point it can feel like bullying. I've gone to get free birth control, regular std testing, and even a pregnancy test and ultrasound at a women's center and it's always assumed that you're there for an abortion and it's just a baby killing factory 🤦‍♀️"
Well that makes perfect sense claim prolife but murder someone ffs
What a SHAME AlL of these people's parents DIDN'T BELIEVE in ABORTION ..we would not be having this discussion ..there is still time if YOU ARE so SET on ABORTION GO  FOR IT ..  YOUR NOT TO OLD YOU CAN DO IT ..  NO AGE  ABORTION ..👍👍👍👍👍
These Maniacs will soon be  running our country. And the democrats are asleep at the wheel .
DiD you see the FBI Finally Found ASHLEY BIDEN Diary she was being MOLESTED BY JOE BIDEN was taking Shower with her .. look it up
IT was never a constitutional right TO KILL  A CHILD ..back in the day woman and children were sacred ..now shoot them EVERY day !! Sick society ..💩for BRAIN'S ..
Are those individuals that are protesting going to adopt the babies and supply money to those individuals that will need help?
Look up planned Parenthood selling baby body parts hidden camera video YouTube ..!! That's why they want you to wait till 15 weeks when the CHILD can live outside of the mother .! Or at birth !!  Use a condom WTF sick MF s
"""Only in America"""
Where DO you GET a PROTEST SIGN SAYS I'm a baby killer ..!?? I guess she is FOR SCHOOL Shootings TO .?? ABORTION AT BIRTH .. ugly BABY 👎 ..make me sick not HUMAN ..
If a women has problems during pregnancy does the doctor give her a Bible or medical attention in the anti abortion slave states?
"Just don’t have sex how hard is that?
Oh rape or incest? Abortion is legal for that in every state."
"God bless these people taking time out of their lives to try to save a child, and stop the psychological injury to the mother. The hateful pro-death side will only understand once it's too late for them."
"Anyone notice how it mostly men protesting? All of them, especially the men, need to mind their own business."
"At 0:47 the women said, “Right to choose...”. Does she even hear herself?"
Yet its the liberals that are attacking the pregnancy pro life centers after Roe v wade was overturned.
She's a wacko!
"Someone needs to stand out there with listing the names of real babies who died at their mothers or loved ones hands. Anti-Abortion don't want to admit what happens to unwanted babies, when our legal system is full of examples of them."
Hypocrite and fake
The compassion that the escorts show to the clients has me in tears right now. It's the same compassion that Jesus would show them. The entitlement and self righteousness of the protesters makes me feel ill.
What a magnificent woman you are Shelley!
They not protesting in front of police stations to stop killing people.
They don't care about people after they're born.
"Somehow I can’t imagine Jesus standing outside the clinic shouting at people.
As for the people shouting about abortions - why aren’t they expending that energy on protecting kids who are ALIVE already & being abused!?"
"We will help you, just don’t ask for any assistance, guidance, after your first breath you are on your own, we have prison space for you or send you to war when you turn 18!!!"
"As a Canadian, I can't understand that.  All that because people beliieve in an imaginary friend in the sky?"
"Those people don't care about life. Do they visit the nearby orphanages or group homes for families without food or money? No, they're too busy trying to take another person's rights away. 🖕😡"
🤔 I hope these people have mercy when some of the children their trying to save get abused the rest of their lives . Yes some people don't deserve children .I think suicide and child abuse statistics are going to go up if abortion is banned everywhere 😢
Asolutely right to choose LIFE?  How aout their right to choose a aortio?
Those protesters are demented religious freaks!!
"This lady is employing a tactic that I think works! These creeps hope you won't engage them one on one. 
Zebras use their STRIPES to confuse a predator. These morons that love to protest as ""part of a crowd"" can be taken down by a smart predator that focuses on ONE target at a time. 🤣"
Good for her. Put these people on blast. They're human garbage for trying to deny women their bodily autonomy.
"abortion is bad, why are people supporting baby killing...sounds wrong."
"What a sick individual Shelly is, this is insane."
"0:41 Keyword in that sentence being ""CHOOSE""!"
Do they ever protest in front of churches about the number of spontaneous abortions that are part of 'god's' big scheme ?
Guess how many kids this “activist” never had
"They'll regulate a uterus to stop babies from dying, but won't regulate guns, and they will happily send these children to their death in an overseas war for nonsense."
I dare her to have a debate with Lila Rose or Ben Shapiro I bet she would lose that debate quickly!
"A little disingenuous about the assault part. If you watch the actual full length video they're both pushing and shoving each other. He is charged because he escalates it. Hence why the charge was ""by mutual consent"" meaning he was able to prove both sides were combative. He essentially the got the equivalent of a bad traffic ticket. Its a violation level offense."
These crazy people are lonely and have no life or purpose of their own  so they find purpose encroaching on other people’s lives and decisions
They are terrorists. That’s not simple protest.   Spend your time volunteering in a daycare or something that is actually helpful.
WHY DON'T YOU HELP THE CHILDREN WE HAVE ALREADY!!!
if they care for children why not become Froster care parents do something nice not hatful and ugly
It’s always people no one would have sex with who advocate for abortion.
I saw that before here In Boston. They were standing outside with signs saying that they would give money to women if they went through their pregnancy and gave their babies to them. Very awkward.
"The vast majority of women going there are like, ""I just came here for a Pap smear, dumbass!!"""
Take the L Libs. Looool
Prove any god exists or stfu.
anti-abortion people killing in the name of life????? What a contradiction
"If you want to help children, you volunteer at a family shelter. If you want to harass women, you stand outside a clinic and yell at them. We know exactly what these creeps really care about."
Ya'll really acting like this is worse than the pro-choicers rioting?
"I Love that woman - Shelley.
I really appreciate the Gutless Selfish crap she has to put up, and I REALLY would like to join her.
I Wish this to be a HUGE WRITTEN HUG, and THANK YOU, for what she does.
I'm proud of her.
I'm Sorry THAT'S even a job.
I'm Disgusted with the selfish protesters, who make it one, 
And, To the WOMEN, who even Have to make to Make that choice, In really sorry You have to endure those WORTHLESS, SELFISH IDIOTS on the Street, who obviously DON'T CARE ABOUT PEOPLE, and, who REALLY should get A NEW hobby.
Thank you Shelley."
The SC overturning of Roe V Wade is a most cruel decision against women in America. After trumps' election this is the second dark day in current American history. America is finally becoming a Roman Catholic Jihadist State. Women are now controlled in their choices. The Roman Catholic Jihadist SC will next go after the LGBTQIA+ community!
These people are evil. These people are scum. Abortion is a big decision and people making that decision don't need the experience to be any more traumatic than it already is. It sickens me. It makes me so sad and angry.
The look on their face when I speed into the parking lot... Gets me everytime
"It was awful to walk through the doors of  the clinic, writhing in pain from an ectopic pregnancy (the hospital would not preform my abortion), and listen to those people yell at me about the embryo that was rupturing my insides, while having no idea I had a breastfeeding 6mo at home. These people have no idea what damage they are doing to the mental health of women that they do not know."
People have a right to protest
All this just to keep kill these unborn babies
"The 11 people killed can not be condoned. Here's a question.... how many women have died because of abortions, and how many babies have been killed because of abortions."
Well if God sends you the gift of a child through a rapist or incest who are you to question it. These religious types are truly mindless cult zombies. Gods quite the a-hole.
"that doctors nerves are shot, hope he can keep a steady hand while performing abortions"
"And yet.... their f Bible says its ok for Abortion, Living Being becomes at first breath, God ok with taking Fetuses etc.....
Like their literally Quotations.

This is called Religious Zealotry where they think they know everything about Bible and saying they obey it and still doing the opposite what the Bible says or Radicalsl Talibanism"
"""I always keep them in my prayers"" while yelling and telling them they're going to hell 🤦‍♀️"
"This first aired over the winter, didn't it? I seem to recall seeing this before, and it got harder to watch."
"ADOPT AND FOSTER UNWANTED KIDS, FINANCE THEM, SEND THEM TO COLLEGE"
"Protestors would bomb an abortion center and kill doctors bc they ""care about life."" Makes perfect sense. 🤔🤨
And they claim to be religiously ""pro-life,"" just not your life if you decide to have an abortion or support it. Hypocrites are the worst."
"God bless these pro-baby advocates trying to save babies. This woman is evil, ignorant and despicable."
The US are fucked up !
"Just the sight of those elderly white men and their dehydrated faces urging this thing on young women is enraging-- I wonder what those twerps have in their past as adolescent guys feeling their oats, and if they're so worried I wonder why they don't go to work on the young men of this country where they might have something useful to say.  But to women they've got nothing useful to say."
Nothing like pro-lifers taking a life for their cause.
She's the grim reaper..
"i swear i've seen this story b4, similar footage. must be a rebroadcast. plz do new reporting on the ground pls CNN"
"It's very sad what the Supreme Court has done. We must VOTE!!!! I know it sounds like a broken record but it's the ONLY THING WE CAN DO... We can protest, we can write letters, post on social media, even get mad, fight ect.... none of it will do any good!!! Remember in November"
"The conversation about abortion has became so basic that it frustrates me…pro life vs pro choose…the main conversation is how to deal with a consequence instead of discussing the cause or like debating what type of cast is best for a patient without knowing which bone in your body is broken or if there is actually an injury at all…
How about we talk more about prevention, about the equal responsibility that both members of a relationship have in terms of contraception, because even in 2022 there are many men who still believe that the woman is the sole responsible for preventing a pregnancy and there is still many women who agree with that or simply comply. 
We need to talk about how can we really help and support pregnant women who are going through financial difficulties, family problems; expectant mothers who don’t have a proper support system and need a hand and better opportunities for her and her baby.
We need to talk more about how an abortion is not a solution or a contraceptive; we need to talk about the physical, emotional and mental scars that an abortion leaves. The chances of infertility, the chances of having a miscarriage later on when you decide to have a kid, the guilt that sometimes last a lifetime, the pain you feel when you see your kids and realize that there was actually a person inside of you and how horrible you could feel for denying your baby the possibility to live. 
The regret that could overwhelm you.
We need to talk more about how to give a better care for the children who enter into the foster system.
But beside talking we need ACTION! Abortion is being sold as the perfect solution for an unexpected pregnancy, but is simply a distraction that is preventing us the possibility to really look for the root of the issues that many pregnant women are facing today."
To be a Christian is to wake up grumpy.
It's like all the crackheads who want to talk to you at the bus stop gathered in one place.
She's way too kind with these waste of oxygen and their demented ideas
I wish some of these protesters offering to “help” these women were throwing themselves into helping mothers and babies AFTER birth.
#RoeVsWade
‘Pro Life’ is an oxymoron nowadays.
The US looked at Taliban and decided that religion influencing lawmaking was awesome…
"Your book of ancient myths is Pro-Abortion, fundies.
Numbers 5:11-31. Look it up!"
The mother is the only one that can make the decision
How psihopats you need to be to be a lookout for a murdering entity! And you do it with a straite face!
I could tell that god give people free will with a reason and don’t discriminate as long the person didn’t commit sin. I don’t take anyone side but I will respect someone willing of having a child unless it a victim. I don’t get why people protesting to congress instead of blaming someone in the Mississippi who started this situation to begin with
Shelley Mann in the clips is so condescending and passive aggressive she really seems like women which is annoying to be around she should seems like a jerk. And Dan the protester seems just like a good person with regrets and trying to do what's right in contrast to her and in general the protesters seem like nice people that she is trying to provoke to do things that look bad on TikTok for her own self image.
And some Americans often wonder why they aren't able to keep up with the science and technology of the rest of the world.
"I Am So So Grateful that Abortion laws were over turned, Let's save as many babies as we can, God Is Good and smiling down, on all the lives that will be saved, and not torn apart and thrown away like trash."
The leaf blower is a great idea. Drown out their rhetoric with loud lawn care equipment.
I take paint ball guns twice a year a blast away it's not much but it's what I do
AR done these clowns
A bomb? Pro-life 🤣 kill real humans and the parasite inside. Awesome
Kick the ladder under him. It be hilarious. These people need to get a job and mind their own business. You know these people have skeletons in the closet that shouldn’t see the light of day.
"Also, I have to add that some of the pro “choice” people are arguing that abortion should be kept legal for mothers who might be hurt by complications. This is the 21st century. The % of people that will be hurt is so small. Also they argue about rape. Easy solution. Carry the baby for nine months then drop it off at a fire station. And for all the other people who have an unwanted pregnancy. You’ll have to listen close. Are you ready for the amazing secret. DON’T HAVE SEX!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Okay. I’ll give them this. If they want to be  able to murder innocent babies in privacy, they have a right to do so. But then that means that I can murder someone in privacy and get away with it…😬"
I don't regret my abortion at all
People are so weird man. Why would they sit out there like this. They have no life!!! I’m sure an abortion is scary as is. I wonder how many children Dan has adopted
She's a hero.
"So pro-life that they murder doctors and nurses??!? What sick fucks. Sorry dude but I’m sure you’re going straight to hell with those choices you have “guilt” over. Oh yea take away woman rights and judge her choices, Im sure god will let that slide buddy! These prolife people are pathetic"
"Looks like women have lost a lot of independence on the eve of their ""Independence"" July 4th Day"
"If I fell pregnant and couldn’t get access to an abortion, I’m going to harm myself. If I fail to miscarry I’m jumping in front of a train. I refuse to give birth. I’m NOT a parent."
"Christo-Fascists. 
Followers of the Apostle Paul, and the Old Testament, not Jesus. 

This inspires me to go to the local Planned Parenthood and get in some faces."
Ask them if they are willing to pay for this child's upbringing.
Imagine a world in which people would mind their own business. Wouldn't it be great?
"Praying for someone doesn’t provide housing, daycare ,groceries…"
So when they r born who's gonna take care of them..there should be better family planning laws for both men n women..strict rules for father's and mothers..this could prevent unwanted pregnancies n sometimes a cheating husband wants the side woman to abort n if she doesn't abort he murder her..so much to say about this topic
They should have a Sprinter van to pick up the patient somewhere nearby prep them for an anonymous arrival without  abuse and harassment - basically get them into a little covered wheelchair type thing with a VR headset and noise cancelling headphones then you can just roll them right by all those awful! people
These male protesters are a special kind of delusional
How to become a patient scort like you !! That's a way to help!!
"Pro lifer - ""Save the children and stop abortion. Life is sacred!""

Also Pro lifer - *attempts to kill the pregnant women by bombing abortion clinics or shooting them*"
Thank you for helping women through a very difficult time in their lives .
"Meanwhile in New Zealand, we passed a bill (voted in by the majority of liberals, conservatives and libertarians) that states an abortion clinic can set up a safe zone of up to 150 meters. Protestors that violate the safe zone can be fined up $1000."
The 73 year old man is my hero. I wanna be brave like him. 🙌🏾
Your maker murdered all but 8 people...including pregnant women and babies...
"Our security team was tasked to do this once. It was myself, a big Jamaican dude and this small Italian guy. The Italian guy was the voice of the group, he loved yelling at people. We had multiple police calls against us for bouncing people off the property. Eventually the cops got involved and told people to stay from the clinic otherwise they'd be arrested."
cleaning up the trash lol
I LOVE her!
why dont they build a wall .
🙏🙏
"So sick of women with their selfish idea that somehow they have the right to murder babies, the degenerate 1960's really screwed up the minds of many, it should have never been permitted...!!!"
These people need to stay in their OWN LANE FFS 🤦‍♀️ EVIL PEOPLE BUTT OF THE PRIVATE AND HARD TIME OF A STRANGER LIFE THAT HAS NO CONCERN OF YOURS YOU INTERFERING OVERBEARING UNINFORMED STRANGERS
I'm confused. They are trying to save the unborn child but they have no problem killing the caregivers or blowing up the building. Somehow that doesn't compute to me!
US is a really weird place... they seem to be pro life... but in reality their guns kill more people... and instead of regulating guns they put anti-abortion laws. If you want proof that some people don't understand logic... well... there you have it.
And they are punk men.
These morons need to do something useful like getting guns off the street...
Over a million children in foster and people are against abortion. Go adopt children if you want to help.
"Mind your own business, keep your religion off of my civil liberties...."
"Prayers.. Nice gesture but you're seriously gonna try offering me B when i explicitly need A and then say I'm the problem for refusing your ""help"". Children can't eat prayers, they can't wear prayers, or sleep on prayers. Tangible assistance people."
I. Love.Her 💪🏾
"Overturned Roe vs Wade. Politicians beware. Married or not Politician’s can no longer force your Mistress’s into having a abortion. Yes. I encourage all Mistress’s to run straight to Fox 6 news name your unborn child’s father. You will need to do this to ensure your child will have financial support that most children are not afforded today. That’s the only choice the Mistress will have. The wife better not be mad accept her husband’s untrustworthy ways with pride. Did I say Pride? LGBTQ will be next, so all the closet politicians can stay in the closet, and that’s not fair. Americans can’t wait to see if the closet politicians will be yanked out of the closet and that’s not fair either. Politician’s voted to take away a person’s choice to choose. What’s next?"
Shelley your a symbol of freedom 🇺🇸
"Hahahaha they want to help! Great! Take the baby home with you and give that woman no responsibilities! OH YOU DONT WANT TOO! Then GTFO there. Christians, stop judging people you go to hell for that too!"
"That's a real stand-up Christian right there, assaulting a woman at her place of business. These anti-choice protesters are the worst kind of human beings. They want to be self-righteous while telling other people when they should or shouldn't have a baby. That's none of their damn business.

How many of those protesters have adopted children already? How many will vote for Representatives that will provide for health care for all Americans? How many support Medicaid, WIC, maternal and paternal paid time off work after the baby's born, or financial assistance to those who need it during pregnancy and immediately after delivery? My best guess is none of them."
"Anti abortionists should show they can take care of a child first before they have one, governmentally speaking. Where are the support services for children in this country? at the bottom of the pile globally"
"Those protesters are the same people that vote for Republicans who support access to military grade weapons that murder school children. 
They care more about their supposed gun rights then they do about human lives. None of them are part of a well-regulated militia; so, the Constitution does not protect their rights to have AR-15s. 
I am not against having guns for hunting or for home protection, but nobody should have in military grade weapon of murder that scares police from actually responding to a school shooting."
Hes NOT A BABY KILLER LIKE U ARE LRAVE HIM ALONE. HES YELLING AT BABY KILLERS
Why are all the protesters old asf!?
"Lol its so funny she has treat them like children, because they are 🤣"
Another baby killer. No difference between abortion and shooting school children.
"Well I think that's harassment, making that decision is hard enough, that man in the video really needs to think about what will HE tell his maker about HIS behavior"
Feeble minded people pray to their invisible God every day. Enlightened people realize we are God grown outta the universe. We are the universe observing itself. An embryo is nothing more than a seed it doesn't know life or death. We practice population control in all species right down to bugs and viruses. Go to any farm u quickly realize life is very messy and involves death. We are no different. Feeble minded need a crutch cause they feel hostile toward the environment around them. They are filled with guilt and shame cause they can't live up to Jesus. They are also filled with pride and judgement of others not like them. They assume their view of the universe is correct wen in reality no1 knows. The realy bad zealots tend to speak their God's will and use actions against others in an attempt to feel better about themselves while reaffirming their beliefs. It's the USA tho freedom of religion hence choice is the American way
"Bless this woman, she is amazing!!! Thank you so much to this fabulous woman"
"Well, when these pro-lifers/God impersonators show up to their Maker, I think they will be surprised. And not in a good way."
Let us help you? How? Prolifers are contemptuous of the mother and the unborn
Wow so these pro-lifers actually don’t like people and decide it’s best to kill them.
I think women are being violated and having their lives taken away from them by the prolife movement.
It sounds like old men yelling at their mom....LOL the leaf blower. That would be me out there with a leaf blower.
Thanks for doing this critical work to support our freedom.
"Dan: When I meet my maker, I hope he has a lot of mercy.
GOD: Are you aware that the bible that I provided you does not mention abortion? My son also does not speak of such."
"No, you don't need to walk out there and protest, you are not helping anyone, you are not pro-life because you are not protecting that life for the entirety. You are just trying to force your own conscience onto someone else without having ANY idea why they are there, what they are doing, what they are facing. In short, stay home and stop making something that is already difficult enough even harder. 

Also, do you idiots not see the hypocrisy of carrying pro-life signs while threatening people with murder and violence. Even your own faith tells you not to judge and yet here you are, playing god and laying down judgements. Even your imaginary sky daddy is ashamed of you."
"Abortion is illegal in many European countries, and they seem to do just fine!!"
How many children have they adopted? Realize u won’t get a baby. States keep kids in the agency. A kid spent life in foster care..17 foster homes. They r kicked out once they age out.
"You Americans Confuse rights with responsibilities A LOT. And the world LEARNS its views from YOU..
 Wake up and see that Sex is not a right. It's a responsibility. If you dont want a baby, think of that before you do it. If we all started realising this not only would we have less abortions all over this world... We'd have less rape and abuse too.."
"The truth is,it's not a single one of these people's buisiness what decisions people make"
Reproductive healthcare? These people aren't going to Planned Parenthood for healthcare of their reproductive organs. They're killing babies. But it sounds much nicer to say it the way leftist do.
"Since 1977, an average of half a million babies lost their lives every single year. The 11 who were killed as tragic as it is, pales in comparison. Oh the irony."
"Uhhg, God and monster nutbags."
We used to sing songs to drown out the protesters.
"It’s a woman’s choice , with hopefully a man’s support and consent as well"
"Look, when people stood up and took their party back by electing an outsider, you all endlessly criticized and attacked him and them.  When people tried to stand up  to the government through protest, you all cheered when the government deployed armed troops against them, and when a cop shot and killed an unarmed protestor you did not demand justice for her, but rather cheered your Dear Leaders.    So why act so hurt now that it's your turn?"
"It looks like these people just don’t have a life. 
They should be with their grandchildren or wife. 
Shame on those people for being weak for stalking a women at her hardest time in her life."
"It looks like these people just don’t have a life. 
They should be with their grandchildren or wife. 
Shame on those people for being weak for stalking a women at her hardest time in her life."
Where does harassment end and protesting begin ?
She a freakin' hero.
"🤡These clowns are so pro life that they’re using their time to foolishly shout at people rather than hell with the lives they say they want to protect. They should adopt, foster, coach, teach children if they love and appreciate them butttttt nooooo they shout at people that may just be picking up birth control or getting a Pap smear."
Do they have money to give to people? Are they going to adopt or foster this child?
A running generator would drown out a lot.  I wish a billionaire would take interest and throw some money at this issue.
Dan is an idiot what has he done in his life that gives him the right to chose for a women.... He's an old man with to much time on his hands ....
"Reasons Why Abortion Should Be Legal:
-Abuse
-Incest 
-Poverty
-Rape
Whether you agree or disagree with me as long as you are tolerant. For those who are against abortion rights for females. What if a female girl or woman was raped by some random violent teenage boy or man, what if she has no way to support her children because of poverty, what if she did not want to have children but her abusive boyfriend or her abusive husband forced her to give birth to a baby even if she is not ready to be a mother and what if she was raped by one of her male family members because it would be extremely disgraceful & disgusting to keep the baby of a rapist & a male relative which will traumatize the mother & especially the children. That is why I am pro-choice not pro-abortion and not anti-abortion but pro-choice period.
(Abort babies when they are a zygote)"
Stop histrionic forced birthers!
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe."
So only pro choicers who support abortion have the right to protest and destroy property at will.
They're actually trying to help guys
"How about supporting child tax credit, child care, medicare for all, universal healthcare. . . you know things that actually help children after they are born?"
Thank you for what you do!  You can’t imagine what you are providing!
"They are not PRO LIFE, they are PRO BIRTH.  It is between you & whoever you believe in.  NOBODY, NOBODY had a right to tell me what to do with MY body."
So we’re Singing her praises for killing babies?
The only reason to stop abortions was the Republicans are so afraid they will be replaced by black people  dont have a dam thing to do with life but the cowards
"They should embrace the GOP's support of BS ""Stand your ground"" laws and say they feared for their life whenever one of the crazies whacks them with a sign."
Bro chill those women need to do what they need to do none of our business that’s giving them some of a choice. There not even asking to help just to leave them alone
Where’s the help for the tens of millions of children going hungry right here in the USA !
The Christian Taliban
Provide headphones with music as they get out of the car.           Very brave young woman. Thank you for all that you do!
Those men should step up and have a voluntary vecectamy. Nip it at the bud
"Men control women's body is wrong, are men having them No! What if a decision to cut off your b.. is that right?"
Bless her
This abortion issue has never been and never will be about the actual health of the baby or mother or whatever this is about religious people trying to control others as they have done for centuries
"Yeah pro-life people killing isn't that a contradiction, why can't people just mind their own freaking business. :-) :-)"
Damn it’s already hard enough…and how does Damn know? Only p—-y he’s seen is mama’s.
"The women who are forced to give birth should give the baby to these anti-abortion people. If the anti-abortion folks are so self-righteous, they should help take care of these babies."
fat and ugly women disagrees with pro life who would of thought
That doctor is a stand up guy
My wife and I had to go through this. She was having an ectopic pregnancy terminated. We were told there was no chance the fetus could survive and continuing the pregnancy was not an option for her safety. At the time we had four children and she ran a daycare center. We certainly had room for one more.
Creeps
Baby killers are disgusting
"Not today, Larry 🖤"
"Pro lifers are hypocrites. Why are red states the worst out of 50 states for infant mortality or child hunger? By the way they yammer you’d think red states would be baby utopia’s but they’re not. They’re absolutely terrible in every metric. If they really cared they’d show it opposed to leaving terrible messages and protesting clinics. Laughable most are pro firearm and pro protecting property with deadly force. Also capital punishment. Yeah, really pro life right there. They’re hypocrites plain and simple."
Evil churches fund these demonstrators to cause trouble
"CNN: ""this woman is standing up to anti-abortion protestors by posting them on Tiktok""
Also CNN: ""LibsOfTikTok is dangerously doxxing liberals by sharing videos of them on Tiktok"""
They won't help anyone
"WOW, it was incredibly dumb to post video of that woman saying that anything that looks like a bomb gets the clinic shut down for the day. Now there will be boxes on the doorstep daily.  Sometimes you shouldn't tell the WHOLE story."
This is why religious freaks are the most dangerous. They are like cult. They believe they are above everything/ everyone. I can not name any other religion that tries this hard to dictate How everyone else’s life. Actually dangerous to modern state governing.
How ironic to try to kill or harm someone for doing a job which is protecting and supporting a woman’s difficult decision from harsh judgment shame or harm. There’s something really wrong with these protesters fr they could be helping at a homeless shelter or fostering children but instead they choose to shame and judge other humans the very thing the bible says not to do
"Abortion is murder, get over it.
There are dozen of contraception methods, so you simply have no excuse for being irresponsible."
"If you don't want a baby, abstain from intercourse, use 2 kinds of birth control or get sterilized.  Only 1.5% of ALL abortions are because of rape or incest!  That means 98.5% are because of IRRESPONSIBILITY!!!  Grow up and be responsible for your actions!
Yes, I got pregnant at 19, in 1974 and could have had an abortion, but DIDN'T!"
"Anyone who works in a clinic will tell you: the meanest, harshest thing you can do to an anti-abortion pain-in-the-ass protester, the thing which bugs them more than anything, which makes them have to work hard to avoid displaying their frustration, is to ignore them.  There is nothing you can say, nothing which you can do, which will frustrate them as much as if you ignore them."
You are so brave!!! Thank you for helping all women
How can you cite the being who commanded the murder of the first born of all Egypt as being anti abortion?
Wow ! what a job - escorting baby killers to the execution chamber. How brave & noble.
"Shouting we will help you?
How? Taking care of medical bills? Adopting children?
They are so self righteous that its disgusting to watch. They are so prolife that they are willing to KILL.🤬
Thanks to all escorts and workers that risk their lives every day in order to help those poor women."
"How brave the staff are against the deranged religious cultists. I remember working as a midwife in the US 30 years ago. One, wonderful, back up physician had to have 24 hour security as he was the only obgyn who would, humanely, terminate a pregnancy when it was needed, saving many women's lives, and putting his own in jeopardy. My colleagues birth centre was 'bombed' by a christian psychiatric case, ( thankfully no one was in the building or in labour at the time). The reason he destroyed her birth centre? Her back up obgyn was the brilliant Dutch Dr who supported a woman's right to choose, whether to have a child, whether to give birth in a hospital (with most US doctors sabotaging labour to make as much money as possible) or a natural birth centre, with trained midwives. I lasted 2 years before returning to the UK. The horrors I saw there made me realise the dangers facing normal, intelligent, compassionate people against dangerous religious fanatics. My colleagues birth centre had volunteers help rebuild it but the expectant moms had to either have their babies at home or at another birthing centre in the interim. The attack affected her livelihood as many women felt too frightened to then have their babies at her beautiful birth centre after that. Yet abortions never take place at a birthing centres. Pregnancies end because a baby is born!!! So this crazy man could easily have killed a new mother and her baby as well as the professionals and other staff. It was an eye opening experience to say the least. Returning to Europe was like returning to heaven after 2 years in American fundamentalist hell."
Men!!!
She is a very brave women.   We need more like her. Those people  would make a way bigger difference if they put down their signs and volunteered  their time to children and families who are already here and need their help.
Shelley Mann looks hideous. She doesn't have to worry about needing an abortion. Lol.
Brave lady.
"That escort is great!  Love when she says, ""Nobody asked you.""  LOL"
how about having an underground parking lot? lol
Thank you Shelly for your strength!
"Ask these same religious self righteous hypocrites about the lives of children coming across the border, about wars killing dozens of children everyday, or even underage, mentally disabled people on death row. They care only for the fetus and once born they are worthless to them"
These types of religious people just never stop infiltrating not only people's house doors but the most vulnerable and private body parts.
Go Shelly
Can ppl pls start bombing the pro lifers? Why is it always the other way around?
"Who the fuck are these old men? FOH. America is a shit hole.
 And I LOVE this girl!! This is what we need!!"
"I love this escort so much.  With all my soul.  She is a strong warrior who care so much for my sisters, mothers, aunts, and friends.  I thank her from the bottom of my heart.  And those protesters?  Why aren't they adopting one of the 150,000 children who have been up for adoption in the USA?  If they care so much about those children - why aren't they adopting 5 or 6 of them and why aren't they with them right now?"
Lunatics
You are a brave young women and don't know how many women you've helped by simply being there. Thank you on behalf of my grand daughters and great grand daughters.
"My dad used to walk up to anti abortion protesters and ask their name. Then he pulled out a $5 and said I’m going to donate this to the clinic IN YOUR NAME!
He was a warrior spirit"
The problem with the protesters are is that they believe they have a maker and that maker does not approve of a woman's' health. How sad and stupid is that.
3:12 she just called it a tiny rubber fetus?
Religion sucks.  What a bunch of horrible people.
"They don't care about the life that's already here
Once the baby,that they beg for, IS born they do nothing to help the mothers in any way,shape or form
Doubt they would care if a ten year old girl was pregnant"
"Simple, criminalize fornication. Castrate any man who violates that law!"
And not one of these protesters ever adopted a baby.
"Isn’t it wonderful that these old MEN are there harassing women. And really, it’s a boy or a girl” well crap, I thought it was a puppy."
Why don’t they just spend their time in foster care taking care of those beautiful children instead? Do they know how many homeless children are there in America?!! !
She’s amazing
Don't understand how certain people can so passionately support the murder of unborn babies. Thousands of lives saved by the Supreme Court's decision.
Make no mistake - you are a hero.  Women need to be in control of their bodies PERIOD.

"Years ago I worked in law enforcement, and I remember getting a call, that a group had barged into a clinic. When I arrived, there were several protesters with signs sitting on the steps of the clinic and a few on the edge of the property as well. I tried to ask what was going on but was ignored, until a staff member from the clinic stuck her head out the door and said ""they're in the clinic"". By this time I was backed up by several other officers and we made our way past the ones on the step and into the clinic. The protesters had entered an examination room where a young lady was still on the exam table. They were sitting in a circle around the table singing.  About 3 months later the clinic moved to a more secure location."
"Can you imagine if the pilgrims didn’t bring all that religious crap with them.
Go on, just imagine that."
Wow so brave of her. Get a real job
I don't feel sorry for these demons!!! Stop killing babies!
"If you kill a baby, you should also die!"
Why are we killing babies?! Just why??!! Why should a precious baby 👶 get a death sentence?!!
But pedophile priests are okay with your imaginary friend in the sky?
America is NOT YOUR CHURCH
"The two most dangerous times for women in abusive relationships is when they are leaving or are pregnant.  But these are the same people who would deny her an abortion but wont vote for gun control or the ""boyfriend"" claus which could possibly save her and her unborn life.  I am so tired of these meddling white old fanatics."
"Funny how women are doing what they need to do to stop unwanted suffering, yet some men and women ignore all the real issue, like the fentanyl epidemic, to berate women who choose not to add to it."
"Funny it's always the people who don't have to deal with the consequences of their opinions that are protesting. The mothers are going to have to take care of the babies that they can't financially support, the foster care programs are going to have to find these children a better quality of life, and women are going to forcefully die giving birth to babies that wouldn't have had a conscious understanding of their existence otherwise. No one should be allowed to decide for these women, it's their choice."
"Well, that whale will never need an abortion."
"So funny how these loving caring ppl bravely usher these women past the protestors, up the stairs to a dingy room where they lovingly kill babies. It’s beautiful"
"Anti-abortion protesters make spectacles out of a desperate need to feel important. Otherwise, they feel they lead insignificant meaningless lives ."
I would love to see those people standing and praying in front of a coming tornado or hurricane to go away.  Let's see how god helps them there.
"How about handing each of them earplugs as they get out of the car, or maybe earphones and music (We - Will - We - Will - Rock You!)"
"Pro-Lifers' message is incongruent and irrational.  They want (supposedly) to save the life of a fetus, but in the same breathe they're willing to kill another human being?  I think they have mental health issues, OCD being one of them.  I wonder if they would be happy to have Muslims, Jews, and Buddhists next to them  praying to their respective gods? Remember, the Constitution says we have freedom of religion and there aren't only radical christians and evangelicals in this country."
It's none of your business why they are at the clinic. Just mind your own business.
A fetus from r*pe is NOT a blessing from God
"What they forget is even God gives us the right to choose. God says ""CHOOSE death and cursing or CHOOSE life and blessing"" Each person's version of cursing and blessing maybe different than the next person's."
If men were the ones having babies they'd want the right to choose
Maybe Dan should find time to adopt a few children.
USA educations and religion are making people STUPID/IGNORANT and selfish
You  retired my dude you'll be gone in a few weeks  🤣🤣🤣you should worry more about your life
"If Jesus were alive today, his DM's would be full of death threats for supporting a woman's right to choose."
Love Shelley!!! Keep it up!
Those people will be gone in a few weeks 🤣
Crazy....They don't want abortion to happen but will kill someone...how is that ok???
"This is about people who have a small minded bias about a subject they can't understand.  Instead of minding their own business, they push their magic man in the sky who according to the bible supports aborting unborn fetuses.  But they interpret their entitled nature according to what they want to believe and support autocratic invasive theocracy and suppress the privacy and freedom of others.  They are too stupid to realize their wrongs don't do anything but cause harm to others they don't have any business of knowing about or what they are doing.  They are extremists and hide behind their rights to violate others rights.  If there is a god, I don't believe they are going to be happy if they get judgement."
I  have one thing to say to the guy who said he believed abortion was wrong... well don't have one and get your nose out of other peoples business.
"Honestly, I think abortions should be done in either a hospital or outpatient surgery clinic that does other procedures. That way the woman who have abortions and all those involved in the procedure will be safe from violent protesters and judgmental people."
"Did someone that doesn't want you to have a choice really say, ""their right to CHOOSE life"" ?!?!"
Good for you!   A brilliant idea
"All these capable ""good"" hearted people could be fostering or providing care for actual children. That's their hypocrisy. They only care about women paying for ""sin"" even if it's a Man's sin.  I had a crisis in pregnancy and chose a therapeutic abortion,  rather than wait for the baby to die on his own. He was 22 weeks, kicked until the last minute and I got to hold him, have pictures and say goodbye. My alternative was to wait for nature to take it course and have an unpredictable situation which was not going to change the outcome. I'm assuming women in that situation will now have to wait for fetal demise and hope they can get through that without an emergency or having the dead baby removed surgically.. or maybe you start to hemorrhage in the grocery store. That's the problem. You don't know people's stories, or the why. And things can go very wrong, babies can be ""alive"" with non survivable defects, we are now capable of knowing that and asking a women to walk around visibly pregnant waiting for the baby to die is cruel, and barbaric. We arent forcing anyone in any situation to terminate. If you want to carry and give birth to an anecephalic (brainless baby) you can. So don't have an abortion.  But if your weeping over non viable fetuses but not engaging in feeding, housing and caring for the unwanted, abused, neglected and homeless kids we have..you're an asshole telling strangers what's best for them.

"Ask these protesters, how many unwanted babies have you adopted or fostered? I'm sure none. They want to convince you to keep this unwanted baby but are they stepping up to do there part financially, physically and emotionally for the mother or the unwanted baby?"
"My Grandmother would have aborted my father, he went to the children's home at birth!
My mother tried to get rid of me, she tried everything to get rid of me, when I was born, she said she wanted me....... it never felt like she did!
I would still rather be alive!"
"Vote Blue for woman rights to choose, cause Red want them dead."
"Most women have very good reasons for abortions and do not do or take it lightly. Whatever their reasons, it is no one’s business but theirs. I knew when I was younger, I didn’t think I could do it, but I never had to - I never had desperate, medical, or traumatic event around being pregnant. I DO believe woman have to decide for themselves. 

The second part: men, birth control or vasectomy? Accept NO MEANS NO including from your own wife. We had hard days, too. Take responsibility and be accountable for your part in this. I know this may be preaching to the choir. Emotionally Mature men of conscious do not rape, or commit incest, they do not bully women, or demean them. They support and love and care. Emotionally Mature men."

"Notice one of these is an unhealthy woman self focused on filming herself and getting clout from people's pain, the others are people who care and want to help at the core of their intentions.  Just saying......"
Private security paid for by unrestricted donations would be useful at these clinics.
"I once biked to Planned Parenthood to be present for my friend.  As I was locking up my bike, a man came and kneeled beside me, shoving his rosary at my face.  He was violating my space, and his presence was unwanted.  He started lecturing me about life, and I said, ""I bet you ate meat this morning.""  He looked confused.  I think I broke his brain."
Creeps!
11 killed by anti-abortionists!? These pro-lifers continuously contradict themselves. Idiots.
"""so you're, a pro-lifer but would kill a doctor"""
Bible thumpers are a plague
Much love to Shelley!!!  Such an inspiration.  I didn't know you could volunteer to escort women.  Maybe I will do this one day.
We should now change our name to the divided states of fascism...we now have a supreme court who is rendering rulings based on partisanship and their religious views...4 of them lied to get onto the court and it is now apparent in this country that as long as you have power and money then laws do not apply to you..you can be sure that the rich will have all of the medical access to abortion care they need and once again the women who will suffer the most have the least amount of resources and the least amount of influence..I never thought I would see the day that this country would undertake an experiment that was so detrimental to what we claim we are as a nation..this court will continue to strip rights from people based on their own held beliefs and interpretation of the bible and if the court is not expanded and the filibuster removed..we will be back to 1940 by next year..
"These people don't care about health care or the quality of life for babies after they're born.  Nor do they care about the women.  They probably ate a big breakfast full of animals, to boot.  *They don't care about life; they care about sanctimony.*"
"Life begins at the egg and at the sperm. All male anti-Choice protesters produce sperm and all female anti-Choice protesters produce eggs, but all protesting women and men abort those innocent lives so they will burn in the fires of Hell forever, no respite, no relief, in pain forever."
Isn't it odd that the only people who want abortions legal are the people who *weren't* aborted themselves?
This woman is so courageous and amazing.
"Too bad Christo-fascist ""god"" doesn't care about the animals he created who are suffering in factory farms, zoos, and slaughterhouses."
Shelley is great. What a hero for women’s rights.
Why don't they visit a factory farm or slaughterhouse if they're so pro-life.
The fact abortion clinics even HAVE escorts is bullshit. This would mean that some people are so insane about this that it's been decided it could be dangerous for the ex-mother which is retarded
"Could they just blast heavy metal , rap, or something to drown these jerks out"
So “pro life” but so strongly pro gun. Is life really sacred? Apparently not 😂
"I don't understand how it's allowable for these protests outside of clinics. Protest the decisions of your elected officials directly, but harassing people who are exercising their right to get health care should not be permitted. It would be like people who oppose income tax interfering with people entering the IRS buildings or state tax & revenue offices."
I remember these people. I was going into Planned Parenthood for cervical cancer screening. They yell at you without knowing much about your situation.
"KJV Mathew 2:16  Herod had all the Children under 2 Years of age killed, But GOD only warned to save Jesus!!! God is in Control of Life and death!!!! WE all Pass at a Young age or at an Old age!! Sad women have to make this choice!!!"

Why is it more people are encouraged to rescue a dog from a shelter instead of a breeder. 

See If I was her , i would find out where they live and organised a protest outside their homes  maybe po outside their chievhy"

Thank god these are old they’ll soon die
WHY NOT GO HELP ACTUAL KIDS THAT ARE ALIVE AND PRESENT ON THIS EARTH. The spend all this time harassing people and wasting their time if they actually cared about kids they would spend this time with all the kids in foster care.
Old men…. Figures

Have to pray for everyone with Love even when the anger comes from stopping murder… All murder is horrible not just for the ones who can or could defend themselves (out of the womb)🙏🏽
You ladies are superhumans 💪🏽
"The idea that you can’t decide for yourself whether to keep or abort a pregnancy ( not an actual human being ) is just mind boggling 🤦🏻‍♂️
Also that it is not your own business !"
what type of f****** ghoul kills an innocent human life because they had irresponsible sex. what kind of f****** ghoul even believes they have the right to do this. there is still hope for you. we have a loving and forgiving God turn away from this lifestyle. it is a lifestyle of mental illness and suicide.
"Martyrs of abortion, God has heard your cries. God shall avenge your blood."
Men have no say as to what a woman does with her body. Hell no one has a say on what you choose to do with your own body men or women.
"They should go protest for better sex education for both man and woman so we avoid unplanned pregnancies. Also go pretest for a better Forster care system, there are children suffering atrocities because the system fails them everyday."
"I'd like to say that you don't have to be pro abortion to support these women....I am pro life but I am also pro you doing what the hell you want with you body as long as it doesn't affect me or my family🤷
And someone who is raising the Christian church I don't understand Christians they don't practice any of the s*** in the Bible like I already stated it's just a sad situation all around these women need a safe place to have this done if they're going to do it cuz it's their choice well I would never be okay with my wife doing it unless it would kill her to have the baby or the baby would die it needs to be done in the Safeway so that like this doctor said women don't lose the ability to reproduce you should be able to have a baby on your own terms at your own time and unfortunately as a man I have experience with failed contraceptive my wife was on contraceptives when she got pregnant with our fourth child"
let me get this straight. These so called  anti abortion terrorist are willing to kill 11 human beings all in the name of protecting a fetus that has nothing to do with them??? Stupidity has no definition.
Be that compassionate about the Word of God.
Why is it always people who are claiming they have a religious authority in a religious right to be there the most rude aggressive and violent of the bunch why don't you practice the f****** preachings that you'll try to preach cuz I know being forced into church as a child the Bible is all about forgiveness turning other cheek being peaceful and loving people like you love yourself so what the f*** is wrong with you Christians
"I was at planned parenthood to help me with excessive bleeding. Newport Beach, Ca anti abortionist threw bibles at me hit friend n nose made her nose bleed, cops did nothing?"
I just do not understand how there are so many independently wealthy people to literally make harassing people their unpaid job while so many of us are struggling to feed ourselves everyday.  These people must have loads of cash.
Creepy af!!!
It's almost as if Condom don't exist
And adoption doesn't work most adopted kids go in and they are either sexually abused and then they have children that they have to deal with that came from an abusive parent that fuck them and had sexual intercourse with them trust me I've seen several of my friends that have been put in the Foster system get raped by their own foster parents disgusting you guys are and you know who I'm talking about too
Abortion should be accessible to women I am a God loving man / woman and if something is inside our bodies that is toxifying US does it matter if it's a living being it should be removed immediately if it's causing harm to the body and if it's causing harm to the mind is well God has said that in the Bible that we hand the choice to do so and you Christians calling yourself Christians now what a shameful act of disrespect to God's creation God will punish the masses that follow the masses which you God following followers that follow churches are the masses which you will be punished for your own self pride shall be judged and if you're wondering if I'm 8 non-Christian now I went to a Baptist you guys have no idea how hard it is I'm also integrated with more than 100 different types of religions so I know what God wants and I know what God doesn't want you guys that stop the abortion process causes us harm to our bodies I hope you know that if you guys continue this and down the road especially you Republicans that are following q you guys will learn your lesson soon enough and Donald Trump you need to get out because your lawyers right we're coming for you don't forget about what they said in the Bible about the Meeks we will return just because we've been watching you fools and you sadist calling us sadist which is nasty and itself because I will give my life freely to God unlike you guys won't lay your lives down for the real God you will lay your lives down for the petty the silverishly foolishness of a governmental party like the Republicans this is a Democratic Republic it is both a Republican and a democratic system it is both for the people by the people with the help of industry
And they should worry about the babies after they are born🙄
Dont these protestors have jobs? I mean really ? Gosh Are they that bored? Ffs..
I would ask them ask them is they march for black life matter
"I bet they are all child molesters, or something vile"
These fairly tale worshippers aren’t  making sure orphanages are empty though huh?….telling.
"I had an abortion procedure at 17 years old. I choose to terminate because my ex was abusive to me, and the abuse only escalated when I was pregnant. It was a very difficult decision, especially for me who LOVED children and babies, but I felt that was my only way to survive that abusive relationship and also a potential child. My ex became addicted to drugs, and he was physically and emotionally abusive. Whenever I tried to leave him, he stalked me. I was literally stuck with him, until I broke free and terminated. I wasn’t old enough to have an abortion without my parents consent, so I tried to poison myself first hoping I’d have a miscarriage, which only caused me to become very sick. I would’ve killed myself trying to terminate the baby from my abusive ex."
"So sick of these fairy tale worshipping little children getting to rule others lives….
These are terrorists and they should treated as such. Stand your ground and fear for your life…end these anti choice terrorists threats."
They’re literally called The Deathscorts.
These people need to get a life.
The doctor who still does third trimester abortion said he prays? to whom? maybe the devil.  Second trimester is clearly unimaginable horror not to mention third. The whole thing is clearly evil.
"If you want to understand something about creation, never listen to religions !!!!"
Yea it’s crazy to think people feel this passionately about abortions but not about addressing the issues that would lead someone to make this decision. Like people literally cannot afford to have a child and the foster care system is an absolute mess
"I can kind of see the point of view of the anti abortion people. 

They truly believe that the fetus is a precious baby (and they're right). Their heart seems to be in the right place. 


Problem is it's too much to ask to force a mother to carry a baby."
"help reinstate roe v wade
impregnate a christian republican today"
"Lets get real here, there is no justification for ending a baby's life. All I hear people saying to justify abortion is, ""The foster care homes are horrible"" or "" the babies should be aborted because they'll grow up in poverty"". The truth is, it is usually young women having abortions because they think a baby will interfere with their dreams of going to college or becoming an actress and model. Young girls live in a fantasy at that age, and have almost a zero chance of ever becoming famous. As for the foster care thing, being in foster care is alot better than being murdered. Growing up in poverty is also better than being murdered. How would you feel if someone killed you because they said they wanted to prevent you from living in poverty?  My grandmother grew up dirt poor in Oklahoma during the great depression and dust bowl, and said those were the happiest days of her life. Money is not everything and this is not Ethiopia where babies will starve to death with flies swarming their mouths."
"Most of the protesters cannot get pregnant, they need to leave these women alone."
"0:48 ""I'm gone get me a ladder, climb to the top and shout at people until they see the world exactly how I do"""
"When a fetus has a heart 💓 , it becomes a child. Nobody has the right to kill a child. Listen to the science. Listen to the law."
Pro choice works both ways.  They need to remember that.  It means you can have a child or not.
She is a hero......I ve never thought or imagined that in the United States the situation of abortion clinics are those and that women doctors and people working in the clinics risk their lives everyday......it is crazy ....I m shocked
"Republicans just want total government control over all our lives.  And when that same government comes for their guns, the right wingers will give them up without a fight, because they trust anything Big Government tells them."
Being OBSESSED with what is INSIDE a woman's PRIVATE BODY is SICK. They're NEVER going to STOP women from WANTING an abortion. Do these people take care of CHILDREN? Or just waste time being a PEST?
"They're fighting a losing battle.
God ain't gonna ask you about OTHER peoples sins. These people are meddlesome and obnoxious and are DELUSIONAL by judging as if they're God"
V interesting doc
Only in America does the religious nutcases and religious violent extremists stalk abortion clinics
"Thank you sooo much. Thanks to Dr Bill Baird, who gave me my first IUD. He helped me through my first exams. He gave me respect and fought for reproductive rights. 
RIP Dr Baird 😢"
"Thank you to all the escorts, nurses, and doctors for being there for women! Your bravery and service is important work and appreciated.  You are saving lives.  We won’t go back."
I guess they think god can’t fight his own battles.  So impotent.
Friggin psychos.  Mind your own body ffs.
These harassers should be filmed and heckled back.

A brave lady.  Bless her for the work she does.
Laws in Australia ban these types from harrassing women  outside clinics
"These loons are pro-birth, not pro-life. Just think if they took all this time and energy to help all the kids in foster care,etc."
Both sides have mentally deranged individuals. Look at the Jan 6 committee if you don’t believe me. Cheers!
They've been groomed for decades to act this way. They're useful idiots.
All this can be avoided by using a rubber
"when you have women dying from unhealthy fetuses it's a f****** problem okay ... when the woman's life is at risk and the fetus probably will not grow properly, or live to be discharged from the hospital after Labor and delivery, an abortion is very much necessary... people don't think of these things, all they know is  irresponsible women get pregnant, and want to terminate the pregnancy, but that is not the case all the time!! this is a very sad world we live in no consideration at all!! I'm with abortion if it's going to risk a  life!!!"
"Take them up on their ""help"".  Get them to pay for all the expenses of the pregnancies, and then they can adopts the babies, and do all the work of being the parent.  They'll each have 28 kids in a month, and they'll be way too busy to protest anywhere."
Bless you brave volunteers
you go shelly! keep doing it sister!
More proof that this issue is far from over
I wish I could thank that doctor for saving women’s lives.
Religious nutters

"Anyone who doesn't know the pain and hardship of being an unwanted child should really not wish that on anyone. The people who are crowing over this ""win"" are getting a hard-on for human suffering.

“All I really care about is the women and the children and their right to choose life” 😂 😂 😂 😂
Jesus went to modern churches and preached hell fire to CHURCH LEADERS like false prophets. Not this
That doctor looks good for 80. It's too bad he can't retire cuz his job is so risky
Save a life then murder 10 all in the name of god
God killed lots of 👶 look it up
Ever notice it's almost mostly men who are outside. What the fck do they know about women's reproductive organs . They those creepy men tend to look like pervs.
"I saw one protester, covered in tattoos, with a sign mentioning God calling out to save the lives of babies. I wondered whether he'd ever read the bible, especially the parts that says that one should not decorate their bodies or the part that states that life begins with the first breath."
creepy ass old white men🤢.
"""We'll help you"" they say as they continue to vote for the same GOP politicians that refuse to pass bills for assistances including food stamps, day care , minimum wage increases, affordable health care, affordable housing, etc!!! Yes, they want women to stay pregnant, have the baby and bring it up in utter poverty. G D hypocrites. It makes my blood boil!"
"She's actually interfering with those people's right to protest. 

People always claim they believe in freedom of speech........until someone says something they don't agree with. Left or Right, Conservative or Liberal, it's always the same."
Since 1977 11 people have been killed in anti abortion attacks...how is that pro life?
"""An invisible man in the sky told me to come harrass women"". Okaaaay crazypants."
I find it cruel that these pro lifers say they want life but when the mother is endanger of dying from carrying or giving birth there is no sympathy. How is that pro life?
Third trimester...that's 29 to 40 weeks. Did anyone hear what he said
Shelly Mann is a true hero. She is ensuring that women's rights aren't stomped on by those protesters; Funny how their rights seem to outweigh the rights of everybody else.  *Those protesters who claim it is their right to stand out and yell at women trying to access healthcare are doing nothing but trying to suppress the rights of others.  A $50 fine and unsupervised probation is a RIDICULOUS punishment for someone who is trying to take away or suppress the rights of another individual.*
Why are old men putting themselves in other peoples business?
"Funny how all these people who act like they care so much for fetuses actually care so little for the rights or feelings of anyone else. These guys defend ""their right to stand out and yell at people"" but they have not one peep about the right of those women to access healthcare. It is awful to have to walk through a bunch of yelling people to get into a clinic; I had to do it to get my birth control pills (the people yelling didn't know or care why I was there) they yelled ugly things at me and shoved gory pictures in front of my face as I walked into the clinic. They literally tried to terrorize me into not going into the clinic, all it did was make me mad and more determined to go in and get my pills (they were $10 at the clinic pharmacy, $28 at a retail pharmacy). Those people yelling could care less that I was there to try to save $18 on a month of pills, they were there to yell at and upset women; Somehow that is their ""right"". Sick puppies one and all!"
Dan needs to go back to work and then return to pass out his paychecks - MONEY 💵 COLD HARD CASH to the women he’s yelling at. Dan you did it backwards dude! Go back to work!!!
There not one state that prohibits abortion if   mother in danger of death/injury  rape or incest or miscarry killing a innocent makes no logical sense I don't get it and if we're going to practice that ideology then we need to have a serious discussion of getting rid of child support 50/50 marriage and paying alimony because cutting ties with a baby momma and children will save and improve male lives physically and emotionally?
"When you meet your maker, Joe, God better have mercy on what you did with YOUR life, YOUR dick, Your Mouth, ect. Mind the speck in your own eye!"
"I love it, notice most protestors are men 🙄🤦‍♀️ once they become pregnant, handle the 9 months, give birth and then they can say something… I still will never understand why these people are violent.. but pro-life protesters rarely become violent.. actually I can’t remember when one has happened"
BABY KILLERS!!!
What the hell is he talking about nobody is telling him what to do with his body
"again, they are not pro-life. they are pro birth and also pro death but they tend to be to stupid to see that."
"Why are these idiots not arrested. It is illegal to protest a medical facility.. arrest these idiots, a fetus is not a living being"
Freedom of religion means freedom from religion.  If you don't like abortion  don't get one. Such moronic people 🤦🏾‍♂️
The amount of demon possessed people who love killing babies in these comments is staggering
Want to help? Take the little bastard.
"Why are the protestors trying to force women to carry to term are so old that they wouldn’t be able to take care of a child? What’s is this, Grandparent fever?
Also stop pushing your religion on others."
It  amazing when you see the size of their protesters compared to the size of the pro-choice protesters.......... But yet somehow the few get to run this country on the many do not.
"why protesters have to be so rude? Yelling at women like that, shame on them, freedom of religion should be re-inforce, but we have to remember that country is not the land of the free."
Go back to your f'ing church and leave people out of your crazy. No floating man in the sky decided that your here to harass people in a bad place. Nuts.
"These so called pro life protesters are ignorant, misguided, judgemental, who have no right to try and impose their will on others. Individuals who for whatever reason, but especially the victims of rape, incest or child abuse have the inalienable right to reproductive healthcare. It’s especially egregious in my mind when individuals and groups think their religious beliefs take precedence over another person’s life. I feel that’s the definition of religious extremism, bigotry and hypocrisy especially when they put their own narrow interpretations on scriptures that seldom if at all make references to birth control."
These old fart men n women have no right telling any women what to do with their body.
"This woman is a hero. These sanctimonious ""pro-lifers"" are nauseating."
I'm starting my own cult. It's so easy to con the galactically ignorant among us.
Religion is the scourge on this earth.
All of you people protesting should be asking why the democrat party hasn’t turned Row into law for over 50+ years? Answer: They don’t care😂😂😂
"2:33 Your ""Good Lord"" has no mercy. Have you not read the Bible?"
Why is it everybody who is against abortion is somebody who should of been aborted? I dare any anti abortionist to prove me wrong.
They aren’t there to help. They just want to spew religious nonsense.
We need to start counterprotesting these protesters. Escorts have to stay professional. The rest of us don't.
"""I hope he has a lot of mercy."" Yeah, you're gonna need it, bro."
Thank you for your work
So abortion is killing but the anti-abortionist’s shoot up the place and kill people and take lives . Ironic?
The most unfuckable women are protesting from both sides.
A pro lifer commits murder. If that’s not hypocritical I don’t know what is. These people are so small minded and arrogant to their own personal views.
Not all heros wear capes
Not all heros wear capes
Those protestors need to get a life.  Go mind your own business.
They keep preaching god but god also stated it is a sin to Judge but they don’t comprehend that !!!!
"Hey, idiots. You don't have to be a crazy Christian to disagree with you. Abortion isn't ""ok"", at best it's the only option that makes sense, and that ain't how it is usually"
"Pro-life side also seems pro-shooting and pro-fire bombing when they don’t get their way.

Wish the media would stop portraying this issue as if both sides had equally valid rationale."
Not one of those antis own a uterus!
"Bless you,Shelly.
Brave American hero."
The scariest thing is that those imbeciles  so truly believe that they have the right to tell others how to live their lives. I wonder how they’d feel if we followed them to their doctors and and “objected” and screamed abuse at them for whatever procedure they were having. Believing in the invisible magical guy who lives in the sky is more important than living humans is being just bizarre. Ignorant Taliban America.
The street protesters are no different then the SCOTUS on the bench with their twisted ideologies.
"Horrible people who care nothing and know nothing about these women.  They are not ""pro life"", they are Pro Foetus at the cost of the life and well being of women.  These pests have no right to torment medical people or the people having a procedure."
"America is totally messed up. 
The ones who want gun control, wants to kill babies. The ones who say life is sacred, are also saying guns are good. 
No wonder Russia is not afraid of America and China will soon lead the world."
These pro lifers are sick.

"It's easy for men to sit there and say what's wrong or right they don't have to go through any of the sickness, pain or they don't care for any of those kids. Where are they when these kids by that mother that shouldn't had kids from the start,where where they when a 3 yr old was found dead in the freezer didn't see them speaking out . My body and f#ck your thoughts, opinions and I'm gonna do what I want for me and my body period 😌"
Literally old white men and Karen's.
"I have a very difficult time with anti-abortionists faulty logic!!! What makes ANYONE think they have a RIGHT to tell ANYONE what they can and can’t do with their bodies…. Yet the same individuals that  protest against abortion also  
protest against public assistance!!!
When someone doesn’t want to have a baby that’s their choice whether you like it or not or anyone else likes it or not!! I have five kids I wouldn’t have an abortion myself but at the same time I’m not comfortable telling another woman that she can’t! Do you know why? Because it’s none of my fucking business!! Too many people make other peoples business their own and that’s the problem with morality!!"
Those people are the Taliban in America. It  was created by the GOP and extremist religious and it has the support ofThe Supreme Court.
"“The right to choose life”. Woman, that is what they are doing, they are choosing their life. No one goes to an abortion clinic just because."
"We know they're all hypocrites because they're not protesting outside of gun manufacturers and NRA offices, especially now that guns are the number one killer of children from birth to 18 in America.  Not to mention the fact that nearly all of the States that are the most anti-choice are also ranked at the bottom for healthy outcomes for children and families.  It's not about abortion, it's about control.  It's not about children, it's about limiting agency for women.  It's not about children, it's about imposing their religion on others."
Infant mortality rate is a joke in the USA. Maybe fix that is they are so pro life!
"Great job Shelly dealing with these right wing religious nut cases. These people are right wing Hippocrates who whine about a woman's choice for her own body but they won't support childcare, healthcare, funding for schools, time off for parents, or gun control which kills living children every day. They are disgusting brainwashed bullies"
"May Baphomet protect those seeking passage, for Satan is responsible for the responsible."
Why this men name “Dan” or all those protesters against abortion that are so worry about live of kids go feed and provide for kids without parents if they are so worried about .
Someone needs to take sign up vouchers to these places and see how many of the pro choicers are willing to help financially with the upbringing of the children they say they are saving.
They got nothing better to do but go out and harass people.  They don't care about babies.  They're just trying to make their own miserable pathetic existence mean something.  But all jokes aside these people may seem harmless but they demonstrate the underlying threat organized religion presents to liberty.  These people think they have a right to dictate how other people live and historically this belief system is what led to religious institutions literally murdering people in the most horrific ways imaginable.  That is precisely why the founders of the US drafted the US constitution with a separation of church and state.
You get messages but your broadcasting yourself to the masses
"It’s crazy how she’s taking her 15 bucks a hour job, she’s literally trying make money off tik Tok off all this."
"U lost me at the “3rd trimester abortion”
I will NEVER agree with that"
Kudos to Shelley.
Great work Shelly!
The irony runs deep here
"There majority of people against abortion are good people and good critical thinkers, but there are some pro-lifers that take it to far. The world is not a perfect place and it will never will be. That does not mean we should sit with our arms crossed and not try to help these women, every life is important"
Someone should ask Dan and the rest of the protesters how many children they have taken in or adopted. Also ask him if he has taken in any single moms and supported them and their children.
Why don’t these protesters protest outside of prison for against the death penalty?
Thank you for your work.  Please stay safe.
"those crazy people needs a job,  glad i am living in the Netherlands"
When he meet his maker He is going to ask him why did he waisted his life protesting instead of actually helping others.
How about telling all the women and girls to stop opening their hairy legs and having sex without protection? There are consequences of your actions.
Pro life people : let me save that fetus or I threaten your life with violence and death. Very pro life. You can really feel they care for every living being on this earth. Very deep Christian values
To be proliferated and threaten people with violence and death is nonsensical
"Women need real sex education again. We can only get pregnant during ovulation and that's when we in intense sexual heat also.. We ovulate only a few days per month or prior to menses. Women need to get their reproductive system examined/tested to know if they have healthy functioning uteruses/overies thats functioning properly. White women does it when they WANT to have kids. It's more to it than a PAP SMEAR. When u know your OVULATION CYCLE u know when u can get pregnant and when u don't want to get pregnant and teach our men partners of how we operate in NATURE beyond their ego needs.  ♥️ Time to go back to  NATURE NATURAL ORDER AND LAW for righteousness... not government abortion programs LAWLESS DISORDER for wicked agendas. It's time for women to say ""NO IM NOT HAVING SEX NOW BECUS IM OVULATING"" instead of saying ""IM GETTING AN ABORTION"" and accept responsibility and be a grown woman about their decision when they change their mind too late.♥️now rape and incest is indifferent and a personal spiritual choice bcus great things also birth through chaos. Point is...STOP DEPENDING ON GOVERNMENT to enforce your divine right and KNOW THYSELF! to be your own government in NATURAL ORDER IN YOU. POWER IS WITHIN LIKE OVULATION MONITORING!"
"How many of the pro-life people have adopted a child from foster care, or even been a foster parent?  How many have fought for M4A?  How many have tried to educate others on contraceptive and abstinence. Now how many just go out and push their own ideas and beliefs on others when in reality it does not affect their lives any which way if a woman unknown to them has an abortion.  Its about power and control anynway you slice it.  I am an atheist and never have i had the desire to protest at a church or temple, it does not affect my life when someone i do not know goes to a church to pray or have service.  You say its murder?  Well what about the wars waged in the name of a god, both sides usually think god is on their side.   Words and empathy will get you farther than violence in most cases."
Thank God for the people who escort those women. Those protesters are violent criminals.
The good lord is ashamed of the way you treat women.
"This is a baby trafficking money making scheme for the Christian Right. Amy Comey Barrett says she wants a supply chain of babies for *religious organizations.*
Betsy Devos charges 50K per immigrant baby. I wonder how much a white baby will fetch? Christian church makes money and fills declining churches."
We are going to turn into a 3rd world country fast!! Look at red states. They take the highest amount from the government and give the least.
Libs of TikTok is so much better...lol
Such holy people 😳 as if they care for  somebody else baby...
"White neighborhood = fertility clinic
Black neighborhood = abortion clinic"
"The majority of people that get abortions are rich white women, they even have their own office hours.

Idc about the abortion thing, that's clearly about the fact white people are going extinct. 

White women's pathology makes them do this, it stems from having so many rights and having being a protected class for so long, now they want to pretend they are upset about being oppressed when in reality it's the fact they are learning about their actual minority status globally/ a resentment of their cut for their participation in white supremacy."
"I have issue with 3rd trimester abortion. 
These are babies who can survive  outside the mother.
If you're getting a 3rd trimester abortion you've waited way too long."
These people have escaped from a mental institution called church!
So he's protesting for his own future salvation? Wow...these people are nuts.
"These are the same people that tell colored children at the border ""America is full we can't help you"""
"Guilt!! The guy is right.....you have to feel guilty for...well, just about everything.....that's what give them the control over you. The world is crap?....It's YOUR fault, so get down on your knees and do whatever we want you to do......it's God's will and only we know what that is."
"It is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live as you wish.

-Saint Mother Theresa"
All these cultists with their imaginary friend as an excuse. 🖕Christian Taliban
I guess this is way most people need to have a job...just so they don't harass others.
The is a difference between peaceful protest and verbal  harassment .
"Dan, you’re a hero. Keep it up!"
How ironic that Dan mentioned God’s mercy?
https://youtu.be/VAvFfrYA2LM
I thought it was just RICH White men that wanted they’re hands in americas wombs.
"Isn't it funny how it's so easy to threaten an adult's life like they weren't children at one point, too🤦🏾‍♀️"
"Protesting is one thing, but this is just harassment."
"There should be an exclusion zone of 500ft for voicing or holding protest and laws to criminalise serial harassment by individuals or groups against people seeking medical care, whatever it is. Personal medical care is private, personal and confidential. Unwanted, unsolicited intervention by third parties is not a right, it’s an assault and should be treated as such, pure and simple."
Has anyone changed their minds because of these people?
"Religionists make me sick.  Republicans/conservatives (and the like) MUST be voted OUT of all levels of government and society immediately!  Every state, everywhere.  The Garbage-Obsolete-Party policy positions are irrelevant and useless to humanity in the 21st century.  There will be no R’s checked off on my ballot!  You do the same.  There is no right on the right; it is anti-science, anti-education, anti-reality and on the wrong side of history.  In evident-reality, religion is psychologically/culturally toxic fiction that needs to go away immediately - particularly the tribal wargod of abraham.  Religion is bs.  No more tail wagging the dog!
Lastly, if you don’t menstruate 🩸YOU don’t get to oppose a woman’s right to an abortion. YOU get to shut-piehole and get out of the way.  Keep your misogynistic/religious hatefulness to yourselves.  Life begins when a female decides to allow the fetus to proceed; if at ANY time during the process she decides she no longer wants it (for any reason) ‘it’ doesn’t begin!  Period.  A woman will NOT be forced to host an organism against her will.  
*Religion is NO solution for the requirements of humanity in the 21st century."
Repeats ?
"America, I just don’t get it. Why do you care so much about things that doesn’t involve you and isn’t any of your business?"
"I was one of these women accosted in 1998 in Madison, WI while walking into Meriter Hospital on West Washington Ave.  (See story link below) I was 17, nearly 18 and I won't get into specifics of my circumstance as it is a very private matter, and now that I am nearly 41 now, the way I was treated by these ""pro-life"" jerks still haunts me to this day.

I am furthermore re-traumatized now with ROE V WADE being overturned, and is now ILLEGAL to obtain an abortion, for any reason, including RAPE & incest because the POS SCOTUS chose for me and all women, based on a law from 1849.  YES, 1849.  I want to throw up! 

 I  am now a  mother of 3, I first became mother in 2003, because I CHOSE to be a mother, and the act of her, and her siblings conception was CONSENTUAL!!!  It sickens me that my girls, if they become impregnated, whether by force or not, or simply because they are not ready to have a baby for whatever reason CANNOT LEGALLY have an abortion, they in turn will have to travel to MN, OR IL to obtain one.

Mind your own fucking business, because you don't know what these women's stories are, and believe you me, it is an excruciating decision to make, it is heart breaking, and for these assholes to try and make women feel guilty is abhorrent!
 
This woman, a crusader, and a protector of women seeking abortion is a super hero!

What a screwed up country
"why the pilgrims came to America in the first place. the church was telling them what to do. the only way to be a republican is to not understand history. also the church loved abortion and referred to it a lot in America in around the birth of our nation, they loved them to fight against, no joke, demonic spawns, and their trained midwives did them all the time. it wasn't until a man named Horatio Storer convinced the nation after noticing white protestant birth rates were committing race suicide, in the 1850s, so he fought to make abortion illegal on the grounds of Eugenics, and saving the white race. Then you had the life long racist democrats from the south who voted dem because they thought they fought for the little guy, Ronald Regan saw that, and noticed the relation of abortion issues and the south wanting to preserve white nationalism, he pushed the GOP to appeal to that, the moral majority at the same time was making a lot of noise so he thought it appropriate to grab their votes with the abortion stance. not the constitution, not the founding fathers who loved abortions, not doctors. The GOP and white supremacist."
"In the now immortal words of the late George Carlin, rights aren't rights if someone can take them away they're temporary privileges."
Thank you Shelly!🙏
Why is it the asshole that want abortion rights is always that typical idiot? Or some bearded trans. smh
"As ""creepy"" as these anti-abortion people appear to be it's even more creepy for people to support murdering babies."
"Now that guns are legal and abortions are illegal, right wingers have to find new causes to continue their grifting."
There should be no abortion unless it’s due to rape or health reasons.
"People who invoke the name of Jesus or Allah or whatever, far more often than not, are up to doing some pretty disgusting things."
"I CAN NOT understand these anti abortion protesters who have so much time and money to travel all over. Why aren't they home taking care of the unwanted children they've adopted? Their time could be better spent protesting the horrible foster care systems or doing SOMETHING for all of the homeless children, better Healthcare for the children that are already here instead of wasting their time on wanting more kids. I just don't get it 🤯🤯🤯"
Some people have 2 much time on their hands.
"These people are sick, let women make decisions for themselves"
"They are beter than GOD,now the think they are GOD on earth !!!!!!"
"Joe, let's babysit! All these others, let babysit for the children you SAVE! LET'S DO THIS!"
I wish I lived there I would counter protest and support the woman walking in
This woman is doing god's work.
"People, stop trying to convince these anti-abortion folks that they’re wrong. You are wasting your breath, energy, time, and sanity. I doubt even .001% change their minds no matter how many well-articulated logical arguments are presented to them. 

Do you know why? The guy in this video tells you clearly: fear of god. These people believe if they don’t advocate for “right to life” and to “end the murder” then they will literally burn in hell for eternity. I mean think about this. If you genuinely held those beliefs - and they DO - wouldn’t you do anything and everything to stop that from happening? Do you see how pointless it is to continue arguing with these people? 

Save your energy and breath for a very real path towards legalizing abortion. And no, that’s not to try to change SCOTUS. Those judges are exactly what I just described but on steroids, because they will be praised every day for the rest of their lives for “saving the babies” and those narcissistic sycophants are eating this up! 

So where is your energy most likely to yield actual results? The November 2020 elections coming up! Remember the push in November 2020? Well, we need that but tenfold! We MUST take over every state, every house, every office that we can! And by a wide margin, because you know, Manchin and Sinema. 🙄 

Let’s do this! When we win, we can just ignore the far right for a little while and heal from the madness. But only for a little while, because you know, Trump. 🙄"
I love her so much. They should give these women headphones.
"Shelley Mann is alive...does she know that she is alive and doing this because her mother allowed her to live?
And CNN is helping her vileness!!!
I pray no doctor is found as replacement and the clinic closes."
"""Judge not, that ye be not judged"" is way beyond these psychos. I wish I could be there when they meet their maker."
Bless you Shelly! And everyone who does the work like you. These protesters have absolutely no compassion or empathy. You have no idea what situation is women are in when they are going into this clinic. Many of them have babies who are not viable and they need to have the procedure in order to save their life and protect their health. It’s beyond shameful watching people who claim to do the work of God behaving this way
Something tells me that most pro choice activists will never have the opportunity to have an abortion
It’s NEVER BEEN ANTI ABORTION. Always known as pro life.
"I am finding it very interesting that all these protesters are so passionate about saving a fetus, then they go home and literally eat another females' children and drink milk intended for baby calves.  Dairy cows are repeatedly forcibly impregnated and their babies taken away from them almost immediately.  I have seen videos of mother cows who are still cleaning their baby - that they carried for 9 months - get their baby taken from them and thrown into a truck or other vehicle.  The cows, with udders heavy and dripping milk for their baby, will run after their baby but will never see them again, because humans want their milk for themselves, for cheese and ice cream.  Male calves are useless to the dairy industry, so they are either shot or bludgeoned to death, or raised for 4 months and sold as veal.  Female calves will end up enduring the same fate as their moms.  It is truly heartbreaking.
  So these protesters are absolute hypocrites unless they are vegan."
Religious nuts encouraging and enraging maniacs surely should be against the law?
"Yeah Dan, lets increase the consanguinity of the gene pool. After all, Deuteronomy 25:11 and 25:12 right ? Or was it Deuteronomy 25:5 I cant recall. Please, do enlighten me."
Religious nut jobs! Zygotes are NOT unborn children! These people have no idea what the sanctity of life ACTUALLY mean. I wonder what percentage of them have had the courage to adopt a child!
"They could open up a low-cost daycare centre, if they love children so much.
They could run a free breakfast program, if they love children so much.
They could offer low-cost housing to families, if they love children so much.
They could fundraise to provide regular nutritious food baskets, if they love children so much.
But they don't do ANYthing that would actually help children, because they don't give a single shit about anyone but themselves."
Bless this woman! Great work!
Those protesters are such awful humans. These escorts are heroes.
It should be legal to punch these cowards in the face until they forever sleep
"""The unborn are an easy group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated,
unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor;
they don't resent your condescension, or complain that you are not politically correct; 
unlike widows, they don't ask you to question the patriarchy; 
unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; 
unlike aliens, they don't bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; 
they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; 
and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. 

You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, 
or privilege, without reimagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone.

They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim to love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. 
Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn."" 

Methodist Pastor David Barnhart"
As a Democratic Indian🇮🇳 we support women rights and right to abortion laws.
IMO these religious nuts should be trespassed and pepper sprayed and arrested if they refuse to leave.  I'm not a legal expert but I'm sure that harassing people who need a medical procedure done violates some law and shouldn't be tolerated like this.
all of those Christian evangelists are as extreme religious fanatics as Isis or Alqueda... their Pastors have contaminated their soul...they create violence and even kill in the name of GOD... God must be ashamed of all of them
What’s really crazy is those who feel they have a right to tell you how to live your life according to their belief system…that’s a true sickness but is the world of religious fanaticism…🧐
I thought third trimester abortions were illegal
Women have the right to choose believe me they can do it.
"Well, you won't have to creep out on front of these centers anymore...... cause now THEY CLOSED!!! 🤣🤣🤣"
Using their logic.......if they believe life starts at conception.........God is the biggest mass murderer in history..... 10-15 % of pregnancies end up in miscarriage
"""Since 1977 at least ELEVEN people have been killed in anti abortion attacks.""

Let's do some math, 60-70 million people killed by abortion since 1973 minus 11 equals about 60-70 million more killings by abortion supporters.

Lol, abortion supporters are so stupid, do they even listen to themselves?"
She’s an Angel.
usa is crazy
These anti-abortion people are just frustrated with themselves and want to get rid of their guilt by passing out their self-righteousness to others.
People should never judge women I mean I had three and these people are sick asf I mean get a fucking life
"NIKKALYN.....nope. no one NEEDS  an abortion!! Overwhelming  majority are selfish, lazy, irresponsible,  immoral, childish, entitled  twisted deadbeats!!

If you are ready to have sex. And proceed with it....then handle the possible  outcomes of it.

-Abstinence 
-Condoms and /or MANY contraceptives.

"I asked a man that was yelling terrible things outside of an abortion clinic why he thought that would help. He said ""how would you feel if I killed your child."" My child was 4 years old."
Okay I'm just going to say it let's just address the elephant in the room the only reason why pro-life is such a big thing it's because the white population is dwindling that's why these anti-abortions are mainly happening in predominantly white States this is a last-ditch attempt to up the white population in the United States
"11 staff and 63,000.000 precious little babies were murdered. This is hellish..."
Why don’t these old white guys get outraged at weapons manufacturers?  They clearly don’t care what their products do.
How many babies have been killed since 1977….. Millions. Compared to 11.
This physician is a rare breed that kills babies in the third trimester. Truly a sicko. Yet CNN portrays him as a hero in this video. Absolutely disgusting.
"God endorses abortion and gives instructions on how to preform it in Numbers. The Bible also states that life begins after the fist breath is taken and that happens after birth. And the Bible also gives less worth to a fetus than a person. No where does the Bible prohibit, denounce or condemn abortion. Read your Bible and stop adding things that don’t exist."
"How do ppl go from ""mom, keep your baby...we'll help you (really with nothing more than prayers because let's be honest those ppl ain't out here helping these women with longterm resources) - to ""let's just kill the women, the physicians, and possibly someone near the building that was just wrong place/wrong time""?"
So sickening!!!! People have serious mental issues! STOP KILLING BABIES🗣
"To quote former Catholic George Carlin"" They are not PRO-LIFE ,they are ANT- WOMEN""!"
"""If men could become pregnant, abortion would be a Sacrament""!"
"I’d love to see these People give up their time to support abandoned unwanted children. Honestly,its so easy to object to something you have no idea what these women are going through. Dan the clinic protester. Go and adopt children left behind. Howard stern said “If men could give birth you’d find abortion clinics on every street” women will suffer big time and thats b4 we even mention the children feeling unwanted ,because of this dumb stupid law"
"Odd that people who worship God can't handle victims of incest and rape getting an abortion of they want. Didn't God kill all the first born sons of Egypt, send a big flood, issue the Mediterranean Apolocypse? They be cray in the hypocrisy 🙄 Mind your own business is right beautiful, refreshing that people like you are out there! Thank you! ❤️ 🕉"
"The man that said he hopes when he gets to the pearly gates...what... God will what say we'll done my good and faithful servant?  Noooo my Bible says judge not it also says he who is without sin cast the first stone and love thy neighbor It also says we're all sinners filthy Rags. So where these people get the idea that there doing God's will from is beyond me.  My Jesus already died on the cross for my sins and I belive that.  He also  gave us 10 commandments to follow and between the  old and new testaments he only asked one (1) thing from all of us and that was to....
*Remember the Sabbath day and keep it Holy*  that's it everything is our choice bc he gave us  *Free Will*   He didn't tell us there was a *sliding scale on sin*  he said we were all *born into sin* And I believe *My God is all knowing*  the alpha and Omega. These self righteous hypocrites gone bust *Hell wide Open*   Jesus didn't have a problem with Mary Magdelon and he was the son of God. Jesus died on the cross for all our sins. So when the man in this video gets to the *pearly gates*  he might hear him say I said it on the cross *they know what they do*  This guy will be beyond the forgive them father  part.
Sad 😔 smgdh these self righteous folks are something else."
shelly needs something else to do someone help her
"Those nuts are always smiling, but boy, do they turn on a dime, and they get very belligerent very quickly."
"Here’s an idea!  Have a family law attorney draw up a template form “Pre-Natal Adoption Contract” that women who want an abortion can download and print out before the go to the clinic.  The Contract should specify that the protestor who offers to adopt the woman’s baby if she will carry it to term MUST adopt and care for the child and pay for ALL future and unknown medical expenses of the child, pay for ALL the woman’s pre-natal care, including any and all extraordinary and/or life-saving interventions should the mother experience complications at any time during pregnancy, childbirth, or in the ninety days postpartum, guarantee the woman’s income if she is unable to work (or chooses not to work or is put on bed rest by her doctor) during pregnancy, pay for all care, maintenance, and education of the child including college, and legally adopt the child with no possibility of “return” of the child should the burden of raising a child with severe health conditions or disabilities prove too “overwhelming” for the adoptive parents, that they will never interfere with the woman after they take custody of the baby, or make financial demands upon her, or publish the fact that she is the mother of their legally adopted child, and that if the child should die for any reason after the contract is signed, including at any time during the pregnancy, they will bear the total cost of last illness, funereal, and burial costs.  The pro-life protesters who are so eager to adopt the babies of these women seeking abortions can just sign on the dotted line right then and there, et voila!!  They get what they want.  The woman will not have the abortion, and the protesters will bear the entire personal and financial and social cost of raising said child.  The mother will have all of her prenatal care taken care of and be compensated if she needs to quit her job in order to sustain the pregnancy.  She will be given any necessary life-saving medical interventions required if she experiences complications, and the adoptive parents will bear the entire financial, social, and personal cost of the pregnancy and the cost that the woman would ordinarily endure as a result of NOT having an abortion.  Then, if said pro-life protesters suddenly get “cold feet” when confronted with the very real opportunity of adopting a baby about to be aborted, and when confronted with the reality of just how much it will cost them financially, and back away from their offer to adopt said baby, well, the woman can simply say, in a very matter-of-fact manner, “Then shut the f—- up.”  And march, head held high, into the clinic and do what she needs to do to protect her own life, health, and financial future.  Also of these la di dah pro-life protesters have a very fluffy, romanticized, Donna Reed vision of what having a child means.  For a woman who already knows that the child she is carrying has anomalies incompatible with life, or who cannot take care of the children she already has, and whose husband is too much of an oaf to use a condom or have a vasectomy, she is the one who knows exactly how much that child will cost her, and whether or not she can absorb that cost."
Thank you Shelley!
You don't have children or are a pedophile probably look them up cause it's nobodies busniness
You have a right to your choice and I have a right to mine
Jesus F. Christ!  Those asswipes need to get off welfare & get themselves a job.
"""The women and the children and their option to choose life."" Do they HEAR themselves?"
Pop
"""That walk is the loneliest walk..."" They're already traumatized by the time they get here. I don't think anyone is doing this frivolously."
"The United States of America. So glad I’m an expat living in Europe. Much better, safer place."
She is literally doing Gods work.🙏🏾
"This is classic CNN tactics. Use all the eccentric, small town people  to push your agenda by painting a vulgar picture of pro-life people."
theses guys should protest against guns like M15 killing real alive people instead of wasting their time bothering people who needs help for abortion.
Pregnancy is 100% preventable
Christianity has killed more people than all of the abortions ever performed. We should go protest church services.
"""Let us help you!"" So aggressive, violent, and heartless."
Yeah how does he explain necessary medical abortions 🤔
"Dan needs to go save some on the living children ones on the street starving, ones abuse homeless."
"They said this doctor performs abortions during the third trimester!? How despicable. I understand there are times, when a baby dies, to save a woman's life, but this isn't considered abortion. The baby is already dead.
 Killing a baby that is that developed because you ""change your mind"", murder.
That is why when you kill a pregnant mother, you are charged with double murder. It is a life, and they have a right to live! You don't want a baby...close your legs!!! You have that choice."
Yet not justifying taking a life but then for what are you saving if there’s a person who has a baby and give it up to a foster home
Not sure it was such a good idea to interview this doctor and put his face in this video
You can at least attempt to loose weight 🙄🙄🙄
They talk about God.. But if you believe in God then you should know that he can do his job and don't need you people doing it.. HE IS GOD YOU ARE A HUMAN.. LEAVE PEOPLE ALONE!!!
The old man who hopes his Maker will be there for him will have a rude awakening; live your own life and let others live their's as they see fit.
Hope Dan's maker holds him responsible for every woman who is murdered by anti abortion bans
Can’t stand listening to men talk about having abortions. They have no business even talking about it. I can’t stop them from thinking about it but I can say they shouldn’t be talking about it. No uterus means no valid opinion.
I hope they are all certified foster parents who prove how much they love kids that need care. Oh wait- nope! huge crisis there. These people care about cell sacks. Not children
Run over the protesters like they run over us when we protest easy peasy
Of course most of it is men but all are crazy
"Now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned, it should become illegal for men to leave pregnant women.  If women can't back out of becoming a parent, men shouldn't be able to either"
"""their right to choose life""!? Who's forcing anyone not to!?"
It's none of these people business. Women have the right to make their own decisions about their bodies
Only $50 bucks for an assault wow I paid more for a parking ticket what a system we have
Idiots is nobody’s business if you so against it are willing support them financially?
"Protesters take abortion is a violation, yet they have no problem violating other peoples rights."
"His Penis   no longer works  why is he there, and did he take care of his kids? Does he have kids?"
When my kids were little they were horrified by those signs that f ass men and pud stew kneelers. Sickening and disgusting. Hope you're all sent to hell
I wonder when we will stop letting rural Americans ruin everything?  I say NOW.
Ask these people how many unwanted children they have adopted.
"Lol, tell me what I'll remember? I remember the love, safety and appreciation I felt for my dad when he took me to get an abortion as a teen. He saved my future, and I wouldn't have ever been able to have my beautiful daughter that I chose as an adult to have. So I don't remember the abortion very well, never met any fetus, I remember the relief."
God freaks
I saw this video many years ago. She is Great! God bless her strength!
How are you gonna be pro life and go out and kill others
judgemental power tripping white men.
i Love this Queen!!!! Power to her and the Women of Our Country.   down with power tripping entitled creeps >>>
What is happening in the Supreme Court is really scary why do they think it’s okay to take away the rights of women over their life and body and I personally don’t like adoration but I have no rights over another humans life choices period and to protest this with violence is utterly stupid
What’s going on in the states is really scary they are going backwards the Supreme Court is a joke now reverse a lot more then just abortion
do these same people protest the NRA;  to save actual live kids
"How long will the protests help? For 18 years? Will they support them financially? Will they babysit or pay for their child support? Will they provide medical assistance? Etc. Etc. Etc.

Getting them to keep the baby is the easy step, the next many, many, years are the toughest steps."
These protesters violate a person's right to privacy. Gross.
"They claim to want to protect life, but she had to look for bombs or anything that might kill or hurt the patients or the staff. WTF"
This doesn't make me side with abortionist.. If anything it make me see how many people feel the way I do. These people are not evil.
So
Was that doctor really murdered though??? Or was it just considered a late term abortion?😂🤣

"The Land of the ""Free""  and the indoctrinated ignorants on the Evangelical Evil Cult...!"
"What are these anti-abortion protesters doing for children that have already been born?  It's easy to stand there, pray, and tell someone they are doing something wrong., in their opinion.  Do they volunteer at orphanages or something?"
"Bet not a one of these people have helped, or adopted a needy child."
loser media and losers follow it
"Bombs and deadly violence - because life is precious 😂🤣
You know that nobody can take religious nutheads serious, because of double-standards like that."
These same fools are all claiming unemployment or living off the state because they dedicate their lives to harassing women.
These people really have nothing better to do !! I know an old grandpa is not there telling US WOMEN what to do which our bodies. Remember you don’t know everybody’s stories.
"I think people should mind their own business and care about others a bit more… but in a kind, compassionate way, not like yelling 🍆heads."
"SOMEBODY should ask the anti abortion protesters to Write a check for a $100,000 dollars for each child they want to save & sign papers that they will support the child until 21 & include college education"
Some people need to be admired
This makes me wanna have an abortion immediately.
"The Catholic woman doesn't realize it. But said it best She wants the women to have the right to choose life. Well, that means that they have a choice to choose the other path as well. The path of righteousness is not righteous if forced. Without the consequence of choice, there's only bitterness in obligation. Religious people are absolutely backwards."
"Standing outside of an abortion clinic ? 
Dude, you are weeks too late !
If you want to make a difference, walk into bars at night, patrol campuses, and spread the message of :
- males, please act like men,
- guys treat every woman with respect,
- take responsibility for each and every action,
- get a vasectomy
- there is no honour in creating a ‘fatherless’ child.
- do want the title of “that bastard’s daddy” ???

If you have testicles, please try to grow some ‘balls’ !"
Nothing says PRO LIFE like harassing living people and threatening them 😂
"They need to post a guard at all 4 corners armed with AK 47's and a fence. Let them drive in the gate and close it and leave those entitled busybodies on the outside of it. The nerve of these people to think they have the right to  interject themselves into a stranger's family planning decisions. These are the same people who then turn around and talk about and penalize mothers who can't take care of the children and have to go on welfare. They don't want their tax dollars to go to them. When the pro life crowd clear out all the orphanages and unwanted, neglected kids in foster care, then come talk to me until then, they need to STFU and mind their business."
"Prayer doesn't work, ask them if you can adopt the babies."
If these portestors cared about children why aren't they adopting them from foster care? The system is full of them. Why not donate half of their check to the poor to help children? Those hypocrites would never do that. I commend Shelly for helping poor women.
"Men need to STFU, women beyond bearing age, that’s another issue, but men have no skin in the game and it’s just ridiculous"
"The we will by you a bag of diapers and a can of formal crowd is no better than the we want your unborn baby but not the ones currently waiting for adoption bunch. A few meager hand out then you're on your own,  medical bills,  food, clothing,  daycare well you dregs of society need to pull yourself up by your boot straps."
All these we'll adopt your baby folk are shallow we don't want used kids hypocrites. There are tens of thousands of kids waiting for adoption in America alone not to mention hundreds of thousands to millions worldwide but they want the new puppy not those at the pound.
You need sports moms out there yelling over the protester azzholes
"The issue is that these anti-abortion people believe with all their hearts they are in the right and they are defending babies.  With that in mind you can see how it can escalate to violence, especially if they already have some other stresses or mental imbalance.
I honestly wish they had something better to do with their lives than harassing strangers and offering prayers."
"CNN, ladies and gentlemen! What great example of framing."
And might I add how brave those women are especially in today's hate driven climate. They are literally risking their lives to protect their fellow woman. I applaud you all. Truly
People with nothing better to do harassing people. That is terrible 😢
You need protection.
The part where they have to escort the women to the stairs made me cry. The fear and shame they must feel that never should be. Republicans are one step closer to getting the theocracy they've always longed for. If we don't get off our butts and put these traitors in their place like this woman then we can kiss our democracy goodbye.
"Jesus would be ashamed of these folks. Blessed are the meek, they hall inherit the earth."
"Why do some people feel they have the right / power / duty / whatever madness drives them to IMPOSE THEIR WILL / WAY OF LIFE onto other people who are just passing by?
They would hate it if I stood outside their house and tried to do the same to them.
Also, it's NOT the way of Christianity at all, if that's the mode of living they are suggesting that they follow and that we all should.  Disingenuous, dangerous fanatics. 🤪
The escorts are wonderful people, do superb work and will become more and more important. 👍🤗
M 🦘🏏😎"
"""Pro-lifeer"": We're going to help you with thoughts and prayers. 
Me: What about helping with caring for a child who was forcefully born wuth health issues that remove any chance at quality of life? After a female child is raped and impregnated, how is it helping her by making her have the child?"
"Dang, what a hero for freedom and the rights of wemon to control their own bodies."
Where was God for the raped and abuse woman and children??
We will provide everything to child murderers
"We’re here to help!   Except after the baby is born then we just don’t give a fuck!  If only these people cared about kids from 0-18… helped moms with child care, help assure that the born kids have access to healthcare… so hypocritical"
"I'll keep my laws off your body when you keep your hands off my paycheck 😂 make killing infants legal cool I don't care less toxic in the world without your narcissistic entitled kids growing up. However, make getting everything free from my hard work illegal."
"Hey, ALL OLD MEN AND A FEW DERANGED OLD WOMEN"
Killing people to prove how pro life they are is insane.
Creepy guys harassing females.
"She's like a put-upon school yard monitor, tired of kid's antics. She knows their names, calling them out every day..."
"These folks are past baby age. Abortion is not THEIR problem. When our system addresses poverty, mental health, and a plethora of issues that most trumplicans,Republicans, and let's not forget the nationalist, won't support social programs to address these issues. ""It's too expensive and they made their bed."" Ah self righteous conservative geezus believers. Gotta love em, idiots that they are"
Assault on mutual consent? WTF!!!!
White people are strange on so many levels
These people are so many levels of disgusting.
"How these “people” think they have the right to enforce their morals on anybody is beyond me. Then they’ll blow up a clinic whilst screaming, “murders.”"
"these men who have the nerve to stand there and judge these women😡🤬🤬

If you can't give birth to children, you should keep your mouth shut 😡🤬"
I wonder how much money they donate to orphans. If they really care about babies I hope they are donate their entire social security.
"Yep, engaging in population control is murder. Protesting population control is justified murder. We should ask these self-righteous God fearing people how many guns they have."
What about the victims of gun violence?
"These people remind so mich of gilead, its scary"
"These religious extremists need to MYOB!  If you're anti-abortion-don't get one, but stop imposing your self righteous views on everyone else. 
They treat adult human beings  abusively & then talk about the ""sanctity of life""-but only if you're a zygote or an embryo. 
They're 100% hypocrites!"
And I am sure they fed up with you
"The self ENTITLEMENT of these ""protestors"" over another woman's body is what sickens me the most. It's how many of these demented people there are is what disturbs me entirely. They all think they're out there doing God's will, but simultaneously dehumanizing women for their RIGHT to choose. Fucking paradoxical oxymoron politicized bull shit. YouTube please  forgive my language"
"Crazy to think that in 2022 America, this is what we’re faced with. Can’t wait until time machines are invented and all those people can go back to 1900 where they belong"
These people should actually go talk to rape victims and ask them how they feel when they got pregnant and had to go get an abortion or ones that didn't have a choice and they have to have a rapist baby
Go home old man!
"These people are mentally unstable.  It’s not helping, it’s not moral. It’s pathetic. It’s harassment. They’re grossly confused about life and who needs their help.
Losers. They protest while real kids could use a mentor.  But maybe it’s good these pro-life nutcases aren’t around kids.
“When I meet my maker” - he’s going to hell"
"Screaming at women who exercise their health choices, but too cowardly to have her name broadcast - pro-lifer hypocrisy in a nutshell."
"Don't these fools have jobs ,these people are sick"
"Protesting to be able to murder babies, it's insane. They chant "" my body my choice""_ it's simple ladies keep your legs together and you won't get pregnant."
The best part is if you go to the local strip club on Wednesday night I bet you see all these guys.... Hitting on a 19-year-old girl... The irony
1% of Abortions (child murder) is due to rape or childbirth problems... Abortion is genocide of infants and everyone that supports it WILL BE REMEMBERD AS EVIL AND BIZARRE
CNN is fake news and abortion should be illegal
"Nope... Nobody asked you!
PERFECT"
"Ironic that Republicans ""apparently care for an UNBORN foetus, but don't give a shit once it is born!

Said child can be shot and killed whilst at school...

But NRA donations matter more..."
"🛑I do not agree with abortion of babies! But I don't necessarily disagree and special cases like R*pe,or babies being born with H*v! Or any stuffing of any kind for the baby's because it's NOT Fair to them at all..but it's just my opinion. But it's not for me to judge the most high God will do that!🙏🏾sooo vary sad if you feel like this is your only option 😩😢"
No more using abortions for birth control  have to start practicing safe sex
"😂🤣😄 This was the comedic relief I needed after watching the hearings. “Absolutely not, nobody asked you” Get ‘em
Shelly lol"
She is a badass!
Why are some people all ways in other people business they should worry about there ownbody not die one else body they got the nerve to be talking about god well guess what god give us free will only he can judge so some people just need to stay out of people business 🧑‍💼
It's pro-birth not pro-life. Once the fetus takes it's first breath their concern for it's health and welfare  disappears almost immediately.
"People do know why woman abort! They’ve been fed with the lie that their babies are not human. They are just an inconvenience to 78% of woman who abort. If you’re going to support abortion, do it bravery, don’t lie and tell it like it is for these women: and inconvenience. If you’re willing to have unprotected sex, be responsible enough to face the consequences and don’t run like the coward who kill a child that can’t defend himself"
"Hipocracy is amazing: complaints about killing of 11 people since 1977, when during the same time about 50 million babies has also been killed (NO! They’re NOT rubbery fetus. Rubber fetus don’t move, their heart doesn’t beat, don’t grow…don’t move to love to millions of women who develop the deepest love for their babies…"
Trolling used to perfection. Well done.
We need more people like her
When my girlfriend decided to get an abortion I remember coming out of the clinic with her afterwards and some A hole was holding a sign up of a baby in pieces . She didn’t need to see that. These people are voicing their opinions according to what they believe. Doesn’t seem on the same level at all. Pro choice protesters can be pretty brutal as well . Just saying to be fair and not hypocritical.🤷🏽‍♂️ Why would CNN even air this ?
"YOU are AMAZING! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU for being there, in the hardest moments in a pregnant woman's life. Thank you for standing in the line of fire, making those distractions and being that strength of reassurance so she can make it inside safely- giving some honor to her after she's made the hardest decision of her life. Thank you isn't even close to the praise you deserve for ALL you do for these women already in such incredible pain."
What a beautiful person she is. Very very well done
Someone get that lady a bullhorn
"We're not animals nor your slaves, you can not control us woman"
Thank you for what you do!
Bless you
What about the children that's already born being killed in a place of learning. They don't give a damn  about that. I believe a person should have a  right to do what they want with their bodies. I don't see these them a protest at the NRA headquarters about the mass gun violence in America. One born they are just an image and is not protected. There are a lot of children in the United States  that are hungry and malnourished. They have did everything to cut funds to help with  that part. Land of the free for who??? That is my question.
"Must be so hard to deal with so many nut jobs every day, good karma for this woman!"
"Testimony of an abortion doctor 
https://youtu.be/WNx7s58q5cY"
Wait…… they’re pro life but want to kill people?? That literally makes NO sense.
Politically incorrect private investigator.
Idgaf wat nobody say abortion wrong just like legalize gay marriage is wrong bt     I dnt believe protesting that shit dnt wrk look wat Malcolm X dr. King an so many did that protest bs dnt  work
"It’s MEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!’ Omg, of course"
"There are over 400,000 children in foster care.  Go take care of them.
There are children being massacred by gun toting 2nd amendment freaks.
Once you take care of that situation, then maybe, yes maybe, you will be considered pro-life."
I would like to know how many of those anti abortion protestors are adopting children.
What a great woman. You are my hero
"The guy that said he's been ""in this movement since 73"" is almost absolutely an outright liar.  The pro-life movement wasn't formed until the late 70's / early 80's, with Frank Schaeffer's propaganda films."
They help till the fetus develops into a baby then is born. Then they’re no where to be found.
Dont think shes gonna have to worry about having an abortion any time soon lol
Abortion needs to be between a woman and her doctor safely and needs to be protected by HIPAA laws. It's sucks we have  these clinics where these women get harassed instead of going to their own doctor's office.
"Lol bombs planted by ""prolife"" people lmao"
Is this a repost?
I wish someone would’ve been more vocal to me to change my mind so many years ago
Somebody please tell these men this issue doesn't concern them. I can not believe a man would go to a women's health clinic and yell at the patients. Can women have one area where men don't get to yell at us. I don't care what these guys do with their penises.
Third trimester abortion unbelievable!
"Telling someone else that she is beautiful and will miss her baby is wrong?  The only person who is derogatory is her.  The only one being aggressive is her.  Those people are trying to save a life.  This woman wants to ensure that multiple ones are taken, and she's NOT funny.  It's really gross that she is that arrogant and indifferent and acting like she's above it all.  No, bombings, attacks, and murder should not happen to anyone protesting or working there but the people being shown are innocently trying to sway someone in to making a different decision.  They have every right to do so.  She could potentially bring negative reactions upon herself by trying to provoke people like she has in these videos.  She is on the offensive not defensive in this video."
"I hate the contrast that it’s either-or, like black and white and pretending that there are no better solutions to these issues. 
How about better care for our children, how about explaining to them, not just about condoms but about the consequences of unprotected sex? 
How about providing free contraceptives specifically IUDs and vasectomies? 
How about advocating against hook-up one-night stand culture? 
There is a lot we can do to reduce abortions if society would care collectively not some biblical nonsense and not some feminist “my body my choice” crackhead. Both of you are wrong on how you approach this subject."
They say they are prolife but you have to check for bombs?
"3rd trimester abortion is disgusting, what made her wait that long to do abortion in third trimester? Can abortion clinics provide free IUDs? Especially to repeated clients?"
Looks like she's out of a job now. Probably didn't see that coming.
🤔
"Shelly is FANTASTIC. As are the others who are there to help these women. 
The world needs more of them."
"Notice these zeolites are all from  Trump based ""Poorly educated""  Red states."
Joe tripping...
Isn’t this a vice story? Lol cnn just copy and pasted the video and slapped their logo on it
"Interesting how ya'll don't give this much attention and sensationalism to all the pro-life clinics and government buildings that are under attack by pro-choice mobs. It's almost like yall are trying to push a certain narrative, while suppressing literal terrorism (in the name of tolerance, of course) .. 🤔"
Radical evangelical Christian nut jobs.
What about the half million kids in shitty Residential Treatment Centers how are u helping them
I don't believe that 90 percent of abortions performed are due to rape and incest. It's done because the women don't want to be inconvenienced with having to raise a kid.
"This woman is really disgusting... And just a little FYI, millions of babies have been murdered because of abortion."
What's even better being broadcasted on tik tok are all the videos I see of liberals trashing capitol buildings all over country spraying spray paint attacking civilians u are such sweet innocent ppl aren't you lmao
Time to Tax all churches!!
Why are the PENIS' put there?? Its NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS!!
I'm just curious and I may be wrong but how many children has Dan adopted and raised and supported by himself without any state or government assistance has anybody asked Dan this question yet if not someone needs to tell Danny he ain't got a dog in the fight he needs to take some of them babies home and take care of them that he loves so much and that are so beautiful and it are so wanted by everybody tell Dan to take him home take care of them
Whats with the rainbow umbrella
Big fucking deal….these people need to be dealt with better than that
"""11 people have murder......"" what about the 63 million preborn people that have been murder in these places? What doesn't CNN do a special on that?!"
I just don't recall seeing this when trump was messing up our country but all of a sudden they care now but didn't care enough to wear a mask to protect children gtfoh trump supporters u are clown's
Putting their faces on tik tok without their consent is illegal. But you are actually advertising them so this is a benefit for them.
TIC TOC STEALS YOUR INFO FOR CHINA THEY OWN IT..
Creepy ignorant busy bodies that feel that need to push their uneducated beliefs on the rest of the world.
God will send him straight to hell
lol 'nobody asked you' .
My favorite part about tik tok is how cool it is.
You are so shameful Shelly. Advocating for murder. May GOD have mercy on you one day you will have to answer for it. We all will be judged
Supreme Court - we own your hoohoos
Much respect to her. Those christo-fascists need to piss off.
One brave and just woman.  Proud of you!
Enough peace and patience already. It's been done and look where we are. We need the goons with the blammers. We gotta exercise our 2nd amendment. (Bird call) 🕊️ 🐔
Where are these protesters when the children need food on their table?  When the mothers can't afford child care?  A B S E N T
these Women who can do this Job to help kill unborn babies are Evil and its worst than Vet-techs putting 100-200 animals down each Day . In Michigan 7-8 % African American Women Population are responsible for over 50% of the Abortions made yearly . Nation wide over 1 Million Babies being killed each year and having My Tax money go to this evil dead is Wrong. If Women want to abort a Pregnancy there are herbs and such things that they would use 2K years ago . Why have a Doctor rip it out  of you piece by piece and use your Fetal tissue cells to make vaccines.
A true angel. Keep up the great work.
"SUCH A VAST CONTRAST BETWEEN the ANTI-ABORTION protestors DEMEANOR and the PRO-ABORTION. 

Anti-war so much NICER, CALMER,  NONTHREATENING, REASONABLE...hoping to give someone a bit of realization and see their true value.  And the PRO- WOW, SCREAMING, HATEFUL, THREATENING, CUSSING, ATTACKING PEOPLE. 

And the clinic attacks that occurred DECADES AGO are not the norm and do not occur like the PRO ARE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY"
"I want to know the psychological reasons these people are so against someone else who is making choices for themselves and their bodies? It's a fascist ideology to want to control over others, their bodies, and thier life decisions."
I can’t imagine how creepy it must be to hear some random middle-aged dude calling you “Mom” or “Mommy”. My heart goes out to those patients and their escorts.
The young lady who escorts patients  is very brave.
"Seem to be a lot of weird people with nothing better to do.
Wonder if they'd be so excited about black or Mexican women. My guess is no."
Classic poster of a Democrat loser. Overweight and a human being killer
"""We're here to help you""... but won't disclose her name."
"I find it funny that all of these pro-forced-birth people automatically assume that the fetus wants to be born, regardless of any circumstances.  The fetus could be deaf, blind, and limbless, and these idiots would say it wants to be born.  I honestly question why ANYONE would want to be born right now.  We have hyper-polarization of politics (worst in the U.S., but to a lesser extent worldwide) that is getting worse, not better; steady removal of rights in the U.S., wealth disparity in the U.S. resulting in increased homelessness and inability to afford food; not-infrequent school shootings in the U.S., Russia's war against Ukraine which is impacting the entire world, Russia's threats of nuclear war against the entire world, climate change that is literally making the world unlivable, and this little thing called SARS-CoV-2 that people pretend has gone away, but hasn't.  Only a masochist or a sadist would actually want to be born into this wold right now."
Woe is them. What will they do with their time now that roe V wade is overturned.
Religion cannot dictate human rights
The only people being rude are the abortion clinic workers lol
It doesn’t seem like the people are being mean or even rude…. They’re telling them that there’s another option. What’s wrong with choosing life?
I went there for birth control once and was swarmed by crazy women who wanted to adopt my baby I didn’t have yet they wouldnt listen to me or let me leave just kept ranting on and on about how much they love babies was is creepy
"Many more babies are going to die without this ruling,isn't that the point? Isn't it ironic that the very topic of death as it relates to the life bearer when life receiver are intertwined and at one point the life bearer was the life receiver. You see the Communist Democratic part of the U.S. can't see the santity of human life so they desensitize and segregate the life that is inside. This is all part of secular humanism which is Satanism."
"The Pro-Life movement is not really a Pro-Life movement, the are just Pro-Birth, because once the baby is born, they could not give a shit about the child. They are not pro expanding Welfare benefits for poor people or single moms, they are not pro public education and free college education, they are not pro universal healthcare. Once the baby is born, ""you're own your own and don't be a moocher"". They are even for raped little girls, the product of incest, having the baby. They are disgusting, really."
she is great; but what's with those creepy old men telling women what to do?
Christian Facist
Shelly needs to be careful there is crazy people out there
What a evil woman
Love this woman.
"Abortion facilitators were one children; it's wrong to commit violence against them. Vid: ""Since 1977, 11 people were killed in abortion attacks.""   Also, since 1977, over  *59,603,131*  Babies have been Aborted in the U.S.  [according to Guttmacher Institute]"
"So ending the lives of babies is more important than, let's say correcting the wrongs of the past. like REPARATIONS"
"Funny. Not one of the “protesters” were berating or violent or broke windows or spray painted threats. There was no profanity or shaming going on. Yet the clinic workers acted like they were threatened by a 70 year old man who never raised his voice. 

Moral of this story is that if you support abortion you are free to destroy private property, threaten Supreme Court justices and even attempt to end their lives but if you don’t support abortion you can’t calmly stand outside a clinic and say anything without being treated as a threat. 

For liberals you can only have “free” speech if you agree with the liberal opinion. All others must be silenced in the name of “free” speech. FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS FREEDOM TO SPEAK.

For liberals you can only have democracy when every votes liberal. If you don’t your vote shouldn’t count or you should be silenced. This is liberal democracy. It’s like racism for politics. People that aren’t like you aren’t real people. They’re more like 3/5 of a person. Sound familiar? 

Read your history books! The Democratic Party supported slavery. The Republican Party was created to fight slavery. Republicans voted a black man to congress decades before democrats did. It’s right there for you to read. Now they’re calling republicans the racists? 

Oh and did you get the part where this doctor performed THIRD TRIMESTER ABORTIONS? That’s when the baby kicks and moves around. Thats when they can be born and still survive outside the womb. 

Does that mean that all of these late term abortions were life threatening to the mother? If that were the case shouldn’t we find out why that’s happening? How many of these late term abortions are because of a “change of heart”? 

So murder is when you take a “clump of cells” that made its way out of the womb (“born”) and cut it into pieces.  Even if it were just out of the womb a few seconds. 

Cut up that same “clump of cells “  a few minutes  prior and you are praised for performing an abortion. This is the position of the liberals."
Maybe just stop killing babies
What is this? Escort acting like a victim as she victimized women and babies!
People complain about why kill a beautiful life if it can become the next world changer or life is god’s gift but they are in denial of the bigger picture. The fetus is aborted for a reason if it is horned into the world without decent care wouldn’t they actually hurting the world and the baby more? Like it he irony of it. Pro-life but support weapons that easily kill life? Like?
"Nobody asked any of these busybodies their opinion.  The woman yelling, ""We will help you!""  Name the list of the children this woman has raised and helped.  How many is she up to?"
"I am pro choice. 4 choices specifically.
1. Abstinence
2. Contraception
3. Motherhood
4. Adoption
I just can’t support the 5th… murder"
"She shouldn't have a problem, I'm mean who would want to shag that anyway."
Just hire a sniper to kneecap each protester. Enough BS. That one guy said he was doing this since 1973 ! Since when is it even legal to harass people for 50 years ???
"So an anti abortionist who ""believes"" in human life, is willing to take life?"
"Just watch, the day I'm Republicans will do nothing to create programs to support these poor women going through hell. I can't stand liars and hypocrites more than any other kind of people in this world. So no I don't like very many politicians, if any.  I don't agree with the policies of someone like Liz Cheney, but I would vote for her over many others just because of her integrity. 
The pendulum always swings to the extremes, the backlash that will happen from all this alt right-wing bullshit will completely change the country, thank God.
Imagine, if Lincoln had lived. It's highly likely we would not be facing, civil war part 2. What I don't understand is I thought everybody watched Star Wars and Star Trek; if they did, they would have recognized the orange headed orangutan is emperor Palpatine."
when you're a judgemental bigot who delusionalally believes you are doing god's will you don't have to try and put yourself in the other person's shoes - it's literally one o' the easiest things for the inhumane to do...
Abortion is murder...by definition. It is killing an infant human being inside the womb.
"It’s truly a sad day in our country. I’m a disabled dude. I’m here because of women. Women were the trailblazers. From the women right to vote,civil rights act,Womens reproductive rights,disabilities rights act & LBGQTI+ rights. 
I’m hoping to wake up and say: oh thank goodness it was just a horrible nightmare. 

From human rights & corporations attacking movies we love.👈🏻This is a sad day. Hopin it’s all one horrible nightmare."
"Not to mention the consequences (like mental illness)that can imply having a child you don’t want bcuz of whatever reason. The child can be given to the grandparents, or pass on to whoever the mother thinks is “suitable” to take care of the child except for her. The child will grow with so much anger, resentment, or grow up to be successful who knows. Is all correlated."
"Also, these protesters have been brainwashed by a Bible that is not accurate! They are reading scriptures and twisting them to fit their narrative  and interpreting what they want. It's so sad because they don't even know they are and therefore are not interested in learning. If you do not listen, you will never learn. A lot of these people think they know everything about it."
These anti abortion lunatics are incredibly hypocritical. They claim to care so much about life that they get up early every morning to harass women for their choices instead of getting up every morning to actually help people in need like the homeless women and children all over America. Why don’t they expend their energy helping humans who actually need help instead of attempting to force their fake religious beliefs down the throats of women who don’t believe in their ideologies.
"So why don't clinics have a pickup/drop off spot near the clinic, maybe a block or two away (change the pickup/drop-off spot regularly)  have a vehicle waiting, offer the ladies ear plugs, drive each lady right up to the front door of the clinic, then do the same afterwards? Why are these women forced to walk in front of the protesters?"
Children without healthcare or good schools or food are more of a concern than abortion.
Ha ha... abortion clinic escort hasn't an abortion clinic to escort anyone to anymore. 🤣🤣🤣
"Prayers do not cover rent. Prayers dont buy food. Prayers dont provide transportation for a child. Prayers do not raise a child. The choice should always be up to a woman to decide what's best, and that may include prayers. However, the prayer cult harassment needs to stop."
"If you are performing abortions in the third trimester you aren't a champion for women's rights you are a killer of a viable baby.  You want an abortion, get it in the first trimester."
CNN reposting old contact 😂
Thank you Shelly!
I have one question for all of them are you willing to become a foster parent to take care of these children when the parent don’t want them the answer is NOOOOO  this is something that is between them in the man above or who ever you believe in not your business
By day carrying a anti abortion sign.....now is is giggling with anticipation as he tries to be a rapist by night
"So all these people think they are better than the God they claim to worship...God is pro abortion, He told His priests how to perform abortions on the wives of jealous husbands."
"Abortion is a big deal these days as the world turns, but what I cannot yet figure out is why the women don't just practice birth-control, with medical pills and procedures, instead of using Abortion's as the only way? One is wisely preventative and the other is foolishly applied cruelty to the babies and the baby lovers, who have to hear, see and know of the horrors. Not to forget that the God-believing, loving people are horrified at this unnecessary, belated solution of an unwanted human Pregnancy. Some of the Animal Rights people are more humane then these Abortion-thumpers. There are many parents that are begging for the opportunity to adopt a baby, all the while they are being flushed down the proverbial toilet and what a shame to lose them to the Abortion-Cults. How many times have we hoped for beneficial help for the planet, only to have that talent Aborted before it came to exist, mature and do its planned repair/aid? Maybe Einstein, Nicola Tesla or George Washington should have been Aborted?"
Love how the anti abortion people are old or people who Aren't having sex anyway
Well if they care so much won’t they offer to adopt??
And it’s so funny to me !!! That all those men protesting!!!
"Whats the big deal about abortion who wants to have sex with this man haters ,look fat and look like a guy. My question is what guy wants this females?"
This is the reason that Christians suck. They get $1 trillion worth of tax breaks every 12 years. That’s fucked up. It’s time to end tax exempt status for fake Christian churches. Separation of church and state my ass. Christians are authoritarian fascists. They are complicit in violence against women.
Anti  choicers
"Are the same people who fought tireless to ban abortions going to fight tirelessly for food stamps, school breakfast programs,  after school activities, and stricter child support laws?

Or are they going to say,  move on to banning birth control, then gay rights, and revert back to the 50's where black people cant vote,  woman have little say, and maybe kids can work in sweat shops for pennies?"
Walking you to the clinic is not help if you’re gonna end up killing children. It’s funny how the  same rainbow colors that can’t make babies due to choice wanna kill our children! Truly misery loves company! Just terrible
"Yeah, because killing babies is a great thing to do!  You people are sick!  I use to be Pro-Choice until they went to far.  NO ONE should be able to get an abortion after 12 weeks.  Keep it sane people!"
We shouldn’t be pandering to those that believe in the supernatural.
"Looking at America from the outside, i don't understand two things:
Why are some constitutional rights OK to overturn (such as the 14th,  regarding abortions)
While others will get your death threats if you even casually mention it ( 2nd,  guns )

the next question is:  when will the United States stop pretending it doesn't mix church with state, when there are very clear undeniable examples of it,  such as the overturning of Roe v Wade?"
Story as told by women who were not aborted.
I usually just flip them off
Let's be real you have a lot of nasty people out there that have unprotected sex everyday and basically gets abortions every 2 weeks those are the ones that are upset 😄😄😄😄
"All you bible thumpers out there demanding people live your way.. Remember this.. God made humans with the ability to choose.. God wants humans to choose to live his/her way.. Not force people to live that way.. If that is what he/she wanted.. to force humans to live his/her way God would have made it that way.. And it would have been written in the bible.. You are supposed to SHARE the word of God.. Not forcibly make people listen and follow the word of God.. You can CHOOSE to live God's way or CHOOSE to live the way as God put it, of the world.. 🐧"
"I have never seen these people standing outside of the WIC office or Medicaid for all this HELP they claim they provide, such BS."

Obnoxious people being bolstered by an obnoxious corrupt media company.
At least they aren’t burning clinics down https://youtu.be/A93SCDBDuzo
"14mil subscribers, haha yea right. Maybe at best 125k with about 10k actually watching videos or news. CNN, you're garbage for keeping this left vs right crap going while your suckers get priced out of survival!"
what a hero!!! she escorts women to a place where babies are killed !! yes!!
And how much money have all of these people given to the health n care of the born children n Moms. ??   Put your money we’re your mouth is. This is a heart breaking act for any woman!!!  I’m
I'm glad to see what real Americans look like!
"Abortion protesters are out of their minds
Whay aren't you protesting the right to life outside gunshops?"
I'm with her.
"Stupid churchies, how many adopt, or assist raising the unwanted embryos"
"She can only do her ""work"" because she  was not killed by abortion.  How about some self-realization,  sweetheart.  Do you escort the dead babies out the door after the abortions."
These pro-lifers AKA Nazis are out of there Effin minds …
"“Since 1977, at least 11 people have been killed”. 
How about the millions of children that has been murdered?"
"I'm Pro Choice but I respect the protesters ...God Bless them for fighting for what they believe in ...it is powerful to hear them call out ""Hey Mom"" ....Good and honorable work by the escorts too ....Zulu"
Do it!! You're awesome!
These are sad depressing times.   😢
Thank you for protecting women making their OWN decisions.
I would ask how many children these ppl have adopted. How much child support they pay to the women they have kept away from clinics.   Funny how they use god and the Bible.   The Bible advocates to abort a pregnancy just for the suspicion of adultery.
"Where they are known, don't withhold names!  Video of the self-righteous is not enough: name names!"
"old white guy telling women what to do, great..."
"So, women of compromised pregnancies: 
Here's another angle: women, if you
are compromised, think of all the DNA
lawsuits to claim support payments
and, more so, claims to property
inheritances, etc. perhaps this
invasion of your property and rights
can be turned into lemonade? More
so, hold those forceful lords
accountable and expose them! This could go so far"
"White Old men who couldn't even purchase a sandwich let alone foster one of these ""babies"""
"This is all religion's fault.... these people are so blinded by it, they feel they have ""the obligation"" fuck that... will they finance the newborn? will they care after afterward? doubt it!!"
Hand them adoption applications or ask them to donate to help women who can't afford to take care of their children. Put your money where your mouth is people. If you don't want abortion as a choice then you need to provide an appropriate alternative that solves the issues that may lead to that choice rather than deny a woman's basic human right to sovereignty over her own body.
They should open a mental health clinic next to every abortion clinic so they can help anti-abortionists with their neuroses.
"First of all it baffling how we allowed the anti-choice movement to seemingly create the abortion narrative.  The vast majority of these people are pro-birth not pro-life. Additionally they have proven time and time that they couldn't get less about the women who are pregnant. They only care about the fetus, the majority of those who are pro-birth aren't that concerned with what happens to the child after it has been  delivered."
"Instead men  who don't have any part in the carrying of babies to go through that ordeal n most of the times its their male partner insist to dem having the abortion. Women are secondary citizens to men, they are our life companion, the side of the coin. Anti-abortionist don't really care about children if they did they would supporting the childrens at orphanage that really need their love n support."
"Until people start confronting these right-wing bullies in mass, this move to the ultra-right will continue. They don't want a functioning democracy."
"For those people using their BIBLES as an excuse for this monstrous decision to take away women's 14th amendment rights, how about you actually READ THE DAMN THINGS??""

""Life begins at birth with the first breath"" = Genisis 2:7

""Fetuses are not persons"" = Exodus 21: 22-25

""Fetuses should be aborted as proof of adultery""  Numbers = 5 : 11 - 31

""Life is not sacred, the soul is.""  Deuteronomy 28: 18 - 24"
Lol these old men that can't have children tell other people what to do. I just can't. Lmfao.
"So dis man thinks he has the right to tell women wat they can with their bodies, wat kind of misogyny crap is dis, no 1 stops a from getting vasectomy but here they telling women not to, we men of no place in women issues period, y don't they invest their time n money  at orphanage if they care so much about children. Show women dat if they ave d babies dat they will have a support system."
"If I was a Dr, I'd take that target off his back..."
"Unless you're going to adopt every child in foster care, shut up. My family does foster care and they system is overburdened and flawed... it's necessary, but not optimal. None of these potential children are alive if you consider that it's not considered a live birth until the air sacs in the lungs expand. How long until I'm sentenced for discarding tampons?"
"Even worse than what happens outside the abortion clinics is what happens inside! All you woman need to watch an abortion. It's absolutely disgusting!!!  CNN loves to Race bait but they won't tell you When Eugenicist William Gates Sr Bill Gate's Pops financed and helped start Planned Parenthood he located 90 % of them within walking distance of a minority community mostly Black neighborhoods and this was done strategically! Out of every 1000 black babies are born  450 are aborted!!! Blacks make up 13% of the population and account for 40% of the abortions!!! CNN always has an agenda.  Propaganda all day, every day!! Divide and Conquer, and Order out of Chaos are there motos."
Some of those anti abortion people really make a case for abortion
"If you don't like abortion, don't have one"
Their focus is self righteousness and telling other people what to do according to their beliefs.  Dan is a twerp.  And how many of these people contribute financially every month for years to these unborn children?  This is basically an attempt to punish women for having sex. Particularly if Thomas has his way and eliminates birth control.
"In the same time the court rule in two cases 
First case you do not have control over my Gun
Second case I have control over your body (you do not have control over your body)
This is why the Christian democrats don't want Christian hypocrite to rule this country, so we do not go to the Stone Age like Iran, Afghanistan….etc.

"The Dominionist Court imposing Dominionist Christianity upon US all against our will. The Great Raping of America. 

Because to the right wing authoritarians, dead women are ALWAYS acceptable collateral damage to their theocratic ends."
"""Their right to choose""  Right out of the anti abortion protestors mouth.  You prefer they choose life...great, but it's their choice.  The theocratic SCOTUS is making that much more difficult.  Enforcing church rule in the US will lead to violence.  The US is suppose to be a country where you're free to choose.  Removing that freedom is removing the soul of this country.  You can hate it, but it's not your choice what others do.  You choose to stand outside and harrass people...great.  Leave the rest of the world alone."
Keep it up girl! It’s our right!!!!!!!!!
These people could give a damn for live children.
what about protesting against fire arms To protect children
"The lady actually said their focus ""is for the women and the children and right to choose life"" I want an abortion so they will do everything they can to prevent me from getting an abortion. Got it, thanks."
Cristofascist are making our Democracy disappear.
"Republicans are true hypocrites of the century! Pro-life while as well anti-guns control. They are more eager to protect unborn so that they can kill them with guns when they go to school or shopping mall! So, the foetus are more worth to die when they are grown instead or what are their conscience in all this nonsense?! Can they be so uproaring against guns as they are about abortion rights? They're really blood thirsty to see more adults' death than foetus! Bloodsuckers Republicans calling themselves Christians!"
"good for this brave young woman. These people have no right to impose  their limited belief system. They are not even aware they are pawns in the struggle of greed and control by the extremist, facist, fake Christian Taliban."
How many babies have these old men who feel they have to guilt trip women who they don't know or care about.
No man had a right to question a woman's right to her body... Men need to just shut up and leave the female issues to a female.
#OldWhiteMen #SMDH
Ask them for child support
"Talk about a life with meaning and meaningful work. I would walk with you if I could and if I lived there I would do everything I could to be hired so that I could work alongside you. Bless you. Because we all know that these people couldn't care less about these zygotes, referring to first trimester procedures. The arrogance of these old white men shown here thinking that they should have any say whatsoever in what happens to the bodies of women they don't even know and don't care about and would rather see die. They don't know if they were raped, the women they address who are walking in, they don't know if they have some health condition which would result in pregnancy making their life a risk. Look I was on the pill at 19, took it 100% perfectly and still got pregnant. Yes I'm one of those whom my doctor calls The Superfertile and I I just been dumped by the baby's father because I was pregnant and he wasn't done having fun, we were both in college full time, living in the dorms and I was also working 30 hours a week in addition to maintaining a 4.0 average. I did a lot of thinking, after getting over my initial shock wondering how this happened when I was absolutely on point with my daily pill taking. If I hadn't been able to get an abortion~which still took me several years to emotionally heal from because I've always wanted to be a mother, and of course I'm a mother now but back then I was just not in a position to be able to be a full-time mom and there's no other kind of mom I would ever want to be. Wh atI'm trying to say is if a woman chooses abortion~and I'm even disgusted that I have to defend this in the first place there should be no ""discussion""about this in the first place, this is a medical and health decision that can be made by one person and one person only because only one person would have to carry a pregnancy and give birth and go through all of that and only one person is going to be caring for and raising that child forever, don't even for a minute think it's just 18 years cuz that's a laugh and anybody who's the parent of a child older than that knows it

I would tell those old white guys if they would be 100% on board with me deciding`~a woman they Don't know and will never know~if they should have a vasectomy or not. Or whether if they've had one it should be reversed. Or not. 

SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS...ON  A SCALE OF 10, lol, how would they like ME making those decisions for THEM????"
Hey anti abortion protesters: GOD HATES HAGS. have fun in hell.
Are they not protesting without a permit...why are they not arrested
"They're just trolls who get off on their self righteousness. 🙄
Hey, religious people... your religion is like a penis. You can be proud of having one, but unless someone asks about it, keep it to yourself."
"I bet you’re not reporting on the pro-abortionist rioters who attacked state capitols in VT and AZ. The pregnancy centers fire bombed, vandalized, and burned. Crickets."
These morons are disturbing customers ..lock their asses up... Fi e them charge them.... Throw them off the property they are nuts
"I LOVE HER! ""Is that enough? Have you had enough of feeling righteous today?"" 😂❤"
"Let’s assume for the sake of this conversation that God and Jesus is real. A lot of these conservatives, and pro life people, are going to be mighty damn surprised to find that they’re not getting into heaven, because none of these people actually follow the teachings of Jesus."
Thank god  for the Supreme Court !  What could be more violent than abortion ?
These jerks are publicly harassing people ..why are the cops not doing their jobs.. it is a crime to threaten harass or in anyway. To imped the rights of another .... If I walked up to people going in or coming out of a church and said ... You people are crazy you people are totally insane morons to believe that nonsense.. Does anyone really believe I would nit be arrested..in minutes ..what's the difference?
"Jesus started a ministry that caters to the free will of the unbelievers, 
Read the 10th chapter of Matthew, christians were commanded to shake off the dust off of their feet when they were not welcomed, but never to interfere in the rights of others, read it yourselves.
No where in the bible does it say, we must interfere with what others are doing, that comes from satan."
"It’s fine with me for anyone to have their religious beliefs but confronting anyone that does not share that conviction is just wrong. If you do not know that person and their situation you cannot judge, leave them alone. This conduct is exactly why people are leaving churches in droves, there is no human connection, you are just condemned if you do not fall in line with the brainwashing program, do not dare to question or your left wing trash!"
"Christians were comanded to mind their own business and these are fake christians and busibobies in others affairs.
The bible condenms both of these actions.
Christians are suposed to obey God's commandments.
Revelation 22:11"
Yes I’m pro choice.. As a man I have no right telling a woman what she can do with her body. I just wanna ask the anti choice people what have you done for unfortunate children? You only seem to care while the the woman goes thru the pregnancy process.. Once that child is out the womb you give no fucks what happens.. This is also another reason I Do Not follow NO RELIGION… The Best and Worst people in World history have followed the same Book or Books and came to separate conclusions.. I don’t have time for some ancient writing that when people saw Thunder and Lightning believed some God was raining hell on them.. I simply treat people how I would like to be treated
"You know these anti abortion people could better spend their time volunteering helping poor children by reading to them, playing with them, telling them stories. This way their own lives will be remembered instead of being remembered for screaming at another person. Which is better?"
"Need some girl going in with a few very overly protective Italian brothers, I'm sure they would ""escort"" those protesters off the lot."
"I just have to wonder what women are thinking that need an abortion. Do they not know they had unprotected sex and that's how babies are made?
 With the morning after pill why is there even a need for abortions.
Get caught up in the moment? Stop in at the pharmacy and don't wait and see....just seems to not be very responsible to wait and have to go through this terrible procedure."
Love that Clinic escort lady. Bet none of those Pro life people donate a dime to fund those unwanted babies. Pro life hypocrites
"I wish these protesters would put all their energy and time into things that would lower the demand for abortion instead of harassing people who already need one.  They could work to promote sex education that includes education about contraception and consent.  They could work to make contraception more available.  They could lobby for better health care, child-care, and an increase in welfare and disability to make it easier for women who want to have children to do so.  If these people sincerely believe abortion is murder, why wouldn't they work on lowering the demand for abortions so that less women need them in the first place?  This seriously lowers their credibility."
Jesus would absolutely HATE Dan
Just don’t call them “pro-lifers”
"Dear Shelley, i admire you so much and have your back. i live in Amsterdam so cannot help you in person but i send love and want you to be safe, take care🌷🌷🌷"
It seems ironic that those folks that don't bat an eye at an unborn child being killed is OK but don't want to face the same fate .....if you chose death for someone helpless should you not be treated like a slug also .....
They don’t have to actually do anything or spend anything. They just judge and feel self righteous! They are what’s wrong with our country!
"This is so dumb. If abortion is that important to them, why don’t the Democrats propose an amendment to add to the Constitution protecting abortion rights? They have had 50 years to do it if it matters so much. But they didn’t. Make it constitutional if you want the supreme court to deem it constitutional. All this wahala you guys are giving the wrong people. Why aren’t you giving this hell to the Democrats for not coming up with legislation to defend this so-called right? SCOTUS did their job: simple. So ask your Democratic representatives to finish the job they have been stalling on for 50 years."
Praying for this woman. These people who are out spreading god’s truth and love are needed. More of us need to speak out against the truth of abortion. We are all image bearers of God and life in the womb is exactly that-life.
"How many of these protesters adopt kids, take in foster kids, be a big brother/ sister, take in kids who age out of the system? I bet none."
"If all the women who are/will be pregnant carry to term and put that child up for adoption, will all these protestors adopt all these extra children? Currently there are estimated 117,000 children waiting to be adopted. Those children are ALREADY HERE. We've all heard/read the horror stories of foster care. Let's take care of the kids who need us before adding to the population of abandoned children."
Ironic the the death count is higher from the pro-life side
"They are shells of human beings, useful idiots being used as political pawns in the lust for power."
"Privileged POS, the protesters that is."
Suprise suprise they are all religious fanatics trying to push the christian  version of sharia law ... these people should be locked up
"I REQUEST ZELENSKY 💙 OR PRESIDENT  PUTIN💚 or any christian in the world ❤️ TO ALWAYS THINK  THESE ,,,A,B,C,D,E AND Fs in your life , for a great future 👍
God bless you
Logic of  joy or peace in Life is very lies in a very moral knowledge of  life style.
That's as below
Everytime or every moment  or always when you do not love  ( careful that someone watches you ) the world ( eyes flesh lusts and pride )
You have lot of 
Peace 
Courage
A) God’s Children have no fear of death 💀 
But we will not die unless it is God’s will👍👍(great peace  in times of diseases or fearful journnies in life battle ,)
B) We shouldn’t be worrying about anything a lot because everything works together for good for those who love GOD ( marriage or death  or any good or humiliation or a great permanent honour,)
C) we must sacrifice our life at least for our children
The world is not  life  to us 
Imagine will a father be happy if he gets some privileges but not his children 👶 
Never 
So something if you don’t get 
Or something dangerous happens to you deliberately is for good 
Because we live for a fellow Christians or a christian family and children and overall for the  kingdom of God in earth ( government)
D) we must know that
Our heart ❤️ is filled with fear and guilty conscience for many reasons
1) for not following according to 1 john 2:-16
2) our unbelief ( jesus could not do Many miracles because of their harden heart and unbelief)
3) Our blind eye ( we don't avoid or cut our relationship with a bad CHRISTIAN,,) towards a bad companionship,
E) IF FOD DOESN'T COMFORT TOU WITH A BIBLE VERSE ,,,WE CAN NOT KEEP IT AS OUR POSSESSION,,
Invite shames to you  Before( you ) expecting a miracle we forget brotherhood and PRAYERS ( God will be glorified amongst brothers and church ,)
So tell your problems to the congregations MEDIAS ,people or governments,( but miracle is God's 😁😉😁)( In any situation what we can do we must should do it  never expect God to do what you should do)( Honour God respect God )
But life is God 
For example 
Lazarus death 
The news reached Jesus ( this means to prayer  and brotherhood )
Rolling down of the stone Take away the stone ( take off the grave clothes) John Gospel chapter 11;39 and 45 
Untie the bandages,,
For example
We got some shops in the middle of a city here ,
But managing to keep it with respect as a owner is very difficult,
But God comforted me with a verse 1 corinthians 1:-31
This shops to us are from our hindu ancestors so though God is helping us to keep it but we get lot of insults ,
Every time when I get a problem I pray God and go according to his counsel,,,
29 so that no one may boast before him.(BG) 30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus,(BH) who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness,(BI) holiness(BJ) and redemption.(BK) 31 Therefore, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”[d](BL)
So what 1 john 2:-16 
Says about not to love 
Lusts of the eyes ( because people or enemies watch it make it a issue as sin ,this we must be careful everytime at home and outside holy ,it means do not love sights ,do not turn back and see ,do not listen to what they speak even,)
Lusts of flesh 
Pride of life ( insults)
You must know that there are TEMPTATIONS common to all men ( PAUL TO CORINTHIANS ABOUT SINS OF ISRAELITES IN WILDERNESS,)
F) 
NEVER FORGET ALK ARE SINNERS
ECCLESIASTES 7
G) ALWAYS KNOW BA FACE OUR LIFE IS ETERNAL
NOT IN THIS EARTH,,
BUT HERE TOO GOD CAN RAISE HONOUR YOUR HEAD ,
Philippines 4:-8
Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
Amazing that adults have nothing better to do with their time than work towards enslavement of women.
"You are a blessing,  Shelly.  Thank you for what you do."
"US Americans see abortion like Abraham in the Bible killing his child.
In reality it is a tough and emotional decision by a woman to terminate a pregnancy, which, at this stage, is just a tiny lump of cells.
They forget that nature, what they call god, is the #1 pregnancy terminator."
That doctor is one sick puppy anyone who does this is one evil bastard 3rd trimester abortions are straight up murder why can't you acknowledge this this is what really gets people upset unbelievable
That doctor seems like he is having difficulty focusing at age 80. It should be illegal for doctors at age 80 to do life threatening procedures.
"Nice of her to show how out of touch these people are and how to confront them without being aggressive, especially when its old white men telling others what to do."
Please tell me how it is a good thing to kill your offspring? Twisted.
Why is it ok for pro abortion people to say what they want but not pro life?
Biden and his administration do nothing to fix this.  Remember that when voting.  We have been bamboozled.
"Jesus , I'm watching from Australia . . . .
 I admire this Lady's work so much she is amazing  . . . . 
but those Crazed Religious Meth Zombies hanging around need to be repelled . . . 

Civil War in USA is closer than ever"
Prayer doesn't pay for childraising! Do these holy rollers walk the walk or do they just talk the talk? I wonder how many of these protesters have adopted any children?
Now more unwanted children will be placed in the foster care system.
"Psalm 139:13-17
13 You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother’s womb.
14 Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex!
Your workmanship is marvelous—how well I know it.
15 You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion, as I was woven together in the dark of the womb.
16 You saw me before I was born.
Every day of my life was recorded in your book. Every moment was laid out
before a single day had passed.
17 How precious are your thoughts about me, O God."
"Seriously, Jackoffs for Jesus"
"You ever notice the people against abortion, should have been aborted."
You know those hospitals and fire stations where you can drop off unwanted babies? They are going to be swamped. I hope they can handle it.
imagine being forced to have a child you didnt want and that child end up being owned by the government and raised in  a foster prison
It cost what I read at minimum 10k to just deliver a baby in the US?  Correct me if I'm wrong. I mean if you want to deliver here a baby in the hospital without medical urgently you pay 350 euro. So maybe there it should already start. There is no reason why a normal delivery without any issues have to cost 10k
How far the moral compass have shifted when aidding murder is celebrated and discouraging one is jeered and mocked!!🤔🤔🤔
Much love and support for this brave woman!!!
Heroes come in all shapes & colors. God is the ONLY judge of us and even He is forgiving & compassionate. Leave that final word to the Almighty. Free will is for each & all of us! These women that help other women & men facilitate such a very hard & painful decision are HEROES!
"Shelley and Dr. Carhart are treasures. They must be protected, from these nutjobs, at all costs!"
Religion is a mental disorder.
"Is like a cult. I have never seen anything like this, is so backwards and uncivilized. Seriously, how many developed countries in the western world still bans abortion? You wonder why the US got completely slammed by even their allies such as UK, Spain, Canada and so forth. This is Year 2022, not the 1950's and certainly not the 1850's. And do you know what countries does the US sit right along side with now when it comes to abortion? Let's see, Abkhazia, Afghanistan, Andorra, Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, just to name a few. A pretty esteemed list huh? It would be a complete joke only if it was funny, but it isn't. People have no idea how far this has set the United States back. Wait until those 5 far-right extremist justices ban same-sex marriage and contraceptive. Then, they are really going all the way back to the Dark Ages."
Religion poisons EVERYTHING!
Someone should start a website exposing republicans who pay for their girlfriends and mistresses to get abortions.
"Religion, the great con of man"
"I did not see any ""beautiful"" gifts amongst any of those people she captured on video."
"lol, are they all old crusty white dudes?"
I actually die laughing when I happen to drive by that stuff

"Is CNN still broadcasting?  They must be trying to keep thier 500 viewers. Great work CNN. By the way have you heard about Hunter Biden and his money connections to the pathetic president?   Thats not news to you , but you  could tell us what color shirt Trump is wearing today.  Like most Americans we cant understand why you are even still on cable.  You suck"
Por lifers who want you dead... That almost as hypocritical as the Catholic Church itself!!!
Antiquated thinking. USA one of the most dangerous places to live.
"JESUS IS THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE... #YES TO GUN CONTROL! #END ABORTION!

Why cant people respect that GOD gave us all Free Will?
Abortion is wrong. Killing babies is wrong. Women celebrating abortions are crazy
"Elections have consequences,  and #DropBoxes have consequences...."
Abortion is the only medical surgery that insurers at least one patient will DIE
Y'all ought to ask Dan how many kids he's adopted. Just emotionally abusing women trying to do the toughest thing they'll ever do is performance art. God sees their horseshit.
That's makes sense.  ANTI ABORTION PROTESTORS use violence and guns and bonds to kill others.  These people are two faced.
"Yep I'd rather listen to a doctor that went through these procedures and how it actually is killing babies and went to Congress explaining what they do why he  quit and how horrendous it is, then hearing some typical fat sjw give a opinion."
Must be nice to not have to work and pay bills
People think they own God’s word. They do not know what God would do if on earth. Buy using their own interpretation is wrong for all. Judgement day is each individual day of facing our savior not protesters.
No one has a right to choose life except for god. NOBODY!!!
"Human cant protect their children in their worm..so the govt help them🤣🤣.
Why dont we abort these people who support abortion🤣"
How about you go and stop the bombing of crisis pregnancy centers? No you don’t care about that you only care about the ones who interfere with your belief who are actually just being friendly and speaking instead of bombing
"God bless these people who are trying their best to save the lives of babies! I obviously don’t agree with the violence against the the baby-killing clinics but changing giving the act of baby-killing the name of reproductive health-care is extremely deceptive and evil. The innocent person who is being killed isn’t given the choice to live. Also, I’m not religious in the least bit. I actually kinda despise religion… I just believe in God and I hate the murdering of babies. I wish abortions were completely overturned and made illegal nationwide."
Yet they see no problem with 19 Uvalde kids having no freedoms anymore.
Those disgusting orange clown cult members are terrorizing all those woman!!!
Get in my way protesters   and its you who won't be a le to bear kids.
"Vote blue if you stand …
For Woman rights 
To Save Our kids from getting kill by gunshots 
To Save our constitution 
To Save our democracy 
To save Unions 
To save Social Security 
To save Medicare 
AGAINST greedy corporations(the need to pay TAXES!!!)
Again racists Republican billionaires(they need to pay TAXES!!!)
VOTE BLUE MILLENNIALS!!!"
"I love how people who are ""pro-life"" are planting bombs, shooting these workers, and assaulting these women. Shows how this has nothing to do with life and everything to do with controlling women. I commend the abortion workers for standing up to these zealots."
Why does this protesters not think about all the children who will not be born becouse of lack of unplanned babys. No mother will let their doughters out of the house without having the pill. and older women will also make sure not to get pregnant if they dont really  want a child.
"Life does not begin with conception nor does it end with dearh by abortion or death after living life to age 70 years or more. I feel empathy for ignorant christians who are thoroughly confused between life/soul and lifeless body which is nothing more than dust to dust and ahses to ashes. All you have to do is read Bhagvad Gita a so called Hindu religion text but really is a Vedic religion/Eternal religion text titled as The song of God. Would I support abortion? No, but I would definitely not judge (Ye shall not judge others as their/christians book says) others who are compelled to make tha choice for whatever reason. I would rather spend life time workiong on issues like poverty, rape and incest etc. so that nobody have to make the choice of aborting a baby from the womb. Pl. join in liberating women."
"Maybe get a nice, tall fence.. ?"
Mind your own effing business old man.
"If I had the money, I would provide tall walls around the clinics. 
And provide large opaque shields.
Ans sink money into research on artificial wombs. That would take so much pressure off women who can't take care of a child. 
I know it wouldn't do much for those whose fetus had passed 😔."
The Word says that God has mercy on those of us who have mercy for others.
"Unfortunately, every child is not wanted. Are these anti-abortion Republicans willing to adopt all the babies (some with severe deformities or pay for the funerals of women whose pregnancy killed them) that women are forced to carry now that the Supreme Court thinks they can rule womens bodies with their overturn of Roe vs. Wade? Yeah, didn't think so. If Republicans were so concerned with children...why were they ripping children from their parents at the border when incompetent Trump was president? I look forward to your answer, Republican Bible thumpers. Thank you.
p.s. Not everyone believes in your religion. I thought we were supposed to have the right to our own beliefs...religious or non-religious. Quit trying to shove your beliefs down people's throats!"
"Margaret Sanger was the founder of plan parenthood. 
Margaret Sanger and I quote said 
“We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.”
Personally I don't support eugenics of certain ethnic groups let alone someone who had ties with the KKK.
Do your research and learn there true colors and agendas."
At last a peaceful protest
"I’m in Boston, where we had the shootings at two clinics in 1994 that left two people dead and so many traumatized. I worked at Planned Parenthood years later, where the protesters included a man dressed like a priest who’d throw himself on the ground and scream “momeeeeeeeeee!!!!” all day long. We could hear him clearly through the thick, bulletproof glass, and his screaming was joined by many others who’d be outside all day as well. The escorts were tireless and endured terrible insults and face to face confrontations. My job was public health research-related and I didn’t work in the clinic level, but experienced the same harassment whenever I left the building. It always left me jarred and worried that maybe one day someone would show up armed and dangerous. I can’t imagine what it was like for clinic patients to come in on those days. They included people terminating pregnancies, but also those getting medical care. And sometimes those patients getting abortions were protesters who happened to have unplanned pregnancies. The hypocrisy of pro-forced pregnancy supporters is revolting. Are they really going to save babies? Are they truly going to take care of them their entire lives? Do they support social services for women who are too poor to raise a child or who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest? Fuck that shit. Overturning Roe has darkened this already damaged country and is leading the way for other human rights to be taken away. For those who are pro-choice, keep fighting the good fight. And for those who aren’t, please consider the complexities of unplanned pregnancies with their rippling effects as well as the rights that are now very much at risk."
What is going to be the consequence of an unwanted pregnancy on the man's part it does take a man to make a woman pregnant so he should be paying the same price to walk away from the woman and not want the baby or the responsibility and she's forced to keep it
cant these women give up their baby for adoption?
Touche!  Thank you for being there.  ☂️☂️☂️
Trump cult are pro birth for a vote but are not pro life after kids get killed in school them and the NRA go out and celebrate how much money they made up the bullets and the gun
Abort her job
Abortion is wrong. Because it has no happy ending.
She doing
"The anti abortionists are not pro life.  They are pro violence and hatefulness.  Forcing every fetus to term is just mean spirited cruelty to women, their families, and society in general.  They will have to answer to God for their unwarranted malice."
My mom had an abortion- it saved her life and five years later she was able to have me. If that abortion hadn’t happened- if she hadn’t been able to get professional help- neither she or I would be here.
"I agree that abortion is wrong, but why doesn’t people protest against guns."
"If their is a chosen one up their in space somewhere? I doubt think he or she cares a hoot about all u religious nutcases, plus I don't think he or she or whatever that so called God of yours would approve of all u idiots thinking you should control a womens decision on her own body, so you people need to mind your own damn business and basically PISS OFF!!!!!!@"
"""We'll help you""

Really? Will you help financially? Will you help pay for their hospital bills? Will you help them raise their child? 

Why is it so easy for Christians to demonize women. Is that what your bible tells you to do?"
America is no to abortion. 👍
"True American heroes, both the doctor and the the young woman escort.🫶🏻"
"It's a 50/50 scernio 
50% of women want abortions and 50% don't believe in it and otherwise u wouldn't be here today on cnn's YouTube channel 🤪"
Try using a ball bat next time.
This woman needs to get a life
How many unwanted children have Dan or any of those clowns adopted? Anti-abortion protesters clearly get off on live trolling vulnerable women.
This lady is awesome.
"Absolutely stupid people, saying they are protecting life when they go in and shoot them! OMG, how effing ridiculous!"
"Does this woman need any money and where do I send it and how does she recruit.
If your religion needs a police force laws and a prison system then maybe there's something wrong with your ignorant and disgusting religion."
"Between you too, the one mocking is at lost."
How many children did Dan adopt? If none than he can shut up
"My 80 year old mother, who voted for Biden and absolutely hates Trump, cried when I told her that Roe was overturned. She said she thought she’d never see the day. She said she thought that Roe was the biggest mistake ever made."
These whacko protesters should mind their own business.
"Abortion opponents, you really have a special mentality - over there"
seeing that guy break out the ladder cracked me up a little bit
"Pro Life, Doesn’t means anti-abortion,it means we All have the Right to live."
All those old men should be followed home
The consequences are a joke
"I mean, why do these people only think about themselves, their ""rights and freedoms"" and stop caring about life AFTER a baby is born? What happened to the mass hysteria around wearing a simple mask on their face to protect others, or getting vaccinated OR OR OR....... REASONABLE GUN CONTROL?"
This escort  is a degenerate  🐃 BUFFALO!
"Infanticide insurrectionists are attacking our democracy. They're bombing pregnancy centers, rioting at the Vermont statehouse and threatening Supreme court justices. One was arrested trying to murder Justice Bret Kavanaugh. Will you hold these violent insurrectionist thugs  to the same standard as the January 6th protesters? If not you're hypocritical anti democracy domestic terrorists."
both sides are losers
She needs federal protection!  A true humanist...working against the threat of death every day!!  She is so much stronger than any Uvalde police officer!
11 physicians and escorts killed and what happens outside these clinics. How diabolical. There have been literally millions of babies murdered in those butcheries. Hardly a comparison.
"Somehow CNN missed the violent pro abortion riots going on in major cities. 
Almost like they have an agenda to keep you childless and earning money for thier corporate overlords."
Abortion is not something to be used as birth control!! Keep your legs closed or get fixed if you don't want to have children!!! Wonder how these people who are for abortions would feel if they were asked  if their mothers had a late term abortion with them  and they were survivors of that abortion  ended up having mental or physical repercussions of that decision their mothers made would feel!!! Don't think they'd like it too much if they did have the mental or physical abnormalities to live with for the rest of their lives!!!
Abortion is Murder!!!Wonder how these people who are for abortions would feel if they were asked  if their mothers had a late term abortion with them  and they were survivors of that abortion  ended up having mental or physical repercussions of that decision their mothers made would feel!!! Don't think they'd like it too much if they did have the mental or physical abnormalities to live with for the rest of their lives!!!
Wow they're going to be protesting about this for a while🤔
"They had 50 years to KILL innocent BABIES because of irresponsibly opening their legs. Now, it’s time to save future presidents, doctors, engineers, etc."
Okay these Republican protesters are starting to give violent and crazy that's why they want the gun laws to be the way they are so they can just go out there and choose who they want to kill based on who they like or who they agree with and that's crazy so I'm ready for you I'm going to Stand My Ground it's like you do but you walk up on me you come in my property I'm going to blow your f****** head off you guys got to understand you need to turn it down go see a doctor because you're mentally ill all of you stop protesting like this it's not doing any good because you're basically you say you care about life but you want to kill somebody and punish somebody for based on what they do with their lives that makes no sense you're just as guilty as them and honestly they're not guilty what they do with their body is they're right you need to go home and do what you need to do stop inflicting pain on the world because you wake up with an epiphany and want to change the world how you see fit based on some Republicans protest like I give the f*** about what you feel about how you think religion should be it has nothing to do with me and killing people because they don't agree with you is called psycho that's what you are
"Had she been aborted as a baby, she wouldn’t have been an escort of baby murderers."
They will insist that religion is harmless. Millions of scramble brained morons who do whatever they are told and attack in any direction they are pointed. THAT is the point of religion.
"It's funny ,
Why are there men protesting abortion.
I have never heard of any man giving birth to a child.
America is strange."
"So we’re not going to talk about all these white women calling the black Supreme Court justice a monkey and all type of names. Now white women know how it feels to be oppressed. I’m the words of Dave Chappell “come on white woman, you were in on the heist, you just don’t want to get burnt”. While your white man want to stick seeds in you the black community will be fixing our homes and wealth and no longer voting blue till reparations are received."
Funny yall keep re-uploading this. Slow news day CNN?
"Imagine America being a first world country is still sitting on it's women, talk about freedom and Democracy !!!!! What about Gun control laws????"
"Shelly Mann is a bad ass. Nothing but peace,❤️, & understanding to her & ALL woman who want THEIR right to choose. Fu©k SCOTUS !!! Impeach the 6 Catholics !"
"You know why I love Australia? Because these blokes get arrested for harassment. The police come, and take them firmly away, protecting the rights of women to choose."
The liberal left can loot and riot all they want and someone tries to save babies and somehow that's wrong
"not today, larry."
F cnn
"The next generation will be wondering if their parents really wanted them, or if they were a forced birth."
"Dan told us the truth, his truth anyways.. These people think they're scoring brownie points with their god. Really sick, they think harassing woman who are already making hard choices regarding their lives and their futures is going to impress their imaginary friend."
"“I’m 80, I DON’T NEED TO DO ABORTIONS ANYMORE…” that’s right, your days of profiting from killing innocent babies is almost over. Then, when you draw your last breath, time to pay the piper. You people call it Karma, Christians call it sowing and reaping, and deal you will."
All I hear is a message of love from the protesters
"If you support abortion, you will have a special escort when you reach the other side. Maybe the soul of a baby you helped to kill…"
"Anti-women nutcases are some of the most distasteful people in America. They're not Christian, they're hate mongers."
Women who support women in this way are heroes. Thank you to all the countless clinic escorts.
Why didn't she broadcast the nuts who scream at prolifers
"Woah, she's really nice to the women going in to end the life (or potential) of their unborn baby but super passive aggressive against the protesters..

Also, why is she checking for bombs? It's the opposite side that's usually using destruction and violence against women's health clinics.."
"THE MAGA SUPREMACIST COURT IS OUT TO GET YOU! We have been threatened by the rabid black-and-white supremacist, Clarence aka Ginni, who gloatingly informed us that abortion rights were just its first target. The MAGA Supreme Court shall strip away other civil rights asap by abusing the Constitution, possibly inciting a civil war!"
"if abortion is so great why would they need ""support"" walking to have it done. So it's horrible if the woman dies but not horrible if her baby dies"
"Planned Parenthood is SO MUCH more than just abortions.  They help with regular preventative care—they caught my cancer thanks to a routine Pap smear. They also do hormones for pre and menapausal women.   Too bad SO many people are IGNORANT about their services. Radical violent people need MENTAL HEALTH care.
Let us hope the rest of the world continues to value women’s healthcare and rights and does NOT listen to what is happening in the USA.  All my European and Aussie friends think the USA has LOST it.  Thank God their countries are NOT going back to the 1950s like the USA!"
Abortion is murder but don't harass these poor delusional women
Abortion are painful to babies during the process it is a mercy less feeling for the victim they really feel the pain before they die like some discarded trash but they can try again but not with the person who aborted them any members of that person's family ether
When you see a demon in the flesh. You never know it's a demon. This white woman is demon who comes in the name of rights.
The fact that a majority of them are men 💀💀
😲😲😲😲😳😳😳 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
"And the brains of the Americans after smoking marijuana apparently did not remain at all. The ban on abortions will lead to an increase in the death rate of women and to the birth of disabled children with Down syndrome, аligaphrenics, and simply children with physical disabilities. And this is the degeneration of the nation. The Down syndrome test: One blood test is done at 10-13 weeks. The analysis reveals over 80% of fetuses with Down syndrome. The name of the test is based on three proteins that are tested in the mother's blood: free estriol, alpha-fetoprotein, and b-hCG. It is advisable to do such an analysis at the end of the 16th week of pregnancy."
"The deciding Justices have ignored fundamental civil rights guaranteed by our Constitution and years of judicial precedent to advance a politically partisan agenda. There is no denying the fact that this is a direct attack on all women, and Black women stand to be disproportionately impacted by the court's egregious assault on basic human rights. We must all stand up to have our voices heard in order to protect our nation from the further degradation of civil rights protections we have worked so hard to secure. We the People who cares about Abortion and Gay Rights need to register and mobilize voters in what will be the most critical midterm election America has ever faced. If you're not registered to vote or know someone who isn't, now is the moment. This is no time for anyone to sit on the sidelines."" Now is the time for all current and former Dems Politicians, Celebrity Allies, Business Owners and organizations to hold RALLIES and TOWNHALL MEETINGS every weekends in Poor White, Latino, Black and Asians Rural Counties to educate voters on how Dems Policies are improving their livelihood. This will help get Dems Voters Motivate to vote in 2022. So Dems can keep control of the US House and WIN a SUPER MAJORITY in the US Senate with 61 Dems Senators. This is the only way for Dems to pass meaningful Police and Criminal Justice Reforms, Voting Rights, Comprehensive Immigration, Economy, Abortion, Gay Rights and Gun Control."
"Why is it that the women in the pro life group are way more attractive than the unhappy, toxic screeching sjws who don't need to worry about pregnancy anyway?"

This woman is crazy.. Confused girl.
"Just keep your legs together if you don't want a child because that's the first step in creating one everyone knows this but so many ignore it and take it out on the child,I had my child at 30 years old when I was financially ready so I know its not difficult"
Why do people care soo much about people killing their unborn babies . No one is going to loss anything. The only person who's is going to face the results of the abortion is the one who choose to do it  . People should do whatever they want .
"I don't think men should have a say in any of this. Unless, so the woman won't have to get an abortion they should claim the baby as their own.  Raise the baby, clothes the baby, feed the baby, send the baby to school!  You men just shut up.  You have no say in any of this!"
Way to go Shelley i follow you on TikTok! You are amazing!

Stay strong Shelley
Yet she needs to watch the liberal abortion lovers attack the Arizona capital building. She had one small group that she met and they were very peaceful to the ugliness put out by those in Arizona.
Why GET PREGNANT  in the first place when you have many choices of CONTRACEPTIVES to use and not be pregnant so that ABORTION won't become a CHOICE

They are doing the Lords work. Praise God for overturning the murder of babies.
Thank you dan!
"“We’ll help you” - so you’ll help the mother with the costs of raising the child? Or provide the legal fees for the mother to hire a lawyer to get away from an abusive SO who raped her 2 months prior and caused conception?  Or provide a home and food for a mother who will lose her job because she’s pregnant, a job she desperately needs to look after herself and other children?

Feeling immense gratitude for these dedicated people willing to risk their own lives for their patients. This brought me to tears. You are brave beyond words. Thank you for telling your story.
What a joke it's the pro choice that are clueless nut jobs. Nice propaganda CNN keep to what your good at I guess.
"Pro-""lifers"" bomb and kill already living people. The irony is beyond belief."
"Is it really that hard to use a condom, take a birth control pill, or tell the guy your spreading your legs for to just pull out. There are a plethora of ways to prevent pregnancy's. If you are to stupid to take basic precautions then you should deal with the consequences of slutting it up. Instead you want to murder unborn children because you wont take any personal responsibility."
I’m confused.  If pro-choice protestors can scream and harass people and threaten their lives these people also are able to peacefully protest.  I wouldn’t do it but they have the right.  And they are not threatening to kill people like others are currently who don’t agree with them.
I can care less if woman die from trying to kill their baby. If your willing to go that far to Murder your own little person you created by CHOICE then you deserve the consequences. Keep drinking that koolaid. It's clearly a satanic ritual and satan loves nothing more then to prevent life.
"You don’t know their stories either. You just know they came, and you hope they’ll appreciate your agreement that their babies should die. Pure feels."
Have fun women now you know what it's like to be a man in court powerless
I have always wanted to do this. Ironically I live in omaha
"If “liberals”/communists and demoncRATs are so interested in “democracy” and as they always say they are the majority, WHY ARE THEY AFRAID TO LET “DEMOCRACY” WORK (ie let the people vote on it state by state)?"
These pro choice people will pay a heavy price one day.
Pro-lifers killing people smh.
"Didn't god, like, rape a minor and then late-term abort him?"

Glad they banned it

"She is such a brave and caring person.  These people can be so vicious!  I tried doing this for awhile but couldn't take the hate and nastiness that these ""so-called"" christians spew.

After Roe passed these people repeatedly and violently attacked the medical personnel with bombs and guns & injured or killed many.  Some christians!"

"New idea for T-shirts can capitalize on both sides of the fence on the abortion protest, 

On the front of the T-shirt put

The Constitution does not protect abortion..
Why doesn't this so-called report mention the more-than-60 million American babies lost to abortion since 1973?
She is so strong
How is abortion essential when taking responsibility for your sexual behavior would take it unnecessary...and if not then live with the consequences of your *_choices_* like millions of men have to do every day.
We Just want the right to rip our babies out of our wombs at 9 months what is wrong with you people.
Men have every right to ensure that women behave responsibly. Men have every right to control female behavior. I feel like this point is completely lost on the pro-choice crowd. It's weird
Imagine being a baby murderer. Always using the straw man of women’s health. Saying this when over 92% of abortions are because of inconvenience.
I love her!!
A bomb? Why would an anti abortionist want to bomb a client full of people about to kill there babies if that's what they are protesting PRO LIFE. Means LOVE FOR LIFE.
Repost. Imagine trying to defend the murder of an unborn child... disgusting
This woman is assisting in torture and murder of innocent babies and passing it off as helping. God sees everything and he will have justice.
"Why doesn't somebody explain to these God-spouting anti-abortionists that, actually, and logically, God himself obviously approves of abortion! Doesn't he himself bring about the death of one in every four fetuses in the womb in what's called a miscarriage and/or stillbirth!"
"0:39 ""I think abortion is so terribly wrong. I have a responsibility to be here.""
Apparently, his responsibility ends after birth. Then the responsibility is on someone else. Anyone else but him.
Seems to me that a lot of these anti-abortion protesters are doing it to make themselves feel good & in the hopes of getting into 'God's' good graces."
"We're SO PRO-LIFE, we're willing to KILL people! We're so PRO-LIFE, we don't care if the mom dies, as long as she carries her (shame) baby. There, is that sanity?"
"If these protesters really want to help all these pregnant woman, then perhaps they should be contacting their representatives in government to reduce the cost of reproductive health care. Because it's doing most pregnant women no help by forcing them to give birth, and then having to spend $10,000 plus, just to give birth. If childbirth was free, or much more affordable, then so many pregnant women wouldn't get an abortion."
Wow crazy God loving evil people killing doctors and nurses became a woman decides what to do with her own body...
"American need to stop protesting for abortion rights  .The United States needs more unwanted, desperate people being born and joining their military.Stopping abortions is the best recruiting tool."
Are these children being validated when it's the 13 years old dad's father??? When fathers are sleeping with their children.  Where is the 13 years old rights who's protecting her?

I love this lady.. you know they might of overturned Roe vs. Wade... but you cannot stop  women having abortions
She treats that man like a toddler. Lol because he is

thank you God bless you and protect you
Communism is healthcare Soviet psychiatry BIDEN BUDGET PROPOSAL (DARPA) Tax the rich/corporations
thank you
Are these protesters going to take care of the babies that cannot be financially or emotionally supported? Maybe they should be trying to protect women from rape and incest by strengthening the laws and holding men responsible and also making sure that women receive adequate child support for the children that are already born.
Hopefully someone hits that target on his back
She is a special person for sure
“Nobody asked you.” I LOVE IT!!!! Go home guy and manage your own life!
"The only place she could be an ""escort""! Lol. No chance of her getting pregnant. Show how abortions are done! Large needle stuck into the brain, baby turned around and yanked out by it's feet. Might make you think twice. It's painful and barbaric"
"Thanks for your help. You are appreciated.
I’m glad you are unable to remain silent. We are being pushed around by a vocal minority who have no respect for anyone’s rights, instead trying to shove their ideas down the throats of the majority. 
Religious organizations indoctrinate their members to believe they are right and everyone should believe as they do without question. Personally, I believe all churches are cults and should be banned or at the very least, lose their tax exempt status . Throughout history, more people have been killed in the name of god than in all of the wars put together."
"A zygote isn't a child, it's a single celled organism. A fertilized egg isn't an ""unborn baby"" and terminating a pregnancy isn't murder. Why are we being subjected to the whims and imagined moral authority of religious zealots?"
"1.Who cares if she is fed  up they are trying to stop an unborn baby from being brutishly killed
2. They are presenting women with an alternate choice.
3. The anti-abortion protesters are not a danger to anyone.
4. Since 1977 millions of unborn babies have been killed. Why does she think adding a bit of humor to killing an unborn baby is appropriate."
You won't know that baby's heart nor will you ever hear THEIR story!
"I have never had an abortion, and I probably never would, although I’m too old to have children anymore. I was raised Catholic in a conservative family. That said, it is not my choice with another woman does with her body. I don’t like abortion but I 100% support another woman’s right to access one for her own body without judgement."
"Go do something about all the unwanted children already born and living in this country. All the kids with mental and physical disabilities born alcohol and drug addicted.  Use your energy and time to adopt or foster an unwanted child who has been mentally, physically or sexually abused. There are hundreds of thousands of them in this country and will be thousands more when abortion is banned and womens body's and choices are dictated by others beliefs and religion.  If you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem.  Step up or shut up your self-righteous rants and quit trying to dictate what I do with my body.  MY BODY! MY CHOICE NOT YOURS."
"Let's start protesting outside their churches, harassing the people as they go in. Not everyone agrees with their religious choice. If they don't respect the rights of others, to choose for themselves, they should expect no respect for their choice."
Why don’t these people get upset about all the fertilized embryos that are frozen
Men with little ones.
Love this article. Thank you for all you do and may you be safe!
"As you can see, these people are mentally challenged!  The RepubliCON party is full of mentally ill mass shooters, but what about these right-wing nut jobs protesting abortion clinics!   Seriously, get a life!  The mentally ill are a serious problem in the CONservative movement - bigly!"
Rape babies are an abomination!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm sure Dan always used protection when he had sex so their would be no  unwanted fetuses.
"All mental cases, huge ignorance mixed with religious fanatism, since they don't have a life they have spare time to meddle in other people's lives, the problem is that stupid people is very dangerous. She is very courageous for doing what she does."
"Yes, abortion is awful. But so is mandating the course of another person's life. (That is playing God, dearie.) So, being morally lazy, I leave it to the pregnant woman to decide."
"I bet you those antiabortion men are wife beaters
and during the beating,  they don't care where the blows end up and/or the woman receiving the blows"
"People that are anti-abortionists are completely selfish. They have no right to force their decisions onto other women/girls. They don't know the circumstances why someone would seek an abortion nor are they entitled to. The people in this video absolutely disgusts me. ""We'll help you."" ""The lord will help you."" If they cared so much about the well being of all children, we wouldn't have starving kids. We wouldn't have a shortage on diapers and formula for our infants. We wouldn't have so many kids in the system."
Ha ha ha you leftist are a joke and cnn is you daddy
Those grown ass men have nothing better to do
"Life does not ""begin"" at conception. Nor is it ""sacred."" Not even in their little book. How many people did God kill just because he didn't like them?"
Women like her are not lost but are finding their Voices and STANDING UP for those who cannot speak.
Everyone of those men don't have any right to say one fornicating thing about a woman rights I know they don't have any right because I'm a man a real one!
Thank you Shelly and Dr. C. We will not give up! And we WILL not back down! I plan to do my part and help women in need still as well!
Any man who doesn't believe in abortion should believe in s vesectomy and go get one.
"Wow, 11 people killed! How many babies killed during the same time? Babies are people too. Their not puppies. You don’t have a constitutional right to an abortion. You don’t have a right to kill anyone. No one does. Now that you have watched this video, I challenge you to watch 3 abortion videos. One of each trimester. Won’t be hard. You should be able to find them here. Take a look."
"What most of these people don't realise is that some form of abortion has existed in almost all societies for many centuries - whether they worked or not.  Women have always sought to not have children they don't feel they can look after, or from rape, or incest.  Our body, our choice."
"What gives those people the right over a women's body, the Supreme Court f**ked up, the republicans are gonna lose the mid-terms, nothing like a woman scorned, people vote for democracy, republican dick-tators deserve to lose."
"Religious fanaticism &  a lack of education -.- #murrica at its ""best"" 🙄

IF you have a schlong & bag between your legs, you should have *NO SAY WHATSOEVER* in what a women does with *HER* body!"
Great work Shelly. I love the protesters comments “we’re here to help you”. Like they’re offering to pay the $275k it takes to raise a child. Or erase the potential horrible situation the woman might be in.
"No egg must go unfertilized, otherwise it is murder."
"Ahhhh, I like this tactic. Yes my minons! Our lord will get his sacrifices one way or another!"
I stopped by the local planed parenthood and asked the men if they had ever cracked open an egg and found blood… when they answer affirmatively I asked if they understand that it was because the egg had been fertilized… they said they understood… so I asked if they were speaking to young men about not exploring their sexuality where they had no intention of staying??? They wanted to explain what they were doing there and refused to answer my question… they all appeared to be pedophiles to me.
More than 1M democrat voters have switched to the republican party since Biden entered office.  Red typhoon coming in November!

"My mom wanted me aborted, and I wish I had been.  My ""pro-life"" dad wouldn't allow my mom to get an abortion.  I was born into a family who didn't want me.  I was abandoned by my mom, then beaten and raped by my dad.  I was already suicidal by the age of 8.  I spent a childhood being abused, neglected and without love.  Abortion would have been more merciful."
Libs of TikTok is great
"Why do people think it's any of their business! 🤔 NOYB, NOMB."
I love her
"Abortion is not healthcare because it is not caring for the health of human life that is not a part of the woman’s body (and has their own DNA). I’m an unplanned mom, I know how scary it is, but killing is killing. Murdering a pro-abortion person is hypocrisy; but saying you do not harm while engaging in abortion is hypocrisy as well. Both unplanned mom and child matter ♥️ 
Anger and jealousy can create sinful motives like wishing death upon people and I am sorry that pro-abortion and anti-abortion people have faced that. Abortion is violence."
I love how it's always old men.  Why don't they go volunteer in foster care.  Hypocrites!
It's hilarious that liberals all of the sudden know what a woman is.  What a bunch of bozos.  Truly amazing.
Stop
"I don’t get these people, no one should be so invested in how others live their life, mind your own business. You go live your life the way you want and I will live however the f… I want. The only one who has anything to say about your body is YOU!!!"

"If you think abortion is a “Constitutionally protected right”, give me the citation.  (Abortion was Federally protected, but never Constitutionally.)

Pro-abortionists talk about the woman’s body and the woman’s life.

The fact is, there are TWO LIVES involved, but pro-abortionists rarely say anything about the baby’s life. 

I am not a lawyer.  As a layman, my reading of the Constitution’s Article 1, Section 8 and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments leads me to believe THE ISSUE BELONGS AT THE STATE LEVEL, NOT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

“OVERTURNING ROE DOES NOT STOP ABORTIONS.”  IT RETURNS ABORTION TO THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS.

SOME HAVE SAID, “ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE.”  Sometimes IT CAN BE, BUT MOST TIMES IT’S NOT.

The State of Florida requires women getting abortions to complete a questionnaire disclosing why they are getting one.  

1.4% were for Incest, Rape, Fetal Abnormality or for the Mother’s Life or Health.
6.3% were for “Social or Economic”.
92.3% was “No Reason (elective).

The following is from “U.S. Abortion Statistics”, https://abort73.com/abortion_facts/us_abortion_statistics/ 

Percentage of 2019 Reported Abortions by Weeks of Gestation* (CDC):
≤6 wks	7-9 wks	10-13 wks	14-15 wks	16-17 wks	18-20 wks	≥21 wks
42.90%	36.40%	13.40%	2.90%	1.70%	1.60%	1.00%

So my points are these:
•	92.7% of abortions occur within the first 13 weeks.
•	98.6% of abortions are for Social, Economic and Elective reasons.
•	Life begins at conception. Conception occurs when the sperm enters the egg. The zygote is the only cell in a woman’s body that has different DNA.
•	WOMEN GOT ILLEGAL, DANGEROUS ABORTIONS BEFORE ROE.  THE REASON FOR LEGALIZING ABORTION IS SO THEY CAN GET ONE LEGALLY AND SAFELY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME."
America the laughing stock of the world.
"I just witnessed the birth of fascism in the U.S. I remember when the States criticized Iran for combining fundamentalist religion and politics. Full circle. But it’s always different when you guys do it, isn’t it?"

AS THE GREAT G CARLIN SAID MOST WHO OPPOSE ABORTION  COULD  GET SEX IN THE FIRST PLACE ( PARAPHRASED OF COURSE)
Dude's got more issues than the National Geographic
why do men protest do they have a baby to kill ? and abortions isnt health care or birth control its for women raped and incest and going to die if they have a child thats it. if women want abortions as a birth control keep there legs closed.
"Religious zealots, really ridiculous people. So Dan is doing this to secure a place in Heaven?"
Baby killers rule!
I’m prolife but I respect there decisions it’s there body’s
What happens now???
Shero 🙂
"My thoughts and prayers for the under educated humans that believe taking away human-rights saves lives. Well bless your heart, it is simply human trafficking!"
I want to be like you!
"Why doesn't the global monopoly just make another virus, but one that attacks people who bring their babies to term."
State Run propaganda at the CNN.
"We know they are good at making viruses to manipulate elections, but are they any good at making viruses that attack unborn babies."
Abortionist are the insane ones.....
insanity beyond insanity
YouTube is nothing more than a State Run Entity that antagonizes the people to see which ones will stand to be persecuted or prosecuted for what they say. King OBiden wants his opposition in small cages.
Well bad things happen when plutocrats manipulate presidential elections with weaponized viruses.
"what is it with all that god crap in the states, demo should be in front of the church, to ban that mind poison. and it should be a crime to teach children that crap."
Look at her speak in slow motion. She is a devil in human form.
The devil dresses very nicely when given a platform to speak at CNN.
Thank you Shelley. We're grateful to have people like you in this country.
These abusers need to get a life. A friend of mine is still pissed after 38 years for a “6 week” procedure. Her escort took his own life.
That lady that said we will help ..will be the same person complaining about her tax dollars is paying for welfare.
Thanks CNN for showing us how crazy the baby killers are.
I'm going to work at the clinics as an escort asap.
She is baffled as to why so many people want to save the unborn. Hell on earth we are in.
"She is cuckoo for cocoa puffs, and dead fetuses."
Somebody get this woman a life she can take before she goes postal on the anti-abortionists.
It’s obamas fault he didn’t codify Roe. He had the majority and said it wasn’t a priority
This good and brave woman gives me such hope in these dark times
She hates anti-abortionists because nobody would ever get her pregnant. She would have aborted it anyway.
"Are these the “thoughts and prayers” people protesting outside these clinics???  Hummmm, where else have I encountered that and observed how utterly, absurdly ineffective that approach is….."
“Help”?  Bullshit
Crazy how the world has become ok with these acts against the unborn… these acts will go down in history as being barbaric and inhumane.
go home and clean your filthy homes….pay your bills….balance your check books…MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS‼️
Loved that old man. So much wisdom
"Abortion is not the answer, water causes miscarriage look it up."
the man protesting a woman's right to choose...when he meets his maker...I hope he likes eternal fire....
"Dan should Feel Guilty for judge others and not doing the actual Help to them but instead of passing his own judgement. When they Pro-life starts actually Financially Help from the before birth to the actual adulthood of age 21. They have no say on the women who makes this difficulty choice. And Ironically they are the one that is more Violent. How interesting??? and all history of men kind have proven when a Men start doing things in the name of God, is nothing but an excuse to start a war."
An anti abortion shooting is the biggest oxymoron there is. “We preserve life. If you don’t like that we will kill you!” 🤔🤔🤔
"Irony:
Democratic cities will be burned down by democrats in Democrat states where abortion will still be legal."
I know all those people protesting against abortion clinics are singles with cats and dogs with no adopted kids at home
THANK YOU SHELLY!  You are the most wonderful beautiful person EVER!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!
I don't see how everyone think we free when in reality we slaves on our government we not diferen from Cuba with Fidel Castro the government has control of our bodies and the government is going to have control what to eat and how much just like Cuba
And I say hey (HEY) what a wonderful kind of day. They've ABOLISHED ROE V WADE. So you all better deal with it 🙂
"Jordan Klepper said it best when he said ""How many have you adopted ?"" to the anti-abortion protesters."
Whatever happened to not judging? Religion is the biggest cult in the world! They don’t even understand the Bible! Don’t reply unless you want to hear about your mama!
"11 people have been killed in anti abortion attacks?  Strange,  in abortion 100% are killed!"
Killer a  baby no one Bat on eyebrow no one gives a shit no thoughts and prayers  you kill a six-year-old everybody shits their pants they’re prayers and thoughts all over. There are no difference they are both are children  they both had names.
"We know what happens INSIDE the clinics, babies being murdered"
Bunch of Bible thumpers. Organized religion has been the scourge of humanity.
"Didn't Kentucky pass a law mandating ultrasounds before abortions? And from what I read, ultrasound techs put notes like ""hi, mom"" and ""please don't kill me"" on the screen.

But yeah, let's talk about how ""both sides are the same."" Congrats, white women. You voted for this. Own it."
"“They ain’t seen nothing yet, women are going to control their bodies no matter how they try to stop them""

It's ironic that women who seek to ""control their bodies"" manage to have unwanted pregnancies."
So sad so many women don't even feel that life inside them is real. My daughter thinks it's not even real until it's a fetus. These are unborn children.
She has more balls than texas police. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Standing up to these anti-woman loons, is a very dangerous job."
I hope this guy isn't depending on this getting him into Heaven!
Notice it is men mostly. What do they know?
"The hypocrisy of the anti-abortionists is clearly evident in that women who said about ""the right to choose life"". Exactly - a CHOICE, not an imposition by others as to what happens to your body. If you don't like the idea of abortins, fine - don;t have one, that's your choice. But if you want to have an abortion, far better to have one at a legally licensed clinic than to go to  back street abortionists. 

Also, all the death-threats against clinic staff - how do the anti-abortionists not see how hyprocritical they are, are they really all THAT stupid?!"
"Clearly the US Government does not acknowledge the fetus as a person, or it would be a tax deduction."
This makes me cry
"I've NEVER SEEN ANTI ABORTIONSIST IN A Black or Brown Community. Hmm, we know why; they don't care about infants of color."
Is it better than liberals of Tik Tok?
TikTok is poison. And China is stealing your information off that app.
"Also, assault by mutual consent means that “two people are voluntarily fighting each other,” so she was likely just as guilty in that matter"
"If these ""ANTI ABORTION PROTESTERS really want to make a difference in the lives of women that don't want to have an abortion, TAKE THE FEMALE IN AND SUPPORT HER 100% AND THEN ADOPT HER CHILD. IF THEY/YOU CAN'T DO THAT, STFU! AND STAY AWAY! 
OR
MANDATORY VASECTOMY FOR ALL MALES AT AGE 15. THAT WONT HAPPEN BECAUSE ITS ALL ABOUT D..K WHEN IT COMES TO MEN. THEY, THESE OLD AZZ MEN WOULD RATHER HARASS   WOMEN OUTSIDE OF A ABORTION CENTER. 
UNTIL THESE ANTI ABORTION PROTESTORS ARE ADOPTING CHILDREN THEY HAVE NO SAY SO!
ITS TOO EASY TO STAND OUTSIDE A CLINIC AND HARRASS
MAN UP! WOMAN UP AND  FINANCIALLY  SUPPORT THE WOMEN YOU ARE HARRASSING AND GIVE THEM ANOTHER OPTION! 
If not
Back the f..k off!"
“We’ve gotta clean up these leaves and trash!” … proceeds to blow the leaves and trash on to the street. Here we are witness to the wonderfully evolved liberal mind 😂
"""She was fed up with anti-abortion protesters, so she broadcast them on TikTok"" thereby reminding us that abortions are the terrible consequence of #TerriblyHungry people misbehaving terribly like #Jan621 Insurrectionist #HangryDJT and motivates us to redouble our efforts to #ConvinceItForward to stop being #Hangry in hopes of stopping the #MourningInAmerica"
"Really guys, really?  The gender of the species that can't seem to keep it in their pants is anti abortion?   Really, maybe you should get a life."
Where is the separation of church and state? The churches should start paying taxes on their greed. Sanctimonious hypocrites!
"As a pregnant man, I am so glad that I live in California where I have the right to terminate my child. When it comes to my child, it’s my body my choice! Except for vaccine mandates, I need the government to control me in that aspect"
"Shelly, good for you. Thank you for helping those poor women. How dare those people impose themselves on others."
"These people have no right to stand outside the clinics and ""protest"". If people were stood right outside some Church entryway doing this, it'd be different."
Now show what goes on INSIDE abortion clinics!
"You are trying to protest ""murder"" and then murder the Dr. and Nurses. Doesnt even make sense."
"A note to the woman, (I think Christina) it’s not “a right to choose life” if there’s no choice"
I love that pin “Not today Larry” with the ladder lmfao 🤣
They want to save kids from being aborted but can't save them from being killed in a mass shooting in schools 🙄
why not just put a 12 foot fence around the property
CNN: “We’re ideologically left-leaning and it shows in ALL we do!”
Nonsensical News!!
"Mad respect for this woman! Yes, Shelly! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻"
I can guarantee none of those anti-choice idiots is a foster or adoption parent. Useless creeps.
It's  so easy to sit in an ivory tower and pass judgement on others.   It should be mandatory that politicians contemplating withdrawing funding or passing laws go and live in the trenches with the very people their decisions are about to impact.  You can pass all the laws you want but it won't stop abortion.  It just puts it back into the alleyways.   Laws should be based on the way the world is not on an ideology of what we would like the world to be.
It should be the police that protects the patients from that kind of harassment !
"This is the best day in American history. 
I was hoping they ban abortion in California and all states as well.
Babies are precious. Let's save the babies and our future generations.
BTW, these women are not ""patients"". They are just shameless and promiscuous baby-killers."
those pro lifers killing people again???  I guess that is ok because they believe in the bible  WTF
God gave us free will he gave us free will to choose abortion or to naught choose abortion…. About to have a government to rule that you cannot have an abortion even if it’s all right baby goes beyond the pale United States says it’s the land of the free but is it really?
CNN already posted this Abortion Karen video.
"It's unusual to be this obsessed with any topic, but all of these protestors aren't Christians. I'm not a psychologist, but there has to be something else going on here.

If abortion was supposed to be one of the biggest evils in the world since the liberation of the concentration camps, they should be happy that _Roe_ was overturned.

Now that it's outlawed and the clinics are shut down, will they have to go protest nightclubs, hook-up apps, condoms, and pharmacies that dispense contraceptives?"
"So, these people hear otherworldly voices telling them to attack women seeking health care services and that's not a reason to have them committed and medicated until their hallucinations and delusions stop?
  (Even if they think her choices are ""sinful"" can they not by definition be forgiven by the same prayer we are all supposed to be forgiven by? Why is this one area so unforgivable in these people's opinions?)"
Safe to say she wont be having an abortion
"A dreadful example of how America's obsession with 'free speech' results in harassment, and worse, of vulnerable women and staff at the clinics.  

In London, where I live, there is a Marie Stopes clinic near to where I live.  The idea that women using the service would attract any unwanted attention from members of the public is absolutely unthinkable.

Those people who are picketing the  clinic in Mississippi represent the worst of religiously motivated meddling in other people's lives.  They never change the choices that individual women make, and they spend all of that time virtue-signalling to their God when the could be doing something useful  to contribute towards their communities.  Pious narcissists - yeuch!"
"These anti-abortionists want nothing to do with universal healthcare, which would provide protections for children.  These are the people that are ""fry em"" when any black man is convicted of murder.  The straight-line pedigree of these people go back to holding black people as ""property"".  The hypocrisy of these cretins is astounding."
"Republicans protest against abortion but they don't protest against the guns killing all these children. And they don't protest against the abusers, rapist and killers of the now living unwanted children. Republicans walk away from these children,they don't care about them once these children need help. ""Christians"" pretend they care when they don't."
This woman is a hero.
All sad little people with no lives and head full of evangelical show-biz preacher psychobabble.  All of them should be dragged off and put in a mental institution.
They killed a doctor in the name of life. Makes total sense. I guess as much as being “pro life” and defending the use of AR-15 and the death penalty 🤪
Shelly is a super hero!❤️❤️❤️
"I don't think I'd last a day out there. Joe would trip and fall, Tom would notice his tires mysteriously slashed , ya know? The paperwork alone would make it a pain!"
"Let’s talk about hypocritical. What about The Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004 also known as the Laci and Conner ACT: is a United States law that recognizes an embryo or fetus in utero as a legal victim, if they are injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed federal crimes of violence.

So a mother can terminate her pregnancy but if a man murders a pregnant women he’s charged with double murder. Let’s start holding these doctors & mothers that go forward with abortions. 

USA is heading in the right direction. You don’t like it. Leave please"
The fat gate keeper will get what she protected.
I do not feel bad these killers were killed.  They got what they give.  Seams about right
"🎉 Perhaps ... Start a ""Mother and Baby Life"" program  (MABL) create a sign up list offer it to folks that care standing outside clinics or at protests. This will offer a more positive outlet that can really help 🤗 That way we can sign up to personally help with all medical costs, therapy, travel, diapers, foods, education etc until the baby can find a job around 18 yrs old. This list would agree to help with all costs including if the baby grew up as an invalid, then their pledge would automatically extend to cover further than 18 yrs of age.  This would give an opportunity in truth for folks to prove how much one really cares ... and or ... give folks a chance to think a little deeper before commiting their whole Spirit.              *Remember as humans being the best humans we can be ...  we must deserve the right to change our minds in a moments notice upon new and valid information"". Add this  to the top of the MaBL financial sign up list.😊 Must also consider in the future we will lose much land mass as oceans rise. And Environmentle changes  will be Forcing all these then adult  babies to crowd together in smaller useable lands, also creating less food and drinkable water. 😳🥺 Remembering the horrific results of having too many rats in a cage social experiment. 🤔 😱         So this may be one of those questions that has no real answers and perhaps designed to create separation and chaos.
A  Divide and conquer type question. 🤔 Build the list. And as folks, politicians and judges sign up to this Baby and Mother Life Financial Help program  others may follow ... Or not. 
But either way it will give folks a chance to ponder a little further. 🙏💙🙏💙"
She needs to be expired.  Wait.. that would be murder.  Same thing they are doing.
"Mrs. Shelley, you are HERO!!"
"I thought God gave people free will??  
Yep, the sinful internet says he did!

How hypocritical are those sickos who killed those people at those clinics.... 

She should find out where they go to church, and protest there with a ton of people every Sunday, with signs and banners saying things like; God does not exist! -  Do you still believe in fairy tales? 
See how they like that kind of harassment on their door step..."
Ignorance is what religion is about. Keep people ignorant to control them and take their money.
Anti abortion protestors: the epitome of why we need abortion.
Group idiots
"UNWANTED PREGNANCIES are going to cause TRILLION of DOLLARS in FOOD STAMPS, MEDICAID each year, STARVATION, NEGLECT, HATRED, ABUSE and DEATH. UNWANTED BABIES will be ABANDONED in hospitals. Children are precious in the sight of God. What will happen when these babies are born and they have to suffer??

Let face reality. The woman who murdered her 4 children in Georgia by stabbing and injured one, then set house on fire."
"The dumb Supreme Court just gave the Democratic Party super majority in November and I love it.

Let's just stop having sex with men.. That's it. That's the post.
"Get yourself an open carry, protect yourself so, you can continue to help these other women who NEED YOU!!! $50.00 fine for assaulting you is a slap in the face and I'd be dam good and sure to protect myself!"
That man spewing the love of God' is probably one of the most Godly people you will know. He loves everyone. But! he is also very specific about who and what he hates.
Okay an abortion before the 12 weeks ok but the third trimester? Now I understand why yall got some serious problems...your killing full blown babies yall..and you pray this wakes people up? Are you fucking mad?!
"The minute an unwanted child is born, these ""people"" want NOTHING to do with paying for the support of the child SO, I think they ALL need to STFU and MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS! GO HOME, you hypocrites!"
Are you going to support this children that for some reason or another have to be aborted. It's not your business stay out of it. Unless you're going to raise it. And if you hurt anyone working there or going there for help your committing a worse crime. You should go to jail.
"Why do we focus on the symptoms rather than the root of the problem? The constitution lacks the power to motivate citizens to collaborate rather than be antagonistic towards each other. Issues of abortion, civil rights & question of guns & mass shootings are symptoms of the disease of disunity."
How come daddy in the sky just doesn't come down and stop it??
"Omg these people are ridiculous, had no idea women had to put up with these freaks, abortion is a woman’s right, a women decision, make Dan go down and look after some street kids, junkies kids, alcoholic,s, foster care kids, now adults and on the streets, ho look after them, pay all thrre costs, feed them, look after there medical needs schooling jobs cloths etc, then see how you feel about taking a woman’s right away, a families right husband and wife right, and the rights of raped children, some as young as 9yr old,"
Holy shit these people are out of there collective minds!!! religion has fucked up more people than any war!!
Do these people ever ask themselves what is it about our society that makes abortion necessary?   Why not invest their time giving support within their communities to lower the need for abortion?
I think that we should be able to make our own choices.  If women can’t make a choice then man should lose a right too.  That’s life.  If you kill someone who is pro choice that makes you a killer too.
"Something that baffles me is this: if the constitution didn't give me the right to an abortion, how can it take it away? P.S. I am way past reproductive age but I am not way past caring for the health of young women."
"CNN posting old sht zombies will eat up. This “woman” or “bleeding person” is harassing protesters for exercising their 1ST Amendment RIGHTS. There’s protesting and then there’s reactionary harassment and infringing on people’s right to protest. If she wants to counter protest no one objects, unless she’s harassing and intimidation by getting in people’s faces, personal space and trying to dox or threaten with recording them for political intimidation."
Thank you for caring!
They should be trespassed and not be aloud in a certain mile radius. Where are these protesters when men rape children or woman???
abortion is only keeps woman promiscuous
"LGBTQ don't get pregnant
why they protesting?
it's like a vegan protesting McDonald's is not serving hamburger"
Men need to shut up.  They know nothing of what it's  like.
Good job Shelly. We need more genocidal activists protesting against people who value life! You must feel so proud. Keep getting in ppls personal space. Remember the best way to express your view is to antagonize and promote violent confrontation
"Sooo many OLD MEN!?!?! And what's wrong with that picture... Two things! Firstly, MEN don't have wombs and won't get pregnant hence they will never have to decide on having an abortion or not! Secondly, they're OLD and had they indeed had wombs, they'd be barren at their over-ripe old age!

Guys! Give! It! Up! 'K?

Women gets pregnant, have to bear the fetus to term, deliver it and take the lion share in nursing and raising the kid! Yes, men are part of the process: 100 percent in conception and of varying degree thereafter.

Sooo... It's basically just the woman who can make a decision here! If she chooses to consult with the man whose genes contributed the other fifty percent of the fetus, it is HER choice!

No man has a right to decide in this matter! Men don't even have the right to demand a right!"
I think these people should lawfully be responsible for adopting every baby they “save”. Bet they would sit down re-evaluate.
Shelly wants to make the choices for her own body. Looks like she could use some help with that.
Why are these abortion escorts wearing rainbow vests??? This is a cult
Why do all these women advocates look the same?!?
WTF! Assault with mutual consent??? I don't think anyone consents to assault normally. Crazy report!
Old white man looking like fools screaming at women
Old white guys protesting abortion...interesting. 🤔
How do you sleep at night? You escort a woman to murder her own child! You have no idea the pain women suffer life long with guilt and regret from abortion. It ruins their life also. Stop playing God. You say it’s the longest walk into the clinic. Maybe the woman needs to rethink what she is doing. Abortion or escort we all stand before God in HIS judgement. You can explain to Him why you escorted a mom to how many deaths of babies? He will judge you. Hell is for eternity.
"Remember who voted to take away your individual rights women of America and vote those people out of office,  America needs progress not regress you outnumber pro life loud mouth holy rollers now prove it on voting day"
"Abortion is a woman right, your body your CHOICE period!!!"
"Their REAL focus is on demanding other people have the same belief they do. That goes against everything our Constitution stands for. ""Pro-Life"" is just Republican rhetoric BS. If they actually cared about ""life"", they'd make major changes in our gun laws. They'd make sure ARs are not available to the public. They'd have a minimum age of 21 for buying a gun. They'd have instruction, licensing, and safety standards for gun owners. But no, they just want to control women and tell them how they can live their lives."
Religious zealots are the most dangerous people on earth! History proves that over and over! Ask any psychiatrist or experience cop and they'll tell you the same thing like my lieutenant told me. They can justify anything in the name of their God murder suicide giving up their kids for sex letting their children die anything. A religious nut stabbed a psychiatrist I worked with in the neck
Little do they know they are setting a great example of why abortion should be legal.
People are bold these days.
"Why no teporting on what left groups have recently been doing at different facilities? I get it, can't drop the agenda. In reality BOTH things should be reported, but won't be on CNN or Fox, because they each have their audience. Local news is more likely to have both types of stories"
"Well, look at it this way: if these clowns believe that embryos have a soul, then an abortion is helping them get back into Heaven as fast as possible. Isn't Heaven better than Earth?"
Religious Christian nuts. Just like those Islamic Crazies. Get a real job and go fix your family. Feed the poor and hungry who are already out there if you want to help. Your Jesus wont forgive you for your sins in life if you impose yourself on others. You make it worse for yourself.
"Take baby clothes 
Abortion is not a type of birth control

Three people died but millions of baby were killed but who cares"
I can't imagine this morbidly obese and terribly homely women ever needing an abortion. So why does she want to kill other people's babies? Jealousy?
"A fetus is not viable outside of the mothers body.
Most fetuses become viable between 24 to 28 weeks. 
To think that a lump of cells can live on it own in an incubator is DELUSIONAL.

These people are the minority of the American society. They live on the fringes of society.
They do not have the right to  SHAME and BLAME women seeking an abortion. 
Especially MEN who don't know what it's like to be pregnant or go through the pain associated with giving birth. 
Nor do they have a clue about the huge hormonal changes a woman goes through during a pregnancy and after giving birth.
Hormones that can cause postnatal depression and worse postnatal psychosis were either the mother kills the baby, kills herself, or both. It never ends well. 
After giving birth it takes  time normally it may take 6 months to a year, or even longer depending on your health and whether there were any complications during delivery.
During this time a woman's libido is usually very low.
Not all husband's or boyfriends are thoughtful enough to wait before demanding sexual intercourse something that is the last thing on a woman's mind. 
You can take progesterone only birth control although it can affect your milk production and  needs time to start working. 
Men can use a condom, but most men don't like using them.
It should be at least 6 weeks before you resume sexual intercourse."
"OMFG. Just let people be! 

If you don't agree with their decision that suits you."
Vote Democrats into extinction in the midterm elections period!!
And yet these men and women who protest do nothing for the born! Ignorance is not an excuse for hate and violence!
These anti abortion fanatics don’t appear to be to clever…
Stay strong.
“And their right to choose life.” That’s not a choice! The right to choose is choosing not to carry the fetus to term.
And they claim is the other way around… I have no doubts the attacks to the pro-life clinics were made by themselves to look like victims.
Baby lives matter
"I'm not an expert on the topic, but it should be the womens choice plain and simple."
Why don’t these pro life people petition their politicians to increase food stamps for families with children if they care about kids so much. So many children in this country go to bed hungry because their parents wages are low and food stamps are too low to feed kids enough and nutritious foods.
"They will murder people someone's family member in the name of pro life.
I  am  pro life but women should have that right to choose their body there choice.  That was also the chant of the same folk who did not want to wear masks to save lives or get vacancies again to save lives."
They have the right to protest. Be safe. Arrest those who violate the law. Lets Go Brandon
the religious are the worst.
"Even God gave us a choice.  Personally, I do not believe in abortion.  but my beliefs have nothing to d with another woman's right to make this personal decision for herself."
Mercy...you're being judgemental
What a God sent protector. Blessing to you always😇😇
IDC how much they say they're are passionate about religion or thier skewed beliefs. I truly believe imo these anti abortion protesters enjoy being antagonist. Pathetic
"These people confuse me. What do they think happens to these so called babies?  Do they just disappear? Since they believe it is a child from fertilization that means if the child has been aborted it returns to the arms of Jesus. The child’s soul returns to God, in heaven the home and place  we are all wanting to be.   They make no sense. Life begins and ends with breath"
Gun shops need to be protested with as much vigor.  The irony is off the charts
"Good for this lady! 
Of course these women have already made their decision, it is ridiculous that these pro fetus people yell at them."
"Dear ❤️ President Putin,
Adultery is a sin 
But fornications are deadly sins .
Adultery is sin with a person whose husband is not informed about his wife’s wilful sin .
Fornications are very common in relationships.
Fornications brings diseases in body .
Sometimes fornication is also dangerous says Hebrew ,
Adultery may create bitterness and lead to murder .
So relationships are safe .
Your war with Zelensky is not a great 👍 sin according to the Bible.
Because Ukraine 🇺🇦 people are our Christians.( relationships)
But I request you to stop the war with Zelensky with a condition stop joining Zelensky in NATO.
1 John tells a safer life style .
1 John tells  us to live in this world according to 1 John 2;-16
Lusts of eyes 
Lusts of flesh 
Pride of life 
Because there is fear ,death and loss of father’s (God’s ) love .
So not only we shouldn’t love 💖 it but we mustn’t  even pray for those Christians who do these mistakes in their life.
But how to make our relationship while in body?
It is only with Christian families.
Take example Jude Boaz and king David 
The great sinner ( from our point of view) David the great king 🤴 sin was only with a Jewish woman but her husband was a gentile.
As a king 🤴 and Jewish leader he might be pitied for her because her husband failed to love his wife .
But Christian family is safe .
God bless you 
🙏🙏🙏
Note ;-King David managed the situation because he was a king 🤴 
But we would be killed or facing troubles in such a deadly sins .
Kings of David times grabbed any woman they wanted .
Amongst all gentile kings David was a gentleman,.
But God didn’t spare him too ,,
My question did god kill those gentile kings ,?
Yea all of them died in the battle.
🙏🙏👋
I request Putin to take a fruitful discion very quickly because as antony blinken says already lot of companies left Russia ,it might affect russian future ,,
So President Putin must stop his invasion of UKRAIN and I assure everything becomes normal to Russia and Russian business,( this I assure President Putin on behalf of usa and President Joe BIDEN,)
God bless you sir 
Thank you Jesus 🙏
Amen 🙏 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
"I wonder how many of these people realize that babies are killed in the Bible, often mandated by God himself!"
"they don't need prayers, they need better wages for a start..."
I believe women with ectopic pregnancies should be monitored closely if there is a obvious and VALID danger it may be able to occur except it is wrong for women without health issues to be given the option of abortion at all!!! It's murder!!  These people are doctors to heal the suck  not your hitman!!!!
Doctors and nurses who perform Abortions are our hero and heroines. Love you all for saving women's lives!. Thank you to this beautiful women for protecting women's rights!. ❤️ 🙏
What gets me is why does God not stop abortion if it is wrong. Why do people have to? Why do they think they are God and have to play being so for God. God is about freedom of choice. You are taking God's given right away from people. You are forcing your beliefs on someone and that is wrong. That is against God.
Why do all anti-choice crazies look like in the privacy of their own homes they molest kids?
"I am pro choice BUT unless the woman's life is in danger  I can't support late term abortion.   As with everything,  there must have limitations or else we become the monsters the right  wingers say we are.  
We can't claim the high road and do what they accuse of doing which in most late term abortions is actually killing a baby. 
I support your right to choose,  just do it before the fetus becomes a baby."
The shootings are just post birth abortions. Other than that the clinic and the shooting kill people at many stages of life. It's mostly just irony.
These people demonstrate how uninformed they are.  Or nuts depending on how violent they act.
They want those white women going for an abortion to carry those babies to term for the sake of the white race
Are these protesters going to adopt these “children”?
Sure wish there had been an insurrection at this point. Papaw is the absolute worst. Get him the hell out of there while there’s still anything to salvage. The next president is screwed  I don’t know why anyone would want to follow obiden.
Fake news as always.
"That makes perfect sense! How can they kill people when they are against killing people???  They are so delusional. 

Men in general, like DAN should have no say in the matter whatsoever!"
"""When i meet my maker I hope the lord has mercy."" Instead of having mercy on the woman that has to bear an unwanted child and Care for them until their 18? Really sir?"
"These religous fanatic's have no right to try and force their beliefs on me, my life my body. I dont want these extremist trump thumpers telling me what to do or how to live my life. They are all so stupid they cant think for themselves so they look to their god trump to tell them what  to think. They are the bottom of our society and I thought snakes were the lowest form of life, not so anymore. These are so sub human. No abortions but allow our children be killed by guns in their classroom. So two faced everyone of them."
This is so much bigger than abortion. It’s about minority rule! this is just the beginning if we do not go out and vote in November. 🙏🏾
How many children has DAN delivered. He has guilt but it is not about abortion. Maybe he has never done anything good in life but he has NO UTERUS NO OPINION. Men should be forced to have vasectomies at 12yrs of age so he know what it is like to have their reproductive rights taken away. That would finally be real justice.
"This is all about a bunch of religious nonsense!  Merchants of myth forcing their views on everyone.  Once these yahoos take total control of our government they will be a dangerous cancer, difficult to remove and deadly like the Dark Ages of their beginnings."
The funny thing is when we die we are shown and experience all the hurt we caused other souls. So that man thinks God is going to show him mercy for doing what he's doing when in reality he's causing those women anguish and that's what God will show him
"you are obviously an introspective thinker. People say it’s a complicated issue often if they’re pro choice, but too often they only see the complications which support their belief. I personally believe that rape, incest, and circumstances in which the life of the mother is in danger are valid reasons for an abortion. I am definitely repulsed by the fact that in the state of New York babies are killed after they’ve been delivered and therefore a US citizens under the constitution. In other words, babies are actually being murdered in New York."
Old people are screwed up in america
It’s terrible to kill babies
"ANYONE who kills an already living breathing people is NOT A PRO LIFE ADVOCATE!!!!!  If you can't figure that out for yourself,  nothing I write will help."
"If churches are going to get involved with making laws, they can pay their taxes as an admittance fee just like everybody else."
No you definitely do NOT have a responsibility to harass patients at the clinic. Your function is to mind your own F'n business. Not your business. These women's bodies are their own.
"Absolute madness, delusions ""we are here to protest the right for the woman to choose life""... is she listening to herself 🤣🤣"
"The irony of violent, corrupt, racist, sexist, hatefilled and criminal activities by people espousing religion is not lost. The only real of religion is the opportunity to control others through misinformation and continuum of ignorance. I know it sounds like we are talking about trump and his radicalised followers…same same.

These yelling crazies look to be the same neighbour’s that yells “get off my lawn” to little kids walking by."
Is it too late to abort these protesters???
Abortion clinic escorts are AMERICAN HEROES!!
OK I''LL HAVE THE BABY BUT.... YOU RAISE IT !!!! THAT WILL SHUT THESE IDIOTS UP
Eleven murders of clinic workers. How pro-life is that?
"America is seriously in very bad shape, everything is sooooo messed up. Nothing make sense anymore"
A key phrase “I think….”  So they are trying to impose their on feelings about abortion. No one has the right to make decisions for someone else. If you don’t like something then don’t participate.
This woman sounds so pretentious.
Anti abortion people who bomb and kill people at clinics are pro life??? Really??? Think about how fucking stupid that is for a minute
"The old guy is funny.  He thinks when he dies he's going to meet his maker.    Like of all the millions that die everyday, the ""maker"" has time for him."
"No no you don't best way is if you abortion girls put a ribbon  on so we no it's my freedom to no who kills the seed 
Cause the best way to avoid this problem  is not to stick it in give you the seed  best abortion  plane find the pro life girls only .
Not saying there not free they are but understand  the price involved 
Taking life away is man take responsibility  of that action  of creation  of life 
And women you chose the path that says life.
So if you don't get the seed you can't kill life 
I respect  all mothers 
Who take responsibility  and still get it done 
Men should take responsibility  of who you released  
Adultery is adultery 
Fight temptation  
But what pro life has they took responsibility  
Not greed that says I deserve  it no I want freedom you have it when you ignore the temptation  of adultery 
Until you become 1 in flesh 
Which passes DNA information  from he and you making a hole new DNA information  creation  life"
"Facts First:
Even the Pope agrees, if you’re “pro-life”, then you should also….
1.  Ask for more gun control laws
2.  Provide more support (financial, emotional, and physical) to mother’s
3.  Support the under-privileged"
"She literally uses “death” in her channel name… This woman is straight out of a horror movie. (And did you catch that this clinic does late-term, abortions, which is basically straight-up infanticide)"
"If these lost souls who feel guilty about their own lives or are 100% cultists actually ""believed"" in the sanctity of 'life', they wouldn't be protesting outside of the Clinic...they would be demanding children be provided education about reproduction, sexual diseases, cancer, women's health, mental health, and demanding universal healthcare for all Americans."
"Why isn’t the private property much larger, with a long driveway?????"
"These are off course sick, sick people."
"The pro-lifers ""think"" they are so just ..
But pressuring people into your way of thinking is being a nazi..
And we live in a free country"
Hero! CNN HERO! I dare ya. 🫵🏻
"These are like minded people who Clinically, walk talk and think exactly like Donnie tRump. They are all mentally Deranged and unstable. Donnie your clones were let loose from the asylum. TRE45ON"
"Have Dan and Joe do a though experiment. As an abortion protester, you are now eligible to be randomly selected to raise an adopted child. They can think of it as unwanted pregnancy. They wouldn't refuse or ""abort"" this child, right?"
Shelly big thank you.  Women's rights
I love how these people think that posting anti-abortion makes them bad people when all they’re doing is ensuring that you don’t kill your baby. What monsters
"I could care less how you feel about it, but if you use abortion as birth control I dont feel sorry for you. for the ones that need one i feel bad for you that selfish sluts ruined it for you. i hate when people abuse good things and get them taken away."
"hope they have put plenty of money aside to pay for all the orphans, children with disabilities, children with severe disabilities. then you have all the problems with many many children with no parents to guide them, therefore creating plenty of new recruits for the gangs. should be OK though coz usa doesn't really have a gangs and guns problem"
"Trying to stop abortion by murdering people..it's all about control...what did this man do to help mothers and babies...nothing,  other than terrorize!!!"
This lady is going straight to hell
Gods number one rule is not to judge and what are they doing protesting?! JUDGING !! MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
"Those killers of abortion workers are no different than the abortion doctors... murder is murder, be it a fetus, or a grown adult ! 💯🤔"
Those protesters are great people
The guy worrying God might be angry he didn't harass and cause enough distress to women and girls. If his god exists he I'd going straight to Hell for his cruelty.
"What is anyone business what I do with my body, no one has told this people to have abortion so don’t tell me don’t ! These are people sit by the window and watch neighbors house!"
"In the past 50 years that has NEVER been a valid case made against abortion. All the anti freedom crowd has done is lie, appeal to emotion, intimidate, extort, commit violence, acts of vandalism, terrorism and even murder. What they really want is to feel self righteous over other people so they can feel good about themselves while ruining other people's lives."
Are they aware Abortions was performed in the Holy Bible?🙄
"So that lady works at an abortion clinic? I guess I’m not clear on how abortions are performed, does she eat them?"
These old men shouldn't have a f***ing thing to say about abortion.
"Jesus comments on True Life and True Death:
« ...You are indeed the children waiting to be born to the Life of Heaven. This is not Life, this one which you live on earth during the mortal day. This is only the formation of your future being as one living eternally. Human existence is the gestation which shapes you to give you to the Light. To the true Light, and not to the poor, murky light of this earth.

I bear you in Me like a mother forming her child; I surround you and shelter you with Myself; I nourish you with My food to have you be born immortal in the hour of what you call “death,” and it is nothing but a “passage.” A passage from an incomplete phase to completeness, from imprisonment in limited space to boundless freedom, from darkness to Light, from obstructed caresses to the absolute embrace of the soul with its Parent.

This is what you call “dying”. You that, with your proud knowledge, still are not able to give the right name to things, and like children a few years old you call things by mistaken names. I want to teach you what “death” is and who the “dead” are.

Death is to be separated from God, like an unborn child that before the proper time is separated from the maternal organ and putrefies in the alveus, which expels him painfully. The dead are those who, because they are expelled in this way, do not differ from the remains of an animal disintegrating in the sun and rain along an earthly cart road, causing repugnance in those seeing them. This is what it is to be “dead.” Sin is the cause which separates you from God and makes you decaying, corrupted flesh, food for Satan, who has poisoned you to devour you, a prey to his hunger as a devourer of souls and an enemy of God, the Creator of souls.» [...]
(— dictation from Ma. Valtorta's notebooks, dated 10-Oct-1943.)

Do not abort if you do not want to become an abortion."
Religious Lunatics 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"McConnell and Thomas should worry that, next, the Court will 'revisit' the right to interracial marriage. Legal since only 1967. Remember the Domino Theory? America is killing itself. Corporations are going to pay travel expenses for women who need to leave the state for an abortion. If corporations are people, will SONY go to jail?"
"So , they don’t mind taking care of born children? Free healthcare, education, and food!"
"Well with the shit that went down with scouts, these people are now gonna feel more justified"
"SO much unnecessary pain, bloodshed, fear-mongering, and interference of (at least SOME) medically necessary abortions… just makes one wonder whose god is going to forgive whom for what wrongs☯️🙏🏼🕉☮"
"What I see is a lot of people who most probably have mental issues. 
This is sad but also often a result of abuses and neglects of children that were born when they shouldn't have because the all women can't be good mothers and many don't have resources in your country like in Canada where everything is made towards helping young mothers...free healthcare for everyone, free dental care, a year off of job paid by our government after the birth of a child and we recuperate our job, that's the law...we also have very little fees for school (mostly their materials)...a monthly payment by child also given by our government until he reach 18 years old...yes we pay big taxes for this but our system is made not to forget any people of our country, and for the well being of mother and kids in priority.....here our children is a priority..and even with this we are not going to force a woman to keep her baby!
We will encourage the ones that would want to keep them and will talk to her about all the perspectives of their choices first but her decision is between herself and God, no judgements...only God can judge and forgive, not us humans. We often think that we have all the answers for others...and clearly take ourselves as God in our world...look at all the dictators that do impose their ideas to their populations..
Also abortion are free in Canada and we assure women to recieve all medical and psychological help necessary...she won't have to go get an abortion on a kitchen table with risks for her health, like many women will probably do now....and if I were you I would start to look at the statistics that will come over women suicidal and child abuses. Your country is pressuring women a lot when they are having their hormones up the roof,  and no consideration of her age, she will have to face maternity and parenthood without any help most of the time, or promises from friends and family that will end up abandoning her with her kid often left alone with her kid.
This decision is never an easy one but remains a woman's decision because she is the one who will live with the consequences of it."
"Wait..these escorts are helping violently and cruelly kill a life. In some states now after this week, they would be an accomplice to a homicide or even serial killing (depending on numbers). That's not heroic, that's serious and extreme mental illness. They should seek professional help asap. Get them to a hotline fast."
Anti-abortion extremest’s are the biggest hypocrites! They don’t want abortions but will not pass legislation to provide healthcare and or financial aid for the less fortunate. Or pass legislation to go after their rapists.
"Abortion is bad
Word atheist  and abortion say 
Biology  
Bio is life accents of life

GOD BLESS the people of the clinic. Stay we the people are behind you.. Thank you...
"I am all for ""freedom *of* religion"" for anyone to choose whatever floats their boat, but please for the love of the allmighty spaghetti monster, could we maybe also get ""freedom *from* religion"" so people can not pester and penetrate others constantly with their deranged relgious bullshit views and opinions? Maybe even throw in a s bit of secularism so the USA wont become a califate or a Republic of Gilead."
"Cant we ban rasing children if you dont want to??? Do the Constitutions tell women they have to raise their children if they dont want to??
Can women deny doctors and other healthcare workers to assist them giving birth???.
We have to find a loophole in this mess. 
Can we force the father to take over after birth. The father is just as much mother as the father of the child. Women can provide as fathers can care for the child."
Ask these protesters how many children they've adopted.
"It's the Left that is violent and unhinged. It's not even close. Years ago there were a few wackos on the right, but it's not close now. Just look at all the places of worship or Womens health care facilities that are under attack. There have been over 40 places vandalized and trashed with all kinds of stuff, graffiti and threatening messages, and human excrement. People have been assaulted and sent to the hospital. It's not close, the radical Left becomes unhinged and violent if they don't get their way."
She doesn't need to worry about getting pregnant
Good for her.
"His maker is going to ask him how many unwanted babies he adopted, or supported through college."
"What I find interesting, some of them are willing to kill people over this, bomb clinics, etc. How is that pro-life? And what if they bomb a place & there happens to be a child or baby in there?"
Nightmare!These people are in a cult.They are the Taliban.They are happy now that we have Sharia Law
Time for a gulabi gang
"These people want our country over flowing with poor babies, suffering in poverty & slums.   & Of course they dgaf about life once it's been.
That's why they don't care about rape victims or women who die because they cannot bear having their rapists, or dad's, or uncles baby."
She ?
Hypocrites
How can you be anti-abortion…and pro murder?! There are some insane people out there y’all 😨
God bless Donald trump.
She's a hero . Comment by Bailey Bell
"As a European, I am utterly shocked.  What shocks me the most is anti abortion men.  First, they have no idea what it means to be pregnant.  Second, I would love to see them pregnant and delivering a baby of which they know they can’t take care.   We as women know what is best for us and for a baby because sometimes a baby will have a miserable life for different reasons.   I myself have had two abortions when I was young.  I simply couldn’t have coped, the two men would absolutely not want to take care of me and a baby.  And I would have had to give up my job which I loved.  Anyway, this whole issue is is our, women., not men’s problem.   With all the issues like abortion, racism, extreme right movements You have in the States I consider myself very lucky to be European, Swiss exactly."
Thank these women for helping these ladies!!!!
It should be illegal to harrass anyone seeking medical treatment from healthcare professionals. Throw these lunatics in prison.
Our country is going backward because of the minority.  I feel sad that they're attacking women's rights currently but we should fear what they'll come after next.
Why are all these crotchety old men protesting? I guess they take their cue from all the crotchety old men in Congress who get to decide what's best for women.
Instead of protesting how about “pro-lifers” adopt the kids already here and needing a family?! Even as an adoptee I’m still STRONGLY pro-choice and these hypocrites disgust me to no end.
"One very courageous woman. Thank you for protecting these women. God bless you. I can not understand the types of people who insist the country & everyone in it live under THEIR rules. Americans have a right to choose how they want to live and those protesters have no right to harass women. If the protesters believe so strongly that  their god doesn’t want abortion, then they should live their lives under their God’s rules and have faith that these women will be punished. It is no one’s right to make others live a life that they have not chosen. This is why I detest all these man- made religions, claiming to know what god wants & doesn’t want! And I especially detest the evangelicals. What hypocrites. They send in their money so that their pastors can live a life of luxury, while screwing around outside their own marriages. Bloody hypocrites! Go home and pray to your god and let others do as they please. 😡😡😡😡"
"They are escorting women in there to kill their children,and they don't even realize how evil they are.they are so evil! There is no gray area to: thou shalt not kill. Who gave them the right to decide who lives and who dies?I guess it makes them feel powerful!"
Man it must be nice to have nothing better to do with your time…I’ve other shit to do 🤷🏽‍♂️
Shelley needs arrested.
"When he meets his Maker, he will be asked ""Who told YOU you have a RIGHT to OVERTHROW MY WORD!?!"" And they are yelling, ""You have a son or daughter!!"" when they could very well be carrying someone Intrasex. THREE SEXES, PEOPLE! Don't EVER forget how THOSE babies had their genitalia butchered to satisfy someone else's Beliefs there are ONLY TWO."
I respect you so much Shelley!!!
"I just want to smack the anti-abortion protesters. Guess I shouldn’t work as an escort, then. 😂"
Thank you Shelly.
Until abortion starts killing these women as well maybe then they will understand
"I am a Christian but I irks me to no limit that these so-called Christians are in direct contradiction of the words from the Bible they are shouting at those women.  That Bible says to follow peace with ALL men and not just those who agree with them.   The Bible is not written for those that don’t believe and follow it teachings  it’s for those who say they are believers and gives them instructions that governs their conduct toward others.   They are suppose to be lights in a dark world but they are poor examples  and if I wasn’t a Christian there is nothing they are doing and saying to those people that would make me in anyway curious of accepting their God.  Shame on them for their hypothetical ways.  I pray for the safety of all those escorts who have compassion for those woman. Remember, it wasn’t the so called sinners the cried for Jesus’ crucification, it was the church people."
Some retired  vets would like to protect the clinics ask them Lord will and he send help
Gosh what a surprise... a bunch of old white men and a couple of white women trying to force their religious ideals on ALL women in America. Yeah that hasn't happened about a billion times since the 1500s
How is having a right to choose life when you vote to restrict someone's basic human right to choose?!?!! These anti abortions numskulls need to be in a cave locked away from society
"Fact, you that aid the killing of unborn will suffer consequences because there is an afterlife and there will be consequences."
But yet they believe in the death penalty.
"The anti abortionist should teach ""fucking with responsibility"" so as not to create a life.
Keep condoms on penises and crossed legs for the ladies.
YES! Very basic!"
"Crazy people outside abortion clinics need to get a life, live their own life with a little purpose, cause don't make a difference.  They just litter the sidewalk."
#republicunt #cultmembers #STFU
"Why does the Christian taliban feel the need to push their ""magical sky god"" beliefs on everyone else???

Didn't they ever hear of FREE WILL???"
"I love babies, who are born one of the twelve months Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter."
"If a man thinks abortion is wrong then all of those ,en should be fixed immediately."
You are an amazing woman please don't stop what your doing. Sending love from 🇨🇦
Great job america.
"God is not going to reward you for harassing these Women. If you don't know that, you do not know The Lord."
So much for the land of the free… Republicans are such ridiculous hypocrites.
"Religtards, Amerikkkan Taliban"
boy. all this to make sure some unborn people die.
"Anti abortion protesters killing people is as nonsensical as it gets...
Pro life alright...."
Burn it down
Wonder what they are going to move on to next?
This might cause human extinction if abortion is completely banned in some states.
As far as I'm concerned a baby is only a baby when it pops out crying.  A Kleenex is not a multiple homicide scene and abortion is just a more complicated way of pulling out
"Get ready for all the unwanted crack babies, the ones born with severe mental and physical disabilities, the ones born with no limbs, the ones born destined forever to a wheelchair, and finally in 16 or 18 years, you now gotta deal with those that were raised in the foster care system... What Pro life group has the money and facilities to take in millions of unwanted kids??"
"How many of them have adopted children or offered support, financial, mental, physical, etc support to women if they have the baby? My guess, 0."
"These people saying they will “help” what does that “help” look like? Are they going to fund the low income women? Are they going to adopt unwanted children? Are they going to help pay for child care, food, health care, college?"
"What an unfortunate job title!  Can you imagine applying for a job later in life with ""escort"" on your resume?"
"Its like they are only ""pro-life"" when it's a fetus in the womb. These ""pro-life"" politicians and citizens,do nothing to help and seem to stop caring,once the child is born. Children in America are starving, children and woman are being raped, and here these people want to force them to birth the child from that. Like it's their fault or something. Its disgusting,and honestly people should be ashamed of themselves. #mybodymychoice!!. And its just creepy that men put so much time and effort into telling us woman, what we can and cannot do with our bodies."
"TWISTING THE NARRATIVE JUST LIKE THEY DID ""THE DON'T SAY GAY BILL""."
"Pro-life, however they murder and execute the healthcare professionals. How does it make sense??!"
"Protest wont help much in USA. Your not in Europe, where politician takes citizen opinion serious and they will resign in the favor of the citizen. USA, you run and lie in front of the voter faces. In Europe, if you do that. You can be fire and resign in a year. A laying corrupt judge is immune to being fired. I guess, they can change the whole country."
I wonder if they get their animals spayed or neutered?!?!?
"Notice how more than half of the anti abortion people are men, people that never have to make the decision."
Noos
"So, Governor Asa is bragging about all the wonderful services his state will provide to women enslaved by his state to produce children for his future workers. These women did not desire his services, they were not looking forward to his services and they may hate that their state-enforced slavery against her has forced her to receive these services. He loves making women his slaves. He worries about the ""life"" of an unformed human, but he does not give a damn about the real life of the woman who is pregnant. In reality, Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark) is a murderer of grown women. (And he loves that about himself.)"
"Any monster who could serial kill their own children, has serious and extreme mental issues."
I bet a lot actually had or paid for abortions and are hypocrites VOTE BLUE EVERYONE AND STOP THE RADICAL REPUBLIECAN AGENDA
This woman is a phenomenal woman!!!
"Gotta love the woman saying every woman has the ""choice of life"".
But no other choice is available."
"I'm a conservative, and pro choice. I'm against abortion, but telling a woman what she can and can't do, over rules my feelings on abortion. These people that stand outside of clinics, and yell at these women, need to get a life. They should thank God she's there and not me!!!!!!"
"Why aren't these people supporting Universal Healthcare and education, why aren't they fighting for guaranteed maternity leave and childcare assistance for working Moms
Why??? Because this is NOT about life, this is about CONTROL...PATRIARCHY"
"God Bless you Shelly and the doctors at this clinic and all their staff for your assistance to these women in their most difficult times.  These protestors are nuts, and none of them will adopt a child so how can they tell someone to choose life when they won’t choose to adopt."
"LAME🙌let these people live their path. You’re not their savior, you’re not GOD. Let them be free in a free state. Don’t be a LAME TRUMP SUPPORTER, that guy is a rapist.👍"
I grew up 6 blocks from there. Dr Carhart has a very interesting story. Women owe him a LOT. I’m very grateful for what he’s given up so we can be safe.
😂🤣 4 of the 3 protesters were very old white men. What is that about?
The music really sets the mood...
"I don't agree with an abortion just because ""it's my body,"" although I feel they should still have that right (hey, freedoms a bitch). I fully understand that banning abortion only bans _legal_ abortions, that a woman who has committed herself to not having a child is going to do *whatever* she has to, by whatever means she can find, which includes some dangerous and deadly stuff, to not have that baby

I've always felt like the decision from a standpoint of, ""Well I just don't want this baby, because I'm careless, and never been big on learning a lesson or keeping condoms,"" was a selfish motivation, especially in a world we're there are good couples who really want a kid yet can't make one themselves.... I mean, there should be options in that case...

But incest, rape, or a medical diagnosis that fully confirms the baby is just lining up for a miserable existence or going to endanger both lives coming to term.... That's just necessary, and I hate to think a woman would need that and not be able to get it.

People who protest abortion don't seem to realize that, to prevent the one selfish case, they endanger two lives, in every other instance, to protect one life that they _never_ really cared about in the first place (or, as Carlin put it, are just outraged that they're never going to get the chance to stop caring for this baby after they're born)"
"Nice, TickTok Shame lol. The chinese are laughing at you while doing the xi xi ping shuffle, sometimes, youtube is a wonderful place. Notice its people with northern accents, most southerners are actually cool with having the right to choose.. except for the religious and maga hat minority.. yeah i'm glad we addressed the issues we were having here with nonsense."
That guy calling her mom was as creapy as ive ever seen.
"Can they feed them? Can they those kids they call life? Why don't they start feeding homeless kids first and get them education ! Them maybe , maybe 🤔 i will think if they really care."
Their bodies their rights 🤷🏾‍♂️
"No,  one has the right to tell a woman what she can and can't do with her own body.   Not even a law past by the corruption of the Supreme Court judges."
"""She was sick of the mentally ill, so she posted them on tiktok"" should be the title here."
"SCOTUS, by its dishonest tricks sided with those terrorists anti-abortion. The people must ask Kavanaugh, Gorsuch and Barrett to resign or at least to recuse themselves, given that they lied to us, and the debate must be resumed with the remaining judges. A liar with a conscience is a liar who resign when caught on the fact. To let liars (caught on the fact) not being fired, is like keeping a broke engine in a plane, except that here the plane is the country. The court above Scotus is the people, and the people have to ask Kavanaugh, Gorshuch and Barrett to resign, or at the least to recuse themselves, in the debate which has to be resumed. If not, the US looks like being already a theocracy à-la Saudi Arabia or Iran.
BTW, in my religion it is a sin to impose to people doing something with their body that they do not want. That rules infringes my religion which shows that such a ruling is also completely anti-constitutional. It has 0 merits. The trigger laws should not be applied."
"Why those prolife people don't go to protest in Harlem or in the south bronx to gang members and tell them not to kill childrens and grownups. There are real criminal out there that kills and torture other people for no reason. 
I think those protesters will do better job with real criminals."
Make em famous

"Thanks for covering this woman, SHE is out here doing ""God's"" work. If you see any of these comments, Ma'am, just know you are appreciated by many people, and deserve to be recognized by many more."
It's our bodies we can have as many abortions as we choose to. Jesus gave us the opportunity and privilege to choose. If we choose to have abortions It's our choice to do so. I wish one of these people who is against abortions would approach me. I would kill them
"Why does't anybody realize and bring it up that all these conservatives want to do it CONTROL you.  PERIOD.  They want to control you what you do with your body... what you do inside of your homes, etc.   The ""saving of lives"" of the unborn is just a scam, lies and a sham--- like everything else they say and do.  THEY CARE A HOOT ABOUT SAVING LIVES--and I mean any lives (except their own).  IF they really cared about lives, they would do something about guns and ban them.  So why doesn't anyone bring this,  the real truth to their hypocritical faces and to them.  The proof is right there for everybody to see it.  All else is whitewash and hogwash."
Bravo! To Shelley!!! These mostly are men that are anti women's rights!
America is 🤒
"These are the real heroes,God bless them,and we all need to vote in November to stop this madness, because this is just the beginning of all this shiit."
it's always the people who don't have wombs or no longer can use their dried up wombs that are so concerned about another people's bodies and it's beyond disgusting
"The worst thing we can do to another human is to assume we know their lived experience. If you want to affect change in the world, stop harassing people, and go look in the mirror and start with yourself"
Why is it anti abortion terrorists are almost always men?
Bless her!!!!!!!
"Either be pro-life or you'll be killed? Yeah, that logic checks out...SMH"
What kind of help? They're going to help raise it feed it clothe it educate it or they just going to give her a pep talk you can do it?
Guard  DOGS?
"The Atlanta Olympics bomber was part of the Christian Identity movement, and also bombed at least two abortion clinics, killing a cop in the process. Right-wing extremism is by far the greatest terrorist threat to the US today. It's also sanctioned by a growing subset of the GOP."
"this is a repeat from months ago , not news."
"I love how people think it's OK to kill an actual living and breathing female over a fetus that can't breath on their own. I was brought up believing in God. I still do but these religious extremists are actually insane. Stay home. It's not your bodu so it's none of your business. These are the first people to not ""have their tax dollars"" go to welfare. They are the first people to judge a single mother because their husband/boyfriend has abandoned them because they actually had the baby. The first ones who abandon these children when in foster care. Those children are abandoned by the church and state. The ant-abortion people are ignorant. If they believe one second that their freedom of prayer in public is not in jeopardy now they are severely mistaken. I hope they have to go pray underground or in an alley  some day. They don't realize this is more than abortion. It's a FREEDOM and civil right being taken away. It leave us as Americans venerable to have ALL our freedoms stripped. By the way, Justice Thomas is a sexual devient!! He is the devil incarnate. Below is verse for you false prophets and religious nut jobs since you like to quote the bible.

Matthew 7:15 ""Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves."""
"These protesters are going to meet their maker, Satan, they are literally doing the devils work and they are acting as if God would be proud. The Bible directly says not to do this type of tomfoolery, that he is the only one to judge. It encourages the slaughter of women and children who do not agree with you because they aren’t Christian? How is that worshipped? Or when Lot throws his daughters out to the town to get r***ed then they both impregnate themselves by their father!?! This is what prolifers want? Disgusting. If people actually sat down and read through the Bible they would find a majority of it makes no sense and is absolutely amoral."
So much mental illness. Why normalize it instead of helping them? Maybe Margaret Sanger was right
The audacity of a man taking this stance 🙃
These Bible pounders deserve some lead
Dismantle the churches. Topple them. They are sources of anti-logic and abuse. Dismantle them.
Lmao. Shouldn't you at least be capable of getting laid before you have an opinion on abortion? No way someone is throwing it in that
"Post-natal abortionists, I hate them all."
"It's funny (not) that I've never heard one of these forced birthers advocate for services for families and children. It feels pretty hateful to women when you won't support kids and families but impose your will on them.

Freedom is weird in America. You have the right to a gun and to shooting kids, but women and families can't make decisions about their families. You guys are messed up. Freedumb. That's what that is."
All these pro life idiots are so pro child abuse. It’s disgusting 🤮 how they want more unwanted and starving children. They don’t want healthcare for babies !!! No food for babies !!! Sick
"Romans 1:22-25
King James Version
22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen."
Total biased coverage.  Another slow day for CNN.
"Abortion =  killing unborn babies

Call it what it is !"
This is what Social Security is allowing
The ban on abortion does not go far enough. An ban on male masturbation is needed! Sperm is life and these men are look suspiciously guilty.
I believe in abortion but I have limits. I knew a girl a few years ago she had 2 weeks Before her baby was to be born her and her boyfriend broke up she went and got an abortion I don't agree with that she was only a couple weeks from giving birth the baby she said they cut the baby head off before they pulled it out I haven't talked to her since I could never let some chop my baby head off and pull their limbs off if that's what really happened that's disgusting I can't agree with it
"If a woman does not want to get pregnant, just don't spread legs. Or take contraceptive pill to not get pregnant. OMGOSH, 😢 😢 killing babies is just another crime."
"When your State seizes control of a person's body and forces that person to make a product for the benefit of the State, that is SLAVERY. Throughout history, the most despised form of slavery is when your State enslaves women and forces them to make babies. That form of Slavery is called BABY BREEDING SLAVERY. It has been reviled for thousands of years. And now Baby Breeding Slavery has been forced on our United States."
They are harassing not protesting there should be laws against that call the police
"Where's LE? Harassment is legal distress. Lord of the Flies, sub 😫
How much treasure + resources do these ""anti-abortion protestors"" give to children + their parents?"
For once. I would advocate for holding guns to protect the clinic
"Thank you Shelley. You are the actual source of love to those women, not those very ignorant people outside."
Shelly is a very brave woman!  We could use more like her.
"Women in America think that they have it  better than women from other countries, sorry,  even other countries realize  women  deserve a choice.  
These protesters don't care about  the abandoned children, sexually abused children, and children in foster care."
"Please don,t stop we all need more people like you. Love and respect coming your way."
Very courageous. Thanks for what you are doing.
Abortion may be wrong to some people but the thing is it's that persons life n choice what they want to do. Worry about your own life n let people do what they think needs to be done with thier own body!
Once your born your on your own!!
Those anti abortion activists are so ridiculous.  MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
"Respecto,  respect and love for all of you ❤️"
These people protesting the abortions but none of them are willing to take these potential children and give them a home and raise them. After children are born they have nothing to do with them.
"50% of all fertilized eggs do not implant on the uterine lining.  If God is the reason for everything, why does God abort 50% of all babies?"
Think about this at the next election.   Especially with all the rolling back of rights in the US.
"They are PRAYing, but are they PAYing for the children's needs for the next 18-20 years? As Dr Phil has said many times: the child-protection services are broken in the USA. 
Every child should be wished for, and none the result of their father's neglect and irresponsibility. Give women the protection and services they need. And stop male privilege - let women decide over their bodies! And make USA a modern and developed country with some freedom and essential rights at last!"
I’m sorry but on one asked to be brought into the world I surely didn’t and if I had been aborted I would not have lived the hell on this earth.
"Let me throw out a bizarre thought. Recognizing this is not even reality but let me throw out a thought. What if the government said men no longer could have vasectomies? What if the government told you that you had to father children and being those children's Life daily have complete support of medical food clothing schooling and should you not provide that you go to prison for the life that the child is on Earth? The responsibility always falls on the mother even when the courts get involved many many sperm donors managed to avoid taking their responsibilities. It is time to make it an equal playing field. Rapist lovers one nighters have to take legal responsibilities or pay with prison time for the 18 years. The mother is not the only one that created the child. These men in courts and on the streets are so damn righteous. I don't necessarily believe in abortion but men have to remember the government is controlling women's bodies, it is time they realize that the government could take over theirs as well.. oh yeah men rule sarcasm noted."
Isn't this an old rerun I swear I've seen this same episode like 4 other times on cnn
based and abortion pilled
CNN inciting as always.
This man has it right too many people wanting to k*ll babies instead of helping babies they want to k*ll them..no help with s*xual abuse and rape is swept under the rug but can make such a up roar to K*ll our babies..girls/ woman  please STOP listening to these people tricking you God help them all..I know someone who has had this done and she's crys and regrets it everyday she says and wishes the truth would come out there using baby parts to their gain..it's a life threatening job meaning they take the babies lives
"Put the White Fascist in Prisons for they love walls, make sure they have entertainment of recorded babies screaming, kids nagging and screaming on intercoms all day long, so they can be fulfilled.  we know they won't need medical care as they did not want America to have it. No hot food , homeless people can't get hot food., they made sure of that. So that should be the Heaven that they wanted."
All men saying this shit but don't bare no responsibility
There is no constitutional right to kill babies.  That is fake news.
"These women will meet these children, the children will stay in heaven !"
wow those people are weard. how can they think they have the right to decide  other peoples destani.. Is that the free country ?
"She is doing a great job.
Keep these nutjobs away from the patients. Each patient has good reasons for getting their pregnancy ended and should be respected for their decision."
"Dan, I am the result of date rape and the subsequent abuse I endured by those who claimed to love me should never be the result of an unwanted birth. You are short-sighted in your extremism."
These pro- lifers really love to resort to murder to get their point across
The U S. is going down the tubes.
What a bunch of hypocrites...I wish they would use the same effort to ban AR 15 and make it harder to get guns that kill born again born little kids in schools...the constitution says freedom of religion yet Republicans and most Christians want to force Christianity beliefs on ppl...again what a bunch of hypocrites but won't fight for stricter gun laws and the ban of AR 15 which have been used to killed alot of born children in schools
"Be Ready to Afford Baby Formuls and Diaper$..? .* FFIE... Faraday Future. New FF 91 Futurist $ 180,000 SUV EV Pre-Order Video Commercial released Thurs. Production Starts by Sept 2022. ^^Over 175 Global FF 91 videos/shorts."
"Why is it that all the men protesting and harassing women only care about the fetuses and abandon them the minute they are actually babies? There is more than a bit of hypocrisy and cruelty displayed here. Men will never have to make this decision, so they should be busy supporting charities that help real babies. It appears to be against their principles, which are missing in someone who will never find themselves in that situation."
These effing idiots should be held crimininally responsible for all the resulting deaths of pregnant women and financially responsible for the unchosen born.
"Religious or not, if you want to be a help, help but don’t be anymore of a Burden to people you want to help. Just saying."
"The men who are against abortion must stop f*cking women and start f*cking themselves
Edit: oh, and praying is not helping. Just so you know"
"I had an abortion 35 yrs ago it was the same shit show with especially men outside the clinic. It's not used as birth control and I don't believe in your hateful religious beliefs, your hateful god or your Bible thumping bullshit. It is way past time to tax the churches since they don't understand the separation of church and state. They have no idea what the fn Constitution says except of course the 2ndA and miss the well regulated militia part."
Religion is the practice of using nonsense in order to explain ignorance
When are these anti-abortion protesters going to line up to protest against lack of health services for babies?? Infant mortality is a thing. As well as various serious health issues and social outcomes. They don’t seem to care as soon as the baby is born.
"It's so funny.

Libs Of TikTok is single-handedly dismantling the intersectionalist progressives.  This woman is doing nothing."
... and they're mostly males
Hypocrites   They don't care just follow their evangelicals desires
I couldn’t be a clinic escort. Because I’d just haul off and start throwing hands with some of these anti abortion people. Then IM suddenly the bad guy for being brought to a violent rage by stupidity and ignorance brought on my a self righteous need to force the rule of their own religion on others
"Educate people on ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies, stop having unprotected sex. Make contraceptives readily available."
Santa clause kills babies all the way up to delivery date.... wow
Shelley and all others protecting pregnant women are so awesome!  Those forced birthers who hassle these women are pathetic and disgusting.
The same nutjobs who didn't want to be told to wear a mask for their and other's health wanna impose a pregnancy on women. That's rich...
"These people are Pro life. Until the baby is born.  They couldn’t care less about the poor, the disenfranchised."
"Abortion should absolutely be legal, but third trimester abortions?? I assume those are only done whenever the child is severely ill (not viable) or when the woman's life is in danger? Here in Sweden, abortion is not a controversial topic - it is absolutely the woman's decision. No questions asked. However, after 18 weeks you need a special permission from the National Board of Health. Abortions are NOT allowed if the fetus is viable and are generally never done after 22 weeks."
"You could start guarding these places with Assault Weapons.
That'd not just drive off Protestors, but it would win the Gun Debate with Republicans outright.
Once a couple of Republicans got Aborted too, they'd try and ban assault weapons so gd fast."
"0:40....Why does this woman not say that she has never had an abortion?   Probably because she has had at least three of them, as a teenager, at this same abortion clinic.  These abortions, according to her, are not her fault because if abortion were illegal, she could have forced the fathers to marry her    If the clinic released her records, would she sue?   And would she be insulted if I said that having babies for the purpose of asking people for money is prostitution and should be so prosecuted?"
"They are allowed to protest just like pro choice is allowed to protest but a right winger took it too far by running his truck into peaceful protesters protesting the overturning of Roe. I’m pro choice but I’m against abortion in late pregnancies. There are GOP that also want to ban contraceptives which means that women will be forced to have the child no matter what even if it’s a result of rape or incest. As a medic I responded to a 12 year old who was having post partum depression. A 12 year old! These states that are making abortion illegal want to prevent women from crossing state lines to get an abortion as well. Charge the woman with homicide. There are a lot of men who don’t want to have children and with abortions being illegal then what? Do what others have done and beat the living day light out of the woman to force an abortion? Kill her to avoid her from having a child? Men have done that several times. And if she needs to have an abortion because her life is in danger then who gets to decide if she is allowed to have it? Call a judge to decide if she is sick enough to have an abortion especially when it’s early stage or deny her and use her as an incubator and let her die after they take the child? Do we have to call Marjorie Taylor Green and ask permission from her because the mother will die if she carries to term? We all know she is so pro life right? Oh wait. She is pro life for the fetus but once the child is born she doesn’t care about the born child and that’s evident with all of the bills she vetoed such as bills to help families receive formula, mental health services, gun restrictions, and so on. Those she vetoed because we can’t allow Biden to get any bills to pass because we have to get Trump back in office right even if it hurts Americans. Trump is number one and the American people are wayyyyyy down on the list."
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼👍🏼
"""Their right to choose life.""

As oppose to a woman's right to choose anything else. You know, if you take away all their other options, they're not really giving them a choice at all.

I want to kick these idiots in the head."
Preborn okay preschool your fucked  George Carlin
People really need to mind their own business and let people make their own important decisions about their life ! They are the ones that have to live with it .
What about the sins they are commenting openly or secretly? Is this what their religion tells them? Is that their gateway to heaven?
Oh the outrage for the 11 killed..🤦 what about the millions killed by abortion 😡
"ALL of those anti abortion protestors are middle aged, probably middle class, white people."
"So it's okay for ""Pro-Life"" advocates to gun down and murder doctors and staff at abortion clinics?!! I call BULLSHI*!. These so called Christian do gooders are a bunch of homicidal hypocrites!! Stay safe Shelly and to everyone else PLEASE vote these corrupt Sycophant MAGA Republicans OUT of government and VOTE BLUE in November before they take ALL of our freedoms away!!
VOTE BLUE! 💙"
"Hey, the vast majority of Americans WANT legalized access to abortion, and many of whom normally voted Republican. But not any more!! I cannot think of a better way to get couch potatoes off the couch, and into the polling stations, this November!"
WE WILL DEFY THEM
"So... If blue states can't keep up with the influx of abortions coming in from red states, should blue states turn away people from red states and give those appointments to people in Thier own state first? I think so. They made their bed...not us. And when that time comes...they should be the ones forced to lay in it...and have a baby they don't want"
Why don't all these complaining people go help poor already born babies!
We are coming for you Democrats!!! We are going to take your rights away...one way or another. Bwahaha!!!!
Vasectomies should be mandatory as it take two to tango
Everyone for abortion has already been born
"You call yourselves the land of the free but will not give women their own right to make a free choice, but are happy to sell guns to any tom, dick or Harry so they can go round shooting your children at schools 🤔"
SCOTUS is stacked with Liars.....Republicans Leaders don’t care about people after birth....crazy stuff
"Wow only in America do you get threats outsideof a medical institution and patients who need escort for. 

You're gonna help you right now? A prayer? How about a truck of money to help support poor moms? I bet they run away if they are charged a ton of money every time they shout outside of an abortion clinic."
This woman is a human hero the likes of which Republicans will never have
"“Mom, let us help you!” How? Adopt the baby? Cover the healthcare? Or pray? How about they put all of this free time into some real good and feed kids at a youth shelter? Then again I forget, after the baby’s born, their mission is done. These escorts are amazing!"
Typical Bible bangers......
"There are two bots following the CNN trying to troll everybody
One of them is Lauryn Green. Another one is auditing the epics. They have the same computer that sends out misinformation and also trolls anybody that stands against justice fueled by Putin and trump cronies
If you read this can you find them and report and if you see more bots You keep reporting them until one day there won’t be any bots"
"Imagine being Shelly Mann, you walk into an abortion clinic and say that you’re pregnant. If I was the doctor I would be in complete shock because there is no way."
"I might be fucked up for this but when I was younger me n my friends would drive by rotten egg these types of protesters 
My gf at the time had a red paint ballon thrown at her for going to the clinic so I figured fuck it imma terrorize these assholes right back"
"Anti seems non violent -however the pro's are destroying property, I see a left wing democratic pattern here..."
Bro she doesn’t even have a counter argument
Won't these protesters be surprised when they close their eyes for the very last time and then there is.... nothing... nobody... a complete void - forever.
"It's not 'my body' once the human being is alive inside. It's 'OUR bodies' and America will protect that unheard voice.

Be responsible and abort before and stop thotting."
Abortion's are violent. Just watch how one is done if you can stomach it.
"Amazing, perhaps hypocritical, how anti-abortion protesters use violence in their so-called efforts to stop the ""murder"" of innocent children. I say y'all get your heads out of women's uteruses and mind your own damn business!"
Fuck cnn
"“I will aid and abet abortions”
Made me cry."
Herr escorting job is horrible i hate her!!
"All these anti-abortion people should pay a 35% tax that would then be used for rearing an unwanted child, a "" sick"" child or a child of rape and or incest. I  can imagine how quickly they change their mind."
"Seems like a lot of women dont want to be accountable.

The responsible women are not afraid of the hearbeat bill."
I'm not a woman ( as you can see by my name ) but I understand that having an abortion is not an easy CHOICE for a woman.
GOod!
Thanks Shelley. You're doing the right thing.
"Where are the women?
The guys look so ignorant."
Can she be arrested now ? 🤔🤔
Good for u… these people should not be allowed to do that. Leave our bodies alone
No surprise by democrat media no word about left wing mob vandalism and attacks
Shelley is risking her life big time. I wish her all the best.
No surprise by democrat media no word about left wing mob vandalism and attacks
"Educate yourself a little bit and you'll become anti-abortion after the heartbeat. 
Special cases are always excluded. 

CNN found the least useful argument for anti-abortion and perfectly planted it here.

Well its CNN."
"You aren’t “offering help” ma’am. You are making a painful decision infinitely worse. It’s not your body, butt out. Roe v Wade balanced the rights of women to own their own bodies and lives with that of a fetus. An embryo is not a fetus."
religious nut jobs have taken control of our country
"The thing is the anti-abortion movement would receive a lot more sympathy if you heard kinder words from many of them with a softer tone and if you saw action behind those words. The one thing we know for sure is while we have a lot of people who want to be anti-abortion when it comes time to offer the mother of a child health care things change, when it comes time to offer a child healthcare after being born things change when it comes time to feed the mother and the child or to help pay bills for the mother and the child or to do anything for the mother and the child after the birth of the child things change. The same anti-abortion pro-life individuals you don’t see them after the birth of the child. For instance you see lots of protesters outside the clinics why are the same protesters outside of adoption facilities saying give those children more they need more. Why are those same protesters outside of Medicaid facilities protesting for access for single parents. You don’t see those protesters pushing for more food benefits or better housing stipend for single moms but they push for the pregnancy to reach full term. After that they disappear."
"Don's picture of the as yet unborn full term infant is from the final scene of Stanley Kubrick's movie, 2001."
The men protesting...wow...
If you don't have a uterus you shouldn't have a say on what a woman does with her body.
These people are ignorant god got nothing to do with abortion they there is god so far god has not shown up
The greatest trick the Devil played was hiding in plain sight .  She is escorting them into the shower in away. 😯😯
Well first of all there is no God .....
"They are not anti-abortion, they are pro-birth and that is all.  They could be volunteering their time helping children that have been born and are under resourced due to poverty.  But instead they harass women with their religion.  They can't mind their own business....."
Mostly old white men. Fascist kooks.
"Are these people prepared to take the unwanted babies into their homes and raise them as their own?? No way , they will not!"
This is what happens when you let religious extremists take centre stage. Enough already. Tax the churches
I think she is awesome for what she's doing. Please be careful and stay safe.
Abortion was never the answers for me but I was thankful to have the option. I’m pro choice and I’m for taking care of the kids already here. All those people screaming about abortion being murder  are the same people who complain about low income families getting food stamps and healthcare from the government. They only care for the unborn and when the baby is born it’s fuck them kids. It’s not about unborn kids… this is about controlling a woman and her body.  We need to clip a their nuez and band the blue pill. Make men start supporting the unborn baby as soon as she test positive. If they abuse a woman or a child we start wacking that off too.  Matter of fact jacking off should be considered an abortion and murder of unborn kids.
"Women should have the choice to decide for themselves.
As a Christian I know for sure that our choices and actions in life have consequences but it's the individual that must answer at the end of the day."
Their right to choose life = They don't have the right to choose unless they choose what I think is the correct choice
"Nebraska abortion clinic, I’m guessing closed today, ha ha"
But what's an Abortion?
"Put them blast with their intimidation!
I want to see the opposite happen in this country... There are well known organizations sending out vans to trick women into these vans to tell them all kinds of nonsense and not given all the options available to them. I want pro choice activists to go and find these vans and stand outside with pro choice posters and pamphlets with accurate pro choice information."
"Abortion is not healthcare. Killing a baby to save your career is not healthcare. Killing a baby because you hate the daddy is not healthcare. Killing a baby because you had a one-night stand is not healthcare Killing a baby so you can have fun & travel is not healthcare Reminder: 

What’s more democratic, giving 9 unelected and lifetime-appointed judges (not lawmakers) unilateral federal authority on such a controversial issue for which the Constitution is silent, or deferring to each state whose state legislators are voted in by the people?

Who cares how long something has been the “Law of the Land” if it was the result of a faulty interpretation.

The vast majority of these “my body, my choice” activists were totally fine with you being forced to take an experimental “vaccine” or lose your job, your livelihood, and your ability to put food on the table. They’re phonies at their core."
The tolerant leftist
Gosh they are ugly.
"It's time to send the Supreme Court and anti-abortionists photos of children attacked in their schools by madmen with war weapons! Ban arms, not abortion! I am sure more children in the US are killed by arms than abortions."
WHEN ENTITLED PEOPLE LYING ABOUT SHIT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO HAVE IT DONE BACK TO THEM.
"For being supposedly Christian, these anti-abortion protesters have a lot of hate and a lot of time to waste."
"Bah ha...they got some actors because the lefties are making complete fools of themselves...showing that public school taught them nothing about America and that they literally WANT to kill babies.  Good riddance to wierdo lefties and thier bizarre propaganda machines, CNN & MSNBC."
"I hate this lying hyhpocrisy!!! They are protesting but they are not offering the women help and support after the birth of a baby that the woman and the baby will hve a good life. They are not interested in the situation of these women, they don't try to understand. Why are so many men protesting?? Men are the ones who are impregnating women, deny the contraception with condoms and many of them run away when they get to know that their girlfriends or wives are pregnant. They don't help and support them, especially when the child is born. Men you have no right to dictate women what they have to do!!! I am impressed and greatful that still so many people protect these women who come to the clinic be safe and protected. To the protesters: don't think that what you has anything to do with christianity!!!"
All the unwanted children in foster homes that have been ignored by the anti-abortionists are waiting to be adopted. What will happen when millions more unwanted pissed off 18 year olds hit the streets with the guns they bought on their birthday? We live in interesting times.
These pro lifers never show up at schools after mass shootings. Wonder why . . . .
Welcome to White Christian Fascist America.
"“We will help you, no not financially but we will pray for you, which is essentially nothing”"
They’re fking mental
"Love it "" Jesus saves the babies"" .. yet the same Jesus "" kill all teh first born children"" , doesn't save kids from any childhood diseases like cancer , wipes out all man kind through floods, killed countless in his name through religious wars and so on and so on... but yeah sure, lets call on jesus to save the children"
Sickening how does one rationalize taking a life in defense of one's religious belief? Wtf?
Sure they miss her at the job she doesn't have 🙄
Thank you Shelley! Thank You!
"I’m fed up with the pro abortion protestors going insane in the streets. Tearing everything up, again starting to burn shit down (a pregnancy center)"
"The idea that the majority of women who have abortions are burdened with feelings of regret, guilt, shame etc is not true to research. It is the anti-abortionists who project this on women and then claim it to be true to girls and women's experience."

"A week or two after my State Abolished Abortion Rights a Gal made the news. She was raped by her uncle & his ""Buddy"".
 Their Plea was simple enough, they were strung out from smoking crack!! (Poor guys).
 Anyway this TEENAGER was Impregnated as a result!! Convicting the Crackheads didn't solve ""HER"" problem.
 The Irony comes from the fact that HER CHURCH paid for her Abortion & the traveling expenses.
 This CHILD has been traumatized but can STILL Grow Up without the Awesome Responsibilities of Parenthood.

I wonder how many unwanted children pro lifers have adopted. Zero!
"Remove Churches completely, recycle Bibles to make better stuff, and you'll remove the hate, misinformation, and high-end ignorance, and intolerance.  By recycling Bibles the rules for slavery, and all the hateful and sadistic acts the Bible God does won't be taught anymore or promoted.  I Do NOT mean by fighting, gun fire, or any destructive means other than taking the building down and don't built any others.  Ending Christianity and all sects there of would slowly cause willful ignorance to end or at least not be passed on so much anymore.

Shelley, you're awesome!!"
"The anti-abortion protesters look like a bunch of losers and look like they don't live in reality. They are too lazy to help at a food bank, or work at a community garden harvesting produce for food banks, or to help senior citizens."
Abortions over hahaha Let's go Brandon
I wonder how many people in all that time have been killed in surrounding intersections perhaps they should start helping with other crosswalks also
"No matter how you look at it, 3rd trimester abortions are killing a viable, living human being. 6, 7 & 8 month old babies are born and live long lives every day, guess what I'm saying is I feel after 5-6 months that's a little person and should enjoy the same rights a brand new baby does, I'm not anti abortion, just feel after a certain point it should be off the table barring other medical considerations."
they are more peaceful than pro choices protests.
Yes a little humor killing babies is hilarious
":54 ""Nobody asked you.""  Great line!"
. . . That's what the neo-cons hierarchy wants . . . fewer babies of color to grow up and vote against them . .   These sinister mfers should be held accountable for all the damaged and dead women as a result of their incompetency and religious bias.  Our method of revenge . . . VOTE THEM OUT.
"Remember good ole' Prohibition and how well that worked?
Didn't detour people at all and it made drinking far more dangerous and deadly.  Home stills were killing indiscriminately,  bathtub gin could make you blind ( un- like masterbation). 
Good old Christians dictating your life for you!"
"Now, if Republicans don't support increased parental leave, subsidized childcare, increased WIC and Medicaid funding and availability, greater access to programs for people with abusive partners, minimum wage rates — just off the top of my head — that shows you what they really think of those lives they fought so fiercely to save. If their mass-killing enabling gun degregulation laws weren't enough.

The Role v. Wade fight was devised and engineered years after the court decision as a way to turn evangelical Christians into a unified voting block for Republicans.

Women just lost rights in exchange for increasing the Republican base. And there's nothing preventing Justice Alito's willfully myopic justification from being applied to contraception, gay marriage, interracial marriage, and whatever other culture war issues that so-called Conservatives dream up."
"That woman just said ""their right to choose life""......does she not understand, she *literally* just expressed pro-choice????"
"stop killing the living if you're ""pro Life""...just a thought"
"If not for these wonderful brave people this country was doomed decades ago 
What a wonderful human being"
I wish he’d find a better fn hobby!
Unborn baby killers and supporters should have ZERO rights!!!
I wonder how many of these “pro life” people also believe in the death penalty?
"To say it the short way, those anti-abortion activists give more rights to a foetus (not yet a child) inside of the body of a full-grown woman, that has in their eyes no right to choose. They impose their ideas not granting any option of consent to the women having to go through this not wanting to know the story behind this act. They impede on the human rights of those women. I wish they had at least the decency to try to understand the human aspect of it, seems hard though..."
Bigots make me wanna PUKE

"Thank you for everything you do, Shelley. 
And to all of the other walkers, doctors and nurses that put themselves at risk everyday to make that walk less lonely and more protected, you have my gratitude and respect."
I can't imagine having to deal with those Looney Toons each and every day.
How many of these protesters are qualified to adopt? Not that I expect them to try.
"If this man feels that abortion is terribly wrong, then maybe he shouldn't have one.  Let everyone else decide for themselves."
"Save All The Babies! Then, After That? Sorry, Your On Your Own!!! How Stupid, Does That Sound?! VERY!!!!!!!!!!"
"I am anti abortion, but also anti taking advantage of woman.  I want peace n my family to b happy. I have experience GOP extremism myself but also witnessed how slutty and disrespectful woman can be with their own bodies. So, what do we do?"
"Excellent report.  Thanks!
Courage, Shelly! 🌹❤️🌹"
"The pro-life people getting violent and murdering folks over personal beliefs in the 'freest country in the world'??? I'm shocked 🙄. No, the Christofascist POS's don't want ANYONE else daring to tell THEM what to do (since their twisted and wrong interpretation of the Bible is all that matters... and the second coming of Christ, Trump), but they'll demand you to do and live as they say or you'll end up getting assaulted or murdered. Man, woman, child... It doesn't matter. They WILL kill you AND in their God's name, which is the sickest part. They're like Wonder bread, plain mayo, suburban al-Qaeda. And like usual, the bad guys think they're the heroes in this story because their POV and main character syndrome is the one that matters. We all have a long road ahead of fighting off these unstable, selfish, greedy white Christians who are demanding our rights in one hand and lives in another. Because of them, guns will soon have more protection and rights than our daughters."
I don't want religious idiots telling me how I have to live my life.
"F12, F catholics, F christians, F Republicans,  F America,  ACAB"
They believe in a religion that says a women got pregnant without sex 🙄
Psychosis is not necessarily a moral issue. For when he meets his maker.

"Why are they not helping kids in foster care, the homeless, the elderly. Wasting time on something that is non of their business."
These protestors really need to get a life and mind their own f'in business.  They love to offer help - but not any money once that baby is out of the oven.
"Bunch of hypocrites! Won’t support universal health care, won’t help kids in need but think they have the right to decide for other people. Sickening!"
"None of the anti-abortion people care about the impoverished, hungry children, just their fetuses. It’s fucking. Insane."

What are these protesters doing to help the children that are already born? 🤔 if they care so much about a child?
"You are awesome 👍👍👍👍👍
Crazy F in religious scum."
"In downtown Louisville, Kentucky there used to be, used to be, one of the only clinics in the state that would perform abortions. I would travel through downtown quite often going back and forth from work and I always knew when it was a clinic day. Not because of crazies out with signs but because both sides of the street in front of the clinic and across the street from the clinic would be bumper to bumper with Mercedes, BMWs and Cadillacs. No, they were not there for a procedure they were there to tell the women (who had to park blocks over) coming in for a procedure that they were worthless human beings. Then they would get in their Cadillacs and Mercedes and go out to lunch I suppose."
Lead poisoning is a bitch
"I never forget a pastor that went to see the protesters of his congregation they were doing in front of the clinic. He was standing and listening to the anti-abortion group approach to the people going to the clinic. After he heard them he went and talked to an older woman with a sign on the other side God loves you! She wasn’t aggressive or yelling things to the people driving into the clinic. He decided to wait and listen to her if anyone approached her. When he heard talking with such a loving, merciful , compassion and not condemning them and encouraged the couple to have faith the Lord will provide and you don’t have to this. Told them have a blessed day as they drove into the clinic and on the way out they stopped and thanked her for her advice and told her they changed their mind. Without yelling or condemning this lady kept doing it everyday and he kept going to listen.  He noticed and confirmed how she was able to get people to change their mind; except cases of rape, incest and high risk pregnancies and even some raped victims decided to give the child for abortion and she gave them the information where to contact. The people approached by the other side had no effect on the people driving into the clinic because of their rhetoric and attitude. They didn’t achieve what the Lord expected to happen. In his sermon at the service; he shared his experience outside the clinic and he ask the congregation. Are you showing love, compassion and mercy to these people when you go to those clinic? He say what are we doing to help this people, do we shelter or feed and support these women making a hard decision. Are we providing them support or have plans on how to help them because by condemning them we are pushing them away. Who wants to listen to you if you’re yelling at these people or women. He said the group started changing the way they were approaching them and not showing condemning signs. Think and pray how to do it if you’re in this mission evangelizing and spreading the gospel. Are you prepared for it ; because we’re sending or expressing the wrong message."
"Odd that every time I see one of the ‘religious’ whack jobs doing this…it is a man! Pressuring a female when it has absolutely nothing to do with them…but, their brains are so atrophied it is pathological.

Theological tyranny or let’s say a Christian form of sharia law is coming! 🙈🙉🙊"

How many babies have been murdered???
"What about the kids being cage up at the border like animals, being separated from their parents having that trauma for life, why don’t they go protest there if they really care for kids lives then let’s do it for every single kid specially the ones that’s are fully form and have a chance at life because they are already here"

"Abortion was made for horror. In abortion, a mother is pitted against her child, the Madonna becomes Medea; and the child, usually a symbol of innocence, is experienced as an invading enemy. The distortions of the pregnant woman’s body are mirrored in the dismemberment of the fetus, and the helplessness and terror felt by many women facing unwanted pregnancy are mirrored in the unfeeling, unthinking total powerlessness of the embryo. The present is turned against the future, the doctor works to end a life, and the womb becomes a battleground. Regardless of your political or moral beliefs, there’s enough material there to give anyone nightmares.

Perhaps this is why abortion and unwanted or monstrous pregnancy have been explored countless times in horror movies, comics, and prose. And horror has treated these topics much less reductively than one might expect, approaching them primarily in emotional or visceral terms, and secondarily in moral terms, rather than primarily in political terms.

There are at least three obvious approaches creators could take to abortion-horror. The two I’ve run across most frequently are grotesquerie and grief: horror focusing on a monstrous baby, and horror focusing on a haunted post-abortive parent. I won’t attempt a complete survey of abortion-related imagery in horror; these are merely observations about how horror has managed to address our intense and conflicting fears around unwanted pregnancy and the unborn.

In The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror, David J. Skal argues that the 1960s and 1970s brought a wave of monstrous-baby movies, which he links to the terrible birth defects caused by Thalidomide and the growing movement for legalized abortion: Rosemary’s Baby , of course, and the body-horror flicks Eraserhead (David Lynch) and The Brood (David Cronenberg), plus a score of much lesser flicks like Humanoids from the Deep and It’s Alive and its sequels. He focuses on the hit movie Alien : “The poster art for Alien was deceptively simple and evocative: a cracked egg in a dark void, and the tag line In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream . Whether the space was internal or external was not made clear.”

These images reflect and perhaps strengthen the real revulsion many women experience at the thought of an unwanted pregnancy. It’s impossible to spend five minutes reading an online discussion of abortion without coming across a description of the unborn child as a “parasite” or a “tumor,” a “mass of cells,” an intruder, invader, alien¯almost a rapist.

As anyone who’s watched Rosemary’s Baby can see, the images of monstrous children recur in horror not because the filmmakers want to get us to donate to Planned Parenthood, but because they tap into preexisting fears in the audience.

But there is another large sub-genre of abortion horror. For reasons not entirely clear to me, I’ve run across this other kind of horror almost exclusively in short stories and independent comics.

These are stories about ghosts: The return of the child who was never allowed to be born. As with the monster-child films, not all of these works are very good. F. Paul Wilson’s 1989 novella Buckets , for example, is an uninspired rendition of an obvious central idea¯the children an abortionist killed returning to wreak their revenge. Tanith Lee’s short story The Abortionist’s Horse (A Nightmare) , reprinted in 2001’s Year’s Best Fantasy and Horror , features her characteristic over-ripe prose, redeemed by eerie imagery. Lee describes a pregnant woman alone in a country house who can’t stop hearing the clip-clop of a ghostly horse, which once carried a rural woman who performed illegal abortions. The inescapable hoof beats (a horrific echo of the heartbeat in her womb) both reflect and heighten her own fears about her pregnancy, leading up to a bloody, tragic ending.

For genuinely artistic representations of abortion-as-horror, however, the best examples are comics. Alan Moore ( Watchmen , V for Vendetta ) suffuses his return-of-repressed-conscience horror comic A Small Killing with imagery of abortion symbolically portrayed as the destruction of youthful innocence.

This symbolism seems to have escaped most readers¯despite its ubiquity in the comic¯perhaps because of the comic’s equally-blatant left-wing political slant. Once again, the force of the abortion imagery is best understood by reading emotionally and morally, not politically.

A similar collision of the politics of abortion and the emotional aftermath of the act occurs in Jaime Hernandez’s “Flies on the Ceiling: The True Story of Isabel in Mexico,” one of the darkest installments in the extraordinary comic series Love and Rockets . “Flies” may depict a woman’s psychological breakdown, or her encounters with the devil; or both. Her abortion is depicted by showing a scene of generic creepy protesters outside a clinic. The politics of this depiction might even be called anti-pro-life.

And yet the story of Isabel’s grief and partial healing follows a more complex emotional and symbolic logic. Her healing begins when she becomes the housekeeper for a lonely single father, becoming part of their family. Although her maternal idyll doesn’t last, it effectively shows that both her abortion and her divorce are experiences from which she’s still recovering. The comic doesn’t take a final stand on whether the satanic figures who stalk Isabel are projections of her own Catholic guilt and shame or if, by her actions, she has opened herself to visionary and terrifying experiences of the supernatural.

I had expected to find one other sub-genre of horror: the horror of repression, in which the focus is not on the monstrous baby or the haunted adult, but on the social pressures controlling women’s choices and circumstances. John Carpenter did a “Masters of Horror” installment called “Pro-Life,” in which a woman carrying a demonic fetus is prevented from aborting by her pro-life relatives; I leave it to the viewer to determine whether this explicitly politicized treatment of abortion-horror succeeds as art. An understandably obscure French movie, House of Voices , at first seems like it will be repression-horror, since it centers on a woman hiding her unwanted pregnancy in a 1950s orphanage, and is suffused with images of binding, covering, and cleansing. However, by its confusing, hallucinatory end, it’s embedded firmly in the second, “haunting” sub-genre.

Even David Skal, who often over-politicizes his reading of horror movies, acknowledges, “the demonization of fetal images does not lend itself to a simplistic ideological interpretation¯monster children are not exactly pro-life or pro-choice, but, like the sick joke, articulate unspoken aspects on both sides.” Abortion horror, whatever its creators’ political sympathies, explores the fears and griefs and blood so often ignored or repressed by both sides of the political battle."
I love this woman!
I wish this heroic brave woman so much love xx
"It pisses me off to see these self righteous people terrorize innocent women ! Especially since these same people don’t give a damn about the babies after they’re born, they vote for people who reduce assistance for poor people in regards to healthcare, financial aid and the pregnant women don’t get prenatal care for free but these terrorist protestors don’t care! EQUALITY NOW FOR WOMEN! OUR BODIES OUR CHOICES!# WE WONT BACK DOWN # WE WONT FO BACK!!!"
Absolutely  disgrace the American taliban forcing their  evil beliefs
"Why do have to stop people from (bombing) killing other people because of a, key word, (unborn) element?"
"Wow Liberals heads filled with TDS must just be exploding this week. Trump just keeps winning and winning and winning!

2- POTUS 45 keeps babies alive!
3- Because of 45 you can pray and give thanks that you're alive!"
"There was no Jesus Christ and there’s no God. Just look at the people, who say otherwise."
"Ok, so you Americans have totally gotten this all wrong. It is really simple to get rid of abortion forever. Simply because every, EVERY abortion is ALWAYS and ONLY the fault of us MEN. So, if you American women want to feel safe, then fight for a rule where every ""accidental"" pregnancy is to be regulated, fined, and penalized by those who in fact are to blame, males! 
See, no woman in the world can be accidentally impregnated by herself. There needs to be a male sperm-hosing villain in the picture. and most reasons as to why you women get pregnant is either because the man impregnates you out of his egoistically acted upon the instinct of consuming the act all the way inside of you, or because men rapes. So, the MEN should have to answer to every time he ejaculates inside of a female without her consent. That is it. if the men have to go to jail or let's say, after one proven act of such ""accidental ejaculation"" he would need to be forced to undergo a vasectomy or even better, after three times of accidental ejaculation such a man was forced to undergo a medical castration, I can promise you that the American abortion problem would cease to exist besides criminally executed acts whether by rape or incestuous rape committed against any women. And those would be much easier to legalize since it would not be from a one-night stand gone wrong (seen from the female's perception.)

So to all you American women, there you have the way to go at this, get into the true source of this male egoistical issue,
and to you American men. now that the women have gotten a new angle to look at these things, be ready to show much more sympathy and restrain, the outcome will not be as rosy once your females starts to take action against your long-lived idiocies and old ways of doing things."
What's goes on in other people's bedrooms is none of their business! These anti-abortion protesters aren't paying these patients insurance or medical bills! They need to stay in their own lanes! Mind your own business!
I love her I’ve followed her for a while on TikTok ❤️
"Exodus 21:22-26 states, in no uncertain terms, that the life of the fetus is of lesser value than the life of the mother. In the scenario in Exodus, if 2 men are fighting and a pregnant woman is injured, such that she miscarries, the offender pays a fine. If, on the other hand, ""someone is injured"", then it's an eye for an eye. Clearly the fetus is a not ""someone"", according to Exodus."
I love her! Thank you Shelly and everyone who works in this clinic
Shelley is doing Gods work!! The personal decision that someone has to make to have an abortion is their own personal decision Shelley is walking them in and keeping them safe.

"Keep on fighting, Shelley. The evil troops of Gilead must not win."
"I don't mind someone praying or trying to reason with someone until they say leave me alone, then it is time to stop. There should be no killing, no assault, no threat of violence of any kind, verbal or written format. It is not godly to promote violence and convinces no one to willing comply. It only points to your opinion being wrong and not of God."

"While im not for abortion i would have to say at least she is nice about it. But she is just doing her job for the clinic. However, taking part in something to murder innocent babies i cant go along with. the problem with abortion movement is they've dehumanized a baby to the point where its a ""thing"" and not a human being. that's the only way they can justify what they are doing. but if they really think about it logically there is no way they can be for it. It has nothing to do with a religious belief its murder pure and simple there is no religious aspect about it."

Isn’t amazing that the people who want to ban abortion also call for executions?

Those protestors are creepy.

"My first job out of college was working at a prosecutor's office.   The first week I was there, a little 12-year-old girl was brought in by her mother.   They were old-order Amish, the horse and buggy type.  The child was pregnant and she would not tell her mother who the father was and the mother wanted it investigated.   To make a long story short, after weeks of investigation, blood tests, etc., it was scientifically proven the baby's father was his grandfather.   The little girl was raped by her own father.   Of course, then the mother wanted the case dropped.   The baby was born; he was a little boy; he was born with complications of incest such as severe mental and physical disorders and disabilities.   Up until then, I had not believed in abortion.   When you see it in person, you have a different view."
Why are the vast majority of abortion protestors social misfits or just simply weird?
Abortion shouldn't even be an agrument
And American trying to tell Afghanistan and the taleban to respect women's rights crazy world we live in
Hail Satan!! Praise be the dark lord on this beautiful day of days. May he guide and support his people in ways that God refuses to. Satan is the answer!!!
"republicans HATE women and children
If republicans are going to FORCE WOMEN to have a child
Then republicans should pay for that child - from birth through college
VOTE DEMOCRATS"
Old white men telling women what to do with their bodies. What's new
I believe in free rights as a believer in god. As long as no one treats these young women with malace oe employees with disrespect. A life is a life. We pray for the mothers and babies who are killed. And will help if anyone asks for. But no one should attack anyone. Not in the good book. God bless everyone working in these places . Going to these places. May they see what happens to fetus as it defends itself runs away from the objects being used to kill it. A being has a fight or flight reaction to danger. Maybe when going in for  Consultation the parent should be informed and shown what actually happens before going with the final step. If a women is raped yes abort. If a pregancy occours from lack of a condom. No abortion. When a baby has less rights then a unborn puppy or animal. There is a loss of human kindness.
"In the beginning of the 3rd trimester, a fetus is just starting to develop its cerebral cortex. All the time prior, every movement, every action is done from reflexive behavior. Meaning, it cannot think, learn, do Any voluntary actions. Not even swallow at will. It is in a vegetative state because it's brain hasn't developed yet.
That guys message on his van, ""I'm 9 weeks old and started sucking my thumb"" that's reflexive, not voluntary. At 9 weeks a fetus' brain is making neuro connections to be able to do these reflexive actions. Like, sucking it's thumb, regulating it's heartbeat, blood pressure, swallow. These are not from voluntary thought. It's a survival reflexes development. 
Doesn't it make sense that a brain would first develop survival reflexes then the ability to think? Well, it does. Our thought process to do Anything voluntarily comes from our cerebral cortex. And that isn't even developing until late 2nd to early 3rd trimester."
Thank you Shelley!!!!!
Gross 🤢
Violence against women will sky rocket...because they are pregnant.....unlawful termination of a pregnancy.... the wackos don't need abortion clinics; they don't use them already; abuse works well enough thru a man made-up miscarriage to terminate a pregnancy ; and they get away with it
I commend her on not running the protesters over. So tempting. They have no right to mindf*** these girls and women coming in for a very difficult and painful decision/procedure. Nobody makes that choice lightly and I don't think that's gonna get the protesters in the pearly gates.
"Thanks to those who fight for women's rights. Positive vibes from New Hampshire, remember to be kind to each other and yourself during these trying times"
"Why these protesting people think they can force their beliefs on others and can't mind their own business, is beyond me. They are protesting against private citizens not government."
These religious types are completely out of their minds. Which is fine. But they want to make everybody else mad as well. That's what makes me want to puke.
Looks like we'll have another fat libs of tick tock to laugh at pretty soon.
"What you need to do is have good guys with guns to help escort these women in to get the help they need. I'm tired of these trumpsters and their Bible thumping snake handling ideas. It's time to put them in their place, and make them feel intense fear for once. Time for the tables to be turned on the trumpster Taliban. They may need to experience a real Red Wave themselves"
"They only seem to care about them BEFORE they r born. Most of these extremists r republicans. It's republicans that r constantly trying to reduce public programs or cancel them altogether. 
Where's the help DURING & AFTER? Will they pay the prenatal doctor visits? The $40,000 bill to give birth in a hospital? What about support for raising the child? Family support programs? Food, diapers, clothes, schooling, childcare, medical bills for the child?
They only care before they r born. Then again at 18 when they can sign up in the army to die for a political reason that's usually just to benefit rich capitalists that just want to control another country to make more money. 
Then IF they return & have medical needs or counseling, the support for veterans is yet again something the republicans r trying to defund or or even cancel. 
Before birth, service ""to their country"" is the ONLY time these people care. The rest of the time, the mothers r on their own. 
Support equal funding for public programs & military. Maybe then there won't be so many women feeling they have no other choice. 
Even then, her body, HER choice."
God bless these men for doing the Lord’s work. Here is a thought…. Take responsibility for your actions! Killing your baby won’t just POOF make your problems go away
"These folks crack me up. So worried about an unborn fetus yet won't do anything to help that mom or kid when it's born. Yet they scream their religion yet do again do nothing to help. Who cares if the constitution doesn't cover abortion, neither does your Bible. Love how they scream my body my choice and this is America I have a rights yet are fast to deny women theirs. All these pro lifers should spend a day in an abortion clinic cause they have no idea how hard that decision is. It's not where's using it as contraception."
She looks like she eats the babies once they are terminated.  What a disgusting excuse for a human. She is a Baby Killer
Similar nut jobs are out there screaming whenever I go for a pap smear it's ridiculous
What the hell is 'assault with mutual consent'? Lol

No, I do not care."
There’s nothing moral with the Bible. It’s not even debatable. It’s pure crap.
"The self righteous mindless anti-abortion protesters think murder is okay? How does this paradox fit their faith, Jung explains what happens to their feeble minds when they can't see the truth of existence."

"This is why I'm an athiest this is why it shouldn't be a religous or a political agenda for abortion, this is a medical right for a woman to choose, it's hard enough carrying a child to term, what if the baby had ill effects or even the mother? would you think a 12-year-old is raped by a family member or a teach then is forced to have the child herself? think of the pain she'd go through telling it to stop?. It's like the anti-vaxxers who was against having a vaccination and/or a mask then it's ok to force a woman to have that baby, you know not all sex is consensual right?"
They’re against abortion. They prefer filicide. Babies must be born! We need more to stuff our churches and orphanages with a variety of choices of children to rape. Plus we need more fresh slaves. Finally we need the rest for target practice.
What’s crazy is you bomb an Abortion clinic killing those STILL unborn fetus you’re crying about how ironic
It's usually old white men who oppose abortion rights. Wonder why 🤔
"Mostly Bible thumping self proclaimed Christians. Twisted mess of human hypocrites. I believe in pro choice. Don't like it, don't care!"
These people are weirdo's!
It's better to be alive and poor and then to not exist how many great people rose from poverty.
Those anti-abortion demonstrators are some sick people ! I wouldn't  trust them with my kid !
Pro-life murderers 🙄way too much inbreeding
"Wow. What will those self righteous jerks do with their time now that Roe is overturned? Hopefully gather aid for unwed or poor mothers and children,  but I have a feeling they will find other powerless people to oppress like LGBTQ people."
"I had an abortion. It was the best decision for myself and my family. I’ve never regretted it a day in my life. I was able to finish college, meet my husband and start a family when we were ready both financially and mentally. I went on to have two beautiful children that I love dearly. My kids have never known poverty or instability because I was ready to start our family. They have a wonderful life because of the decisions I made. Only I know what’s best for my family. I will fight for this right for all women. We MUST have autonomy over our own bodies. It’s a basic human right that ensures we have a say in our future."
Throw away your stupid signs and save a REAL child from our foster care system. Advocating for a mindless blob of cells while actual kids are being abused.🤦🏽‍♂️
"Have I got this right - people were murdered by PRO-LIFERS? Well, that sounds absurdly  hypocritical."
The first guy looks like the goon that the Scooby-Doo doo mystery squad catches and takes the mask off ….”if it wasn’t for them meddling kids”
"i wonder how many boxes of pampers, cans of formula, pairs of shoes or groceries do any of the protesters buy for any of the mothers they help."
She's great and Dan needs to stay home to have his movements!
"I’m sick of these self righteous people who think they know what’s best for everyone else.  If you don’t like abortion, don’t have one.."
Mind your own business. Nobody forces you to abortion!! Would a man like to be forced castrated? Women's body women's choice.
0:11 ain’t that the pot calling the kettle black
"What's wrong with people trying to deter parents from killing their child??? I'm truly sad and confused that so many are fighting to kill children, the irony is if our parents aborted us we wouldn't be here"
USA=New Saudi Arabia
"""So they have the right to choose life"". Bs. They are forcing their religious beliefs on others. Scotus has taken away the right to choose.  It is being forced on women. May karma come back on Scotus, in full force."
"The anti-abortion thugs should focus all of their energy on getting kids, who are in foster care, adopted to families. What they are doing is pure harassment.  Nothing more, nothing less."
I think its time for people like her to use guns as a protection.
"Why are these men protesting when they'll never have to be pregnant, give birth or face having an abortion?!"
I think everyone has the right to their opinion.
We as a people now have a choice we are slowly gaining back our power for BOTH man and women. We must get out and vote more. Hopefully this will not get any worse #prochoice
such a brave amazing lady! all my love to her❤️
In my country it is illegal to protest outside of abortion clinics. I feel so badly for the women who go for medical treatment and get harassment and worse. The church has no business in healthcare.
"The realistic picture is that abortion was not enough for Liberals.  They kept pushing laws Laws more and more and more.  Many countries have abortion laws that ban after 12 weeks.  Liberals kept pushing and in some places it was up til due date that you can kill the child and yet it still was not enough.  So many people on the ropes about abortion jumped sides and LIBERALS did this to themselves.  Really a fat white chick with a black beanie and glasses is such a cliche'  Stop trying to hard sister...Make no mistake that these Liberals are THE SYSTEM and are what some refer to as THE MAN.  They are the ones with the top 1% backing them so make no mistake of them playing oppressed.  Planned Parenthood made billions of dollars aborting babies and selling their body parts at 100% profit.  As to my fellow black Americans, Stop letting Liberals from rich families and ivy league degrees control you.  These rich whites are using your skin to empower themselves while your skin tone blocks for them.  STOP WORKING FOR THE MAN"
"Next time we should  hand them a baby and ask them to adopt right there and  they will run away so fast, even a 80 year old man there who has arthritis will not stop running."
"I personally do not like the idea of abortion past 15 weeks, but its still a personal decision that is nobody's business except for the woman having one. If the u s govt were to put more money towards reproductive education in the schools and make birth control more accessible and affordable. These idiots that protest outside of these clinics do not have te patients best interests at heart , most of them have been brainwashed by their religious institutions and misogynists"
Maby they should go helo the homeless feed people a lot more good could be done than waisting time protesting. Adpot a  anorted foster kid rase them instead of harassing women. Help not harm..
"Thank you Shelley , you are a heroine to these women and you DO make a difference in their lives! Keep abortion safe and legal!!!!"
These Republican states are forcing women to have babies just for the state to make money off the babies. That's all it is. Think about it if that person didn't want to baby and was forced to have it and still doesn't want it who takes care of it the state and then their orphans to their 18
"ALL those people, both the protesters and the lady recording them, are extremists. BOTH, I say? Yes. Most people are not ""pro abortion"", meaning that we don't see it as a good, moral choice for  contraception. Most people would be fine if it got banned as a ""do over"" for people who decided to have sex, and ignore the MOUNTAINS of contraception methods out there. However, most people also believe that, in cases of incest, rape, or medical necessity, abortion should be a viable medical option. Again, I said MOST. There are plenty of extremists who would be fine with abortions up to the 6th month or later, for no reason at all, and others who would see rape victims bear their rapist's children against their will. If you live in a state run by extremists, LEAVE AS SOON AS YOU CAN. drain them of population and resources."
Love her energy.
BOYCOTT TIKTOK
Ban abortion all over!
The US Taliban. What a bunch of sickos.
Use Luke 6:30 against the protestors. It is Jesus talking to his apostles telling them how to behave when they are out in the world representing the faith. He tells them give to anyone that asks something from them and do not demand back anything someone takes from them. Get them to read the passage (they have a bible). And then start asking for their things. Usually they will refuse. But then they lose the illusion of the moral high ground as they turn their back on Jesus. It creates a delightful amount of cognitive dissonance for them.
This lady contributes to Death every day for money and dress in rainbow colors leading women to Murder they’re babies🤦‍♂️
To much violence in this world.I pray for peace.nothing ever constructive gets done by violence.

Mostly from drugs like heroin , cocaine , meth , and the ever so popular fentanyal !  Try getting back to being Americas news source , instead of pushing radical divide ! And for God sakes get off the Jan 6 circus !"
They dont care about life. They care about imposing their own opinion on everyone else.
Do these realize if women could easily care for a baby they wouldn't be here.
Where the hell do these worn out old fools get off yelling at young women. They need to be herded into an asylum.
Yet none of them can answer the question of what to do with a 12-year-old that’s been impregnated by her father. These people do not live in reality and they don’t have to deal with the child once it’s here.
Those people are lucky they have no drive by Shootings.
"but why is it only in America the issue is intense and the procedure is very prevalent so to speak??? Should not this overall thing would be rare case?? I am confused here...really...I am pro-choice I guess, but why is it such a frequent phenomenon like some flue or some common cold?? there is fundamental problem in education of reproductive health and focus on preventive/contraceptive is glaringly and evidently lacking!!"
"""Adding a bit of humor"" what is funny about cutting a baby into pieces to throw in the trash or sell for extra cash?"
"Dan, what are you going to do with yourself now that you've lost the one thing that gave your life meaning? Time to kick it?"
"This is an older video. These people are celebrating today I’m sure. But it’s funny how a lot of them are MEN. People who are ALWAYS TELLING WOMEN WHAT TO DO. Now their is no choice. No women who have ectopic pregnancies, or non viable pregnancies, who medically need an abortion, or it will KILL THE WOMAN are now not even an OPTION in 25 states. HOW DARE THE EXTREMIST SUPREME COURT TAKE AWAY RIGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE FIVE POLITICIAN GOP JUSTICES WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL, was stripped. Taken. Done. Doctors being jailed in America and women being second class citizens again in 2022 is sick. The GOP claims it’s to save lives and that’s why they did it. Then tell me why justice Thomas just stated that he is going to review same sex marriage. Same sex marriage isn’t killing people? So if it was about saving lives, they wouldn’t be coming for these other rights. The United States is no longer free. The GOP are taking away your rights to learn about critical race theory, they are banning conversations about lgbtq topics, they have no issues taking away first amendment rights and the rights of 150 million women, and for birth upon them, and scream about protecting these unborn babies, yet the moment you suggest sensible gun control measures, to save these babies being born from being murdered in their classrooms, your infringing on THEIR rights. Funny how that works. Guns have more rights in America than women do. The gop wants to protect lives? And children? But they VOTE AGAINST UNIVERSAL
CHILDCARE AND UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE? They vote AGAINST MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING yet they scream
That it’s not a gun problem it’s a mental health issue! THEN FUND IT. Stop voting against every bill written up by Dems just because you don’t wanna piss off daddy insurrectionist trump. We all know none of the house or senate GOP have a back bone. Their concern is losing their donations if they go against trump, and then losing their political careers which in turn they lose their power. 

Remember that when your wife, daughter, sister, etc comes to you and says, I was raped and I’m pregnant but the baby won’t survive and neither will I if I give birth because it’s an ectopic pregnancy, you better tell them goodbye. Because that’s the new reality if you live in a GOP ran state. Welcome to the 1700s folks. That’s the time frame of the book quoted by the Supreme Court as to why abortion should be over turned. They want to go back to the bare bones of the constitution where the word “she” isn’t in there one time. Where women were property of their husbands and couldn’t vote and when anyone of color or any minority could own property or didn’t have the same rights as “white men.” That’s what the Supreme Court thinks the way America should be. Don’t believe me? Read their opinion piece, and then look at America today and what they’ve done. They’ve pushed their PERSON AND RELIGIOUS beliefs on 350 million Americans, in a country founded on religious freedom. Funny how that doesn’t matter anymore to them but the constitution does. They pick and choose to make minorities suffer. The white men must prosper in the new America. And America I want no part in at all."
Is it allowed to have a tall ladder on public land without permission?
Maybe they should be on Capitol Hill fighting for expanded medical and paid family leave  and daycare

Abortion= antiLife
The same SJW'S who claim men can get pregnant are now claiming that overturning Roe is an assault on women's rights. Were these SJW'S confused when they claim a man can get pregnant or are they confused now when they claim overturning Roe is an attack on women's rights? These people are uninformed stooges.
It's my right to kill my baby!!!😅😂🤣
They are a pack of religious nuts should on medication they been at abortion clinics for years it a disgrace that the supreme Court is allowed to stop abortions my body my choice
"These ""Christians"" are incredibly cruel. A slogan I'm going to begin using ""mind your own business"", which is what conservatives have been howling for decades."
"How tf can American law makers make decisions on the human body/health without studying above high school biology?? Makes no sense. If you even took a course above high school bio or listened to medical professionals, they will understand how important abortion is to the safety of wowan. Absolute fools."
Hope Dan understands the lord has killed babies
People do you see all of the Bots putting spam replies only on the objectionable comments!!!...
"Eleven dead under gunfire, but their pro life🙄"
"I love how these people keep saying "" unborn  children"" and don't realize it is a contradiction in terms. How can you be a child if you aren't even born?"
"Shelly works for Satan himself, it's seriously beyond sick, Satanic and dystopian they've normalized murdering babies, the fake news is mostly to blame. They normalize it, it's so DEMONIC, wait till everyone finds out they put them murdered babies in your pop, food and medicine.. buckle up, cold hard SATANIC truth is upon us all"
"The anti abortionists withheld their names for the press and the cameras today.  They can act like mentally ill narcissists, and damage other people with their words, but, they wont share their names for the world to see."
"Dan the man should mind his own business. Can he get pregnant? No, So he should move on and enjoy his life doesn't look like it's going to be very long.."
The US has become a Country of Dumb Ass Misguided
Antiabortion movement is nothing but the disguise to take woman’s right away. Muslims mainly take woman’s right away or women are considered not having equal rights as men.
CNN...full of Godless lefties.
"Choice comes BEFORE you get pregnant. USE BIRTHCONTROL! Abortion is NOT birth control!!
    All the pro-choice screamers need to shut up and practice thinking instead."
These people are selfish deep down. They want God to praise them when they die Lol
"Guess those protesters believe that when a body dies the soul dies with it. They must be terrified themselves at the thought of us along with our bodies simply vanishing forever.
They claim to be there in God's name too. Shame on them. And why aren't they offering to adopt and raise these fetuses themselves. They want to force pregnancy but won't take the baby! What's up with that?!
I say they start working on taking care of their own issues and quit putting their stupid beliefs on everyone around them! 
Shameful"
The good lord is going to ask you why you were so evil.

Why are these activest old white people or women no one wants to have sex with?~ Wilmrbadguy
She's angel
Most are old men past child making age
Imagine being upset that you can’t murder a little baby growing in a mothers womb. What a sick sick thing.
"Pro-choice americans should push for legislation that requires states to identify thru dna or whatever who the father is asap and pro-rate support for the child from the date of conception thru age of 18. If the father cant pay, the state will. Now everybody has skin in the game."
"I'm sick of ""BULL~DAGGERS""!!"
These people are tormenting young women during a difficult time in their lives. That is ungodly. That is the opposite of Christ like.
These are the ugliest escorts I've ever seen.
This big nasty lady has no worried about ever getting knocked up.  LOL...it's always the hideous leftists that nobody on earth respects that get out and cackle about women's right to Murder.
They could stand outside gun stores

Why don't they go help those that are living and got gunned down?
"Most of the time, it’s men yelling outside the clinic! They are so sickening!"
Notice how the anti choice nuts are all men that NOBODY would ever have sex with!
And how many pro life individuals follow that through. As in anti war cuz that cost life
Hope these people that want it stopped give money and have adopted themselves
I hope Shelly Puts the first and last names of the people harassing patients in social media.

Bomb threats? That's some fucked up tactics.
"People (especially men) have no clue about a woman's reproductive system and why we are fighting so hard!    Before any snide comments, get educated.  I do not believe in abortion, just because, but I do believe in a woman's health...PERIOD!  Judge not, that you may not be judged! (So-called Christians)"
Abortion is one of those things where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
"Didn't God open the first abortion clinic when the the nephilum came to earth and raped earth women, just wondering"
How brave. Nothing but a pole smoker.
"anti-abortion protesters are self-righteous and full of themselves. they can shout at others and feel superior. If they really cared about children, they would be doing something about gun control. they would be feeding the homeless. they would follow Jesus example. Jesus never stood on a corner and yelled obscenities at people."
I wish I could stand with her outside. I have alot of build up rage for these entitled people
Dems begin terror campaign
"I think it's time we start picketing the religious fake abortion clinics with the same fervor the crazies on the right do abortion clinics. Signs can read, ""this org kills women"" & ""stop here for a life of poverty."""
"Pro life, till the kid is born. No free healthcare, no support for single mothers. The narrow-minded hypocrisy of these people is beyond comprehension. Thoughts and prayers never did anything for anyone and THAT is all they are offering as NONE of these protesters would even consider adopting a baby of colour. As for their attacks on LGBTQ!?-when we have kids they are well-considered and planned for and well looked after."
"What an amazing young woman, selfless trying to protect this women from this zealots we need to recognize their work."
"A question for the scotus Many states are turning miscarriage into crimes?  If the mother can be held accountable for harm to a fetus NOT a living being yet?  Then if mother dies as a result of pregnancy then cannot the Fetus then be charged with MURDER?  Likewise this would mean all those that contributed to the death of the mother.... from the sperm donor. too the doctors , right up too state officials that barred the mother from Medical assistance by charged as accessories?"
"Guess I guess the Christian’s forgot about the deaths they cause of the Native Americans boarding schools, Tuam baby deaths and the sexual abuse from priest."
The Republicans are not the American Talibans. The Talibans are the Afghan Republicans.
Wtf? You need protection? 😢😢
"These people are hypocrites….. if you want to do what’s right BAN teens from having sex without being married ! The Bible says no fornication so why isn’t Supreme Court banning sex and condoms? 
They are hypocrites yes we should not kill but we should not lie, fornicate, commit adultery, no stealing from others, no bad words, no violence, no pray to false images and idols , no blood eating yet blood transfusion are okay for them …really… when ur hospitalized tgey feed you through an IV in your arm so you’re eating right there same thing w blood transfusions you are eating blood, no corruption , no gossiping ect…..yet Supreme Court allows all that. That’s why I said hypocrites! If they’re gonna base on the Bible than do it 100% to tge fullest .  Conservatives tell their kids that that’s it’s okay to have sex just to be wise and use condoms ….? Really? Hypocrites. If you tell your kids to keep their snakes in their cage and girls to keep their doors closed then their wouldn’t have to br abortions! Hipócritas!! 
Just as Jesus said: To fake leaders you Hypocrites! You say you love God but with your actions you repute God."
Love this woman.
Help by praying lol
The same people who stand on corners claiming to be Jesus.
Let's vote on it. The majority of Americans are pro-choice. Majority rules.

Do they protest governors or court systems that impose the death penalty?
Those peoples are against abortion ask them you want those babies 👶 and want to raise them you can have them.

"Always amazes me how men feel they have right to protest  , have never encountered a pregnant man,"
"The pursuit of the destruction of democracy in favor of autocracy in America has ALWAYS been part of the ""Conservative"" mindset. But because Conservatives polluted both Partys it was difficult to isolate. When most of them gathered under the GOP banner during the Goldwater-Nixon era the quest began in earnest as they realized their marginalization or extinction was inevitable because of their retrograde thinking & philosophies. The main reason they survived was because of their support (mainly to reap large campaign donations) of the ultra-wealthy & powerful while brainwashing their hoards.
From the 1960s onward the undermining, sabotaging, subversion, distortions, and distractions began to fracture the nation based on Republicans removing their dupes from reality, truth & logic. They've continued to erode Federal government competency at every turn via obstruction & violation of sworn oaths. 
""Conservatives"" can celebrate most recently that they got what they wanted via hypocrisy, stealing, cheating, lying, perjury - there was a complete abdication of ethics & morals in obtaining this (temporary) ""victory"". Minority rule is the road to fascism & should not be tolerated."

A woman makes the choice to either provide a new life with all the equalities of life which are limited in every country based on economy they may of may not have an living wage in.
Whole governments are against Abortions, yet not Carpet bombing or Nuking a neighbor In time of war . 
Does anyone besides me see the Irony in that ? 
So my personal Opinion it should be a women's choice .
Final Statement on this issue by me .
Mr Stormy C. Natero."
The so-called pro life religious tyranny killing people deserve to be sent to Guentanamo...
Maybe the anti-abortion protestors should be confronted with images of children who were victims of gun violence and asked why they support the murder of innocent babies.
"USA is now a theocracy, a country with religious laws controlled by religious people just like you Afghanistan a superstitious third world country and that’s the new norm for USA! No healthcare no childcare, hard to organize and now this. WTF people, you are moving in the opposite direction of every modern nation on the planet. being unique isn’t always such a good thing."

What a woman with so much hate in their heart so much evil she's attacking an elderly gentleman who has the right to speak his mind what kind of monster attacks pull old people what kind of horrible person can have this kind of hard to attack and spread her poison to all people who are protesting their rights of freedom and liberty what kind of evil lies in the heart of a woman like this who's so aggressively in humanely is attacking the elderly
"Why special abortion clinics? Why not just go to a regular clinic? An abortion clinic, of course will bring out the ignorant. Wonder if those protesters are going to pay to raise these unwanted children, education, health care, food, and any other needs they may have? Or I suppose they think the government and the tax payers will take care of those unlucky children born.  Get the protesters names and drop those anti abortion kids off on there door step! People need to mind there own business!!"
Men really should not have a voice or a say in a woman’s decision regarding her body.
"So she thought that the anti-abortion protestors, who are pro-life…as in preserve life…would place a bomb at an abortion clinic.. you have to be kidding me 😂"
Humans have achieved so much for the past 2000 years but yet we still believe in religion...
People that think God is OK with abortion are Biblically illiterate.

"The Catholic Church will not baptize a ""baby"" until it's born even though it doesn't believe an unbaptized baby will go to heaven.  I know because I'm Catholic and I've had this conversation with priests in the past and they agree that it's ""difficult"". The most dangerous time in a person's life is in the womb, as miscarriage is so common, and yet, even though the church believes life begins at conception it's willing to play Russian Roulette with a baby's soul until it's born. The Catholic faith is a convenient scapegoat for these people and their agendas. Most Catholics believe in abortion these days.These corrupt justices are the outliers who got a plum lifetime high-paying job by doing the GOP dirty work."
Hate is so ugly!!!
She should've kicked that Ladder.
Guss CNN can't  show the criminals trying to break into to capital of Arizona why not show real news
Id tell the anti-choice people if you are willing to sign a contract that I get paid $5000 a month for 30 years to not get an abortion then I will not. Would love to hear all the excuses why not.
Leaving puppies and kittens in a box on the side of the road is worse than an abortion.
They should be called anti choice protesters
I'm concerned about these clinics they better have tight security because there's a lot of crazy people out there who are just looking for trouble.
That girl should prolly be fired tbh ain’t the whole point your trying to deescalate and keep patients safe?
Are these jokers in the Supreme Court..... laughing this morning 😠???
"Oh, Dr. Tiller got aborted and no one like that huh?!"
Imagine referring to Aliens and talking about UFOs like they do! These guys have mental defects  and need healthcare but I am sure they can’t and never could afford it so they live a life of illness. People that refer to fantasy figures in the sky that they will meet when dead scare me! 🤯
People spouting God's views are indoctrinated…..leave folks aline…white males seeking to preserve the product of their sperm…
"Allah, who the Christians worship, has no love for a theocracy formed in violent force 😵 Relent, oh you violent oppressors, and save thine soul. For you are the devil's aide and the friend of tyrants"
Today we have shelly who's happy to be part of an industry that helps kill 700k+ healthy unborns a year.
"No man, no state, no religion has the right to tell a woman what to think, what to say, what to do."
"Those protesters should be protesting in front of their state buildings for support for these women. They may not be wanting to have the abortion, but there is no viable option. There need to be better laws and education, to help make abortions less of a necessity."
Threatening Supreme Court Justices with violence is all on the pro abortion crowd. That's perfectly fine with them
"This woman is amazing, interestingly, they could care less for the child once born"
"Hey Dan, how many children have you adopted out of the terrible government system. Well Dan, how many children have you taken care of cause none of us will survive when we get past ten billion people on earth."
"It is insane!!
Religious people should just keep their religion to themselves, WE do not want to be in your CULT (rebranded as Religion).
We do not push our beliefs or lack of beliefs onto you so WHY do you think it is ok  to DICTATE what that we should follow your cult's religious teachings?"
"God will look on those who oppressed women as he did the Nazis, as lost lambs who chose evil in the face of compassion. They will fall below the sinners-by-nature (the homosexuals, the nephalim, and the heathens) and will likely be saved by God's grace alone."
Anti abortion protesters don’t cause trouble.
"You had me at ""she was fed...""."
A biblical concordance is beyond the alleged christians. Abortion is found less than 10 times in a Bible.
"Thank you Shelley and Dr. Cathart, may you the other escorts and those who come to the clinic be safe and protected."
"They protect the womb, but they won't protect the class room. Ban private ownership of assault weapons."
Christian extremists are one step away from terrorism.
"Their ""Help"" is the contact info of the state organizations that the politicians They vote for want to get rid of."
"I love her. She can't keep silent. These self righteous, devout morons can't argue. They can only shout. They need to be shouted down."
Aborting a child is no light decision. NOBODY has the right to dictate such a personal decision. I don’t agree with crazy whack jobs harassing clinics and ppl for their decisions it’s absolutely insane. They all need to mind their own business. I’m so happy I’m not American living in such a messed up controlling racist country
What a woman does with her body is between her and God. You gotta be pretty self righteous to make it your business to tell someone you know best for them.
What the hell is this garbage this is not news this is clickbait
"Why do we have an exception for democrats when it comes to protests?  What happened to equal rights?  Dems think they are gonna run all over us, I have news for you, Republicans are powerful people who also have opinions.  Don't tread on us....you will only stir the whirlwinds!!!"
"What makes sense is that the federal government no longer dictates that states have to allow abortion, finally each state can decide the will of their people, period"
#vice
Ask these people how many kids they have adopted.
Seriously I would tell them to give money to these mom if they want the moms to keep fetus
It’s NONE of my business or these anti abortion folks business what a woman does with her body!!! These people are theocratic Nazis!
"3:55 CNN why don't you tell it as it is rather than half truths? BOTH sides have been known to have extremist tendencies not just the pro life camp. Pro choice have also gone as far as being violent and staging physical att@cks at Church premises too. It's only fair to be objective in your journalism, except you decide to exercise your choice to report otherwise but then, you don't get to give the world an impression that you are being fair, when in reality you seem to be the opposite. We see through the facade of both you and Fox News."
This is not about god so please stop putting god in this. In the bible not one time did god force anything on anyone. You always had a choice. This is about a person putting their beliefs on another person.
"If we plot morality on a graph it indicates imposition of will is immoral also moral progress and intuition suggest this , making abortion immoral but justified , pushing your child out of the way from an oncoming car is imposing on ther will making it immoral but again its justified to stop a more severe imposition of will likely being death , this is not my hypothesis but one iv heard changing my view of moral being wellbeing"
"Notice the left wants to convince you the anti abortion protesters are the crazy people. They're literaly saying ""don't kill babies."" How radical...."
hopes God favors him for protesting... pretty selfish reasons for trying to control people's bodies
"An image-bearer of God, you say? I seem to recall something in the Bible about graven images, what was that? 
I consider myself an agnostic with leanings towards atheism and a lot of my decisions and CHOICES come from having grown up in a Catholic church-going family that actually read the Bible and I would absolutely LOVE to debate this ignorant, hypocritical douche stain on the Bible because he obviously didn't even know the 10 commandments."
"They always shout ""We'll help you!"" But they never actually do. They look down on single mothers, talk behind their backs, and ignore them when they really need help. All they say is the ""The Lord will help you!"" The lord won't pay child support though"
She’s got guts.
Abortion is murder.
"Wonder how many of these anti-abortion protesters have ever shown up to protest a State-sponsored execution, written letters, or lobbied to abolish the institution of Death Row. Or are even troubled in the slightest to know that there exist people awaiting execution for whom exonerating evidence has not been deemed admissable, after-the-fact, in instances when they have been egregiously underserved by counsel, and in specific instances in which they have been framed or scapegoated. Not a single member of the five-strong Roe-breaking Supreme Court majority has ever ruled to give certioriari to a death row appeal. Amy Comey Bryant may be fervent in her faith, but the phrase she has heard thoisands upon thousands of times, ‘protecting life from concepton to natural death,’ means no more to her than to those cheering in the crowd at the Crucifixion."
"Im pro choice, Iv had an abortion myself but i would draw the line at 3rd trimester abortions. Unless it's a life or death situation for the mother, that's WAY too far along imo."
"Imagine if abortion was banned even of both have high probability of death?

Is it worth it for not to have it if one or both dead?

Dont say ""God wills it"" because why can't he made women lay eggs instead?"
She has to check for bombs from pro lifers…what
I am from Europe and have never seen in any country anyone protesting outside abortion clinics ever. Could it be the protesters are paid by the churches to behave in such a way? If not then social reform in the USA is the only way forward. The present situation has similarities to middle age Europe.
I bet not one of those people will commit to help these mom’s raise these babies for at least 18 years!
"Surgically remove all ""living"" fetuses out of unwanted mothers body (ALIVE), put IT in a jar on fluid and send them to the pro life people. They will feed it and let it become a wonderful human being."
"The man said, well I want 6 children, but his spouse said, I don't want 6 children? Mic'22"
"Americans were outraged when religious zealots took over Iran and Afghanistan and forced their religion on everybody....and particularly as they treated women like dirt.
And here we are in America with the same thing being brought in bit by bit....by the same sort of self-righteous and opinionated bullies."
IT'S SIN & CRIME FOR WHITE POLICEMAN BRUTALITY & WHITE POLICEMAN TO KILL BLACK YOUNG MEN & WOMAN FOR NO REASON IN AMERICA. MAKE TIK TOK VIDEO OF THAT🤔🤔🤔 HYPOCRITE
"They can broadcast they clients too, against violence, hate, in favor of love, peace and God bless us"
Religion kills more people every day than any clinic.
Ya that makes sense advocate life yet rake away lives?? These ppl are unhinged crazy mofos
"Let's not mince words, this woman is the modern version of Nightingale, any place with religious extremists like that who shoot a van or commit assault, and then get abetted by a judge, is no different than a warzone or a lawless zone. This woman is a hero."
So sick of these old white men and their stepford wives. May they have others work against their rights. Awful douches
America is a christo fascist state
"If society as a whole truly understood the supreme science of transmigration of the eternal soul, our troubles surrounding this issue would end. Supreme knowledge is the cure for ignorance."
All these pro life people should be REQUIRED to sign up to be a prospective adopter. Then they could REALLY HELP THE CHILDREN!!!!
I hope his uterus doesn't explode
The protester says we will help you. What does that mean? Prayer? How about financial support until the child is 18? That might work. Pretty easy to say we can help but without specifics it’s hollow.
She is impeding their first amendment rights.
Kmft  abortion kills
Good on anyone who doesn't support murder of innocent life 👍
It is a shame the church has weaponized their mentally ill members to push their evil onto others.
"Praise God for this man who has the guts to spend his time on the front lines of hell, turning these people away from murdering God's innocent creation that are made in his image."
"I remember how it felt when they were yelling at me when I went for my abortion. It made a horrible time worse for me.  However my escorts, were so amazing that I felt safe love and supported when I entered the clinic. I got my abortion and went home knowing that there were good people in the world and it wasn’t the anti-abortion people.  Those people will be judged by their maker and I do not think it will be good for them.  Shelly and the pro-choice people will be just fine and get their angel wings faster."
"-Wendell Phillips (1811 – 1884, Planet Earth)
“The white Puritan's idea of hell is a place where everybody has to mind their own business.”
“La idea del infierno de los puritanos blancos es un lugar donde todos tienen que ocuparse de sus propios asuntos”."
That abortion clinic looks filthy too
I want Dan to have the birth assimilation machine put on him.  Let's make sure we CHARGE full child support on the Protesters for 26 yrs.  Let's see if they protest after that🙄😒🙄
"Republicans:
Love the fetus, hate the child.
Once the child is birthed into the world they are forgotten and they move to save the next fetus."
"What if she get raped and get pregnant
What if her mom gets raped
What if her sister gets raped
What if her child gets raped 
What if her grandmother get raped pregnant"
Hey Ben!! Mind your own!!
"Sooo...who's gonna take care of the unwanted babies... I'm pro choice... I mind my business but to the anti abortionists, pro lifers you guys are forgetting the life part... life expectancy is pretty high and you're a mom forever..."
A bomb? They are pro life. How is this logical.
All these protesters but not one will help with adoption. They don’t want ppl to tell them to wear a mask but they want to dictate a woman’s right.
They need to mind their own business!  Stop worrying about what everyone else is doing & worry about yourself.  The guys retired & the best thing he does with his life is hound women?!
My bet is not one of those religious bigots don't have any adopted children...
"The time has come to remove tax exempt status from all churches, Federally.  If religious groups want to play politics, put them on defense fighting to remain financially viable."
The protestor said women should have the right to choose life. Women had that right already.
"wow, never seen anything like this in new york. you can just peacefully go get an abortion without any protesters."
Cowards who want to stop abortions but wont give up their names shouldnt be out protesting
"It's irksome seeing all these ( men ) and I use this term lightly. 
Wish the men would shut the f up ."
"I think it is sad that people won’t mind their own business. They won’t leave minorities alone, lgbtqia community alone the things that really require their attention they won’t bother to pay attention to like homelessness or people needing food that is what they should spend their time and money on if they are the true Christians they proclaim to be🤔😉"
"Are they ready to take care of these children especially if they won't be born normal, if they are terribly deformed then will they take care of those children"

Where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction, and having them under the management of Congress?

"“[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.”

"""Whatever help you need, we have!"" ""Choose life!"" 
Really?... Do you have guaranteed universal healthcare for the child up to becoming a teenager? No? Then you don't care about the child's life, you just want to feel better for acting all righteous. However, even if abortion was legal, there should be universal healthcare for all children. And mandatory maternity leave. And so much more... America is a 3rd world country when it comes to things like this!!!"
I truly don't understand why a person would wait until their 3rd trimester to have an abortion. I REALLY don't understand. 😪
i hope they are also going to support these kids financial and in every other way once they plop out
The Republican Party: Keeping women barefoot and pregnant since 1854.
"One guy says that the unborn children are being ""violated"" and ""having their lives taken away from them"".  Here's a guy who could be at a school mentoring, and he decides to stand around outside an abortion clinic and harrass women as they enter.  Does he ever stop to think how traumatic it is for the woman to even come to the decision to have an abortion?  My guess is probably not. He's so arrogant that he thinks the effect is more traumatic for him!"
The Republicans have now started adopting Taliban Laws.  Woman should have NO rights. Religion has killed how many for having the “wrong” or misguided beliefs?
Hard to believe that people are  still willing to hurt others or interfere with their personal lives because they think there is an imaginary all powerful being telling them to do it. Isn't this a symptom of schizophrenia? The old guy afraid to die thinking he didn't try to stop abortions sooner seems to have a hateful God that he's trying to brown nose. What stage of evolution do you call this? 21st Century Dark Age? Let's Make America Medieval Again?
"So much hypocrisy... 
Let me force you to bring forward a child you don't want. 
...so the 2. ammendment, i'm forcing upon you, can kill the child."
Justice Thomas is American hero and thank you Trump!
"Please please, mind your own business . Save the babies that are already here."
Notice how it's all mostly men who are protesting against a women's right to choose what she does with her body.
"They yell ""You have a choice to give life"".  That means that women have a choice, right?"
These escorters deserve medals.
This is what mental illness looks like .. going out to protest what another person chooses to do with their body.
Your killing the most innocent and defenseless amongst us... Realize they *RIP APART*  the baby limb by limb..
"first they rip off the legs one at a time, then the arms, then the stomach then the hardest part they rip off the head. it’s a slow painful death. not your body!"
"Jeremiah 1:5
""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you.
 Before I set you apart I consecrated you"". ❤️🙏

Angry young people demanding the right to kill a child they carelessly created during a night of recklessness.
If they only knew the years of tears, pain & regrets a person goes through later in life when they realize the beautiful light of life they killed because they were too selfish to open their lives to another human being."
If we are a pro-life country why do we have so many wars?
"Well it's funny that everybody who advocates for abortion has already been born, they now regard good as  evil and view evil as good."
RELIOUS FOLKS are dangerous.
"I hope this apparent female isn't breeding.  So, that is a plus for abortion."
Killing unbornchildren is indefensible. Protesting abortion is the right thing to do.
I am so sick and tired of these fake 'christians'. Remember even with this ruling rich white women will still have access to safe abortions.
Sad to see what happens to the small school bus people when they get old.

It is always about their God.  Who didn't care at all until Evangelical USA decided that it did. God in THEIR image.
Why can't men just STFU 🤬.....if you don't have a uterus just stop
I think you should be allowed to abort a child up until the age of 25 👍
We'll just end up seeing more babies left in dumpsters and trash. Don't forget the women who will try to abort on their own.
Susan Collins is one of the most horrible politicians in the Senate because she pretends to be something she is not! Her votes will lead to horrible situations for many Americans!
My  mother in law came from a family of 11. Last one killed her mother. Read the book orphan train.
"Let us just acknowledge the reality in this debate.
Essentially, men have a deep seated hatred of women, and seek to constrain their autonomy and life choices.
The fewer women who align with the anti-abortion movement, have no sense of feminism and choose to accept the male construct of human relationships.
They collaborate with patriarchal ideology, in order to gain the approval of male ideology, and protection from its worst aspects.
Think the trustees, in outlying prisons, the collaborators with the Nazis in WW 2.
That is what they are.
Colonised women, who choose subjugation over principle and loyalty to the sisterhood of women.
I rarely quote Germaine Greer, because I feel she has become irrational in recent years, but, she warned us in the 1970s, that women are actually unaware how much men despise women, and seek to contain them.
She warned us.
Now it had come to pass."
Shelley is doing God's work.
"Unborn children makes as much sense as a married bachelor, a joyful depression or a wet drought."
"you anti abortion activist would have mire converts if you also fought for Healthcare for mothers and their children and fought for gun reform, so our children and family would not be killed"
"A young woman had a late term abortion in Cleveland. The abortionist didn't remove all the parts of the baby that he murdered, and the child's parts were left in the womb. She got infected, and later died from her infection. Don't let these people fool you, abortion is sick, and it stops a beating heart. The health department has shut down so many abortion clinics because they are so unclean. Abortion is murder, and most women regret having their child killed."
"I am 100% pro-choice all the way but I don't like the idea of third trimester abortions (unless it's unviable or unsafe for the mother). Unlike these people, I understand it's not my choice and not my business, especially as a man."
Pro choice is pro life! Second amendment is killing more than women having the right to choose
"Gotta love the self righteous telling the righteous there being self Righteous! Just then she says ""I don't think most people have a realistic picture of what happens outside of abortion clinics""
Perhaps thats partially true but they do know what happens inside of abortion clinics!  You gotta love the irony of a person who isn't dead speaking out for the ""Right"" to kill the innocent....
The Hypocrisy is mind numbing."
So sad. Stop making this choice so hard on the woman. Woman don't do this every day.  These people won't help these babys when they are born.
Fundamentalists going rampant in the u.s. - how far can you fall?
"......""?......""?"
These idiots ain't just against abortion. My mum works as a councilor who specialises in helping people who are LGBT. She's had to hire security escorts for her patients as nasty religious people have set up in front of her practise to yell homophobic slurs. It's so bad now she's had go create a banner saying please ignore the angry old people out front. Everyone needs to keep their opinions to themselves.
Thank you republicans for saving fetuses and killing children
She deserves so much more credit than she is getting! Thank you for helping our women
"both sides are nuts! I am sick of these people fighting each other. Killing a child is a terrible thing but at the same time there are cases that it is necessary for this procedure. However, women should be allowed to make this decision with their doctors, not by crazy people wearing black robes. There has to be a responsible way to reach an acceptable path forward. Single mother's need more assistance if they are poor because the same states that want to be the saviors of children have the worse policies to support poor families. And let's just say it, having abortions because people cannot be responsible is not a good way forward. Children's lives should be precious to all of us. Therefore, both sides are nuts and I hate them both!"
What is the difference between far right and isis? ........
The 2016 election was one of the most consequential in history.  James Comey announcing an investigation days before the election was a big deal.  You can thank Anthony Weiner for this being overturned.
What's even scarier are those that believe in the religion of government.
This decision made me remember watching If These Walls could Talk with Demi Moore. Scary.
GARBAGE
She looks line a tootsie Roll 😂😂😂😂
Why would someone jeopardise the patients by seeding bombs if they're trying to save the lives of unborn children?
"https://youtu.be/KRb3HDA2DyE Kendrick Lamar  - "" God Speed for woman's rights, They Judge YOU, They Judged Jesus Christ"""
I understand and do appreciate the people there peacefully outside giving their time to stand up for something they believe but doing it in a way that is not harming the patient coming in. It's nice to see prayers but at the same time people are going to do what they're going to do and they have their own reasons to live in a country where we should be able to make those choices ourselves
"(TV series).
A show trial is a public trial in which the judicial authorities have already determined the guilt or innocence of the defendant. The actual trial has as its only goal the presentation of both the accusation and the verdict to the public so they will serve as both an impressive example and a warning to other would-be dissidents or transgressor"
We in Japan cannot believe there are people who care whether  the others have thier baby or abotion.
birthing persons are women too? 🥸
A bunch of old white men that want to control womans bodies.
How the fuck did these ppl get there way its so unbelievable that the usa is some how been taken over by modern day puritans Christian fascists the minority these anal warts of humans cried all though out the pandemic my body my choice who cares if you die then the first chance they take away women's right  .L et me say this i live in Washington state me and my wife will help any women get a abortion and im not the only one this cancer on America will be removed they have lit a fire they cant control we will be taking our country back
These anti-rights Xtian activists are disgusting humans. Proverbs 16:27 describes them as wicked and ungodly.
These old people need a body to be reborn into so they see their time ending and they don’t have one to put their dirty soul in 😂😅 -life right lol just joking but what the fuck
"If a pregnant woman is killed and the fetus or baby was viable at the time, the killer is charged with double murder.  Why is it that a pregnant woman can have a viable fetus or baby sucked out of them, limb by limb, at any trimester?  I understand that SOME pregnancies' should be terminated but those rare pregnancies such as from rape or incest should be terminated as soon as the ""mother"" discoverers that she is pregnant and is carrying an embryo.  Not months later when she changes her mind and is now carrying a child."
These women who work here are amazing!  💙💙💙
"Look how peacefully and non-disruptive those protestors are and then compare that with the climate change cultists and the BLM and Antifa crowd causing actual physical harm and property damage.
I know who I would prefer protesting in my neighbourhood."
So the pro-lifers are okay with killing people but they are against abortion?
They are pro life but they'll be the first ones to bomb an abortion clinic.
The protestors remind me of zombies!
"all these people who protest abortion seem to have no problem eating the meat of animals that are slaughtered young.  over 30 BILLION young animals are slaughtered for food every year.  God said "" thou shall not kill""- and that means ANYTHING- but they eat all the meat they want to eat.  hypocrites."
"Keep religion out of this.  Religion is what got us into this mess.  
If you look at this argument objectively, without your “god” goggles, you will see abortion should up to the woman. 
That is if you are for freedom and liberty."
I will not even acknowledge pro choice people or conversations until the atone for the hundreds and/or thousands of First Nation children killed at “Christian based boarding schools”.
"These religous nutjobs do look and behave just like religious nutjobs! Ignorant bliss among them. Love the wondeful way they are dealt with. Impossible not to laugh at them,though dangerous as they are. This shows how religion does a number on your sanity!!"
"They must really admire Schwarzenegger who was adamant to give birth to Junior.

When it is men's time to go through pregnancy, it is men's time to decide whether it should be legal."

"Dude, God loves you in spite of your works. You don’t have to do anything to earn or receive God’s love."
"I think everyone who protests against these women, need to sign up for adopting an unwanted baby, rather than being detached and judgmental against other humans. 

Their judgements against others where they don’t know anything about their situation, will actually be what is “judged” when they “meet their maker”."
I love you so very much. ♥️

"People who were given the bless of life by their mothers, now they are against giving life to others innocents babies, because for them it represents a big business.

It happens when a society reaches a deeper bottom of sin and evilness.. And this society will be judged by God🥲.."
"These anti-abortion people are the American version of the Taliban.  Same thing.

Not a peep form these people when a school shooting happens
"Lol, leftist is tired of protestors, how ironic."
For all those against abortion I believe we sign you up for the adoption of the unwanted child. I bet you don't care after the birth how about putting your nose in your own business.
"When I lived in Portland Oregon there was one guy that rode a bike around town yelling, with as many signs hung on it as possible. He had lots to say.

It's insane that you have abortion clinics instead of doing abortions in hospitals. The clinics become easy targets for the anti-abortion protesters and also makes it unsafe for both the pregnant woman and doctors who work there. If they were performed in hospitals the protesters wouldn't know who's going in there for an abortion.

She is amazing.
In india the communal powers are destroyed the democracy through Hijacking the elected representatives please protect the democracy in india
"Abortion is a woman's choice in the majority of the world. America is a backward country.
Abortion is NOT mentioned in the Bible or the Koran so why do American Christians think it is?
The US constitution has been amended 27 times and is why each part are called amendments.
WE LIVE IN A GENERATION WHERE TEASING AND LAUGHING AT AMERICANS IS NORMAL."
In india day by day fear of gujarat type communal clashes democracy in danger peoples are feared UNO intervention is necessary please protect the secularism in india and FBI investigation is necessary

Some angels wear rainbow vest
"Think their god showed mercy to the firstborn sons of Egypt, or the fetuses he killed in the womb? How about the countless women he made barren? Genocide is okay? Just an FYI, their religion condones abortions, it was standard procedure before stoning the woman accused of adultery or getting pregnant out of wedlock. 12 year old Mary would have suffered the same fate if 90 year old Joseph hadn't claimed to have impregnated her. Yeah, paedophiles are okay by god too, like that ""take the virgin girls for sex slaves"" rule when murdering and pillaging villages. So is incest, like the time Lot got his daughters pregnant when they got him drunk and seduced him. Seriously Christians, read your bible, it's disgusting."
GOD BLESS The Conservative Supreme Court Justices for overturning The unconstitutional Roe v. Wade and saving unborn infants.
"They won't ""help"" any of these women seeking medical care. They'll maybe take her to church and try to extort money out of her while chanting bizarre, inscrutable scripture.  The only ""help"" they're willing to offer is the ""salvation"" of your ""soul"" using voodoo techniques, brainwashing and bullshit.  You're still stuck with a kid you can't support on your own.  They won't help with that."
"Face it, penises have more rights than vaginas! Why isn’t the SCOTUS castrating pedophiles and rapists?!"
"God this, God that, blah blah blah. What happened to NOT forcing your Religion or Beliefs on others? Nice bit of Hypocrisy."
I wonder if these same GOP will have the same faux rage to pray in front of the NRA or the federalist society headquarters.  Will these same protesters clutch their candles for the children lost due to guns and poverty
They are all men they will never have to make the decision
"Still nothing about the insurrection in Arizona Capitol this weekend??? I'll keep looking, because I know how important CNN feels about insurrections."
Do you perform the satanic ritual before or after the abortion?
Both sides are self righteous on abortion. SCOTUS made the right decision to allow each state to figure it out.
"No one, absolutely no one has the right to tell me what to do with my body. A trained, licensed professional can give me advice or there best possible advice for my situation but it is my body, my choice, period."

No person is above the law!  Listen to former DOJ Eric Holder, you can and need to prosecute Trump.

since January 6 2021 not one single Republican lawmaker has been held accountable for their insurrection actions.  they will win re-election if not arrested and they will cause more chaos and mass shootings.  Put an end to the evil Trumpist Republicans and support the good Republicans and good democrats.

MAGA Trumpists are ramping up their war machine to lie about their insurrection!  Dont believe the lies!

We need to support a federal law mandating prison time for each lie told by an elected official.

More Very Disturbing Trends -

1 Law enforcement has NO OBLIGATION TO  HELP ANYONE...that is what their Union will fight for during investigations and trials.

2 Law enforcement cant be prosecuted for Not doing their jobs

3 Law enforcement can legally lie unless they are under oath at that moment

4 The District Attorney will side with the cops almost always

5 Law enforcement has qualified immunity, which makes it very difficult to prosecute them


Texas Shooting Coverup .....over 18 armed evil trumpist c o p s had over 11,000 live rounds of ammo and they waited.  and waited.....while people were being killed.  it took the border patrol to take out the shooter.... how sad is that?


nothing will happen to these evil trumpist people unless the locals keep up the pressure and the cops and politicians involved leave!

"Of coarse you show the worst pro life people.  CNN just can't help but be bias.  You always create that narrative that goes along with left wing talking points.  You are just shamelessly bias.  Hunter Bidens lap top is Russian disinformation much.  This piece is just more of what you do best, public relations for the Democrat party.  So much deception, so many lies, so many false narratives.  I've seen a couple of good pieces recently.  I was getting encouraged.  This piece reminds me of who you are, shameles partisan hacks and flat out liars.  It's okay, I get my real news elsewhere.  How are those ratings by the way?"
Fake News
These are men who are anti abortion. How would they know the feelings of women who needs abortion? Men are parts and partial in pregnancy and they should know why a fetus needs to be aborted.

Even Joe Roe didn't want fed abortions in the end. From her own mouth.
What is white life? 🤔
