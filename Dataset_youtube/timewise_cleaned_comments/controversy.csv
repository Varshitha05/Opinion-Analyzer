"‚ÄúPro-Life‚Äù 
Funny that states with the harshest abortion policies also have bar-none the WORST social support networks set up."
So disgusting the anti intellectual puritan streak in the states
The majority of Texan voted for him. Now they are stuck with him. Vote him out ladies.
People of Texas can only blame themselves for choosing the wrong candidate. Hopefully when it's time for election they will not forget all these things and pick the right & qualified candidate.
"she can leave Texas to get an abortion and spare us the histrionics. 
If she were really in desperate circumstances she would have not wasted any time on lawyers and court proceedings. 
She's doing this for the drama. 

It's not unusual for people truly in need of life-saving medical care to cross state lines to get it. Sometimes the facility best  equipped to meet your needs is in another state"
"I have not seen anyone who has a true understanding of what the Texas Abortion Kate Cox case is really about.  

What we need to understand is, this is NOT about protecting unborn life aside from religion.  It has EVERYTHING to do with religion. The belief in God's Will is very strong in the new Republican party.  The belief that we must accept God's Will is absolute for them.  We are not supposed question God's decisions and we won't always understand his ""plan.""  

If you grew up in a Baptist household like I did, you understand this, but this dogma is never spoken aloud in the political realm. You can accept medical help to save the baby's life or the mother's life, but line is - you have to understand, what is God's Will, because only God can decide who lives and who dies.  There is no reasonable way for these extremist Republicans to answer this question in a legal or science-based sense. Therefore, Republicans will continue struggle with this issue and look like sadists to the rest of us.  We need to bring this to the forefront as their weakness.  

My grandfather was a famous Southern Baptist preacher from Texas, so understanding this deeply held belief is important.  It is the evangelist's mantra that we cannot understand God's plan, so we have to accept whatever happens as part of HIS plan and still accept what he does as somehow a good thing.  

We need to make them admit that this is a religious issue not based on science.  They are making the argument based on emotion and pseudoscience, but it is not really the basis for their desire to control a woman‚Äôs body.  It is all about God‚Äôs Will and HIS Plan and that is impossible to define because we can never hope to understand God‚Äôs Plan.

I wish someone would talk about this.  Thanks."
"For God's sake. Wake up, America!"
"so true. second class citizenship like in the middle east where women can‚Äôt decide their own fate, can‚Äôt even drive."
And that goes for their own women...
"Pro-Life.
Pro-Gun.
Pro-Capital Punishment.
Pro-Lethal Border Barriers.
Pro-War.
Anti-vaccine.
Anti-Healthcare.
Anti-Welfare.
Anti-Environmental Regulation.

Did I mention Pro-Life?"
"Just as the bible commands.
Christianity is a wretched thing."
"2nd class citizens imply they still treat women as human beings on some level. But this isn't the case, Republicans only treat women as their livestock and slaves."
to bad we can't kick Texas out of the Union...
"The problem with abortions in Texas is the fact you can sue the doctor over it. If I were to perform an abortion and considered it medically necessary for the mother to live, and she comes out fine, anyone could still legally sue me. In a court, I could still lose my medical license because she did fine, and the jury didn't think her life was at risk at the time of the abortion. Therefore, no doctor is willing to perform an abortion for *any* reason."
Texas certainly has doubled down to make war on women.  Women still die of pregnancy complications or childbirth.
"This is second class citizenship for women.

GOP response - and?"
"Next state referendum in Texas: Changing the name of the state to ""Gilead"""
"Separation of church and state is still a thing, except when you're female, happen to be pregnant but in need of an abortion, and living in the state of Texas. Paxton is not a medical doctor, so why does he feel the need to enforce these disgusting laws besides showing religious muscle?! This is a blaintant violarion of human rights."
2:57-3:07!!! Nuff said not to mention there‚Äôs not 1 law that has courts deciding what a man can do to his body
I am glad I live in California. She and her family need to leave Texas.  I hope all works out for her. Prayer be with her and her family.
"Get your hajabs and berkas out ladies.  If they get their way, you will be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen of the master of the house."
"‚ù§In the seventies the saying was "" you have come a long way baby"". Now the saying is"" we own your body and we will track you down if you try to leave the state or buy birth control. That is a giant step back. But I am a guy so if they are not united to vote out those want them to be a second class citizen. Then I say too bad. Maybe they will want them to cover up like Muslim women in the next election. Women, grow a pair if you want to be like us. Texas is still red with Abbott,  Paxton and trump with a lead in 2024."
Reminder: the Equal Rights Amendment has never been ratified.
I wonder how long until the ‚ÄòTEXAS  Misogynists‚Äô decide to PUNISH women who seek medical care outside the state?   OR who suffer a Spontaneous Abortion ( miscarriage) ‚Ä¶.will women in this case have to PROOVE that they did nothing to contribute to that spontaneous abortion. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
Women in America are Absolutely 2nd class Citizens in the eyes of Republicans. Are you still calling yourselves the land of the free?
lol Texas. Who do these white texas men think they are? Joe Rogan
VOTE!
"Too many men just don‚Äôt get the facts about pregnancy and all the related issues. Their black or white thinking is a killer, or at the least-cruelty to the max. Shame on them."
Its about control and forcing their religious beliefs onto everyone.  These are the worst types of people.
The US republicans with their extreme religious beliefs dragging down the country to the level of barbarism. A banana republic.
"This is what happens, when politicians think that they understand the Divine will better than the G-d himself. Texas currently has stricter anti-abortion legislation than Saudi Arabia."
This is what makes America great again. Bunch of B. S. Get these men out of power
"She had some cramping and some leakage; that indicates the body is about to naturally flush out an unviable baby. which happens in animals, too; if a baby animal is unviable, it will either b stillborn, or the uterus will detect the abnormality and will just expel it."
From the advice of ‚ÄúDr Paxton‚Äù the guy that looks like he burned out last century.
who cares red team is winning soon u all will be slaves including me so cry some more it is the stupid dnc got to get messaging and the stupid dems senators and house folks
That guy's proven to be a corrupt attorney and where is Lee Harvey Oswald when you need him
Welcome to the New United Dictatorship of America!
What about vasectomies are they going to ban those too? After all there's lots of half a baby in there.
It should be a no-brainer that these women NEED to get this care. Mind-blowing how a bunch of old crusty men can decide what a woman can and cannot do with their own body!?
Third class actually. 1. White men. 2. Fetuses. 3. Females
"Anything that don't affect their lives personally, they don't care about! Racism, don't care it don't affect them, school shootings, don't care, it don't affect them, (R) don't care, it don't affect them! This issue don't care, it don't affect them! I'm wondering if the Wife or daughter got (R) by a Black or Brown Man, what would they do then!"
Time to vote the trash out ladies!!! Our bodies do NOT belong to the government and these men who want to push us back in the house!!!
"""Pro life"" Repulicans are some of the biggest hypocrites on Earth my god."
This whole thing is Agenda 21. Go read it. It explains everything. The author is glen beck.
Isn‚Äôt this practicing medicine without a license?  Why are legislators able to make health care decisions?
Has ken Paxton's female family members have to deal with these problems?
"She should be allowed to have  her abortion. It amazes me that we are going through this fight again. Women have to vote out these men and women who want to control other peoples lives. This is trump‚Äôs reality and his cronies in congress. The Supreme Court. People will say trump is for abortion, he lies through his teeth. He will say anything to get what he wants. VOTE BLUE so we can move forward not backwards!"
Why would any woman want to live in Texas?  I‚Äôm genuinely asking.
"The only way you can change this is to vote, or actively run for office yourself."
"They are not the party of pro-life. They are the party of pro-birth, pro-death, and anti-women."
"You women need to rise up and put your political power to work .How dare some old dude mandate your body,that should be between doctor and patient , not up for debate rise up vote blue,, and to Ken if your are so concerned about unwanted pregnancy ,how bout we denut ,irresponsible men,HOW BOW DA ,Ken?"
I'm a republican I hope she sees the heck out of Texas and and all the Republicans all the Republican I'm voting down the line Democrat I will never vote Republican
"Medical professionals should refuse services to all Republicans, no exceptions."
"This is crazy.  If we didn't  have the SCOTUS  overturn ROE, all this madness and suffering would never happen.  Then we have one lunatic,  politician compound  this misery. Why does the public allow this to happen. Paxton should be arrested  and put in jail.  And the taxpyers are paying for this circus."
Oh yeah there Attorney General is corrupt   HE should be in prison.
"WE the MAJORITY are going to show the Repulsive gop they have once again underestimated FEMALE and YOUNGER VOTERS. WE will be VOTING OUT all gop ""leaders"". WE will Prevail once againüíô"
That  woman needs to move to a state where she can get an abortion everyone should be leaving Texas that's  because Texas is the worst state in this union I believe we should let them become their own country take away all their federal funding and let the Mexicans and the cartels take back Texas   Had enough of Texas. Take all their federal funding away and I bet Texas will change their minds.
Just use birth control and quit killing babies.
"I wonder how many times Paxton may have overheard his parents wishing they had aborted him when he was a little boy, that may be why he turned out so full of anger toward women!!"
"I keep saying, PEOPLE BETTER STOP WORRYING ABOUT BIDEN'S AGE,!! VOTE EVERY ""BAD"" REPUBLICAN THAT SUPPORT TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE. VOTE BIDEN BACK IN OFFICE AND ALL THE RADICAL REPUBLICANS OUT. To be clear , I don't believe all the Republicans are bad."
Bless this woman for being so strong against these tyrant leaders!
Typical republicans passing a law with no room to move‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a blank document‚Ä¶.I wish republicans were not illiterate
"Only in the MAGA America. Vote the Republicans out. What a miscarriage of justice. About controlling women, not about the fetus."
Paxton should be jailed for preasureing women to die.
"_ women are indeed 2nd class citizens in republican eyes - very much 2nd class citizens, TO US CITIZENS specially US women: ENJOY BEING 2ND CLASS CITIZENS and the threesomes that you are religiously allowed to participate in BUT DON'T YOU DARE GET PREGNANT DOING THOSE THREESOME(S) .. ...."
misogyny is the gift of the devil
Abortion should be based on the right to self defense. Carrying a child to full term is the most dangerous endeavor most women will ever take on. Up to the point the abortion becomes more dangerous than completing the process to a live birth it should be the mother's decision. Why is this any different than a stand your ground law that allows up to lethal force to defend ones self and family?
I'm just glad at this point Texas can't be allowed to bring back segregation OR Slavery. Trying to violate women's rights to get medical care for lifesaving for political political just crazy.
He has to go vote this attorney general out along with this texas supreme court
"It's not safe to be pregnant in Texas, plain and simple.  Ladies, it's time to get out of Texas."
Texas to protect TheSanctity of Life even if it Kills every women in the state.‚ÄºÔ∏è. AG Paxton..
God bless you all
What life do these people think they are saving. This baby will only live hours if that
The second come of Jesus will be a caucasian baby and that the reason the far right want to stop all abortion of caucasian baby.
"Texas is full of idiots that claim they want to hang all them bad boys from a tall oak tree, but so far all I've seen them do is elect them to government office, It sure seems like Texans don't want women to be equal citizens but just want them to be breeding slaves. I'm thinking maybe they should wake up before they get woke up."
"Wake up, americans ,this could be your daughters,granddaughters.  It's horrifying to think because of a bunch of crazies. This could be anyone now... I fear for  all who could lose loved ones."
Ken Paxton should be in prison for fraud and tax evasion with his criminal buddy trump and Gregg Abbott.
Women of Texas VOTE THOSE B***TAR** out !! You are not second class citizens nor are your daughters your sisters your mothers your nieces !!! Please get out to vote at the next elections in your state?
Ken Paxton should not be in office. He threw out 2 million plus ballots to help the GOP hold on to office.  Beto won.
Welcome to the Texas Theocracy where you cant get stoned but can be stoned to death. Sounds like the Faux Xristian version of Iran here in the Southern US.
Republicans hate women and want to turn us into Chattel!
US Americans! Aren‚Äôt there more important issues in the world? Stop controlling women!! Just let them live and move on
"I wonder if those people know how evil it is to drive a wedge between men and women. In fact, men have loved and cared for women throughout human history."
PAXTON THINKS HE HAS THE RIGHT TO SIT IN MOSES' SEAT AND IMPOSE THE LAW !
"Republicans are making women a second class citizen . This is bigger than Abortion  , control over own bodies. Disgusting üá∫üá∏üëç"
All I can say is you elected Trump and put the Republicans in power who are deciding if you should receive Healthcare at all . I would vote Democrat from now on to ensure you have a right to receive Healthcare. By the way wasn't that piece of feiyu Trump bragging about overturning Roe versus Wade? You elected him so you have no one to blame but yourself.
Its a power trip. Thats the Republican party.
Texas was the last state to accept WOMEN as full citizens and not chatel of a man .
"Amazing, the country is watching Texas turn into the country's version the Taliban's Afghanistan every day.  How long before Abbott and his gang of Christian zealots require women to full comply with his version of Biblical, or should I say Sharia, law?"
That man right there is a indicted criminal.  And he's making decisions on a woman's body.  Yikes!!
This sickening decision puts the state of Texas on par with the Afghan Taliban regime. A Middle-ages dictatorship.
He belongs in JAIL!
"""women's voice are their votes"" - well the GOP knows that, so the next thing they'll do is start taking away women's votes."
This should put fear in every single person in America
"It's more than 2nd class citizenship. It's repression and domination.
Why aren't we looking at the $$$ spent on Viagara by the military every year?"
"If republicans get  the presidency, this will be federal law. That's our future ;/"
Texas is a shitshow
Let Paxton be the c*nt that he is. The GOP will lose BIGLY in 2024 after this
This is sick. Women can‚Äôt even make decisions to save their own lives. To save their fertility. All because a dead or dying fetus has more rights than women. All because these sick men want to punish women. Disgusting.
"I don't know why Mika thinks this is ""unbelievable"" since this is what the TX lawmakers wanted from the beginning. DUHHHH"
"Republicans are not pro-life, they are pro-control over people they don‚Äôt believe are full participants of this American democracy."
@1:30 I know that attorney get threats Attorney for Reproductive Rights? Oh God üòÆ
Ken Paxton look like an ex -serial killer just look at the face üòÇ .. got that Michael Myers look going on
These Texans are cat üí© crazy
"After I heard, years ago, Trump¬¥s audio about how he can grab young woman by the pu$$y whenever he wants, I was very sure that there is no women in the world who would vote that man. 
How wrong I was.
After Roe and all the political ploys to reduce women's rights, I still wonder how in the world there are women so stupid that they can vote for any republican EVER! But yes, they still support the GOP. Despite the fact that it puts all menstruating girls and women in danger.
Grazy!"
It‚Äôs a good thing that she went out of state and got the health care she needed
We are voting. They aren't listening no matter how many times we use it. Time to take this in another direction.
Politicians and lawyers are trying to scare women and doctors. Perhaps we should start scaring lawyers and politicians now.
"In this situation, if the baby survives the birth, the baby will suffer for the extremely minimal time the baby would be alive and would then die a painful death.  How can these law makers say they care about babies and demand the suffering of the mother AND THE CHILD?  This is not Godly.  This is mandated cruelty. In other words... evil."
So because shes a texan she doesn't want to flee to get the necessary healthcare so you want to take necessary risk god forbid if something hapens to you because of a radical and ignorant person have u thouht about your husband and chidren do you want to be martyr well good luck because they don't care
How could u want to be a texan if u want to fight vote these people out
Paxton is a vile corrupt snake and his wife backing him must hate women
If this doesn't help flip Texas I don't know what else will just sad
"So a man who can never know the pain of carrying and delivering a child under normal circumstances thinks he's the best person to make this kind of decision? Ken Paxton can threaten legal action against this family, her doctors or anyone who is qualified to make the best decision under this awful heart breaking situation? Will Ken Paxton be charged with legal action if any of the horrible outcomes happen to this mom and her family? What about this families pain and suffering?"
"If it's ""2nd class citizenship for women"" how come so many women are anti-abortion? Seems to me it's mainly women who protest against abortion - indeed it's well known that  it's those evil men who are always wanting their wives/girlfriends/mistresses to HAVE abortions. But I guess it's just another sign of the pure evil that men are that they simultaneously want women to have abortions but also want to prevent them from having them.

Exactly how dumb can feminists be?

And btw ladies, having to obey a law you don't like doesn't make you ""2nd class citizens"". Stop talking tripe."
Christianity has never treated women equally.
Maybe That Judge Doesn't Know the difference between Hypocrisy & Hypocratic Oath ~ Do No Harm
I WONDER WHERE PAXTON GOT HIS MEDICAL DEGREE?
"Remember the results of the one child law in China? No girls were born. Shortage of women. Chinese men are literally kidnapping foreign brides! 
Women's health care controlled by the government, or men?

Get ready for limited benefits, population decline, increase in human trafficking,  and women moving out of TEXAS!"
Republicans finally got their death panels.
"All women in Texas and across America need to vote Democrat. Otherwise you‚Äôre going to have an old Republican politician in your bedroom telling you what you can and cannot do with your own body!  It‚Äôs always the republicans who are taking your rights away, not the democrats!  Vote blue, and show these big government zealots who is really in charge!üëø"
Bigger than any genocide in history
"Handmaid‚Äôs Tale, here we come‚Ä¶"
"Welcom to Gilead ladies!
No self-respecting woman should vote republican!"
"Enough of these people. They are using adolf hitler handbook to a tee. Hitler told German women it was their duty as women to have babies and expand the German population. Hitler then had these houses set up in all the cities where young German women did nothing but fornicate all day. German soldiers were told it was their job to go to these houses to increase the population of the Aryan people. How ironic that he wanted this ""master race"" and he didn't fit into it. These women would get pregnant, go to hospital to deliver baby and back to work. She had no further contact with the child. There were hundreds of babies like this. Baby factories. The babies were raised by older women who were not allowed to give affection or love or human contact. These little babies actually held on to each other for comfort in cramped cribs, cold rooms and groomed to be Aryan! Human baby robots. Disgraceful and inhumane!"
Ever since they took RoeVWade away i knew this and many more cases would happen.we as women need to fight and fight HARD for our daughters...granddaughters...for women period! We need to bring back RoeVWade now! I live in the idiotic red state of Ohio...i worry about my daughter's...i cannot believe this is happening in 2023! We are going backwards...every women in this country needs to stand up and fight for our rights!
The blood is on the hands of Texas voters
"Mika, thank you for your impassioned presentations and reporting! Also, your dress is lovely!"
MEN HAVE NO BUSINESS TELLING A WOMAN HOW TO TAKE CARE OR OWN HER BODY!!‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
"Republicans would have no problem if the husband or a family member brought a lawsuit against the doctor and /or the hospital if the mother died of complications due to this inhumane law. The party of ""the right to life"". Yeah, right"
"What is it that a doctor's oath to ""do no harm"" not trump all of this political BS? Pun intended.üò¢"
Wheres all the women in Texas?!! They are okay with these maga cult people?!!! Omg!!
Texas is disgusting with Banana Republicans in charge. Vote BLUE!!!
"Magas don't care about women, it's about dominance and control."
Time to get out of TexASS.
AG is practicing medicine without a license. Isn't that a crime? State if not Federal?
It is way past second class treatment it's moved into turning women into Chattel
Don't we have more important legal issues to attend to other than killing woman by denying medical needs
Unbelievable!!!!  What century are we in???! Seriously!!
"REmember the Alamo? it was about Texas and  it's ""glorious' ""heroic' founders wanting to keep  owning  SLAVES. NOW 180 years later they're willing to settle for ""just the women""  as the underclass."
"You all remember when Obama was trying to pass ACA? The republicans had ads that said ACA would lead to ""death"" panels. Well guess who has death panels?? Fox Entertainment and all those other conservative, so called news outlets, are feeding their viewers a bunch of propaganda or not reporting on issues that directly affect their constituents. I did just read that this family ended up leaving the state to get an abortion. How much you want to make a bet, she and her husband are going to get arrested when they get back to Texas? This country is turning into a dictatorship, and I know we hear, vote, vote, vote but even when we do vote, republicans lie and cheat. Look what happened in Ohio voted to make abortion legal and the republicans are refusing to accept the vote of the people. Voting isn't working when republicans go rogue."
Taliban Texas.
2nd class? No! They have been prohibited from their right to  citizenship. The 16th Amendment needs to be brought in to protect women
"The party of freedom and DONT TREAD ON ME - THE GUBMINT should stay out of parenting - WANTS TO FORCE PEOPLE TO HAVE KIDS. they dont CO PARENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT they scream.... Its all hypocrisy and lies. JUDGES IN WOMENS UTERUS' = FREEDOM IN TEXAS

This is what evil looks like.
"It's a difficult one, but you cannot continue pretending that her current pregnancy is a thing or tissue and not a human life, stop pretending that ""thing"" is nothing that can be aborted like a butcher aborts a Cow."
She should just go to Canada and get the abortion
"When are we going to wake up and stop the, Bible-thumping mouth-breathers from shoving us back 500 years?!"
Only your fleas will morn you Ken Mr Mcbitchums Paxton.
and Republicans wonder why they keep losing?
Women should stop getting pregnant period. Or get out of Texas
Its all about controlling women by spiteful men.  Vote Blue
"When you fail to vote, or vote further away from your road then accept what can be called God's punishment for not doing your duty. This abortion issue could've been avoided, but here we are."
Flush twice. It's a long way to Texas.
I don't care what the Bible or the Quran have to say about healthcare. A bunch of ancient sandpeople in the Middle East who only lived until the age of 35. I don't give a crap what they have to say about 21st century healthcare.
This is why its unequal and a harship. This is the main reason an unbiased SC would rule for abortion
"If you can't vote these monsters out of office in Texas, then vote with your feet. Move! And don't stop until you reach a state that protects freedoms, instead of taking them away. That goes for voting rights, as well."
No no no you said possible but also possible the baby and her will be fine. Might might might bet the Baby would like a choice to.
Only if you think killing babies is legal without a good reason as her doctor recommended..
We should Demand Men to get Vasectomy

"I‚Äôm so happy that I don‚Äôt live in the U.S. especially Texas. And I am not woman, but this is insane."
"Clearly, controlling women is what is important in Texas because if Texas really cared about getting babies born, then the future children of this woman would be important and they are not. TEXAS IS BAKCWARD! WHY WOULD ANY WOMAN WANT TO LIVE THERE! Texas women need to hit the streets in protest and stay there until the legislature changes this backward thinking."
Pure misogyny. Pretty soon the rule of thumb will be back.

"The woman's life is in danger, so much for the 2nd ammendment."
And when the people of Ohio voted to put abortion rights in their constitution the government shot back by saying 'nope' and attempting to (not sure if they were successful) take power away from the judges and put it only in the hands of the politicians. The GOP isn't going to let something as silly as people exercising their rights and voting stop them!
VOTE IGNORANT Republicans out and don't replace them with another IGNORANT Republican. VOTE BLUE IN 2024.
"Are Texian people that cruelty and too dump to question their bs evangelists and their redneck politicians?
Hope their wives, daughters, sisters, nieces, mistresses and church-ladies would not have to go out of states, or secretly doing abortions in the basements of some pastors' houses, or just rise up and fight for your rights to be safe and healthy, instead of  just spreading their legs for those thugs to make you pregnant!!"
Texas.  Where the guns have more legal protection then the women
This kind of deciduous from republican officials will incite a civil unrest between political parties.
Family values guy with a mistress for years.  Hypocrisy yet again.  I wonder if Ken arranged an abortion for his mistress or any other woman from his past.
"The entire Texas legislature is worth S***!  But many women in Texas are just as bad in their ""religious"" stand!  I know--I live here."
Look up Logan Carroll. The Miracle Baby. God is powerful and it is in His will. This baby has a soul and thus within God‚Äôs Providence.
Say whatever you want there's NOTHING OK with that situation. NOTHING!! It can happen to all women and what's next?! Vote the fascist GOP out!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
I'm soooo tired of the fascist GOP. I'm extremely sick and tired of them. Yet some (including women) entertain the idea of Trumpism 2.0?! Foh!
AAAaahhhhh!!  Is this the USA in December 2023?!?  It's good to be Danish.
I could of sworn republicans hate big gov'ment telling them what they can & cannot do. But I guess that was just another BS talking point.
Paxton needs to go to prison for the attenpted murder of Ms Cox.

"The Fed Gov, Biden Admin pointed out a law that says hospitals and doctors must save a pregnant woman's life, EMTALA. Ken Paxton sued, the fed gov to prevent this act from being applied in TX. He doesn't want to save women's lives"

If pro lifers really cared about life then they would care about the mother

"Thanks a lot Texas!  You could have pushed this criminal pos out of office last month but because you don't have spines or balls enough to go against a bigger criminal pos (tfg), this is what you get!
I sure hope Texans and the entire country is paying attention.  You think this is bad?  Put tfg and his sycophants back in office next year and watch as this becomes only the first in a long list of rights that get taken away from us.  
And I mean ALL of us - not just 'the libs!'
Do you think Paxton cares if this couple voted for tfg or not?  
Of course he doesn't care.  You just emboldened another criminal monster in this country to become even more of a monster.    Congratulations!"
"oh this is easy! women your uterus belongs to old white men in the goverment! ask permission, because they love it! SMH"
Klansman Ken has got to go!
Older whyt uneducatedabout medicine whyt men shouldnt be making medical decisions about a womens choices .
But dumb women keep voting for reps so its their own fault
"The Texas Supreme Court should wait to make their ruling until after Cox does whatever she's going to do. This sends Texas lower courts that have Democrat judges a message, do not give permission to women seeking to pre-empt TX law and it gives Democrat women the message to not seek to pre-empt the TX laws. Cox should go outside the state to California if she wants to murder her unborn baby. The TX Supreme Court can afterward make their ruling in favor of the TX law and the message will be reinforced."
"Texas, vote these people out! It‚Äôs really simple!"
"why are lawyers and judges making medical decisions?   Remember during the healthcare debates when Republicans were talking about ""death panels""?  well, here we are.  I guess the next step is for the doctors and all the support staff to also get the judge's permission?  Then the post-op staff and her husband and children should also get permission to help with recovery lest they be prosecuted for ""helping.""   

It's a Republic - if you can keep it 
as Benjamin Franklin said"
"""Edwards syndrome has no treatment and is usually fatal before birth or within the first year of life."" So they want the potential baby to develop and suffer before it inevitably dies. Imagine the mental gymnastics it would take to justify that."
Ken Paxton was just reelected how many times do these Republican women need to say Paxton is speaking for us. Paxton is doing exactly what they want they will never push back against him.
Prepare for more authoritarian rule if the dumpsters get back in. This is but the beginning of what they'll do to our collective freedoms.
"Exceptional evil with nothing but religious overture for cover. Hey Ken Paxton?! How much do you hate women? I guess we know now. Ken Paxton, the world is in shock and disbelief at your cruelty."
"Whoever is putting these politicians in office is putting women's lives at risk and if this lady dies, you have blood on your hands. It's her body, it's her choice."
Glad she is suing. Also hope she comes to an adjoining state and get the abortion legally to save her own life
They don't CARE. CRUELTY IS THE POINT. VOTE BLUE FOR WOMEN.
The members of the Court should be indicted for practicing medicine without a license.
Yet texas will continue to elect republicans.
"We, the people, need to vote OUT every, single republican‚Ä¶.especially in Texas."
"That‚Äôs awesome that the decision should be in each state. However, when republican legislatures refuse to bring it to a vote, and worse when it does get brought to a vote and they refuse to honor the People‚Äôs decision, that‚Äôs when a national law is needed. Time for the men to get behind the women of this country and actually help."
This is medieval sh*t. I wouldn't treat a dog like this let alone a woman. GOP are sick and draconian.
"Don't believe maga Republicans when they say that there will be exceptions to anti abortion laws.  
This is just the beginning of their attack on human rights."
Pro Abortionists are the worst kind of racists.  They hate ALL races of unborn children.
She begged the ruling men and promises to follow the government mandate better next time. This is our new republican party.

"For a country, who keeps claiming to be ""the best country in the world"", u guys sure keep trying to prove otherwise. And to this Scandinavian, ur thoroughly succeeding.
U guys truly are extraordinary, when it comes to continually electing politicians, who will rob u blind, take away ur rights and generally leave u in miserable lives, that we Europeans would find totally unacceptable, and then u whine in astonishment about how ""government isnt working"". Gee, maybe u should look in the mirror to see why. Coz when electing these ppl isnt the bug, but the feature through decades, then u cant keep blaming the politicians, its on u guys for continuing to elect them."
"I need an explanation of a legal term regarding this situation. I heard elsewhere that Ken Paxton has said that this woman does not have ‚Äústanding‚Äù to bring this case. I recently looked up the legal term ‚Äústanding, and it essentially means that this woman doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave a dog in this fight‚Äù which means that she can‚Äôt bring her suit because she‚Äôs not personally involved in it. I also read that during the last women‚Äôs group (Equal Means Equal - wonderful group, BTW!) to take the ratification of The Equal Rights Amendment and fight to the Supreme Court to have it entered into the U.S. Constitution, because they had collected the necessary number of signed petitions. In the U.S. Supreme Court, one of the judges (I think it was John 8:38 Roberts) also said the woman‚Äôs group didn‚Äôt have standing. Can someone from the legal community, preferably a woman (Joyce Vance? Or the other woman here?) PLEASE explain to me how a pregnant woman carrying a fetus that WILL die either before or after birth, or a woman‚Äôs group which was founded for the express purpose of getting the Equal Rights Amendment put into the U.S. Constitution does NOT have standing in the law? I don‚Äôt understand how either woman or group would NOT have standing in a legal case that pertains fully and completely to them, and they are implicitly and absolutely personally involved in these cases! Can anyone please explain that to me. Thank you if someone does, because it makes absolutely no sense to me."
George Carlin was right these people are Anti Woman not pro life.
Republicans attempt at trying to stay relevant because their cult leader lost in 2020. This is the only way they keep themselves in the spotlight. A woman will die because of these laws.
This is just barbaric. The corrupt Texas AG is just a Devil in the flesh. But the people who are voting for Republican are guilty as well. Shame on all people who voting Republican.
"Paxton, a criminal who was exonerated by his criminal cronies decides over life and death.
The US, particularly Texas, have reached an all time low. Christian white supremacists are
a scourge on society, they are really cruel and inhuman. only interested in forcing their cultism
and beliefs of something that is unproven and absurd, on others. Technically and scientifically
the world has advanced, morally these people are stuck in a time zone where practically 
everyone was ignorant and uneducated and believed anything that clever conmen said to them.
Billions are grifted by clever conmen in the US, in the name of religion."
Sue Paxton for medical malpractice... without a medical license.
Opine Paxton is poster child for americanized christian version of Taliban.
They don't care in Texas.
"I hope Paxton just thru away his governor chances. This was a wanted child that became unviable & a danger to the mother. How dare you step in! These parents have cried unknown tears about this. But you felt  you should get in the way. Shame on you, Paxton."
Republican Government in the lives of families and women making life altering decisions for them.
Evangelical/Taliban maga Cult...
A law maker/inforcer without a medical degree uses his biblical opinion to enforce his belief on all others outside of his beliefs.
How stupid can you be  to be a woman  that lives in Texas and vote for Republicans?
Every woman needs to remember this event come 2024. This IS the Republican agenda‚Ä¶..nationally.
This is a clear and painful example of the misogynistic agenda of the MAGA-GOP.
"Wow, the government has complete control of women's bodies."
That should be a womens right. That's just crazy.
"OBVIOUSLY, THE STATE OF TEXAS DOES NOT VALUE THE LIVES OF WOMEN! 

WHY ARE MEN MAKING LIFE DECISIONS FOR WOMEN?"
These Texas pro life are sick people they have no mercy for saving this lady live
Vote vote vote vote
This is sickening.  The criminal Paxton keeps committing crimes. When will it stop???  The bully that runs Texas.
"Get rid of all these Religious Morons.
SAVE AMERICAN WOMENS RIGHTS.
VOTE BLUE"
"Please *don't call these people Christians,* they are the Gentiles and these are their Last Days. As with the right of an abortion, there is nothing in the Bible denying it. Actually a wise man once wrote...
*And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive. But better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil (that man has) done under the sun.*
The sad thing is, the great false religion, the murderers of our Lord and million of true followers, hijacked our faith and created their ""religion of man."" They never gave a crap about abortion, until 1869 when it was prohibited by the so called ""catholic canon law."" But again, what more do you expect from the Gentiles..."
"Having ken Paxton's making a decision of medical need,..sighhhh a corrupted political official telling a woman doctor and  medical support staff he knows more about human body cause hes a gop shady as heck political members  and now since hes has his law degree he knows reproductive and oby care..this is where a medical persons hippocratic oath should over ride a lawyer's false  wanna be medical ideology..."
"The very same party that is against women getting abortion, I believe are also wanting to make a move to ban contraception.  They cacre so much that a woman must carry every baby to be to term and deliver said baby.  Yet where are they on affordable childcare,  etc.  Once the child is born they don't care, it is no longer the governments  / the states responsibility"
Lower than property
This is INSANITY.
SOO..what she has to be on her death bed to have the abortion? Like ...really!? The AG is not medically qualified. If anything happens to this women her discrepancy is on their hands.
"File through the AG's background,, see what boils"
Paxton should be in jail. What a hypocrite.
"If I was rich, I'd fly her to a state where she can get one without a problem, first class, and pay all her bills. Texas may as well admit that it wants no exceptions."
Apparently Ken Paxton and the TX Supreme court have decided she can‚Äôt receive the abortion that Ms. Cox and her doctors have determined is medically needed. üò†üò¢
"This is what it looks like, when fascists rule and the people obey."
This is what voting republican
No American citizens of the female gender should be voting republican
"What would happen if this woman were to die?  Who would be to blame?  Shouldn't a woman who has two young children have the ability and the right to healthcare in 2023?  It would seem that children already born, and facing their mother dying because she can't get the healthcare she needs, is ok with Texas lawmakers.  It is nonviable fetuses they want to keep alive for a few hours, days, weeks, regardless how that affects the woman.  Who cares right?  Women in Texas have fewer rights that a pregnant animal who needs medical help!  All you need to do there is make an appointment and the surgery will be performed, without lawyers, without judges, without delays and without government interference and their lack of any medical knowledge what-so-ever.  Surgeries are even available if it's an emergency - to save both mother and offspring - if possible.  Imagine that!."
"If something serious happens to this woman, there will be women marching in the streets until next November, no matter what the GOP tries to do!  My wife and daughters will stop the streets of our Nation from moving anything and will make the Just Stop Oil protests look like a tea party!"
Show up to vote people stop complaining. Democracy and freedom can only survive if we vote out the MAGA extremist ! We can not let Trump into office he will go after our freedom to vote next.
This ruling was placed on hold by the all-male Texas Supreme Court. SICKENING
Maternal doctors should leave Texas‚Ä¶let‚Äôs see how republican women deal with it. I want them to spend hundreds of dollars traveling to another state for anything dealing with pregnancy
That's exactly how conservatives intend for it to be.
"If she dies, murder charges should be filed against the legislatures (republicans) who made this a law in Texas."
She can go to another State which allows late term abortion right? Texas doesn‚Äôt wish to get involved.
VOTE VOTE VOTE
Why was this law put in place without a vote from the people. State Government should not have any decision in women‚Äôs health.
Iran of America
Not surprised this is happening in Texas.  It‚Äôs one of those women hating states.
"Imagine that, the criminal Texas AG himself has criminalized abortion."
Leave the State of Texas and obtain the care you want.
Also this woman had to also now have her story on blast bc she has to go to court and over explain  her complications not only in becoming a mother clearly wants a baby and this is just unreal that even the medical professionals are standing by her ‚Ä¶. Her poor mental health?!!!!!
"Let's make a deal.  Trade Texas for Ukraine.
Meanwhile, lets get Ms.Cox removed, quickly, to a more enlightened state.
A question for Paxton:
You claim to be ""pro life.""  Are you concerned at all about the QUALITY of life, or just the QUANTITY?"
Paxton.   You DISGUST me.
No...  She must abide by the rules and regulations put into law by the leaders she and others have chosen to be in power.
Is this in Iran??
"Don't care about cruel laws. I care about her life. So much for ""pro-life""."
"If this woman loses her ability to bear more children, due to the state‚Äôs insane, invasive laws, it should OWE HER IVF, a surrogate to carry the child, and all associated medical expenses, for as many cycles and children as she wants. I SWEAR, it  owes her more than that!"
The American Nightmare. But Republicans will sell it as a dream.
"Right, but then the Texas SC stepped in and reversed the judges‚Äô order! This woman should go out of state. I know she wants to make an example, but she also needs to consider her health. She should come to Massachusetts. We would be glad to give her what she needs! I say if the courts delay her abortion until it is too late for a legal abortion, an exception MUST be made to permit a late-term abortion. This is what the right-to-crappers get when they meddle with a woman‚Äôs abortion rights."
Republicans are destroying this country
"Indeed,what gives a white guy with no medical training at all the right to judge what a sick woman needs to do to stay alive. They cannot claim religion on their side because I am fairy sure Jesus and His Mother Mary would think and act differently."
This is beyond reprehensible.
CHRISTOFASCISM !!
Those poor man in Texas soon have no gf or wifes anymore. i can't imagen that woman want to stay in Texas.
This is exactly why healthcare has no business being dictated by government. They are not medically trained professionals and need to stay in their lane‚Ä¶
Texans hate women.
"Texas needs to get abortion on the ballot.  It should have somehow been a requirement that it be put to the PEOPLE of the states once Roe was overturned.  States should not have been able to pass laws like Texas did - so it was primed and ready to the asshats in the SC take out Row.  I know people will not like that comment.  Ohio, Kansas and others have shown - even with a Rep legislature when put to the people they choose to protect individual rights to choose what you need for your own health.  I argued with friends and family that this would happen. They believed there would be exceptions.  ""Lose of major bodily function"" should include the ability to have children in the future.  Paxtons actions and threats show that's not true.  Rep cowards in the state senate need to be voted out."
Thats what i want to know when did  paxton get a doctor license????
Texas is just conservative North Korea. That whole state is a cancer.
"Grind my gears.


 Why do they keep voting republican?  This is what you get"
"This Is About Politics & Religion And Forcing Your Beliefs On Others.

Vote blue and every election in every state and let's end this fascism and Bible thumping because Republicans are using religion instead of the Constitution
"She can leave the state and get the abortion elsewhere  , almost like she is purposely trying to stay to sue , it‚Äôs your fault now for not leaving , she can even go to Mexico to do it for low cost !"
Absolutely insane for this POS Paxton should dictate the future for any women‚Äôs life! Paxton should be held accountable for anything that goes wrong!
I Hope she SUE PAXTON
You could bet if it was the AGs wife or daughter under the same circumstances he'd get the abortion done under the table.
Texas has always been an a** backwards state! Ain't nothin' changed!
If the mom dies then they need to charge Ken Paxton with first degree murder & give him 20 years in prison.
Why haven't the people of Texas haven't demanded a vote on this matter? Things like this should be brought before the people whose lives these laws effect.
This isn‚Äôt prolife it‚Äôs something else I would call it pro- birth as some have stated.
And just WHAT is the opinion of the health insurance? They need to step up for the health of women!!
I dream of the day when we have personhood rights for women in Texas.
"Abortion stances should be one of many single litmus tests for politicians and political movements for whether or not they're good for democracy as a whole. A politician says out loud he opposes abortion? Then he also opposes democracy as a whole. Also, science says abortion is NOT murder, so save your replies, forcedbirther-trolls."
Her body ken Paxton's choice.
This is an outrage!
These creeps should open an orphanage.
"Your rights end where a Conservative‚Äôs beliefs begin.
Exceptions that one can never qualify for are not exceptions."
They voted for this garbage.
"I am pro-life, but in this case Paxton and Texas are wrong."
Ohio voted to protect yet the state is still pushing back against what the people voted for !! So even when the people have spoken the government still doing what they want
"Texas needs to turn their state Blue so sane, lifesaving decisions can be made for its citizens. Especially for women."
What‚Äôs not believable about this. We‚Äôve been headed here like a freight train.
"First a disclaimer: I'm pro-choice, and see nothing wrong with (the former) Roe decision. But based on a comment on another article, I did find that emergency abortions are being performed in Texas. The link appears valid (Texas HHS). Yet there are the women who sued earlier this year, plus this case. What gives? Why were the other women in this document able to get abortions?

Texas allowed this to happen with your vote.
"Canadian here, I thought the Republicans said they wanted the government out of peoples lives? Guess they lied again,typical conservatives"
Second class citizen? More like a caste system with women at the bottom.
Y‚Äôall vote for them to govern so deal with it all Texan voters. The sense you are making your liberty is @ staking.
"MEN need to get TF up and fight for their wives, sisters, daughters. 
Allowing this to continue means the US Gov't decides when women will die. 
MEN if you value the women in your life, get in there."
"Thank God for Gov. Abbott, Attorney General Paxton, Republicans of Texas, and the State Supreme Court. Letting everyone know. It's a 100 percent pro - life state. No exceptions. As it should be."
This is Disgusting! Are we really still in America?
Paxton should have been aborted‚Ä¶..
If she's forced to have this baby and dies then Paxton she be held for murder
"Interesting how complaints are coming out of rightwing red states. Looking at the makeup of the population being 50% women, I can gather most women in Texas want to have their personal reproductive decisions made by the government. Otherwise, they would have bothered to vote. 

I would say, in Texas, democracy is working the way they want it to."

Women need FEDERAL legislation to protect their health and reproductive rights from meddling by state politicians.
"Just think dads, farther grandparents,  if she dies your now the care givers tonthat family. That or the state orphanages. Some one will need to be the care giver to those children left behimd."
"This just proved that Americans are the least free people in the world amongst the 23 industrialized nations. No other society in this category forces it's citizens to give birth and die. It reminds me of how slave owners would dehumanize slaves as property by taking away their body autonomy. Todays message is clear, the state owns you and your body and you are property of the state."
Republicans are misogynistic and evil.
All this from a man who is currently under criminal indictment and hides from it while he is in elected office.  That is the new norm by the Republicans.
"Women should leave all these states en masse, make the men go to a place where the rules are different and they can't use religion and crooked politics to control women."
The voice of women? Ken Paxton can't hear them because he's only listening to the voice inside his head... He thinks it's God. I think he's just psychotic.
Texas does hate women's rights
"My wife and I had to make the difficult and gut wrenching decision to end a wanted pregnancy that had the life threatening complication of Trisomy 18. We have two beautiful children now because we were able to make important decisions with our health professionals. The Texas Supreme Court and the people of Texas that support such abominable policies are deplorable, horrible, subhuman people that are not even close to being Christian."

"Turn America Blue in 24, go out and Vote. Remove these Maga Republicans asap.
 Women have rights!"
"Denying women's right to choose makes sense only if women are not autonomous humans who belong to themselves. How else to explain how when we don‚Äôt deny right to choice even to save undeniably living, breathing, sentient humans, including children and infants, we act like it's OK to do so to save not yet sentient zygotes and embryos?
Everyone has the right to say no to use of their body, even to save another‚Äôs life. There are people  who die because of this all the time. We don't typically consider this murder, we consider this exercise of our human right of bodily autonomy, our ownership of ourselves. 
It's the same for a woman and the embryo inside her. It's her right to exercise her right to bodily autonomy to say no to use of her body by another. It doesn't matter if the other is a embryo, a relative, spouse, the president, or a Nobel Prize winning physicist. Nobody has the right to use her body without her consent. Yet only in the case of the embryo does anyone think of it as murder."

Go to another state and stop making a big deal!
Her body! Her choice!
The Texas supreme Court blocked the lower Court's judgment as being illegal. Trisomy 18 does not lead to the death of the mother. You can't make up the rules as you go along. As an American citizen she has the right to travel to a state that does have legal abortion without breaking laws. Name me one instance where trisomy 18 led to the death of the mother. You can't. If you don't like Texas's abortion law vote to change the law. It's unbelievable that women cannot know what is legal and what is not legal.

"As a Pro life supporter, I pray for Katie, Justin, and their 20 week old unborn baby. I found it ""barbaric"" that we, as a society do not do our best to protect both, mother and child.

Women must have negative pregnancy test to be able to use a seat belt after all a small short stop at 20 mph might cause the s e at belt to harm the fetus.  They are fragile when they have no organs.
"Ambulance arrives at car crash sees a woman trapped and bleeding, immediately takes a blood sample, she sample to lab, waits for results so they know if they can treat a woman or have to let fetus wait to god to let it be born before treating them."
Folks thought they were fighting satan by   standing up for the poor babies that devil worshipping women just threw away by having abortions...the life of that woman be damned...save every baby! Yup...that is how it was put out there...over turning Roe vs Wade was just the beginning...women were put under the control of the government...just wait and see...
"USA the land of the not so free. 
What a messed up country! For all the noise about the USA being free?  This law fails to the guarantee individuals the right to choose ( freedom). Religion in the USA needs to learn its place.

This case is a threat to their control over Texan women. It's as simple as that.
I believe this regime will be prosecuting women for having miscarriages next. There are already cases of women in the ER who could not get medical attention or removal of the remains of a miscarriage because hospitals and doctors are afraid to perform the procedure for being sued by the state.
To everyone who was on the fence about republicans not being a totalitarian regime. They won‚Äôt even follow the rule of law. They are openly trying to supersede a court ruling by threatening a 2nd party.

"The State, a Judge, an AG, the State Supreme Court, & lawyers. All these people are deciding what one woman should do with her body. America"
"As an attorney, Ken Paxton should know that a court decision is the authority. If he doesn't like it, he can appeal to a higher court, but he is in contempt of court if he is threatening anyone for following the direction of the court."
"I love Texas,but our govt. is so currupt."
"It is old men trying  to control  women, they are still living in the  stone  age."
I betcha she voted for Paxton
is this freaking Gilead? just crazy.
Yet they will continue to vote Republican
I'm not sure voting is a viable solution to deal with lazy-eyed soulless creatures like paxton.
"Texas is the state with the least citizen‚Äôs freedoms‚Ä¶look it up.  All of which are directed towards women and minorities! White old men ruling si the reason the world is in the shape it is in.
WE THE COMPLACENT PEOPLE!"
with three daughters i could never vote for a republican vote blue people
Republicans can be so vile.
Shame on Texas Republicans for letting Ken Paxton off to continue to this kind of damage in people‚Äôs lives. He should have been convicted and removed from office. Shame on Texas. Good for the judge.
Texas women always second class citizens.
I can‚Äôt get past his droopy face and blading GIANT head.
I am ashamed of this criminal AG ! Which century are we in ?
Greg and Kenny are expecting !
How many of the people who are shocked and upset by Kennys   actions what were you expecting and when you vote again for the orange republican God will you cry when he takes away your cake?
The pro-life christian Republican Party sadly just come across in instances like this as BARBARIC. Vote BLUE. this is on Obama could have codified Roe said he would and DID NOT. this is why the public DO NOT have faith in what ANY politician promises.Start governing for the people not the dark money peddling influences.
"no abortion no sir eeeee  lifes too important cant you see?
everyone knows what ken paxtons bottom line is $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
Hey dont ever become ken paxtons mistress and get preganant
"Respectfully, Joyce and Mika, you are wrong. Voting isn‚Äôt enough anymore, not with gerrymandering in TX. Come on, MSNBC, grow a backbone already. And you sponsors of MSNBC, we‚Äôre all sick of your gaslighting. I won‚Äôt buy anything from you anymore."
"Lets see paxtons wife or daughter not get an abortion if their lives are at risk, or show me ken paxtons medical degree"
"The only thing I have to say here is that Ken Paxton should have been impeached and indicted on multiple crimes he committed, as the Texas AG and before. He's a monster and he hates women."
The whole legal framing on abortion sounds criminal. I just hope that women and all sensible men can get out and vote OUT the people behind these cruel abortion laws
Free Texas give it to Mexico !!!
We So NeeD Women
Texas üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüí©
Unbelievable.  These Republicans want total control over women.  Women are to stand two steps behind their men and keep their mouths shut.  This is the United States??  These misogynistic men want to reverse all the social and equality progress made over the last century and return us to a time long gone.  Next they'll try and remove women's right to vote as they are trying to do with minority citizens.  We must vote these people out of office and thoroughly repudiate their fascist ideology.  Wake up America this next election is one of survival for our democracy
"No state,including Texas, has any business deciding such a health care decision for any citizen. Each human can make his or her own decisions regarding their own health. Paxton can decide for himself whether he ought to get an abortion, or not, but he can go stuff his opinions about others‚Äô health care."
"Everything is bigger in Texas, including the duschbag Handmaid commanders posing as republican AGs"
"Just remember this: Donald Trump is not only bragging about getting Roe v Wade reversed‚Ä¶he also wants to PUNISH women with jail time if they have an abortion! If he gets elected in 2024, women and life as we have known it in the US are doomed."
"It's sad that this woman has to fight to save her life, the right to have other children and that she can't make the right decision for the best care that she requires! Since she won her case and the AG is going to go after the doctors that gives her the abortion, the hospital and her husband for participating in her abortion! I pray that she takes the AG to court for attempted murder of her life, for the theft of her right to have other children, and the doctors and her husband also has the right to take him to court also for attempted murder by denying the right to have the abortion that could prevent death! The AG is also saying that the judicial system means nothing and that he knows more than any doctor, lawyer and judge! This AG is one sick man! No wonder God doesn't bless this country!"
"When you vote republican,  you get death panels, politicians in your bedroom, and doctors office. They told you they would do it."
Women as second class citizens IS the 'Great' in MAGA that Pubs want America to go back to.
"Until biden packs the sup court, women will be slaves of the state."
Think carefully about the issues you are voting for or against. B
The republicans have ruined our state.
"If, God forbid the mother were to die, will Paxton be charged with culpable homicide, or is that too much to ask?"
JESUS CHRIST! Please come
That is Insane. Who are these Men who believe they have the Right to tell a Woman What She Can Do With Her Body.
"Texas AG Tom Paxton needs a post-birth abortion, always has. The people's voice is, as the right-wing gun nutters keep telling everyone, the 2nd Amendment. Time for Texas Women to speak up loud & clear."
Ken Paxton is cruel and ignorant.   How dare he meddle in this difficult situation.  He should be sued personally.
Cruel and ineffective sums up MAGA Republicans policy positions.
"This is why I will *never* forgive Amy Covid Barrett for her MAGAcrimes against the American people.  Not content to slay a million living beings with her first ruling as a supreme court justice, she viciously tore down Roe, and now seeks another million deaths by miscarriage, and selfishly thinks it will win her a golden throne and glory in the afterlife.  Without her foul religious predation, American women would not have to beg the government for their very lives today."
this whole clip is some woke trash. 3 women complaining about men and talking about their bodies . you going to talk about that foreign guy you banged while drinking that old lady coffee next
"I thought it was ""Government OF the people, BY the people, FOR the people.  I guess Texas is too big for that principle."
"It's not about abortion and saving children. It's about controling women and girls. If they cared about children they would have past better laws for gun control, foster care and adoption."
TexASS Republicans have more respect for their cattle than women.
Vote all Democrats in 2024!
Anyone can be a woman today remember?  What's this talk about rights. What are those? Apples? Engines? What?
"This is a total embarrassment on the world stage.üá®üá¶. I see a fast exit, of Drs, out of US"
Texas is not part of the democratic world.
Wasn't Ken Paxton almost impeached in a vote and in a trial not too long ago?!?!?! üôÑüôÑ
Our country sute has fallen a long way....a criminal AG threatening others with charges for receiving healthcare.
"Well, we also have Malpractice Insurance carriers making medical decisions for doctors.   No, the insurance carriers do NOT have medical degrees, so glad you asked.  

This is the same thing.   It is dangerous, it is unfair, it should be positively ILLEGAL for anyone other than a patient's CHOSEN doctor to choose what is best for his/her patients.   The bloody end, man!  

I'm Pro Choice, but really thankful it did not have to be MY choice.  Desperate women will resort to desperate actions:   This is why I am pro-choice.   Of course, it breaks my heart for the pigs that use it as birth control...but it's not MY decision.   

I am so sad for this woman.   Truly."
Ken Paxton is a criminal and the fact that the American law allows him to still be. A governor makes me sick
Republic of Gilead IS ALIVE AND WELL IN TEXAS.
Sue paxton and file charges for attempted manslaughter
"Republicans must pay for this in 2024. Especially in texas, florida and all punk states trying to control women"
"WOMEN OF THE U.S. WE THE MEN OF GOD OWN YOUR BODY, WE OWN YOUR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, WE OWN YOUR HEALTH CARE. YOU ARE NOTHING BUT PROPERTY,  LESS THAN A 2ND CLASS CITIZEN, YOU WILL DO AS WE SAY, AS OUR BIBLE TELLS US . (IF YOU DISAGREE THEN VOTE. VOTE. VOTE. VOTE.)"
Isn't this 2023?  or 1723?
Blessed be the fruit...
Vote for all Democrats in 2024!
Second-class citizenship for women is allowing men to replace them in society... literally.
"What in the heck is wrong with the doctors of Texas that they don't fight this cruel, hideous law."
"They don't care about babies.  This baby has zero chance of living.  But 100% chance of conti6to devastate this mother and possibly leave her unable to have children.  Having lost a pregnancy at 22 weeks, the grief and devastation that comes with knowing that you will never get to bring your baby home is beyond what most people can grasp.  Her milk will come in. And there will be no baby to feed.  To put her through this, is absolutely disgusting.  Cruelty seems to be the point and I am thankful that I don't live in Texas."
"Imagine what happens to the citizens of this country who CAN NOT AFFORD A LAWYER OR LAWSUIT.
What are THEY supposed to do? Ken Paxton has IGNORED THE JUDGE AND THREATENED TO PROSECUTE HER DOCTOR AND HUSBAND! This is ""American""?!?!? We should ALL be FURIOUS!"
"Yes, THIS is health care - why call it abortion? Turning off life support for a terminally ill patient is not called homicide."
"The medical community should have created different codes long ago for situations like unwanted losses of wanted pregnancies. This is no different than removing someone with no chance of recovery off life support. If it had terminology recognizing it's not the same situation as what EVERYONE means when referring to ""abortion,"" we wouldn't be here."
Paxton is like the villain in a bad movie! Red states are going backwards.
"How does it affect women's status? Men can be pregnant people, too, ya' know."
Another reason to never live in Texas
"If you believe the Bible you don't believe that women are equal to men.
It's not binary like conservatives pretend. 
God made man.
Man was lonely. 
God cloned Adam and made him a  trans gender partner. 

Conservatives are hypocrites.."
Laws written BY men FOR men. Period. We couldn't get the ERA passed! The GOP will NEVER allow women to survive their hatred.
"STOP VOTING FOR REPUBLICANS.......STOP VOTING FOR REPUBLICANS.......THEY(REPUBLICANS) DO NOT CARE...,,........!!!!!!!!!"
Magaga is going to regret this.
This cruelty and negligence to this lady is ridiculous.  The USA has gone backwards to the rest of the progressive world.
I can‚Äôt believe that the man and woman; Kenny Pax suppose his daughter wife every woman in Texas. His selfishness and fear of women !! Maybe he should have a baby.
"The irony is the GOP wants to cut funding to all children's programs that help children in need, but they want to insinuate themselves in between a doctor and a woman.   These men who are making these laws are hypocrites."
Maybe Paxton should be sued or arrested for practicing medicine without a license.
"The judge already ruled.  But Paxton prefers to impose his cruel, personal ideology on a suffering woman just to show her who's boss.  I cannot use the words here that I would prefer to say."
"Texas when told they've got it wrong say, ""Hold my beer."""
"These people need to be stopped. May I suggest that emergency personnel when arriving at an accident find GOPers on scene and injured. The paramedics and physicians claim this is an act of god, hand them a bible, and tell them they haven't prayed hard enough and walk away."
"Religion is the motivating force behind all republican laws, being cold hearted hateful and prejudice against everybody that doesn't go to their Church.GOD must be proud to have such heartless spinless worms standing UP FOR HIMüò¢"
Let's be real she most likely voted republican until it didn't work to her advantage. Now we are supposed to feel bad for her years of poor choices? Stop voting for them then cry when they bite you. The republican party has been the party of hate for decades and the European women have been voting for them or decades. Now they losing their rights the republican party is the party of hate? Really?
What can women do to retake their bodily autonomy? That answer is very simple: Vote for Democrats across the board and get those evangelical tyrant Republican idiots out of our government.
Their holy book tells them women are property.
She doesn't realize that she is not considered an equal with men.  She is property and is now being reminded of that status.  We have fought for equal treatment for decades and finally won in 1973.  Here we are back at square one.
"I find it very important to point out how much of the issue around abortions is coming from MEN.  I am so tired of men trying to control everything and anything on this planet, especially a woman's body and health issues.  WOMEN ARE NOT YOUR INCUBATORS.  And, if you really want to end unwanted abortions then it HAS to come from the root cause of a pregnancy, which is the SPERM.  The sperm is what causes the pregnancy not the woman eggs.  NO SPERM NO UNWANTED ABORTIONS."
Why do we continue to excuse murder ?
"A bet you a quarter ,that in the past maybe one of trumps girlfriend had an abortion,im not saying it's true,,,no proof but why was he pro choice back in the day ,then in 2015,he change to pro life,because evangelist where supporting him,,,and how many Republicans have the same history when younger their girlfriends had abortions!,,,,iporcrytes"
why is Ken Paxton not in prison yet all government Aid to Texas should be banned.
Vote them out
"This is so distressing, she is cradling her bump so the baby is more than just a clump of cells, and for this poor woman to let go and say goodbye to her baby who she knows will never survive must be so sad.  And for some republican fool to pontificate and threaten her health care providers who are trying to help her survive it‚Äôs just unfathomable.  Republicans who support torturing women are doomed."

"Looney Tunes
think people, THINK"
"Please can we call it healthcare because that is what it is-an abortion is only part of the healthcare she needs
a key part of her healthcare she cannot get"
Ken Paxton belongs in prison
Im pretty sure denying someone medical care to the point where they‚Äôre almost on the brink of death is a sin. Texans need to read their bibles more closely‚Ä¶
He should be in prison for corruption but his time is coming
why does your country even have judges if noone listens to them
"Republicans are using abortion as just another tool against women to maintain control and authority .  Force birth, oppose programs for childcare and economic costs of raising children forces women from achieving higher education and employment advancement."
"I am pretty sure that if Ken Paxton was suffering from a medical emergency he would get the best treatment from Texas doctors.

So if Ken believes that this poor women should not get the medical treatment in an emergency situation then neither should Ken nor any of his family even in an emergency situation."
"Voters in Texas wanted it that way, they voted their people in."
"Imagine the arrogance and cruelty it takes to force a woman to endure such continuous pain and suffering and mental anguish to prove your Christian values and some nonsense religious point.  If she is unable to have children again because of this, she should sue Paxton personally and the state of Texas for damages."
Shouldn't politicans write laws that help healthcare workers keep and support their sworn hippocratic oaths and not break them do to avoid legal prosecution?
"As a Texan, I'm appalled at our Republican House & the AG Paxton.  Paxton is a major criminal being allowed to stay in office by the other Republicans who are know accomplices in his crimes.  The Texas Republican money is vile & corrupt.  How Texas has allowed this to happen is beyond comprehension."
"Abortion-on-demand turns men into second class citizens and brainwashes women into believing that they're ""gods"" that have control over life and death.  Even the Pro-Life Movement doesn't have control over life and death.  We're the messengers for the One who does."
It sure is and the rest of us peones are next in the Traitorous Republicans cross hairs ü§îüá∫üá∏
Ken Paxton is the the most despicable sleazy POS...he needs to be removed from the AG office immediately.
It's too bad MSNBC decided to report the story this way because it's actually an example of our laws and courts working correctly. New laws are sometimes purposely vague in order to allow for the citizens to debate the issue and work out the details in court. It's impossible to consider every possible outcome or consequence of something like a partial abortion ban so iit sometimes makes sense to provide a general framework gets clarified over time. The woman in question took her issue to court because it was possibly borderline and prevailed because of an effective attorney. We should be happy with this not angry.
"Ken Paxton and Gov Abbott shoukd be removed,  investigates, and barred from gilding ANY OFFICE"
"Kkk wants to control everything, but other pink girlmen"
For someone who's looking from outside the United States this is one of the most depressing things I ever heard it's just depressing and sad to see how bad

The left dramatist this case is pathetic and discusting.  Mika is one special woman huh folks.  She knows nothing about this but is telling people that maybe she can't have a child in the future. I don't think she has the qualifications to do that.
"Let's see if the most ignorant stupid people in the USA could figure this out and explain it to the rest of the country, we were number one worldwide in education now we are number 24 worldwide in  education, because we let the criminal Democratic party and the stupid people that vote for them take over the university and the college,  will some intellectually stupid Democratic person explain that to any of us,  because I like to know why they were so stupid to vote for the criminal Democratic party,  they are destroying the USA and everybody already knows there's  the ignorant people that vote for the criminal Democratic party they're too stupid to understand any off thisüòÇ"
I'm glad this guy had the time to give that lady permission to get health care.
Don't worry - d*mb*ss magamoronic WOMEN are still gonna vote for the redumblican party soooooooooo...yep
The trans community has made women second class citizens
"Dang, how far along is she. Why cant she do like thousands of others and schedule a delivery. The baby CAN survive? I'm so confused by liberal thinking?"
"One day Paxton may need urgent medical care, may the ambulance lose its way."
"Wasn't he acquitted of 16 chargesü§Øü§î Probably feels untouchable & lawless....bc obviously he is aka Untouchable Elites. There are 2 laws, one for Elites & another for ppl of limited means. Pfft. üëÄüëÇüëâüëàü§ùü§ë"
2nd Class Citizen is better than making available Zero Class Non-Being status for Babies. Plus making those 2nd Class Citizens Murderers. Your Fancy Excuses aren't Cutting it !!
Women just need to move out of Texas. Leave these control freak men behind to be the incels they deserve to be.
It's amazing that Paxton isn't in jail.  Republicans have a moral value at all to vote for criminals for office.
"Smh. It strikes me the whole abortion issue is about fear and control. Those most fearful (of what, for God's sake? Women?) are the ones most hung up on controlling. They couldn't control their way out of a paper bag."
the last stats and study i saw were that over 75% of abortions were out of convenience. with money and 'not the right time' being the top two reasons.    less than 5% are out of actual medical necessity
"If you want to know how things like this can happen in the state of Texas it is because Texas is the buckle in the ""Bible Belt"".   These are God fearing Fascists in this state......not all of them, but too many of them."
"Lol... ""Second Class...."" As if a mythical ""1st class"" is getting abortions? Wow... Leftists are this nonsensical it's comical. I'm not even pro-life and I can't stand the way you idiots talk about this."
"I live in Texas and yes, our state government is run by a bunch of hacks, but that does not let the voters off the hook on this issue.  No, I have never voted for a single one of the abysmal candidates that were elected to lead this state, but as a voter, I share the collective guilt of the voters of Texas who have installed these misfits into places of power.  I apologize profusely for the misery that woman and her family have had to face because of our elected crud.  And Ken Paxton is the worst of the lot."
Nice to see the boneheads haven‚Äôt learned a thing and keep doubling down on stupid. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Ken paxton you nut case!

These decisions ARE NOT YOUR BUSINESS !!!!"
With Ken Paxton would qualify the abortion is when this woman has a tombstone and dies from the complications of the pregnancy.
"Bring it on Texas.
Keep pushing America's buttons.
FAFO."
"This doesn't seem very pro life too me condemning, them to potentially die from medical issues.  Very Texas, pro life only after people die then do bare minimum to fix issue to look like they're doing something.  Texas energy grid comes to mind. People who didn't realize, how conservative Americans are must not deal with many restrictive laws. Colombia a very catholic country legalized abortion as did overly, conservative S.Korea the USA isn't that pro life more like pro cruelty. I wouldn't be surprised, if the USA starts acting like Uganda or Russia and starts going after LGBT next."
It's shame that they used religion as a tool to control women's bodies.
George Carlin had the GOP dead to rights.  They are NOT Pro-Life.  Conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers.
Hold on define citizens ship is that at the open borders
Men should have NO say in any women's health issues.
Doesn‚Äôt Texas execute criminals?   Why isn‚Äôt that life sacred?   Christians playing God.
There's not a single woman in Texas that feels like a second class citizen.
"When the comments about abortions after birth wouldn't this be the same thing. To force a woman to carry a baby knowing ultimately the baby will suffer a painful death after birth.
   ‚ùì"
"Why do we have to deal with the state when we go see our doctors, this is no one's business but our own. If you don't like abortion, don't have one, if you don't like to think about it, don't, you will never know these women's stories, and it's messed up that we have to be public with our health issues. We are all held hostage by a few men don't like or appreciate women."
Where‚Äôs the surprise..you voted for this
This is just so sick!
"It is the arrogance of xtianity coupled with misogyny and narcissism.
Paxton is deplorable."
"Each state should have a referendum on abortion, let the people speak."
You guys have any breaking news on Hunter Biden!!üòÇ
"I can predict with very high certainty; if this becomes the standard.  Texas hospitals WILL close down maternity wards and many OBGYNs will leave the state.  Just like Idaho.  

As a single, straight male, I am VERY bothered by this, just like Mika"
Republicans must be voted out of all levels of government for this madness to stop.
I'd be curious to know where she stood about Pro-Life and where she's standing now with regards to reproductive rights and healthcare.
"So, let me get this straight...  A woman needs the ability to murder her unborn BABY to be a ""first class"" citizen?  Just trying to wrap my brain around what you are stating...  I understand the dilemma, I really do, but please do NOT make this about ""class"" rights.  It's NOT about that, period.  There SHOULD BE LIMITS and women MUST STEP UP and take PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN CHOICES.  Personal responsibility does NOT mean killing, it means PREVENTING.  Stupid argument.  FOUL."
"Paxton says she's an activist.  Yeah, I bet that's why she got pregnant."
"Are we going to imprison everyone who assists 66th + term abortions, cause I think Mexico is ready to pay for that wall."
Yeah right this is coming from the party who‚Äôs trying to remove women from sports by supporting men playing in women‚Äôs sports. So unfortunate.
What part of infanticide do you not understand?
So sad for her. She obviously wanted the baby. There is no reason to threaten her life by forcing her to continue to carry a baby that appears to be aborting already and that can not survive even if carried to term.
"This ruling would have never happened if the woman suing the state if they were black or brown. 

White Woman tear are a powerful thing..."
wow
The reality is that human societies have to be class differentiated [patriarchy and matriarchy] because the function of the human mind is to discriminate. No discrimination is no mind or mindless state of consciousness.
No woman should have to beg ANYONE for her healthcare.  This is good*mn ridiculous.
Democrats just love üíï deleting those babies üë∂ üë∂ üë∂
A corrupt Texas Attorney General
"Ask Ken Paxton & anti abortion politicians bullying this woman,  Q: How many secret abortions have you had, paid for or forced mistresses to have?"
This is insanity!!! Disgusting what Maga has done to our country!!! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
It's stunning to me that 54.8% of Texans vote for this.
Please stop saying women need to make this decision with her family women are capable of making their own decisions
As a Texan Fu$k Ken Paxton ü§¨
They don't care about babies.  Anti-abortion laws are not about babies they're about punishing women.
"Oh well, at least the economy is great .. according to democrat gov't workers in the DC beltway."
"USA  has always been a caste -class society , depending on your race , religion , wealth and position of power in government ! If your a poor native American women living of the reservation your treated as the bottom of our society ! If your a rich , wealth, Jewish, colonial parents, government official your at the top of our society !"
"That's a rather ""nice"" way of putting it üòí"
Women should be allowed to do whatever they want with their body. There's already too many people on this earth anyway.
"Religion is behind all this crap, vote these nuts out!"
"Where are all the republican pro life preachers now?  I haven't heard any of their takes on this?  They are cowards. Come on out and discuss an actual circumstance that happens instead of lying about ""post birth abortions."""
"This is what forced birthers want for young girls and women in all 50 states. Forced birthers have repeatedly proven that they view young girls and women as sub human property- thats the point of laws like the ones in Texas, Florida, Idaho etc. Vote blue to stop them"
Paxton is a disgrace without empathy for anyone.  Why is he still in power?  Welcome to Texas.  If Women aren't allowed necessary procedures then make those in government who deny them accountable for the support of mother and child.  Texas politics sucks!  Vote Blue!
"Maybe Paxton needs to do a little learning about these rare genetic problems.  Trisomy banies seldom survive and their lives are full of discomfort.  Think of having a baby with microcephley, spinal bifida, clef palape and lip,  do a littlt research Ken. Be responsible, learn how your actions may affect and effect others."
Now I know where i can sell my steel coathanger collection. Thanks MSNBC!
"women in red states are not second class, they are nothing but breeding boxes when they are young and even less when older."
Sounds like a good test for a self-defense for the woman.
"While I agree she should be allowed to get an abortion in this instance and what I'm going to say is not the answer, but wouldn't it be easier to go to Colorado or New Mexico where there are no restrictions and then sue Texas later?"
"Ah, so your lifes on the line and you need the government and courts approval to get the necessary health care you need in order to survive? 

The republican party's agenda folks."
"Ken Paxton, a totally corrupt, self-serving sorry excuse for a human being THREATENING women and doctors on women's healthcare decisions! What woman votes for Ken Paxton??? Or any Texan GOP poltician????"
"But women are supposed to be second class citizens. Read your Bible (Ephesians 5:22,23, 1Timothy2:11,12)"
Never forget -- *We* are the carbon the liberals want to eliminate.
And Texas state Republicans actually voted to keep this corrupt piece of human garbage when they had the easiest excuse to get rid of him. Ugh.
What‚Äôs wrong with that man is a ten volume series. He is cruel and evil and corrupt.
"If this yahoo Paxton does anything to violate the court order, he should be immediately arrested and prosecuted."
Republicans are disgusting. They have never cared about babies
"""second-class citizenship"" .. *Kinda like Democrats making us jobless because we declined the mRNA jabs?*"
White Male Domination.

Republicans and their love of the Jesus!!!!!!! Hurt women in the nMe of the christ. Molest kids in church because..  GOD.
Paxton should be locked up as he should have been for alll of his corruption.
Ken Paxton? The guy should be in jail.
"this is just beyond crazy what is going in Texas, just crazy"
She isn't a second class citizen  she isn't even a person in fascist Texas.
"Let‚Äôs make a ban on men, who have erectile dysfunction, testicular cancer, prostrate cancer etc. let‚Äôs deny them healthcare and let‚Äôs see how fast they would turn this around. This is against the law."
"Where did Ken Paxton get his medical license? 

AND he could orphan two existing children"
Paxton is pure selfish evil. PERIOD üëø
This is the same abnormality the son of singer Prince and his wife suffered when he was born and suffered until his death.
"Holy, is Texas still part of the United States? Do better"
"I‚Äôm at risk of death. I‚Äôm a human being, it‚Äôs unavoidable."
"I could be very pro-abortion, if these loons are all reproducing at a high rate?"
"a pronoun can not get another pronoun pregnant, why are you so obsessed about abortion?"
Anyone who would force a person to carry a pregnancy is a predator and anyone who would force it upon children are child predators
"- Religious idiots trying to impose their imaginary beliefs on other people
- A minority of insecure men trying to control the lives of women"
My mouth is agape!  This so is wrong!!!!
Fun Fact: Abortion is not health care
"So all you people moving to Texass for a ""better life"" better think again before moving to a state with corrupt leaders like impeached Paxton, your life may depend upon it!"
"In Joe Bidens America, you have to step over human feces on the sidewalk üëèüëèüëè

Texas is voting to succeed from the union / America. This would be funny to see how many Democrats flee Texas if that did happen.
"The GOP wants to bend laws for Trump and his traitor thugs from Jan 6 but a women needing medical care from her Doctor, they step in unwanted and put that women at risk and in front of a judge."
Abortion rights to stay
How would making an exception affect Paxton's life? I never realized how many very cruel people there are in this country.
How quickly would Paxton threaten criminal charges and prison if this was his daughter?  Any chance he can be sued for practicing medicine without a license?

If men got pregnant there would be more abortion clinics than bars and churches combined and they would be running daily specials and discounts.
"I have four sisters; how dare anyone, anyone at all tell them what they can or can not do for themselves, especially stupid, ignorant bible thumpers."
Democrat women shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about an abortion because trying to convince a democrat woman to lose weight is like trying to convince a snake to get off its stomach. üëç
"This poor woman. Her life, health, and fertility are going out the window if she is unable to get a lifesaving abortion. That pregnancy she is carrying is doomed to fail because of a fatal fetal anomaly that kills fetuses before or shortly after birth."
Just how low and disgusting can the Republicans stoop?  We will never know because they find a way to disgrace themselves further each and every day.
"Great, but it‚Äôs not abortion or the democrats‚Äô poor messaging‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs the inflation‚Ä¶.."

Protesters should educate themselves on how to prevent a pregnancy instead of killing defenseless unborn human beings. Life begins in the womb and those lives matter and must be protected.

"Planned parenthood only push abortion- they don‚Äôt educate on other options because they make so much money and performing abortions. Think about it why would you not just go to your OB/GYN to get your Abortion? Why don‚Äôt you just go to your doctor if abortion is so wonderful and let them perform it? No, You go to some dirty clinic because it‚Äôs not held up to sanitary standards at all. I know first hand that  they train everyone that works at their facility not to ever use the word ‚Äúbaby‚Äù, show the ultrasound, not to ever tell the person that they have to count the hands arms and feet of they are aborted baby before they let them leave!! Because these poor females would be devastated! They don‚Äôt tell anything of the truth. They are all about money. I admit pro life has dropped the ball and educating. Read The book transfigured‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs simply amazing and it‚Äôs about a girl that had several abortions and that did work at planned parenthood!!"
"It wasn‚Äôt your only option. You didn‚Äôt look elsewhere, ONLY Planned Parenthood‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt offer any other option but abortion they push it because they make so much money they are sick and they train everyone that works at their facility not to ever use the word baby not to ever tell the person that they have to count the hands arms and feet of deer boarded before they let the lady leave because they want to make sure no limbs are left in her body.

The government has no right to force women to have a baby. #fuckyougregabbott
I don‚Äôt feel sorry for the girl. All I heard was what about me. Didn‚Äôt even think about the child at all. I gave birth homeless I had nowhere to go. I could‚Äôve gotten an abortion but I decided not to. I still went to school when I was pregnant. and I didn‚Äôt have family to support me at all. I did what I had to do when I had the baby. I could‚Äôve gave her up for open adoption. But I chose to keep my baby. All I heard from this little girl was I don‚Äôt want to take responsibility for my actions.
Is it now a requirement of a demoRAT that you abort you first born? Or is it the second? Just askin.

If your mad then go out and protest or boycott planned parenthood? Their corporate lawyer is the one arguing in defense of upholding the case made to the Supreme Court
"I am not going to get into ethics surrounding abortion, and here is why: it doesn't matter. It is no coincidence that the places with the least abortion access have the highest abortion rates, and tend to be more sexist areas with higher maternal mortality and lower standards of living. Abortion is proven to improve the lives and educational levels of women, proven to improve the lives of existing children. Most of all, it is proven that abortions will still happen no matter how many laws you put in place to prevent them. The difference is, people will die with unsafe abortion. Unsafe abortion is one of the three major killers of childbearing women worldwide."

12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;
13 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;
14 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:
15 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;
16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.
17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.
18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.
19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.
20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.
21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.

6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.
7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.
8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.

2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.

And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:
12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.

Thank you to all the women who aborted and saved a child from this trash world!
Abortion is Murder
"Pregnancy is dangerous. Even fertility clinics have to go through multiple embryos before success. I have friends in Texas who wanted to start families but are now too scared to try. This punishes everyone across the board. If you don't understand that, just wait til it's your turn to deal with a pregnancy, expected or not."
"lol imagine being one of those absolute TOOLS who got tricked by the government and big pharma that a child is nothing but a ""clump of cells"" and is not valuable as a human life so it can be exterminated.. you realize these same people who taught you to be so stupid are the ones who PROFIT OFF OF ABORTION?  stem cells among all kinds of other things are harvested from babies who are aborted by stupid ass teens who just want to have fun without any repercussions.. imagine that. Idiots don't understand the monetary value in things like stem cells and how much of a market there is for it among the super wealthy and elite.  But keep offering up your children as sacrifice to them and one day you'll meet the creator you think is just a ""sky wizard"" and you'll get to see first hand what Hell actually looks and feels like.  Enjoy."

"All these ppl having sex but not using NO protection. Its too many devices and methods put here. The pill, the patch, the insert under the skin, condoms, vaginal rings, sponge, film, gel. Like if u are getting pregnant in 2021 its because u either want to or you are being reckless 98% of the time. its very rare to get pregnant while on birth control. Do what u gotta do but most of the time abortion is preventable if u use the proper contraceptive messures."
"I am against abortion because today, more than any other time in history, we have ways to prevent pregnancy.  Why doesn't the Government pay 100% for pregnancy prevention (from the pill to sterilization, if a man never wants to father children,  or a woman never sees herself as being a mom) instead of creating laws that only worsen the situation?  And, the mantra, my body, my choice, is not valid.  It is something you tell yourself when you want to get past something that has put a wrench in your life.  Once you get pregnant there is another body that does not have a say in what you are about to do."

Abortion is murder
The fetus is NOT your body and is NOT your choice
Clearly you lack control...couldn‚Äôt stay out of the bed with your boyfriend
See? Birth control increases unwanted pregnancies. Don‚Äôt have sex. That‚Äôs the best way
Private Adoption is not good.  It is legal human trafficking you exchange a large sum of money for a child in return. That is human trafficking with a new name. The private adoption industry will make about 19.1 BILLION dollars this year.  In foster care parent should always go in with intentions to reunite the child with the bio parents unless it is absolutely not possible.
"Some of these comments are vile. Until you all are pro-welfare expansion, low to no cost healthcare, pro mask and vaccine, pro foster care reform, pro comprehensive sex education and free birth control w/o parental consent, and anti death penalty you all are not pro-life you are pro forced birth because you all have made it clear you don‚Äôt care about that being once it is on earth. Just be fucking honest with yourself. 

Also if an embryo at 6 with cardiac electric activity (it is not a fully formed heart or true heart beat; it is also not considered a fetus even at 6 weeks) is considered a child women should start receiving child support at 6 weeks of pregnancy right and be able to take out a life insurance policy right too?

The vast majority of pro life arguments are based off the Bible. Guess what we don‚Äôt live in a theocracy. We live in the US where per our first amendment rights in the constitution (which for as much as you all claim to love and love your freedoms you sure do pick and choose) we have religious freedoms and separation of church and state. Laws shouldn‚Äôt be based on religion ever even a little bit because by doing so you violate my first amendment rights to religious freedom."

"""Pro-lifers"" have never been against abortion because they care about saving the lives of unborn babies. It has always been about wanting to take away the rights of women. Plus, the Bible is PRO-ABORTION. See Numbers 5:20-22."
Adoption! Their is always a family that can‚Äôt have a child that will give so much love to those babies

so with that being said PPD is no joke and she could end up killing her baby from that alone or her own mental state  and not have any love towards the child . 

Why do people not understand butterfly affects .. you don‚Äôt have to be blood to raise a kid so if anyone of you judge mental people wanna raise one there is your chance ."
Exactly why would you want to execute the unborn child living inside you. Yes it's living. It's an act of murder. Pull your head out of your rectal cavity and deal with the situation. Sure if the inconvenience to give birth. But there's always adoption and then you will not be a murderer.

"Dont kill a child.. they deserve a chance at life too, same as all of us üôè"
None of my business.
I don't here one thing about father's rights.
"This is clearly unconstitutional, and a direct violation of the 4th Amendment which guarantees that everyone ""be secure in their _persons,_ papers, houses, and effects."" A fetus before 18 weeks (when it is developed enough to feel pain) has no legitimate moral claim to be considered as an entity in its own right worthy of legal protection. The rights guaranteed to all Americans of ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" simply do not apply to it _at least_ in the first 17 weeks of gestation. The autonomical interests of a fully-grown adult woman who IS capable of experiencing pain and suffering and seeing herself as entity existing over time (the notion of ""personhood"") supersedes the non-existent desires of a first-trimester fetus to stay alive or to not suffer. It couldn't be more obvious what the correct moral stance is here, unless your faculties of judgement are blinded by the shackles of Iron Age superstition. Put two-and-two together, folks. This law is an indefensible abomination in any modern, civilized society."
ABORTION IS MURDER! These women should be shackled and chain and arrested!
"All human life is sacred. This genocide of the innocent will one day be seen as the collapse of our morals on a huge scale. So many innocent children have been killed that future Nobel peace prize winners, pultzer, politicians, people that would one day make life better for all who inhabit Earth, for what? Because you decided that a child's life was worth sacrificing so you could continue living a irresponsible and unsatisfying life that is all about YOU. Human life is the most amazing thing to have ever graced this world and yet we still treat those of us who are the absolute most vulnerable as nothing more than a annoying side effect from a drunken one night stand. If you are having consensual unprotected sex then you have no right to take the life of the child that you had so carelessly pushed into this world."
"Kill a life so you can get back to your life? What a self centered pos. Abortions are NOT healthcare. In fact, they're the opposite of healthcare."
üòëüòëüòëüòëüòëShe‚Äôs selfish
If you are pro abortion you should be well aware of how it actually works. They rip the child apart by each arms and legs and then they literally scramble the poor child's brain and head before removing the child. All life is scared. Either be responsible when having sex or be responsible and at the minimum allow the child to be born and have a fighting chance at life. Who are we to snuff a childs life out before it gets a chance to see the world that has so cruelly destroyed it.
It may be her body but it‚Äôs the baby‚Äôs life adoption is her only choice to not be a ‚Äúdisappointment‚Äù to God only he can take a life
God bless Governor Of Texas!!
"If you have unprotected sex you had better be as responsible as you say you are and find out if you are or aren't pregnant before 6 weeks. And don't say oh I didn't know I was pregnant until I was half way through my pregnancy, NO if you have had sex unprotected then you are well aware you may be pregnant and to deal with it accordingly. Personally I think all abortion should be illegal except for medical and special occasions."
"Why do Republican states keep passing these laws? Because white people keep electing them. 

Don't like it? Leave Texas, because these racist, draconian laws are being rubber stamped by six Republicans on the U.S. Supreme Court."
"just wait till the kids are 18 then use a gun like everyone else.. and take responsibility like everyone else that does it just because the government can kill anyone they want with impunity doesn't mean they can give you the same right.. it's wrong for them and its wrong for you..to          you have the right to an attorney...    .. Jesus is mine..  he already paid my price for sin so i don't have to on judgment day.. ..   but for some reason, this evil generation wants to kill their children by the millions.. .. it used to be illegal when the world wasn't as evil."
U miss one day that baby never sees the light of day
Your literally ripping the baby out of u limb by limb that‚Äôs so messed up. They literally slice the baby up as it‚Äôs alive and has a heart beat dang. It takes a man to have the kid too

Abortion is not health care. Neither is contraception. However You‚Äôre there because you had sex knowing the risk. Grow the Hell up. Stoping a heart beat is murder.
Yep. It's all about States Rights. Go ahead.  Murder a baby in another state.
I think only time abortion should be allow before baby forms..medical condition.... rapist raping a woman and got pregnant.   Baby are innocent... maybe still give birth and give up for adoption.  Many families want a baby but can't
Who cares make your partner use a rubber or get on birth control lady

"What this beautiful young Queen signed up for and did may have been for herself but it was to another human being.

Women are going to continue to get abortions. This change will not stop that. Abortions go way back.  There will be illegal abortions somewhere too. That‚Äôs just my opinion.
Use contraceptives. It isn't rocket science.

"Why can we not have stuff done for justices that lied to us on T>V> live, then turn on roe/wade"
A woman DOES NOT have the right to terminate a life that she was only a co-creator of.  There is a father with equal rights to that life inside of her. Just because women carry that life inside of them for 9 months DOES NOT give them a right to terminate it. Your body does not equate to your choice when there is another co-creator of that life... a father!
Watch next they will jail you for having a miscarriage‚Ä¶. As of now I‚Äôm Texas if someone suspect you caused your miscarriage they can sue you and get 10k in damages!!!!!! Imagine any disgruntled ex boyfriend or anyone who wants to cause you problems. The power they hold
There is no good reason there votes be secret we need to know who is voting for these radical changes.
The Supreme Court needs to have a make over. The senate in power shouldn‚Äôt have the power to select the justices we the people should elect the justices.

oh and that little fact that during their hearings for the job they lied to our faces on live TV.
Oh I was surprised about Amy. Thought she is a traitor to women kind
"In essence, the Supreme Court is inherently a political entity where considerations such as logic, reason, and the protection of citizens often take a back seat to political dynamics."

What a surprise. Conservatives LIE! They hide how horrible even they know they are until they can destroy from within! Just like any other cancer!
Abortion is a privilege.
People with seven children have no right to decide the fate of others. They have proved themselves completely irresponsible.
They all should be going to jail for perjury they all lied on their confirmation hearings

"so, according to Kantor, ALL Judicial compromise efforts become irrevocably ""hopeless"" based solely on things happening in the media.  but the deceptive media they put out to the American public ""we don't know if we're going to take the case"" despite all evidence and facts represents a window of judicial ""persuasion"" that literally does not occur in any real or symbolic way?  why does she feel she has license to invent these reporting narratives out of thin air?"

"The judges on this court are corrupt and biden should appoint more judges to ballance it out and change the job from a lifetime job to a 5 year appointment , they can be removed if they are using their position to push a political agenda instead of looking at legal arguments .

The best supreme court that Putin could buy.
"I always suspect that the Supreme court is corrupt to the bone, did we notice that trump never criticize the supreme court trump pack the court we with his supporters because hebwant them to rule in his favour,that,s why why trump want to go to the suprime court to declare him over the law .total immunity over the constitution of the the USA."
They know you all won't do anything but angrily post online about it
"They say that Trump will still on the ballot. Does that mean that we don't follow the constitution anymore? He not only was involved in the insurrection, he is to blame for the whole thing. I just don't get it. No man is above the law and yet Trump is. How is this possible and why isn't he in prison where he belongs? The Supreme court swore an oath to uphold the constitution, why don't they in this case?"
"Justices don't ""change"" law. They judge cases based on the law which is based on interpretation of the context of a case as the law applies.. Congress is the only ones who can change or make law. However, the court can rule on it as they deem fit per the letter of the law and the Constitution."
"The feds never should have been involved in this to begin with. Up until a child is viable outside of the womb, it is part of the person."
These judges are as honest as Trump.
Abortion never was a Constitutional Right. It should be an issue left to the individual states. I am not for a national ban.  It should be decided by the States.
The SCOTUS is compromised

"Congress should impeach the (3) Justices (names I will not say). Any other person in this country lies during an interview and they find out you lied after getting the job, you are fired immediately. I have seen valuable team members get fired because they lied on their application, in the background documents or during their interview. But, when politicians (Congress, White House and Supreme Court, yes they are bias politicians) lie, nothing happens to them. They keep their jobs, salary and benefits. And, in the case of Supreme Court, they get to keep their jobs, salaries and benefits for life. For anyone who really thinks the US Supreme Court justices are not bias and side with a political party, than please check yourself into a mental hospital because you are insane. Justice Alito, Thomas and the 3 new justices wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade. This is why the U.S. Supreme Court should have term limits. They are more politicians than justices. They use their religious belief to make rulings."
Who Keeps leaking these things? Or is it part of the news story to say it got leaked
Alice Cooper is looking great these days.

How much did  the supreme corrupt judges get paid off to reverse the will of the people?
"If Biden wins 11/24 (dear god PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE) and has a majority House and Senate- He should add 4 Justices to the court. We have 13 districts, we should have 13 Justices... then pass a law stating you can only rise # of Justices when districts reach an odd #- 15/17, etc."

"Chris Hayes alleges that something is a great piece. Translation: it's a moronic piece that wasn't worth the writing of it. I notice that the loyal loonies of the left are out in farce in the comment section. Quelle surprise.

Just to be clear on the issue of votes, they had the votes to both take an overturn Casey (Roe was already a dead letter by the work of Casey). As usual, Chris Hayes is working hard to be the head clown in the car, reading all sorts of idiotic things into the world. They weren't waiting for RBG to die to do anything; her vote was irrelevant. It takes 4 votes to hear a case and they had that. It takes 5 votes to overturn a precedent. Since Hayes isn't all that bright, and neither is this reporter he's interviewing; they had one extra vote than they needed.

Also, Kantor is attempting to sell people on the idea that she has inside information to the Justice's conference; she does not. No one does. She's just doing her job; her one an only job: sell copy. Fiction is a fantastic tool of journalists for the same reason it is for other folks who make bank off of making things up."

the republican voted judges are against all freedom... all choice... and there all apart of the KKK... they work against the ppl. they dont work for the ppl. The KKK are in the supreme courts
We can always tell.
THEY ALL NEED TO BE FIRED FROM THOSE SEATS! WHY CAN'T WE VOTE FOR WHO'S IN THOSE POSITIONS??? I HATE OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM
"Kantor spends too much time making Coney-Barrett a hero in this article, when in fact, she ultimates decides to overturn Roe. I don't get her Kantor's nuance here?"
Look what Republican voters have to ignore. Look what Democrat voters can't ignore.
"SO,basically they are playing with our lives."
It's blatant and in our faces....MSNBC does the bidding of the WHite House
didnt this happen a long time ago
Not the alternate facts!
I wonder how many abortions they paid for in the past ü§î I guess we will never know..
They should wear patches on their robes like NASCAR Drivers showing their financial backers.

"The following are all allegations.ü§£ü§£
Clarence ""Affirmative Action"" ""Money Bags"" ""Money Train"" ""Kept Man"" Thomas is rich. He does not officially own much. His assets are not in his name! Presidents cannot keep gifts. Why should this SCOTUS keep gifts from Harlan Crow, the Koch brothers or any other GOP (4 known) buyers that:
--Paid for his wedding and honeymoon
--Dallas Cowboys super bowl ring
--Mothers house and properties
--Nephews University tuition paid in full
--Leo Lenard payments to Ginny's law firm
--Horatio Alger Association of the wealthy that he is now an idolized member. Yes, he receives gifts from this association 
--David Sokol is a helping hand
--Free flights on private jets, free super yacht trips and free stays at resorts. HE NEVER PAID FROM HIS SCOTUS salary

"Here's the latest news from the Supreme Court: 

FIRST:¬†Orange Man's far-right MAGA majority issued rulings to overturn Roe v. Wade, weaken the EPA, end affirmative action, reaffirm college entitlements and push ALL their extremist MAGA agenda. 

THEN:¬†They heard arguments on a case that would¬†END Social Security and Medicare, programs that millions of Americans count on. 

NOW:¬†They've agreed to rule on a case that could ban mifepristone, a commonly used, incredibly safe abortion medication, and¬†lay the groundwork to OUTLAW birth control! 

These rulings will have DEVATATING consequences for Americans in the present and future."
"The party of trump (POT)
The MAGA are all high on POTüòÇüéâ"
"When a supreme court judge takes a oath to our constitution pledges elegance to our flag.when questioned at interview they LIED!.

"Its only about control üíØ because if you believe in god, then why are you not going to trust him to judge Kate, not you? That is proof politician's do not trust in god to 'punish' her."
Supreme court is bipartisan or political my butt
Why not ban all live births to compensate for the population surge on our southern border ?
This is RGB fault. That hungry B hadn't retired we wouldn't be in this mess
"The breach of trust are the politicians mate-guarding SCOTUS nominees to preserve Roe v Wade.  Laws should be decided by the people, not 7 liberal justices in 1973!"
That's  the crooked games republicans play hi Allito top crook judge we see you.
TERM LIMITS!!
God   said do unto others as you have them do unto you üíóüòÖ
Sounds like God removed her from the planet  and  than  he  replacde her with a pro life judge .
Whats with the attempts to white wash Coney Barrett? She voted to nix abortion in the end which is what matters
The will not stop at Roe.
Barret voted against knowing it would still be taken.  Red herring.
"I commend Jodi for keeping such a level head and stating the facts during this interview. This guy can be a bit leading. I'm liberal and all, but I really don't like his style in this interview like he's trying to rile people up into a frenzy. It's reminiscent of the crap they play on the right."
"Psh, this could have happened 10 years later and we would have known it was because she died. What's funny is these people don't have to worry about re-election or some crap.  The supreme court is too political."
Again I say - WTAF with lifetime appointments?!! üôÑ America... we can be so freaking stupid.
"This sounds like ""Let's forgive Barrett because she's a woman in power, and feminism exists."" What a joke."
"Justices which shouldnt follow political lines, complaining when theyre called out for pushing their political view."
"I love this liberal propaganda. ""The leak may have been inappropriate because the justices could have changed their vote."" Yeah right, and Trump can admit that he committed all the crimes he's done over the past five years."
4:18 come on lady this is your cue to say that thing we talked about you saying
If this angers you remember Trump is taking the credit for this.
American Christian Taliban.
Trying to insert reason and justice into a 50 year long political hatchet job is ludicrous.
Don't understand why its a question. ABORTION IS A HUMAN RIGHT...
"Reform is required. No lifetime appointments, more justices and a balance across all parties including independents all for starters! Having the ayatem as it is oppresses the majority of the population"
This is why we need to abolish the electoral college.  These religious nuts have an insane amount of power over us those are living in 2023.
"In 1953, my great-great uncle found four strangled newborns hidden in his fields. My aunt told me about a much older cousin who had three abortions in secret to avoid raising kids with a violent husband. 
This was in the days before Roe. And these are the days we‚Äôre going back to. When abortions happened in secret and when actual fresh living babies were killed silently when abortions were denied."
Don‚Äôt look at me-I voted for Hillary.
America holds itself as a moral paragon while being one of the most corrupt duplicity even the judiciary
I thought we all knew it was Saltamayor.
Being able to buy a Supreme Court justice is corruption by definition.
I can't say I have much confidence in the Supreme Court. I don't believe that the justices are primarily interested in the law. I don't believe the American people are foremost in the justices minds. They have become political animals who make law secondary to power politics.
"A whole ton of revisionist history in this. The fact remains: they had the votes before and after the leak, the took the case before the leak, they negated the will of the majority of people before the leak. The leak was never a problem for these people, they wanted to destroy the will of the majority of Americans, that's the sole reason they were put there."
Amy Coney Barret be smiling at SC portraits like she deserves to be there.
Beach of trust you crook
"...are we still complaining about having lost Roe v Wade? It's awful, genuinely, but there are so many other stories that the news should be tackling and refuse to. Obviously this is about politics and power, you'd be dumb to expect anything else. The fact this is still in the news cycle shows that it's not a pressing issue, but a distraction from what matters. What is our government doing RIGHT NOW?!"
So do Kantor and Liptak know who leaked the document and why and just can't say due to journalistic ethics or do they literally not know?
At this point there is no one who hates women than the hard Christian right!  We might as well live in Afghanistan and Iran
I have no respect for some of these justices‚Ä¶
"The Supreme Court should take cases regardless of how it appears. They shouldn't take politics into account, at all. This isn't at all like taking gifts."
"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, ACB pulled a RICO"
Bs
The reason Amy Coney Barret (or whatever her name is) voted against taking up the case so soon after RBG died was because she didn't want to look bad. It wasn't because of some great soul-searching moment she had or anything like that. She didn't want to look like a tacky person plowing into one of RBG's most fiercely protected topics while her chair was still warm.
Abortion is wrong in our eyes as Christians from conception but if not in others and it's legal it should have limits on the age .
Developed feeling pain in a awful degree .
"It's sounds like you want to unsurp God's job. As  which He does a  good üëç   enough job at beingüòâthat  he can have a miscarriage happened or help save both lives if possibe at least   ,  still born rok yes but they do saline abortions up to 21 24 weeks  burning a baby alive in the womb it's wrong morally ."
WHO LEAKED IT THOUGH!? That is the big question that was just kind of dropped by the investigation. Was it a Justive? Was it a staffer? Were there any conaequences whatsoever?
I have very little trust in the US. How many more steps until the country will turn into a religious extremist dictatorship? What is the next step after this -  Remove voting rights for woman as it is against gods will for woman to have rights?
"no one is entitled to anyone else's body, period."
"That is a huge pile of male bovine fecal matter. 
Talk to a Lady named Anita Hill! 
Yet the so called justice got approved to the Supreme Court. 
Money Talks..... Lady Justice is supposed to be blind but Lady Justice can here money talking!"
"What does it matter if she voted against hearing it? 6 minus 1 is still more than the 4 they needed. I don't care about symbolic actions that do nothing. She just wanted to protect her own optics and when push came to shove, she still voted to axe Roe v Wade."
Yeah not always true. I have electric heat in each room.
This conservative majority in the supreme court is an abomination and an embarassment. They're overtly political agents.
"The Supreme Court is a farce. Anytime they split party lines, we know it is politics. When that 5-4 vote wins, we know something is deeply wrong with the justices. Not always with the ruling, but with those who are on the bench. 

1) Term limits 
2) Unanimous decision rulings required
3) Only 3 justices ruling per case, selected unanimously by the other justices 
4) At year 5, a congressional review of the Justice or opportunity to step down"
So this entire decision was made on partisan buddy politics and not actually the word of the constitution. Nice to finally have confirmation the supreme court IS IN FACT PARTISAN
I'm for abortion up to the 240th trimester in certain cases.
For some reason I thought that the court wasn‚Äôt deciding the issue until they‚Äôve heard all of the evidence from both sides.  Silly me!!!!
Who cares? Barrett voted to overturn Roe and that is what matters.
Democrats can‚Äôt tell you what a woman is. They think men can get pregnant.
Trumps judges all lied to get on the bench. They knew before they even got on the bench they were going to do what they could to over turn Roe. They have a lot of nerve to have a problem with the leak. They have no respect for the seat as liars don‚Äôt belong in the Supreme Court. The most honest people should be on its highest court.
Worst SCOTUS ever!   Impeach Alito and Thomas.   Amend constitution to install term limits for the justices.  Continually monitor their gifts (bribes).
"Besides Trump, our Supreme Court has become a group of crooks and liars and that should say alot about the right wingers taking control of our nation. 1 thing at a time."
"VOTE BLUE IN 2024! BIDEN, AND ALL DEMOCRATS!"
"It‚Äôs crystal clear that ramming these judges through was an agenda to overturn law and precedent. To rewrite laws based on religion, not law. It‚Äôs an attack on the court system from within."
"This leak shouldn't shock anyone, Supreme Court Justices are merely humans with their own individual opinions of right and wrong and stockholders with investments in a variety of corporations. Our socio-political landscape has always been a battle between theocratic and secular ideals. Add to that the intelligence/organized crime, corporation/government partnerships running our world's economies, and what we end up with are three branches of government (legislative, executive and judicial) focused solely on social baby sitting a population brought up with nonsensical beliefs in an invisible primate-deity. Our entire understanding of right and wrong in based in false dogmas and non-existent gods. We need a new plan."
Yeah more free gifts & vacations from trump for the Republican judges!!!
From the river to the sea
Could we not say ‚Äúabortion leak‚Äù? Wordsmithing is a thing.
"I trusted SCOTUS but no more. It's bipartisan now , Not law. Thomas is on the take with all his freebees. He is own by the rich."
"Judges at Any level should not have a Personal Opinion on any legal review. Especially at the Highest level. I realize it‚Äôs not always realistic for personal opinions Not to influence a ruling. When a judge is at Any level of appeal, it should simply be was the original decision wrong Legally. Was something done wrong that would change the outcome?  When it comes to a person‚Äôs right, is the existing law or decision unconstitutional, nationally or locally?  The reversal of Roe didn‚Äôt say abortion is wrong, it simply stated that the law should be made Locally not nationally.  States are already making laws, but in My opinion, it should be made by a referendum Before the State congress makes decisions. Some states say no abortion for Any reason after 6 weeks, which is Ridiculous."
Your judicial system needs a complete reset; it appears to be corrupted by politics from top to bottom.
This is just wasting our time.
I find this to be a total abomination that one person one vote can affect tens if not a hundred millions of Americans That's just playing NUTZ!
The comment section is gonna be a place of civil discourse with no vitriol whatsoever.
"Trump, Kavenaugh and Thomas are the main reasons why abortion should be legal because cowards will never admit to taking advantage. A woman should always have the final say when it comes to her body regardless. The outcome is between the woman and GOD"
"All of this because RBG hubris refusing to retire while Obama was in the office and the Dem controlled both chambers of Congress.

Yea, the GOP packed the court and overturned the RvW but the Dem party also played with your life by thinking and assuming Clinton would win and she can name RBG's replacement. Instead of being responsible, they played with this and the people ended up paying for it"
It was a left wing democrat.
"these asswipes were hoping to publish their ruling and then skip off on vacation right after and hide until the firestorm blew over, but someone thankfully LEAKED the details out and they were caught red handed LOL!!!!"
"I mean... are they an objectively evil, immoral person? Or are they pro-choice?"
Hoping the overturning Roe v Wade means states mamdate you have to get vaccinated and must donate your organs at death
"To be fair we didn't need that leak. The GOP has made it their goal for half a century to overturn Roe v.  Wade whether it's Constitutional or not. The second there was a Republican majority made by Trump, I knew Roe v. Wade was dead."
CIA or NSA leak
This Court is a sham.  They lie to Americans.  They take money from foreign governments.  They have become so political it‚Äôs sad.
The supreme court. More like the S. court.
You can't trust fellow criminals chief Justice.
The Republican Supreme Court is a corrupt and dishonest body  - The idea that no one is above the law is up for sale and the conservertives have cornered the market.
It terrible that the majority of the SCOTUS is slimy.
Moscow Mitch. Creep.
Reps are nothing but Confederate trash.
Six criminal's.
I bet at least two Justices made a large bundle off this vote.
"gotta give them crazy Jesus Bible thumpers due credit, cause MAN can they get stuff done. they been plotting and scheming and got it done!!

unlike democrats who just lie out their buts about Healthcare for all, free tuition for public college, maternity and paternity leave, they've done absolutely nothing."
"This is what happens when you elect a bunch of unqualified conservative judges to the highest court in the nation.  They can't even make basic decisions about the law without letting their emotions, opinions, and the people that OWN them tell them what to do."
Corrupt Clarence Thomas needs to go. Let's start there.
The Supreme Court is full of frauds.
"We are so proud of our democracy here in the US. We shout our conviction that we live in the best country in the world. When we look at the facts, we see that our democracy is railroaded by neo conservatives who weaponize the supreme court. How can we allow a political party to own our freedom? How can we allow them to hold up a legal nomination of a moderate justice so that he can be replaced with an ultra right politician? I fought and bled for our country, I thought. But now I realize I lost my youth and my health for no reason but the political aims of a morally bankrupt President. My country is sliding into third world status and nobody seems aware of it."
The conservative Supreme Court with their black robes is a corrupt court.
Free American people need to rise up most other countries in Europe fight for their rights and we need to do that
"Not exactly a bombshell. She still voted to restrict abortion rights to women. There's nudging to think about. She's the Trump of SCOTUS justices, compared with the Washington, General of Equality, RBG"
Call it what it is -- a conspiracy of parties on the Supreme Court that actively worked to overthrow settled law.
"We knew. We saw it coming. I hope the clerks, who do actually have enormous sway over the rights of US citizens,  will be vetted beyond their political attractiveness to Leo, Federalist or Heritage going forward. Congress could and should enact auditing or IG for SCOTUS staff, who are paid by tax dollars."
Total lie.
He gave us moral  absolutes that are  what our court systems agree with do not murder don't steal etc it's a crime punishable by law .
"And hope they do not decide your life is worthless too . ,God bless."
We decl care that all men are created  equal   and given  inalienable  rights the right to life  the right to Liberty  and the right  to happiness  by God .
"The Supreme Court consists of a Christian conservative majority (thanks to pressure from ex President Trump and the Christian Right Wing) now making Christian conservative decisions and opinions.
As an atheist that does not recognize the existence of the Christian god Yahweh/Jesus, I find their ruling that overturned legal abortion irrelevant."
What I'm hearing is the final decision on abortion was made long before the Court even heard the case.
It does not mean she is against repeal only it would look bad for her...
"Other than Roberts, the other 5 conservative justices are way more concerned with advancing conservative policy than being neutral arbiters of the Constitution.   To them, overturning Roe v Wade is the main reason why they were appointed.   That is what they truly believe was their job description.  Not to objectively interpret the Constitution, but to advance the conservative agenda.  As an attorney (and someone who cares deeply about the law), I find that extremely sad.   I don't even care one way or the other about abortion.  I care about the Constitution and what it means to this great country.  Stare decisis means more to me than any particular substantive issue.  I get that if legal precedent is clearly erroneous, it should be reversed as society becomes more enlightened and as certain past draconian views become obsolete/intolerable by society.  The Court in Brown v. Board of Education was right to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson (which by the way was a 9 - 0 unanimous decision, which indicates the prior decision in Plessy was clearly erroneous).  But ignoring stare decisis should never be used to go backward like in this case.   Also, ignoring stare decisis should only be done with a unanimous or near unanimous decision, not a 6-3 split like in this case where the decision is made on partisan lines."
So constitution says judge serve based on good behavior so Clarence Thomas has not behaved good so he could be impeached!!
Scouts is a breach of trust
"Clearance wife is the one who leak it!,"
"Bombshell? No new information, just a bunch of speculation based on  ""anonymous sources"" that could easily not exist. I wonder why reporters expect total trust when they have shown many times that they don't hesitate to lie ann misled based on political, economical, and social inclinations. By the way I respect Kamtor's tone, it does not seems she is trying to blow the stuff out of proportion or building a narrative."
"The Supreme Court may think they are the Boss, but they aren't & everyday goes bye, they show their backside in the wind. But the day is coming, when they will be swept aside with the other trash & the good Lord will reign. Their unjust ways will be no more..."
Direct descendants of Spanish Inquisition!
"It was nothing more than pushing a religous agenda. That is all it ever was and they have tried to overturn it for years, but did not have the majority to do it. THIS is WHY the GOP wanted Trump in."
The first thing I want is for MEN to shut up your vote came when you impregnated the Woman who is in charge of childbirth.  The LAST thing I want is a Woman to have a child who does not want a child!  Any Questions?
"NO WONDER WE STOPPED HEARING ABOUT THE LEAK. It went from being a travesty against America to ""oh well""... once it became undeniable that it was a conservative who leaked it."
Sad our highest court is owned:-(
"Person 1 : *does backflip*
Person 2 : ( who cant do backflips)  We should ban backflips lol
America in a nut shell.."
Who wants to bet the leak was Justice Alito (again) and they‚Äôll blame it on a staffer.
"Im thinking once Biden wins his second term he will add judges. We need to make our SCOTUS liberal bc the definition of being liberal is accepting and understanding ALL. Being Republican means you will judge and rule based on your religion, not for all Americans."
"The court‚Äôs decision was based on religious views, not the rights of women."
Who cares if Barrett was hesitant? In the end she did what she was picked to do; take rights away from women.
Superb work.  Great article.  I believe Alito lied and leaked so he could lock in the vote he knew he had risk of losing.
The leak came from the GOP appointed judges.
"This logic concerning Ruth and justices waiting for her death does not make sense.  She was NOT a legaly valid justice some time BEFORE her death. - requires siting for the bench , not at home where no one actualy knowes if its really even HER VOTES!!!!"
Amazing how they think more babies are going to be born. I see more birth control being used.
"Alito leaked it, clearly."
"so basically it was not a legal decision. They had already made up their minds and just wanted it to come before them so they could essentially stomp on it.
DISGUSTING!!!
I don't know how anyone could ever trust the supreme court ever again!!!"
They are all racist Crooks!!!!üíØüíØü§´ü§´ü§´ü¶â
HOW COULD 51%+ OF US CITIZENS NOT FEEL THAT SCOTUS IS A BREECH OF CONSTITUTIONAL TRUST?
"Personally, I believe that Originalism in Constitutional interpretation is as uninformed hermeneutically as Fundamentalism is in Islamic, Jewish and Christian doctrine, each is more about personal certainty and power than it is about genuine interaction with a text."
Congratulations America - you have a corrupt supreme court!
The justices should be disbanded for dishonest behavior and bribery
The conservatives supreme Court is a threat to American democracy now that they've been overturned roe v Wade they're coming for voting rights and then they're going to come for interracial marriage just you wait.  The evangelicals won't stop until we are living in a religious theocracy just like Iran.
"Notice Alito is the only one not looking at the Camera, weird."
Anybody know who the SCOTUS members are?
Wow another overhyped nothing Burger of a report from MSNBC
Sam Seder called it when it happened
"I would say vote blue but the Dems are ok with anything that's ""technically legal"" and will bend over backwards to ""reach across the isle"" no matter how many americans the republicans harm."
Abortion is manslaughter murder
Ban abortion
"SCOTIS has 6 greedy, corrupt, lying judges.   I hate those 6 judges with all my soul."
Thomas's wife was the leak - duh! I knew this within seconds of hearing happen. It is so painfully obvious.
"The right organizes.  There is a ""deep state"" of right-wing activists who have planned an end to abortion for decades.  Planned it while the left talked about ""bi-partisanship"" and ""reached across the aisle.""  It would be nice if the left recognized that it's in a fight between an open inclusive society and Christofascism."
Is anyone surprised that Kavanaugh would lie and deceive....completely consistent with his confirmation testimony.
The damage is done. Its always the people who suffer from currupt decisions ... which is politically all day every day. What says c and his besti. Please
"Prison cell for Trump, Putin, Clarence, and Rudy 2024"
"Since when under our Constitution does the SC make laws?  Oh, since we have the Roberts/Trump Court.  They don‚Äôt believe in our Constitution nor follow, their #1 job is to destroy it for a Trump dictatorship!"
Abortion is murder.
The overturning of Roe vs Wade was entirely politically and self serving.  To maintain profits the corporations need workers and consumers.  Handmaiden Tales has some truth to it.
"Laws made by men (or women) can't last forever, just like the men and women that enact them"
We should never forgive Ginsberg for not retiring under Obama.
"""Politics and power?""

No.  The politics and power grab involved the original 1970's Roe v. Wade SCOTUS decision.

The issue belongs with the states, period.  There's a big flippin' reason this is the United States of America and not the All Seeing, All Knowing, Knows what's Best for Everyone, Big Daddy switch-wielding federal government."
They have got make sure thier anti christ is born.
And this changes nothing üò¢
Honestly most surprised that a women and a black man did that to their own
"Stutter, sputter. Can't they get a guy that can speak well?"
From day one of the death of RBG I did not trust that she died of her cancer. My information at that time was that she was just getting better after some therapy. At the same time all media discussed Russian interference in U.S. elections without identifying any action of them specifically. Her death came last second for a new nomination by Trump and a possible elector boost. That was just too convenient to a possible interference with infamous Russian poisoning. My mind made this all up and  I wondered that apparently nobody else considered it. Then again I also saw January 6 coming before most other people. Anyway I remain in my belief and would appreciate if someone could give me factual information which could change my belief.
"This is all just noise. 

Doesn't matter: RvW is overturned."
The Supreme Court was never supposed to be partisan! We need to  impeach criminals in the SCOUTUS.
"It`s broken the US supreme court, NO politician shoud apoint a judge, other judge`s do that else it`s not divided and not free of politic`s... 
That`s what a normal Democrcy work`s, in the 3 branches like it`s surposed to be..."
They are garbage!
Stupidity reigns supreme in America
The supreme court‚Äôs lost all respect from the people of America
"isnt it great that a reporter will dig for news but wont give source, no one will trust me again if i tell who it was, so i am guessing the reporter just like the judges, presidents, ex predidents, senators, congress persons put their careers above the people, in this case mostly women, the lives of the people of the usa"
"I do not understand how this Supreme Court thinks they have the right to stop a woman or anybody else from murdering a child......
 Its your child and you should have the choice to murder your child.
 What a bunch of sickos in this world."
"Amy has not real opinions nor does she have the skills needed to be on the court, she was picked just to vote with the boys, she is a traitor to women!! Feel sorry for her children especially her daughters!"
VILE bunch in that thumbnail.  VILE LYING and EVIL
Women are not property anymore. Get the courts to prove that definition. It sounds like women are still being oppressed. It needs to stop.
"This issue should never have been a court issue in the first place, never out of the doctor's office and patient. But, there were billions to be made for the agenda. It only went back to the states 10th Amendment.  It was about MONEY from the get go, not health, not women, but power and MONEY."
"Judge should not be political, only interpret,"
Even Ginsburg said Rowe wasn't a valid ruling! It just passes it back to the States.
"Now that we've seen the sadistic consequences of overturning Roe, was it worth dividing the nation by your dogmatic decision?"
"CONGRESS, Not the Supreme Court needed and still needs to make the proper laws codifying the right to abortion and specifying the limits and rules that are or are not needed.  In this interview, she talks about them considering a 15 week rule and such.  THAT's NOT their job.  They are supposed to INTERPRET the existing laws.  CONGRESS needs to do their job as usual."
This is the best court the republican party could buy??
Robert's breach of trust is a good way to put it . But who's trust are you saying ? The American people trust the court anymore ?
No wonder they gave the green light for police to lie as they did the same during their Senate interviews. how much does it cost for a vote as we now know at least some of them can be bought on vacation.
"The corruption and greed of Clarence Thomas are blatant and obvious he put his gavel on sale to the highest bidder this is illegal he has betrayed the trust of every citizen and he deserves to be prosecuted and held accountable for destroying the trust the world had for the highest court in America 
VOTE BLUE üó≥ SAVE AMERICA"
To think I have respected the supreme court‚Äôs ruling most my life. Now I am not even sure if they care how rule affects the people of our country. It makes me very sad for this country. And the future of this nation.
"The Protestants were right to fear a Papist Court when Kennedy won the Presidency. The Republican-appointed are all on the take and anti-American POS! They follow Pius XII, who thought Hitler's ""final solution"" was a swell idea. They even have their own bl√∂d F√ºhrer in Trump.

This is why people are foregoing University, they don't want to become sophists like these people."
I think what we need is more old white guys in the Supreme Court. Ugh!
Neither Kamala nor any of the other pro-abortionists can answer when a fetus is considered another human being.
Stop political appointments for the Supreme Court.  Vet canidates then use a lottery system to choose the canidate.  Remove the politics and the allegiances required for the nomination.  These people should be non political and only there for one thing.  To interpret the law without bias.
I just wonder do they ever go to bed at night thinking  how their SC will be remembered in history as one of the most corrupted SC in United States History. They are the worst of the worst of humans even if they don‚Äôt believe they are the world knows they are.
"this lady is too close in. take a step back. Barret had within a matter of months declared that Roe was settled law in front of the entire country. she was hoping to put distance between her and the lie before she'd have to admit it was a lie. once the cat was out of the bag, she voted exactly how she was intended to vote all along. ain't no mystery. just an attempt to save face.
     I think the leak was a good thing. it forced their hand in time to cost them every election since. and it's going to continue to cost them every election. purple states are going to turn blue over this one, and red states are going to turn purple. we already know what the women of ohio think of it. will be interesting to see what the women of Texas will do with their own personal ""gilead"""
Pure unadulterated corruption!
Republicans nothing like having your own court
"US SCOTUS is the New World Clown Show.  When things start going down hill, it runs away from you pretty quick - FAR quicker than you guys and gals figured, ya?  (Well, some of you at least.)  Now, HOW LONG will it be an embarrassment to be a SCOTUS Justice?  I THINK they are responsible for that.  My guess is it will be for some time."
"The supreme court is not an abortion. 
Scrotus rules ok.
And can someone stop judging amy.
The kicker. 
Hows this for a fun fact (roe) not her real name is a born again christian now and doesnt believe in abortion. 
Oh america youve done it again."
"We know who did it and so do they, there is not process for investigating these black robes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Tl;dr: It was Alito... Obviously.
Oh really you don't say???? Now that you see the real cost it's costing your party you are scrambling to do something abt it shame on you you liers and thieves....
"Their GARBAGE üóë I used to respect @SCOTUS more than anything but I say there's at least 4 that need to be impeached & have great reason to back it up. Their disgusting ‚ùóÔ∏è

Also, what's the value in doing anything as far as states' rights if SCOTUS can just come right behind, with this knucklehead group that lies under oath, & undo everything you've done."
"We do not believe them in the Supreme Court, nor do we trust them. Barrett lied Kavanaugh lied and I don‚Äôt even know what to say about Thomas I wish we would get more Supreme Court justices that are fair and follow the constitution."
"Yes Supreme Court bought, paid for corrupt judges bought and paid for by billionaires and instated on Court by trump.  So of course this corrupt government will rule FOR TRUMP.
We have NO JUSTICE IN AMERICA."
"Yeah but.  He DEFINITELY,,had to get,,,ELECTED,,,sooo,,,how‚Äôs,,that working for you????  Not so good. HUH????    Well,,,that‚Äôs EXACTLY what Happens,,,when you,,CHEAT!!!!"
States can do what they want. No one stopping them.
"Well,,,Once we gain Power,,over both,,the senate and the House of Representatives,,,all will be,,OK!!!"
EXACTLY!!!
Was this really four days old or an attempt to keep abortion top of mind for the elections?
"Why is she making excuses? This is the problem, people need to stop soft peddling this nonsense and just call it as it is. Conservative Republicans did what they said they were going to do. There was no nuanced discussion or debate on abortion......"
"That‚Äôs exactly what they did!!! And they wonder why the American people see them the way they do, because that‚Äôs who they are !!"
"When that putrid curtain is pulled back, that‚Äôs behind the supreme court it‚Äôs gonna show a scared little orange man just like in the Wizard of Oz all these people have been like the flying monkeys and melania will melt"
"The abndonment of reason and logical rationality in such high legal decieons, and replaced by political manouver means the U.S.Supreme Court is no longer  a defender of legal right and truth. It is a buyable political agent of others. It has undermined its high role and besmirched itself badly. It has also galvanised huge numbers of woemn who are very angry at this intrusion into their personal liberties."
"Reporting is disingenuous,  Barrett did not switch sides, she merely acted to withhold facts from the American people."
OMG I thought that was a guy ü§£
When does a law become a crime? Cruel and unusual punishment prohibition stated in state constitution?... Medical privacy between licenced medical proffessional provider and patient and legitament decisions... Pregnacies and medical risks are not created equal and one size fits all bans or laws of an abstract ideology cannot be regulated and force non medical and political interferences.... Political malpractice and medical imposters do not protect anyone!
"So now we are giving ACB credit for being reasonable? Really? All she did was play hardball in a futile attempt to avoid being vilified for the rest of her life as a republican political patsy...but we all know thats exactly what she is otherwise her monumentally hypocritical appointment in the last days of a failed republican presidency wouldnt have happened in the first place. She deserves credit for being politically savvy...not for being reasoned and impartial. Her placement on the court is as corrupt and illegitimate as Kavanagh and Gorsuch, even if she didnt exactly lie under oath as they did. She prevaricated better than they did because she is smarter than they are. So call her what she is ..an extreme maga political activist who will go down in history as a traitor to women and a lynchpin of the movement to destroy american democracy. Because lets face it..women are the canaries in the coal mine anywhere and any time authoritarianism is on the rise. Gimme a break."
ONE MAJOR PROBLEM  WE THE PEOPLE HAVE E-UH WE DO NOT HAVE ENUFF N WORDS AS JUDGES ON THE SCOTUS! ESPECIALLY FEMALE N WORDS!!
"A known billionaire is sucking up to these Republicans and they all know that eventually they will be rewarded for their actions in helping the ultra right wing dangerous morons. Not directly, as they know they can be traced, but it will happen...one, along with his wife, is already getting a lot of money just because he threatened to leave this phony court and be replaced by a Democrat...it's a strange justice department, this highest court, filled with quid pro quo people, all on the right."
If they want to complain about a breach of trust perhaps they should look at themselves and how the American people cannot trust them. It's time to change things up in that old lying supreme court.
How can a SC nominee tell Congress on their confirmation say RvW is settled law then turn around and and say RvW is unconstitutional?  Says a lot about lying justices and a lazy Congress.
Let me guess. It was Trump's fault in the end
Murder is bad
"There's no ""bombshell"" it's just a stupid who caresshell"

"Nevermind the fact that roe was decided far too broadly.  ""Roe ventured too far in the change it ordered and presented an incomplete justification for its action"". -RBG"
This edition of the supreme court is an abortion. A LEGAL ABORTION. Stare decisis be damned.
"I wonder who could have possibly leaked this opinion ‚Ä¶ ü§î

Schmarence Schmomas. ü§´

We first heard about how  SCOTUS planned to rule in a leak from Congress‚Äô Hateful Eight. Everyone also knows which Justice has the strongest, or at least the most obvious, ties to MAGA."
Ginsburg did the country a disservice by not retiring when a Democrat was in The White House.
So why those justice can lie during confirmation and has no consequences???
Republikkkans hate Americans
Thank you to The New York Times! üíôüíôüíô
The breach of trust was them lying in their questioning at their vote to be a judge
"Psalm 139:13-16

"Roberts was so interested in investigating the leak. And then nothing.

He found the leak and didn't want admit it was a conservative justice or staffer"
The way I see it a few of the SCOTUS lied under oath and set precedent for all to be able to lie under oath and face no consequences.
She was a worthless guest. She gave no meaningful information.
Such a surprise that Kavanaugh is playing fast and loose with his role.... said NOBODYüôÑ
"MSNBC: I continue to wish you were better. News speaks for itself, let influencers pretend the public needs to be emotionally charged to click on their videos. 'Bombshell' is opinion, the story is real.. let it be. When you stop sucking, I'll tune in."
This is the most corrupt & classless SC we've ever had
"Jodi Kanter seems to be trying very hard to make the story about Barrett's decision, but I'm with Chris Hayes here, the real story is that they tried to do this as quickly as possible after RGB's death while trying very hard to make it look like they weren't."
Lester Holt can you answer Vivek's question.  Why did you lie to America.  Why are you fake news. Vivek exposed msnbc and it has yet to defend itself from the allegations.
Judge dies and then they over turn Roe v. Wade? There's a movie they killed the judges they may want to watch - The Pelican Brief.
MSNBC IS THE ENEMY OF AMERICA
Gee ya suppose Gini Thomas had anything to do with that leak?
Oh it was settled alright. Should‚Äôve dug a little deeper and asked them to explain more. Classic doublespeak.
"I don't care about the leak, I care about the decision to overturn roe v wade."
"You forgot to mention that Justice Ginsberg supported the relitigation of Roe because it was flawed and was not decided on the text of the Constitution. That was obviously true as many other recognized legal and constitutional experts had said the same thing for many years and decades. There is a strong case to be made that the issue should be legislated by congress and not 9 members of the court, but congress has still not passed a law on making abortion legal which shows that Roe was not ""settled law"". Why doesn't the legislature carry out their constutional role and responsibility to pass a law? This has caused a great deal of public unrest since Roe was decided."
"So I‚Äôve noticed something.. all these people were worried about how they would look, but no one even considered how it would affect people."
"Alito is the chief person of interest, hands down! 
I, like many Americans, have lost confidence in the SCOTUS. I‚Äôve always believed the SCOTUS was concerned about protecting the rights of our citizens‚Ä¶ Sadly, I‚Äôm no longer of that opinion!"
Why is it saying this is 3 days old?
"There was never a ""right to abortion"", there was a right to privacy on the issue of abortion.   That was what Roe decided.    In another case, the Court decided to limit abortion on viable fetuses.     Now, they changed their mind - protecting a baby's life is indeed a function of the government and overruled Roe.

Bottom line, the liberals did it to themselves.   They just had to have later and later abortions for perfectly viable babies, then babies born alive then murdered on the operating table, then harvesting organs.   Despicable act after despicable act from abortion providers was the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back."
What happened to the Supreme Court not being anti-American? The breach of trust is the fact that the Supreme Court has been guilty of openly attacking Americans 24/7/365 since the decision to abolish Roe was announced. The leaker is the only person involved not guilty of attacking the American people.
"About Barrett: No it doesn‚Äôt, there is nothing profound or fascinating"
"Regardless of the excuses given, the reality is that this extremely conservative Supreme Court is poised to deprive women in this country of their inherent rights under the U.S. Constitution. This Supreme Court has unequivocally shown itself to be deeply corrupt, willfully negligent, and a threat to the nation. Period. When the highest court in the land engages in bribery and attempts to self-regulate its own corrupt ethics, the entire country will inevitably face the resultant consequences."
The most corrupt branch of government
"dred scott was once considered settled law.  it's horrible they overturned rvw, but nobody should consider any decision irreversible, especially now that dobbs is on the books."
"There is gun control. With gun control, nobody blames the target. So men have the bullets, (sperm), yet woman are controlled by ‚Äúsaid bullet/gun holder‚Äù."
They fined the doctor that performed an abortion on a 10 year old r@pe victim. One of the politicians even going as far as to say she should have been forced to give birth. Are you really surprised. If that was your daughter would you force her to have the child? Would you stay home to care for the newborn as the 11 year old mother repeats 5th grade ?
Republicans thought overturning Roe would help them win elections. They were very wrong about that
So who leaked it?
"Playing with America based on their affiliation to the GOP Party! Without the Leak and this investigative reporting after the mess. We now see that someone interfered all along. So my remedy is to replace every justice that Trump appointed since it was illegal how he got into office and why he's sitting in a courtroom today. If the Founders of the Constitution didn't see this crap happening, then we need to Amend the Constitution to cross-correct these corrupt individuals. We have to put America back on track for the People, not these politicians or career-driven people like George Santos and Clarence Thomas are great examples."
"It‚Äôs intellectually disingenuous to say that news of a deliberation locks you into a position you weren‚Äôt already locked into.
I highly doubt the leak cemented anyone‚Äôs position."
"Old racist white supremacist judges are totally ignorant and DO NOT care about the reality of a woman who DOES NOT want to raise a child 18 years without financial support from the father just because of a one night stand of 5 minutes. They are bastardized in their 1950 view that all women seeking an abortion are happily married and have money to care for a baby. NO. Women/teenagers have UNWANTED pregnancies because there are NO women's clinics for low income women to get birth control. This causes a strain on foster homes. The adoption legal fees are $30-50,000."
In peoples eyes . God always shows mercy to the repentant  soul .
The other sometimes a unremorsefull person being served justice  .
"I don't understand why it's a problem that the trust of conservative SC justices has been breached when you consider that they've lied to us about their intention to not overturn Roe v Wade, and they've violated ethics standards like taking bribes from people whose cases they're presiding over.  The SC tried to hide the decision from the public.  and the leak breached THEIR trust.  No, our trust in the conservative justices has been breached, egregiously."
"The US doesn‚Äôt want to do anything to protect their kids from getting shot at schools, so they‚Äôll just replace them with unwanted children. Great job."
RGBs legacy will always be colored for me by her inability to make the choice to step down during Obama's last term and keep us from being in this situation.
"Lester Holt uses ""bombshell"" as often I use ""hi"". He sure can read a teleprompter, he reads the 48 Hours script as if he were doing the Nightly News, same writers I bet."
What a disgraceful SCOTUS‚Ä¶
MSM bombshells are hilarious.
MERICA!
So most likely it was a Republican that leaked...
Why aren't more people talking about this new part of the story?
"imagine being so overly ""fair"" that you ignore and obfuscate the blatant truth. It was done for political reasons. There was no ""oh well this makes it look like it was possibly done for political reasons."" are you stupid or scared? Because it's like saying the earth ""could be round"""
My body! My Choice!
"The votes against Roe v. Wade were planned from the start, that's why this was kept hidden, not because of this woman's fantasy that maybe the conservatives would have voted against conservatism if they'd just been allowed to do their secret process in peace. It's insulting to all the people affected by the court's behavior to say that these judges might have done ANYTHING but stick to their plan"
"All of this being said, will the right of a woman to control her own body in the united states of america?"
The Shady Six are not law scholars. They're far right political activists holding two stolen seats hostage.
"Huh, how's that investigation going??  Will there be a report anytime soon?? It's been well over a year now. Or did they not like the answer."
"Barrett's gesture to vote to not take the case was just empty theatre.  She knew as well as anyone they had the votes to take it without her.  It gives her the opportunity to say that she ""did the right thing"".

She didn't recuse herself when they ended up taking it."
There was a big foardian slip right ther.
We need better ethics oversight of the court.
All of them are liers
"Say anything about it you want.
Everyone knows that it was a progressive person who leaked it.
Hoping they could force them to change their Decision.

"every headline has to have bombshell, shocking, blasts in it - constant violent imagery, so American."
SCOTUS is CORRUPT
"The Supreme court wants us to respect them and trust them. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in my opinion the last of her kind. They waited until she passed away and then spit and peed all over her grave by overturning Roe vs Wade. So...were those lavish gifts that non of us could dream of affording, Kickbacks or bribes? I'm sure they were both. So now here we are, and they expect us to trust them with the integrity of democracy and the Constitution. You say it was only one supreme court judge that accepted these gifts for rulings or was her just the one who got caught. The people are watching"
"Poopaganda üí©

Abolish Human Abortion!
"Republicans are the American version of the Taliban.

Women are things."
"All of this comes down to the 2016 election (and McConnell blocking Merrick Garland).  Had HRC just won, this wouldn't be a thing.  Hillary cost the country Roe.  I hope she realizes that.  Her utter failure as a candidate has had a decades long, negative impact to the country."
"What I don't understand, is why the Democrats don't apply the law to the Supreme Court justices. We know for a fact there is no doubt that these people lied to the United States congress in order to get these positions. The law says if they lie to the United States Senate and House of representatives, that they have committed perjury, and they should be impeached."
"The fact that they are appointed by the politicians means they are political. 
All supreme Court appointees should be hired and fired by their peers"
"It means nothing.  I hate that reporters try to romanticize this stuff.  They wanted to overturn it, so they did.  That's it, that's all.  It was a 40+ year long game they played and we let them win. 

I'm still side eyeing RBG because she should have retired when a Dem was president but she put her stock in Hillary and this is where we are."
At what point are enough white people without so much money hurt enough that they get fed up with this corrupt court and the corrupt GOP?üòÇ
"An 'investigative reporter' thinks 'Publicans can be swayed.

I think she needs to go continue investigating."
Obama failed when he rolled-over on his nomination. Justice Ginsberg failed to retire at an appropriate time.
You mean the Supreme POTUS did something inappropriate and ethical? So what?
How sad is the legal profession as a whole when members of the SUPREME COURT are PROVEN LIARS....... just pathetic.
"""Inappropriate and intended to interfere in the process"" just when Justice Breyer was considering joining the liberal 15 week ban. This strengthens my point that Justice Alito was responsible for the leak. It ""cemented"" the votes to Alito's advantage."
The reason Democracy is difficult though is that there is so much corruption  here that occurs with the voting...and it opens every single one of you up to coups...so...I would get a feel from what a country needs and make sure their people like it and put them in there...also some regions need much stronger staying power in terms of leadership to prevent war and couping and conflict...so for those regions like the middle east I would have a different approach...for their own good.  Its not about oppressing their people its about securing their security so we don't everyone attacking and going after one another like its a hobby.  I really hate ongoing war.  Its horrific. This place doesn't spin on suffering.  The suffering and rampant abuse must stop.  It must stop.  Universal income is the quickest way to do that.  No social scores just give it out flat $3500/ month to everyone on the planet.  Take away from those with over a billion as no one needs that much and redistribute.  It's not that hard.  We start there.
why are these SC judges appointed for life ?
"They ( the court) w a super theocratic fascist majority representation  of ,in just the court‚Ä¶.. represents the minority in of the American 
public opinion‚Ä¶. This is  the virtual end of trust in the SC."
"On the Supreme Court‚Äôs Dobbs leak, many of us floated the ‚Äúhe who smelt it dealt it‚Äù theory that Alito might‚Äôve done it himself.
And the fact that SCOTUS dropped the investigation advocated by people who said the leak destroyed the Court and none of them have objected adds to that."
"Why are we paying more attention to the leak than we are to the fact that Kavanaugh and Barrett both said that Roe was settled law and they wouldn‚Äôt overturn it. 

They lied. How can you trust the integrity of a SC justice that lies to get their job?"
"What does Barrett's not wanting to take the case--but still voting with the majority--mean? It means that, far from giving a crap about the law, she cares only about her own optics, and she wanted to pretend, in line with her (and Kavanaugh's, and Gosuch's) fake Senate testimony that she considered Roe settled law, that she was objective on the issue."
"From this I draw the conclusion that SCOTUS had already come to a decision before hearing the facts. In effect, the justices were governing rather than arbitrating. Clearly the SCOTUS needs to be saddled with the SJOTUS: Supreme Jury Of The United States to prevent them from governing and restrict them to arbitration."
"The Supreme Court has a problem. Their name, I believe it has gone to their heads. They need more defined rules and term limits. And I never understood why Ruth didn't step down. Maybe Supreme went to her head."
The confirmation hearings are a joke - what is the legal purpose of the confirmation hearings if the nominated (and approved) judges cannot be held accountable to their sworn statements?
"""Breach of trust"": Funny, coming from right-wing members of SCOTUS."
That branch of government is disgraceful. Zero ethics and zero accountability.
"So, politically speaking, the three levels of government are the house, the senate, and the supreme court.
That‚Äôs what happens when law takes a back seat to politics."
"SCOTUS, the highest judges money can buy."
The leak shows the deceiving
They waited for ruth to die.  No woman is safe with those judges
I understand üòº
"What are MSNBC, CNN, and other left wing outlets trying to do to our country. The Roe law was sent back to the states for people to vote on rather than have the federal gov't telling us what to do. The left still believe in Korematsu v. United States 1944 and other destruction of civil liberties like DEI. Why is it that the left wants to have the federal gov't dictate our lives, I believe in freedom not fascism."
Possibly the last sitting Supreme Court. It‚Äôs no wonder this country turned naxi.
No surprise here.

"Tired of men making choices about our body, health & reproduction."
Another ‚Äòbombshell‚Äô headline. Just reporting the news. Not being hyperbolic (and hackneyed).
What I also find concerning is that the anti abortion justices make a decision against abortion before debate and thoughtful consideration of the will of the public. In the end it clearly is a political decision.
"I'm appalled, among many many others across the civilised world,  at aspects of this whole issue and how it is dealt with in your country. On both sides of it. First of all the way women in favour of it as a necessary part of certain aspects of women's  improved medical care and also choice of whether they should be pregnant or not, in often very appalling circumstances. are pirtrayed, and behave, with frankly OTTcheering etc undignifies and trivialises the whole scenario. It does wo m en no service bbc whatsoever.Also the business of the unbalanced political bias of SCOTUS which defies commmon sense. Surely it should always be a balanced set up? Especially as the appointments are for life. How is this never sorted out? Mass public hysteria seems to rule the roost across the justice board on so many issues that require clear, non- emotiional responses at every level. Deplorable , all round."
the supreme court is corrupt and owned by the super wealthy and maga republicans. term limits for the corrupt court six years limit and can not run again.
they already made the decision amongst themselves to overturn RVW before they case was before the court. that is proof that the court is corrupt and the judges involved in overturning RVW should be impeached and disbarred and most likely criminally charged with conspiracy and corruption. they already sold their votes and accepted bribes. but congress will defend the american people from these criminals. this is what the criminals in congress wanted and they support these criminals on the bench.
Republican rats
2:16 - It may look that this is about politics and power. Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat? It MAY? They are appointed by politicians who listen to lobbyists. It's all political!
1:55 lol. The passing of justices helps refresh the law. Like 4 times a century?
Jive bull crap! Trump is trying to be Dictator of the Greatest Democratic Government Ever! The Reick publicant party is DEAD !
"Iti is their bodies. You self-righteous fools have no say! If we wat to be controlled by ignorance & fear, we will go to a church of our choice!  Dose Not belong in Government!"
The ignorance of most of the lefty replies is breathtaking.
SCOTUS is corrupt and illegitimate until all that lied during their confirmation hearing are removed from the bench.
Don‚Äôt count on these Trump shills to hold the line when it comes to putting the orange cancer in prison.
"Justice Roberts, do your job!  Alito and his three stooges and both Thomas's are liar's and cheater's taking our rights away and country backwards! Church and State must be separate once and for all or tax churches now!"
Barrett is the same backstabbing gal as in the show Ozark.
Imagine taking away rights and and the people that are always saying their rights are being taken away cheer for it.....
The female justices are the only ones with any backbone and morals.
"If the gallows sat outside each home of SCOTUS‚Ä¶ maybe then they would stop leaning over to the side of white Isis /MAGA‚Ä¶.

"When a document that was going to be released anyway gets leaked: This is a breach of trust! We must investigate!
When Clarence Thomas has been accepting very expensive gifts from a Mein Kampf-loving billionaire for many years: *crickets*"
"Root out the Federalist Supreme Court Justices.  We will never have a balanced court with them on the bench. In addition, there have been, for example, so many times when Clarence Thomas should have recused himself when having a conflict of interest, and he did not. They operate at their own will and ideology and even if we are able to purge Trrump, we will still have remnants of his appointees left making the rulings. To give life-time appointments seems not the way to go because you get stuck in their ideological rigidity and resistance."
Today's supreme Court does not represent Even .:0000001 percent of the American people it is no more than a political cult. A  right wing political cult elected by less than 1% of temporary and career politicians who are also on their way to become billionaires through mysterious means?
Whoever the leaker is needs to be charged.
"I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt buy that the leak cemented a position. That‚Äôs a very convenient excuse, but the deliberative process cannot change bad faith. 
The second the US SC decided to relitigate a closed decision with 85+% public support, they lost all credibility. 

And to say ‚Äúthe leak forced us to double down‚Äù is like saying ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs ok that my kid lied to my face; I busted them and maybe they‚Äôd have changed their mind and come clean‚Äù. 

Why are we expecting honesty from the corrupt?"
Thomas is a crooked crimal and he should not cover cing  any thing
They're a bunch of corrupt rightwing liars in this court!
"Blah blah blah
Decision was reversed
Deal with it"
This is what you get for keeping unencrypted memos laying around on their Windows 10 desktops. They make for great influence tools to use. Especially when you hack the judges by weaponizing their individual beliefs against them to plant a trojan.
"The last 3 scj should be removed. 

They lied to get the jobs."
all these old corrupt people deciding a woman's rights is fricken nuts.  non are without sins
"Isn't it pritty disturbing to think the highest court in the land,  can't be trusted."
"I‚Äôve heard this journalist on NPR and now MSNBC. I‚Äôm left more irritated each time. It appears as if she‚Äôs suggesting the leak potentially caused this outcome or that the justices had no other choice but to stop negotiating. Can we do a deeper dive and ask why they took up this case in the first place? What superficial and lazy investigating. Blaming the leak, even suggesting it, for their ultimate choices? Give me a break."
"Term limits and appointed by national popular vote of 60% or better. A president should still be allowed to appoint these judges, but the nation should be allowed the final vote. It's wrong that a tiny handful of individuals are allowed to determine national law for all. They effectively have more power than any other branch of government as well as the populace. It creates an institution dedicated to upholding corruption."
It will come out that one of Conservative justices leaked the case themselves to cement the votes against Roe. However I have lost all confidence in SCOTUS.
Get your sports equipment armor and face paint ready. The man made apocalypse is coming.
This is what happens when Dems take their eye off the ball on the long game. Biden is up for reelection and the team is wringing their hands about him when they know the alternative will be Trump. Show up and vote or see what else you lose.
Supreme CLOWN COURT     Impeach Thomas  and the three  clowns that lied under oath saying they wouldn‚Äôt over turn ROE V WADE
I have even less respect for Barrett now. She cares even more about political optics than taking away women‚Äôs rights. Wow!
Everyone knows it was one of the left wing justices
If Trump never got elected. None of this BS would never have happened.. disgusting.
Roberts calls a breach of trust. The whole Supreme Court has been a breach of trust to the American people.
Refuse for what? She knew what her opinion was going to be. Sounds like grandstanding to me.
"""Conservatives"" is now the most disgusting word in English language."
It's simpler than all this.  Trump stacked the court. Case closed. (It all goes back to the votes)
It was Ginni Thomas and it was deliberate
These people clearly bad ! Why are they elected for life that is insane. We all know now Anita Hill was right and Thomas is a freak. Then you got lying Amy and black face judge really?  Laughable
Clarginia Thomas do the right thing and recuse.
Disgusting supreme court‚Äôs justices SHAME SHAME
End of an Empire‚Ä¶ corruption at our Supreme Court üò¢
To the supreme Court
Why would it be OK for the justices to discuss cases outside of deliberations when jurors are told to never do that while a matter was pending?
"I don‚Äôt get it; you have more guns in the USA than citizens‚Äî men, women and children‚Äî yet no one is prepared to ‚Äútake  arms against a sea of troubles‚Äù?"

"SC = Supremely Corrupt, Roberts has sold the US democracy to the Highest bidder with ""Citizens United"" and sat around knowing all the while his colleagues are taking bribes from billionaires. He should be tried for treason and corruption. It's only a matter of time before we find out what he's been taking under the table and his false indignation is sickening"
"Happened so methodically that I I even suggested on Fb that could Justice G's death have been... hastened? It's enough that Thomas is still on the bench as crooked, greedy, and bought that he is. SCOTUS is sadly political and sloppy. I can't respect it anymore."
"Yes , there's the root cause of all our problems

They all collect a paycheck on violating our rights

OK I'm gonna guess that Alito leaked the draft opinion and that the Republican justices were all in on overturning Roe v Wade and were searching around for a vehicle to do it. Now I'm going to listen to the clip.
"This is why other countries no longer look up to the US as a role model, it's politics has become trash."
"They are all deceitful duplicitous, disingenuous, and despicable."
"Hopefully, the Democrats can take power in Congress, then they can draft a bill, that makes Supreme Court justices accountable as other non-justices are.  What applies to normal judges should apply to Supreme Court justices.  It should include that any Supreme Court justice found to be corrupt will automatically be removed from his position and indicted for corruption and have a minimum mandatory jail term of 10 years, with assets ceased in remuneration of their corruption."
There was a good chance that RGB would have voted to overturn it anyway. She was on record saying she would have never voted in favor of Roe and she thought it was a bad ruling.
Was Alito or someone affiliated with him the leaker?
The leak was only inappropriate when they got caught
"In Canada, there is a requirement that all judges, at whatever level, must retire at age 75. That may not be the right age, perhaps could be older, but it makes for way more rejuvenation of the judiciary that in the US, where judges, whether liberal or conservative, can hang on until they become a bit senile. That results in a much less politically perceived judiciary than in the US."
"Why are those for abortion parents didn't believe in abortion.   At least, in their case."
Trump found three judges willing to lie under oath.
In what imagination of the universe is it correct for the minority to dictate the right of the majority?
Who else was thinking jodie was a dude till she started talking?????

A puff piece on Justice Barrett? Wow. Why? I am going to say this is allegedly the truth. Allegedly.
Get these judges out of my doctor's office! Get this government out of my pharmacy!
"Kavanagh and others, during their confirmation hearings, all said that Roe V Wade was ""settled law"" and that that was that. Turns out they were all full of crap."
"""Abortion Leak""üòÑ... I'm sorry, that sounds terrible ü§£"
"The breach of trust was the Supreme Court overturning, roe v wade itself like excuse me üòÆ"
"To me, the most obvious and important point that is constantly overlooked is how blatantly the last 3 'justices' flat-out lied to Congress.  They all swore that they had no predetermined intent to overturn Roe, Swore up and down that ""if"" given the case, they would make their decision solely on the case presented.  They all gave this impression under oath to Congress.    If lying to Congress to get past the required screening process so you can do exactly what you truly were intent on doing, if that isn't an impeachable offense, I can't imagine what else would be.  
Then there's the other two prize-winners; clearly in the pockets of rich special interests that they then sit in judgement on cases involving them.  How is THIS not impeachable?    
I'm not pointing a finger at them because they are on one particular political party or the other.  Only in that their actions are, at minimum, a disgrace to the office of SUPREME Court.  ""Supreme"" suggests that these should be the best-of-the-best.  Turns out their just corrupt politicians just like the rest."
Get the government out of my doctor‚Äôs office!

"I suppose the next thing to bring women under control  is to send them to jail to protect them from gender based violence, like the Taliban is doing in Afghanistan"
Who said Trump never got anything done.
This is a pointless story. Once they made their ruling we knew how they felt.
"@MSNBC This story would be MUCH easier to understand if they would quit using future tense while talking about the past. ""What happens next,"" means it hasn't happened yet. Other times they were using present-tense verbs. That is confusing, and I am well educated. If this usage is mildly, momentarily distracting to me, it will likely make it hard for others to understand at all. Use past tense verbs, please."
Bruh she is placing blame on the leak instead of allowing SUPREME COURT JUSTICES OF THE UNITED STATES to be accountable adults
Don‚Äôt we have a system or checks and balances? Why aren‚Äôt these judges being punished?
"I think it is political.  Thomas needs to be kicked off the court, he is a crook.  Kavanaugh  is a liar and a pos.  These men need to have their viagra taken away."

"more national enquirer reporting from msnbc, time waisted here."
Abortion is murder and needs to be banned.
isn't the removal of roe vs. wade a breach of trust as well?
"Bottom line all is that all of them need to be removed from the court, totally corrupt court without doubt!"
"Here‚Äôs the thing.  It has become obvious that these Supreme Court justices have their fingers in many pies.  The corruption of quite a few of them has become public knowledge.  After this piece of information regarding Roe vs Wade has now been revealed it is my opinion that the public trust has been even more damaged, and possibly irrevocably so.  At least for these far right justices.  With that in mind I would think all of these justices should be painfully aware that their decision on whether trump, or anyone else for that matter, including themselves, is above the law.  Their corrupt actions may have hidden for decades, but the truth will always out.  Should trump be ‚Äògifted‚Äô  with the title, ‚Äòabove the law‚Äô, and he gets back into the Oval Office, he will inevitable proclaim himself Monarch/King and with complete power have the ability to denounce/disband SCOTUS, if not for their redundancy alone, then for their actions in dismissing his cases or their decisions on ruling against him.  Then they will have no cover at all against trump‚Äòs vindictive, hateful, destructive decisions.  For him, throwing the judicial system into utter chaos would be just another day at the golf course for him.  Beware the easy path; inclinations become slippery slopes that may lead to hungry alligators in a pit at the bottom."
Decisions about reproduction should be made by people of reproductive age.
"This report is the first time I have heard why a Supreme Court leak is important and yet its importance had to be stressed by Jodi Kantor.  Granted, Chris Hayes already gets it, but for the rest of us, I am thankful Jodi Kantor emphasized that a Supreme Court leak makes it very difficult for any of the justices to change how they would decide.  As I understand this, during the deliberation process of the justices, as they tentatively state their positions, assuming they will still be able to change their ultimate decisions, an insider may leak an interim point wherein the leaker's desired outcome would be met if this interim point were the final decision.  Thus, by leaking this interim point, the leaker makes it very difficult for any of the justices to change their interim position when making their final decision."
Dear Supreme Court: Human biology and best medical practice don‚Äôt differ state to state.  Your Dobbs decision was ignorant and arrogant.

Abortion is with the states where it belongs.
"lol ""It can look like politics and power instead of legal reasoning"" - yeah, no duh, Amy. You're an illegitimate court."
"The least legitimate, least informed, least morale Supreme Court in several generations of the United States of America. It's shameful. Hope Roberts is proud of his legacy leading the worst, most corrupt court - perhaps in history."
"lol John Roberts‚Äô ‚Äúbreach of trust‚Äù comment is absurd, given it turned out to be a real trickster move and given the times John Roberts has breached trust with the American people, such as Citizens United and Rowe v. Wade."
"One of the Great Mistakes of this court! This is what happens when the Gop catches the car. There were reasons all the other courts upheld Roe v Wade, and they were wise enough to see what the fallout would be. Which shows just how Wise this present court is."
Republicans are evil
"Term limits.

How do we do this?"
Why on earth do judges on the SCOTUS have lifetime powers to shape America according to their own politics? Even a President can only serve 2 terms. It is plainly stupid and as the Judges age they will lose contact with the changes in culture that happen over decades. The law should adapt to the times not live in the past.
"I think we need to ignore political lines with this issue .  The first 40 years of my life I was comfortably pro-choice.  Birth control has come an extremely long way and options today make it very easy for the majority of people to never have an unwanted pregnancy. Minus risk to the mother or an extreme situation,  abortion in today‚Äôs day and age is just callous. Abortion is not birth control."

"It's funny that pro life people also complain about social aid. If we dont have unwanted children in our society,  we won't have to spend as much on social aid. We should encouraged,  and sometimes mandate this for certain groups of people like chemically dependent people, those on state aid, and people who are here illegally."
"Every judge is a politician in black ropes, exercising their bias and prejudice !"
"This IS ALL about politics! This IS about timing! And after justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg's passing, Donald Trump and Republicans moved VERY fast! In getting their justice's ALL IN, with overturning Roe vs. Wade! I hope voters are seeing and understanding how Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans, can basically take away our rights! The voting rights sequence should hopefully be investigated! A vote for Donald Trump, is a vote for authoritarian, dictatorship! A vote for Donald Trump, is a vote for supporting Vladimir Putin!"
This shows what happens when a foreign entity ( Catholic Church dictatorship) theology is allowed to run our democracy...
Looks like someone did something really inappropriate (trying to influence members of the court). YA THINK?
A lot of this mischief could be prevented in the future by a law or amendment deciding that SCOTUS jurisprudence become part of the codex of laws of the US and can not be reversed by SCOTUS itself but only by a Law of Congress or an amendment to the Constitution. That would also diminish the political power of the court somewhat. It would have made Dobbs impossible if it had been in effect previously.
TERM LIMITS! ESPECIALLY THE SCOTUS!
The new ethical judicial behavioral code the Supreme Court wrote for themselves without any monitoring or enforcement  apparatus is such garbage. So incredibly bogus.
The Supreme Court talking about a breach of trust is hilarious!! Irony
FREE WILL  üòá
What? I thought that they had already dismantled it.
The only breach of trust is that from the supreme court!!!! I trust them zero!
"Whooooo caaaares!

Just agree and move on.... to overturning Heller!

By the same wording on the ruling see you later Heller!"
"The Supreme Court should be the most transparent of all. It is literally our last line of justice, hiding things is inappropriate. It should be Supremely fair, open and right, not secret and questionable. People need to know why they are deciding the way they are. Everything should be based solely on the Constitution and what the public wants. (For the people by the people and of the people) Maybe we would be better off with AI deciding based on the Constitution, It wouldn't use feelings or beliefs to decide, just facts. It also couldn't be bought off!"
Also good that MSNBC is keeping this subject front and center. It will cripple Republicans in 2024.
"""Supreme"" Court? A contradiction in terms. These people are a medieval throwback."
"No different than royalty in olde Europe. Minute laws and punishments for the peasants, vague rules with little over sight for those up the candle."
"If thats true, Amy Berret has to be impeached and replaced by a real conservative justice."
The Supreme Court is POLITICAL.  Five justices owe their appointment to the ultra conservative Federalist Society.  They are all a disgrace in so many ways.
Barrett just wanted to delay the blowback of her lying in confirmation.

The supreme Court is all about partisan politics and Evangelical Christianity!! And let's not forget about bribery from billionaires!!
Sick party
Why do people care if a stranger gets an abortion or not? Like dude get a job. A hobby. Anything lol.
Sounds like damage control...
"It should be up to each woman if they  want an abortion. It's their body, their mind, and their heart.
  Too take away someone rights and free will is wrong. What will be next? Band birth control for  women. If you start taking away the free rights to control your life.
   Then we will lose in time all free rights to decide for ourselves. 
 We will  be under a government rule state."
I don‚Äôt like opinion in the news. Fix it minions.
Abortion is going to happen legal or not. Keep the squrty end out.
"listen ... plz to the last thing she mentions ... to me she almost reveals, what judge makes the leak. 100% sure thge lkeak come from a judge that got scared of the 15 week ban (that most of Europe have, but wanted Roe overturned, wanted the States to ban it.
I remember there was accusations of 'leftist judges was the ones who leaked' I bet to differ ... I would love to know more about this ..."
"What does that abortion rule do for a woman's first amendment, or don't they have one."
Reason???? Is there any reason on the Court?
The supreme court should have age and term limits.
Vote Marianne Williamson president 2024.  Give her a chance to debate.

Supreme Court justices should have term limits and so should senators and any other political entity 8 years and no more than 8 years for any one of them.
Get rid of the courts
"The more I think about it,  chief Justice Roberts has lost control of ghe supreme court and is no chief Justice by any means."
It's dangerous you gamble with one .
No abortion is safe .
It's a matter of  being more morally sound and accountable to prevent them. Alot of women have died from botched abortions too most drs do thüò¢em for money only .
Our democracy is already gone  in this country . The corruption of this supreme court is disgusting !
Why are people not trying to get birth control to prevent unwanted  pregnancies .
"A breach of trust‚ÄΩ  @John Roberts: Just who do you think you can trust?  One thing is for sure, _you_ are not trusted.  In fact, your corrupt SCOTUS is held in well deserved contempt."
All I can say is Men fighting so hard to keep women pregnant is all we need to know and exactly why they have no business making medical and life decisions for us. ü§¨
"Supreme Court political ideological GHOULS??? Hard to believe a person could reached the pinnacle of Judicial authority,  and not understand that judges are supposed to be unbiased by their own subjective leanings!!"
"Chris Hayes is a stuttering mess. Please MSNBC, invest in some speech classes for him. You could probably write it off on your taxes."
The women's rights have to be respected.
At this point of SCOUS could we even believe the leak investigation? They have shown their own ethics to be in question üò¢
What happened to separation of church and state . Shame on them all abortion is healthcare not up for debate by religious zealots
Nice group portrait there-the Judicial Division of the Republican Party. Politicised and compromised
Christians are destroying America.
We need to have term limits for Supreme Court Justices... In my personal opinion we should have never given lifetime terms for any of our government positions with such power and magnitude over the people of our nation. DUH!!!
The ruling is that it is up to each individual state.
Opus Dei uber alles.
Women in Texas and Oklahoma now live under the same religious laws as women in Syria and Libya.  The GOP want all American women to live and die under those same laws.
It must be very hard for every woman to have an abortion. A decision that will have the effect of a lifetime. But is was her own right to do. To find peace and the power to continue.
"Justices are politicians too‚Äîcorrupted politicians. You don‚Äôt change the devil, the devil changes you.  Money and favors grant access and access influences policy.   Internal accountability is not possible."
"The question is they all said at their conformation that they wouldn't overturn Roe.
Ethics seem to be a major problem for our Supreme Court Justices. 
They lied to get the seat and are being bought by the very people who are against Roe."
"Supremely corrupt. NO lifetime terms, self policing or secret anything! The whole setup is deeply flawed & ripe for going sideways. It did, so it's time for reform = least complicated fact."
So they did an entire story just to say they don‚Äôt know what happened?
"They need to stop the LIE'S they planned this a head of time, anyone that can't see them for what they are is blind. The people of the United States of America are in trouble big trouble this our COUNTRY and we been sold out. The whole world watching."
Maybe you'd be happier in a communist country try moving to one .

"Every time I hear ""Justice Kavanaugh"" I wonder Justice Kennedy stepping down and giving trump this liar."
SCROTUS
"If the American people wish to know the history of  little corrupt secrets of SCOTUS, then buy the Case Against the Supreme Court, by Law Professor Chereminsky. Especially, in the 1920, or at the turn of the 20th Century regarding Child Labor. I think even Charles Chaplin has a movie and took a stand regarding robing, stealing, thefting the childhood of little Americans to satiate the suply and demand of workers for big Corporations! Yes, Justice Robing Barons legalizing corruption!!!"
"This entire story is BS, clearly her sources are from Roberts office. Trying to paint him as trying to save Roe but the leak messed everything up. FOH, they had every intention of overturning roe and his descent was just symbolic because he doesn‚Äôt want the court to look partisan."
Sounds like politics as usual! I thought the supreme Court was not supposed to do that? I know I don't have enough knowledge to speak about this in depth. But all I can say is it seems like they're doing the same thing that Republicans and Democrats are doing. I thought they were supposed to be a neutral and just based on the Constitution? But it's really the same; it's all about power. I'm so sad
How dare Roberts make such a statement- he should be in prison right now with his wife for accepting bribes! We need to march on the court and demand the 6 Republicans resign as they're provably compromised.
It‚Äôs the best Court that money could buy‚Ä¶
Term limits! Term limits! Term limits!
"Three branches of government yet one branch consists of 9 individuals that were not voted in by the people and on top of that lifetime appointments. That's not balanced at all. The reason they do this is because they know they can't be removed or vote out, garbage."
"As a Christian, I'm ashamed. Jesus would never want someone to lie their way to the supreme Court to put up an abortion ban. This isn't righteousness. It's evil. Pure human greed."
Everyone with two brain cells to rub together know it was Alito and that he leaked it to force the conservatives to stick to stripping bodily autonomy from half the population. Republicans and conservatives will pay for this for decades.
A bunch of conservative snakes that can't be trusted. No wonder the court has a low approval rating because of these sell out corrupted judges
"They will not answer truthfully, if they answer at all."
"If anybody still believes that Supreme Court Justices aren't just politicians in robes, they haven't been paying attention."
No one gets to decide what surgery i will have.
"In other words, her reporting tells us nothing we didn't already know."
"It's soooooo true, these partisan Republicans justices are drunk on power and politics, and knowing they can get away with crimes is the reason why they need to be stopped."
I dont now wher too longer..
"All six of these corrupt conservative judges are maga politics . Moscow Mitch McConnell and Rrump conservative water carrying tools. Term limits would help but like Gun legislation and weak republicans excuses to do something , they offer only Mafia tactics and prayers and thoughts. Corruption at its best."
"So, who was paid off to get this decision? SCOTUS is Corrupt!"
It's wild how 6 people can decide the fates of 331 million people

The Supreme Court of Canada has a retirement age of 75. The Court works just fine.
"If Justice, Amy wants to have 7 or 10 kids, it doesn't mean everyone should or want to. They should have left roe v wade alone. And mind their business."
"Hmm,,why is she saying‚Ä¶.. President Trump?, Biden is President. Just wondering. What‚Äôs the use, more Republican Supreme Court justices. Only time they voted correct, was when Trump took his case there to overturn the vote, to still be President. They said, NO."
"Quick reminder: our constitution *does not say* Court Justices get lifetime appointments. It says ""shall retain their offices under good behavior."" In the past, we had Justices who held to the standard of ""good behavior"" by not taking bribes, not committing perjury by lying in the job interview. They all held life-time posts *because* they refrained from bad behavior. Hence, we do not have a ""system of lifetime appointments"" we have a system where a justice who refrains from bad behavior shall retain their office until they choose to retire or they expire. Constitution *could have said* ""life appointment"" but chose not to because life appointments invite dictatorial tyranny. After some 200 years, America came to see justices as having ""life appointments"" because of lack of crime on the bench. But that is *not* what the constitution says. The ""originalists"" on the supreme court have never even noticed this phrase, or how it potentially limits their dictatorial powers."
Which constitutional right is next to be taken away as easily?
"Making unilateral decisions about people's healthcare from a bench is not only antithetical to Democracy, it's wrong."
"I don't understand why the supreme court judges have never been charged with perjury during their sworn testimony, at their Confirmation hearings, before Congress."
I've had tacos at Taco Bell more supreme than this court. What a stain on America.

"Coathanger-Barrett was _trying_ for plausible deniability, but this leak removes that plausibility."
What else can Boomers wreck in their limited time left.
conservatives are packing the court to force their will on society. Democrats need to stop play games and start packing to court no matter what because right isn't afraid to do the same. Abortion rights shouldve been codified a long time ago. Now we gotta deal with these morality policemen being in installed on federal benches.
The new justices had just went through lying about Roe and it being case law.
Or maybe.... (sound of getting canceled)... if the entirety of the Justices on the Supreme Court think that abortion is wrong.... MAYBE ITS BECAUSE<<<< IT IS WRONG!!!!!!
"It is way past time to dispense with the ""lifetime appointment"" rule. I have nothing but contempt for this court. Their ethical standards are a joke, some of them sit on seats that were stolen, some of them are patently unfit. Does ""what goes around comes around"" sound like a sentiment that a Supreme Court Justice should hold?"
Don‚Äôt forget to vote for Trump on November 13th!!!!
They did it
This is the evidence required to END lifetime rolls!!  Term limits we need to make mandatory and soon!
B.S. She pulled a Lisa Murkowski. She ‚Äúperformed‚Äù an ethical stance knowing full well her buddies would make sure she got to vote to wage war on women. She got to keep her hands clean while doing nasty.
"The thing that still bothers me is the fact that Justice Alito included the history of 16th century views and feelings on abortion by Sir Edward Coke in England claiming it as part of the US's history when this country is only 250+ years of being considered an entity in its own right. Our history AS A COUNTRY does not carry forward the beliefs and laws of England. Therefore quoting anything before 1776 from England as part of our history as a country is incorrect. 50 years of having the right to abortion means it was and is deeply embedded in our history. That is 1/5 of the years we have been an established county with our own laws, etc."
There own by the Republicans  party
"Context is EVERYTHING, and the crooks on the SCOTUS know that along with their corrupt, ignorant 'clerks' who are just religious and political fanatics in the Anti-Choice lagers and Waco-like compounds."

"Two men talking about abortion, interesting."
"Bravo, to the brave & patriotic person, who leaked these Supreme Court, back room dealings.

There clearly was a personal agenda, and a premeditated plan, concerning the timing of their actions.  This is so discouraging & so disappointing.  But sadly, not surprising or shocking in the least.  Many of us saw this type of behavior coming, when certain justices were appointed.

Their job, is to uphold the Constitution of the United States, and protect the rights of all citizens. 

They don't have to like abortion, and they certainly don't have to get one, but they do have to protect the rights of others, to make that choice for themselves.

The highest court in our land; we look to them to make decisions based on the Constitution, law, and the good of the nation.  This pearl clutching, because they got caught doing something they knew to be sneaky & wrong, is as silly as it is, insulting.

There should be term limits for Supreme Court Justices.  And the selection process needs to be improved, as well.

It will be interesting to see what else comes out, and what if any changes occur because of this."

"Kavanaugh is a lying liar who lies. Though he saw it as his birthright, he has no business sitting on the SCOTUS."

They really shouldn't be smiling for the pain and suffering they have caused.
WHATEVER YOU WANT  MSNBC WILL JUST MAKE UP SOMETHING TO LIE ABOUT
Those six pics of the SC judges could be at a Carnival shooting gallery!
"Roe vs Wade was unconstitutional and needed to be overturn.  1.  There was no federal law in regards to abortions; therefore, the Supreme Court was making a law with the Roe v Wade ruling and the power belongs to Congress not the Supreme Court.  2.  There is nothing in the Constitution that gives the Federal Government the power to regulate abortions; therefore, according to the 10th Amendment that power belongs to the states"
"Seems like someone would have preferred to hold off the case until after the election, all for political reasons."
"It seems to me that the Supreme Court is no longer ""Supreme"" in brains."
"The Supreme Court has destroyed their credibility on their own. There are justices (Thomas, Alito for example) who should clearly be removed as they have been proven to be corrupt. Term limits and clear legal laws are needed for this court NOW!"
Ruth‚Äôs refusal to step down while she had the choice to do so while the political landscape (democratic president and Congress) is so incredibly selfish and SHE is the reason why Roe was overturned. That a selfish woman is THE reason that woman lost their rights. Classic.
Please stop repackaging the same information and start digging up new information like journalists. Please. We need the 4th of state
"They made a whole movie about ‚ÄúSpin‚Äù, it‚Äôs called ‚Äú Wag The Dog‚Äù Spin doctors need to be exposed, like the individuals making up the electoral college. Maybe that‚Äôs why the world is aiming for robots? Can‚Äôt we be real with ourselves, or do we need a war to make us come together as a country."
"I will never respect Barrett.  For her to accept the position under the ramrod they used to put her in place after McConnell derailed Obama's nomination ""because it is too close to an election"" says loudly that she is not concerned with fair play.  She cannot be trusted with her position.

Let's not forget that she and Kavanagh both testified under oath to not upset the precedence of RvW.

It is a political court."
Republicans are Orwellian. They talk about freedom while they are busy taking it from you.
So what ?
So fake Dem News says law is about which party has power to divided without any Constitutional argument that they are wrong. You see sheep how they lie.
"As disgusting & reprehensible as this story shows the ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù of the SCOTUS to be, I‚Äôm in no way shocked ‚Ä¶ especially about the revelation that it was Kavanaugh who was responsible for scheming to take the case but move the date, in order to deceive the public, based on his actions in the W. Bush administration & his specific involvement in the Ken Starr investigation/fishing expedition into Bill Clinton. 
Just on a basic human level, the fact that Ruth Bader Ginsberg - a colleague of many of them for decades! - hadn‚Äôt been deceased for more than a day before they began scheming to undermine her life‚Äôs work, is a testament to the utter depravity of ‚Äúmen‚Äù like Clarence Thomas & Samuel Alito in particular.¬†
I don‚Äôt know how much more reporting & evidence could possibly be needed at this point, to support the fact that these 2 obscenely corrupt, political operatives need to be impeached from the SC! Then there‚Äôs Kavanaugh, who needed multiple attempts to become a judge in the 1st place, & has had more questions arise about his ethics since becoming a justice than any other person ever confirmed to the Court ‚Ä¶ if he is to remain a justice, then the SC needs to enact an ironclad code of ethics & the most scrupulous means of enforcement of any of the lower courts or the other 2 branches of gov‚Äôt combined!
Even then, the SCOTUS needs to be expanded to 13 justices - to match the number of Circuit Courts of Appeals, & have term limits imposed by Congress! The LAST thing this country needs is more bought & paid for, political operatives w no reverence for the law or the rights of the American people, who aren‚Äôt just protected by their lifetime appointments, but are actively, immeasurably emboldened by them - like Thomas & Alito!"
"Save your context, narrative crap. You ARE a utility. Like electric companies, or phone companies."
"This supreme court is corrupt. History will show that the extreme faction of the Catholic higher authority, fronted by Leonard Leo, the fascist OPUS DEI , a group of anti-democratic wealthy individuals, and the Federalist Society have had key roles in the corruption of the third branch of govt under the US Constitution. The vast majority of American Catholics oppose the efforts to destroy religious freedom in the USA."
üòÖ
"This is absolute proof that the Supreme Court is purely political.  They want everyone to believe they actually consider the arguments on each side then rule.  Instead, they do whatever their backers want them to do.  We still need to know who paid off Kavanaugh's huge debts just before he got on the court."
"Maybe, they were hesitant to take up and overturn Roe, because Brett and Amy had so recently taken an Oath to uphold Roe.  They took all of that Dark Money from the Pro-Life Faction, they had to  pay to the Piper.  All of the rest of this is just smoke and mirrors.  They are stuck with their lousy decision and it makes them look like what they are:  Bought and Paid For."
"The Republicans are like the dog that loves chasing cars and finally caught one.
It does not end well for the dog."
"Let me guess. Thomas or Alito leaked the decision. Both are ethically compromised and morally bankrupt. Mitch McConnell has a lot to answer for, as well."
"(0:13) What about the breach of trust this Court did to the American people by overturning Roe!? If he wants to point a finger at someone over a breach of trust, he needs to look in the mirror first! hypocrite!"
"What repubs have done to our now inferior court was 100% political, the court now is a majority of repub, aka fascists, loyalists."
"Plotting to deny women their rights is the breach of trust, leaking it was an attempt to save rights."
"TAKE AWAY MENS REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. EQUAL TREATMENT! No one gets a say in their own health care! Snip, snip, gentlemen! No more Viagra either. If your god wants you limp, you stay limp. And jail the doctors who fight for men's rights to their own bodies!"
This is what has me nervous about this bench looking at the DJT prosecution issues‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
"Every Dem running for Senate needs to run on expanding the court, voting rights, and preserving our Democracy.
Put the Insurrection, the Coup, the corruption of the GOP and their bought and sold SCOTUS justices on the ballot.
Do not allow a Republican a moment of peace in the public sphere, without being on the record about these issues.
Do not give the GOP a platform for ANY other issue. Shout them down, talk over them, control the god damned conversation.

And most of all, the DOJ needs to start arresting and convicting these criminals, including the bribed off SCOTUS judges [sic] Clarence Thomas"
"lol Supreme Court called it breach of trust, but there has been no trust in these corrupted judges for a long time from the people ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"If you do not understand why the abortion process is necessary, then you are not doing your due diligence and understanding things over which you are voting and complaining.

A Dem SC doesn't know what a woman is and in sports.
"This is all about them forcing their religion on us, period"
United States of Theocracy!!
"It's been repeatedly proven, there's only One Body of Law Makers: The Supreme Court.
  ONLY 5 People Rule Supreme!  (5 of 9)

Right & Wrong, Logic & Illogic, Fair & Unfair is not required by The Supreme Court.  They are allowed to interpret the Constitution however they wish.  
Just as ""THE POWERFUL"" have re-interpreted, and even rewritten the Bible, to suit ""their"" Laws of GOD.  These 5 people have that POWER, to over-ride whatever they ""wish."" 

Do YOU understand the unending reach of this?  5 people.

ONLY 5 of 9 Justices have the power to determine what is Law of the Land in this ridiculous country.   Not the 3 Branches of Government/Congress; Not individual States of this Country have the power to make the Law of the Land.   FIVE (5) people of The Supreme Court hold ALL THE POWER !"
Nothing changes what these conservatives have done and will do.
"Gotta say again - it‚Äôs unfortunate that the Democrats aren‚Äôt strategic or long range thinkers. They really had every reason for Ginsberg to step down and be replaced by Obama by a younger judge in the first place in the second place you know I don‚Äôt know if there would be a second chance or on this, but he had the opportunity to put Merrick Garland on the bench during a recess appointment and he chose not to. It‚Äôs such a patronizing mentality. So I‚Äôm not sure? Is it Obama‚Äòs fault that were in this place? He did a lot for the GOP who won were another did a lot for him helping him get into office. he certainly failed to pass or even try to pass important legislation. And let‚Äôs not forget those pictures of children and dog cages were taken in 2014.
Part two of the short term stupid thinking of the Democrats was not having Joe Biden run for president in 2016. I supported Hillary Clinton for president in 1992. I thought she‚Äôd be way better than her husband. But, it‚Äôs a lot easier to get a successful vice president on the heels of the president. Currently the Democrats are trying to do that with Kamala Harris, and it won‚Äôt work because she does not have leader ship charisma at all. It‚Äôs not because she‚Äôs black, because she‚Äôs Indian, it‚Äôs not because she‚Äôs a woman, it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs a twinkly, a little too faced woman with no managerial authority and I don‚Äôt see her being a commander-in-chief. She just doesn‚Äôt have that leader ship vibe. I think she would‚Äôve been a better AG, way better than Merrick Garland. And Hillary might‚Äôve been an excellent vice president in that administration, forging a steppingstone for her to become the first female president of the United States. But as usual, the Democrats and leader ship back there and DC do not have any strategic foresight. They don‚Äôt seem to understand where people are at or how they look at things. They really seem to live in a bubble among themselves, as elitist clueless, patronizing, and phony people. I say this, even though I‚Äôm a Democrat. It‚Äôs grossly disappointing that we have all these horrible people on the Supreme Court, and half of them go back to the days when the Democrats were all agreeable and allowing horrible people like Clarence Thomas onto the bench. They were always being so collegial, while their colleagues across the aisle were always plotting the downfall of our democracy, and the rise of fascism and oligarchy. It was obvious to anybody paying attention since the Reagan and Bush administration."
"This is a separation of church and state issue.  Thinking that you are somehow killing children is a religion-specific dogma position, not even part of many religions, resulting primarily from a very common spiritual failure thinking that you must convert others to your beliefs rather than take responsibility for yourself.  It's a self-improvement avoidance pattern common among humans as they avoid their own spiritual issues while massaging their egos about how good they are being.  It is used by political propagandists to promote voting regardless of the clinic violence and violence to women they are winking at."
What an awful corrupt court.
This may be really off topic.....I thought the NYT journalist was a man until she spoke ü§Ø like a glitch in the matrix.
America sure seems to be turning into a regressive hellhole.
You can thank Mitch McConnell and the GOP. Give them a thank you. Would you please. Have a great day. Take care and god bless. üôèüíôüôè
"The Jusitces didn't need to read the draft, it was written by the Federalist Society. The Society IS THE LAW"
The supreme Court overturning Roe versus Wade was unconstitutional and it is a violation of other laws. The HIPAA laws prevent anybody from using your medical information and no state has a right to stick their nose in your medical information. I wish these attorneys would actually utilize this information because it is accurate to the letter of the laws. You do not have to go to law school to understand the laws you simply just have to have the ability and the skill to read and comprehend.
SUPREME COURT JUSTICED NEED TO BE ELCTED BY THE PEOPLE WITH TERM LIMITS
"Oh good, the Supreme Court participates in political PR by playing the public as fools. Why am I not surprised that they‚Äôre just politicians in  black robes?"
Its time for Biden to pack the court
The Supreme court is just a bunch of liars and definitely not for women because it should be a federal right only s women should have a say over her body since men don‚Äôt have that baby in them that could only affect the rest of there life men don‚Äôt usually have an attachment until after the birth.  Remember who made all this happen! The right wing extremists and romp who it will never affect.
"funny that all these privileged people who went to the best schools couldn't understand the word, ""choice,"" in a case.   You don't like, don't believe or don't want an abortion:  you have the CHOICE to NOT get one!   Just like the peple who do need, or want an abortion have a CHOICE to not believe as you do or have their religion pushed onto you."
"Nothing changes. Set limits on Supreme Court,  no more life terms."
Oh No SC followed the constitution and Dem News trys to bandwagon with no constitution argument.
"The last four republican appointees said under oath that Roe was settled law in order to get on the bench.  THEY LIED UNDER OATH!  Let that sink in.  THEY LIED UNDER OATH.  Then the moment they have the votes to overturn it, suddenly it's no longer settled law.  They lied in order to get appointed to the bench so that they could do what their mega donors sent them there to do, which was to end Roe v Wade."
"The leak may have been ""inappropriate"", but the justices playing politics was even MORE inappropriate.  I am very concerned of our future with a supreme court that is seemingly for sale to the highest bidders."
"Access to the Justices of the Supreme Court   I heard today that it is very difficult to ask questions of the justices. It must be because we aren't billionaires who have personal access to justices. I won't use the word corrupt for SCOTUS, it is POLITICAL. We are a democracy, we didn't vote for them. Now people have no access to justices, in the beginning justices had a circuit to ride and they ate and boarded with the people. They were given their salary to aid them in the hardships they had to endure riding circuit and being away from home. These guys won't cancel lunch for any of us who are the people. They have pulled out the Bible, quote from the worst of it, and hammer the public with old testament vengeance because they see God as vengeful and they see themselves as God's surrogates. Worried about Trump wanting to be the king, we ended up with at least 6 in the court."
It appears that much of America's democratic directives were established based on a reliance that the directives would be discharged with a modicum of honorability and respect. Seems as if this approach is coming apart at the seams?
These corrupt judges make me sick.
"Time to reign the court in! I think they should be limited to 10 years - not life - in the position. They're obviously arrogant and disgustingly entitled. Alito and Thomas need to be impeached because they're blatant crooks, sucking off the teat of their privileged positions. It was a criminal move by McConnell when he denied Obama's choice for the court. Obama was a wimp. He should have fought tooth and nail to fight that, but he knew he was on his way out and just didn't want the hassle. For that alone, I think he was a failed president."
MSNBC is fake news. MSNBC is the enemy of the people.
The right has been planning to put these anti Roe in for years even though it goes against the majority of world opinion.
"I like MSNBC in general but I would like it more without Chris Hayes. He's a bit overboard--an extremist. He pushes ideas a little too far, beyond the facts, and tries to sensationalize the news. Tries to start fires. In other interviews of his I've seen, not so much this one, he's very hyper and often interrupts his guests too much. He needs to tone it down or find another outlet."
The Supreme Court sees what's happening to our country. Why aren't they doing something?
I hope Kavanaugh üí© himself everytime he walks into his chambers.
Mississippi wanted to end abortion because that state is the highest in young black female mortality rate while giving birth or soon after. legalized murder of young black breeders is all it is.
"Hopefully, people remember that the judges involved stated that they would not overturn precedent law, without tacit changes to the circumstances. Only one of the many lies they told to get appointed."
Vote blue so that they can expand the court.
"A Republican led SCOTUS is corrupt. Yes, of course it is, that was the point."
I think it was Alito who leaked it.
"The World is watching! The U.S. cannot call themselves a country of democracy or law and order ever again. What a joke. The curtain has fallen and we all see you now for what you really are... corrupt, violent, anti-women, racist and fascist. Certainly not 100%, but just look at who is actually 'ruling your country' from your local school boards all the way to the top! All the while the people are playing with their toys and stuffing their faces with greasy heart-stopping burgers and fries."
A Handmaid‚Äôe Tale isn‚Äôt supposed to be an instructional booklet.
Biden needs to match the number of justices to the number of federal districts.
Not allowing women to make their own reproductive decisions makes them second class citizens. Lots of people are good with that.
"Cons and piracy; put them together and you get conspiracy. The court is the most corrupt in american history. Lock, them up. Throw away the keys."
"in an authoritarian country, usually the authoritarian ends bad. In USA we have at this point 6 authoritarians that are going to retire from their luxury lives despite how many American lives they destroy. And you the republicans call the democrats and some other countries, third countries and   authoritarian countries, communists or socialists?"
"A justice system that is so lost and broken, make their citizens have no respect for that institution. The Supreme Court should be abolished at this point."
"I don‚Äôt care about the leak. What concerns me is that millions of dollars were wasted during these confirmations that ultimately mean nothing! Kavanaugh and coney-Barrett said, in front of congress, that Roe v Wade was established law. And these people clearly lied and are on the supreme court FOR LIFE! That‚Äôs a problem"
Religion infused justices are EXACTLY THE WRONG THING when trying to maintain separation of church and state.
"It's okay with the justices violate ethics...but not their assistants.

""Do as we say, not as we do"" is not a good look for any judge or the rule of law."
you missed the entire point  of this story -- Why was the conservative  wing of the court so fixated on Roe?  Why were they so motivated to change the law?   It is so incredibly obvious that it was done for political reasons to serve their political overlords and the federalist society  .  This story strips the black robes  and reveals a bunch of political operatives.
"The current supreme court made US women second class citizens again! Want to protect your rights and your daughter's, mother's, sister's, aunties? Vote and bring like minded people to the polls üá∫üá≤üíôüåä"

"Women in the US are now headed for a Taliban-like existence. Pregnancy is now governed by the government, and natural processes that lead to an unviable fetus in the womb are now crimes against the state."
It was Donald Trump who appointed those three zealot justices!
John Roberts should be ashamed to lead the most corrupt court in living memory. He should resign because of his failures.
"the US population has doubled since the last time the number of SC Justices has been adjususted

it is time for Biden to immediately appoint at least 9 additional SC  Justices"
"The Supreme Court, the easiest to buy, these days."
The justices released it on purpose.  That's my opinion.
No one is above the law not even the mega Republicans. The Supreme Court is the court that we depend on. The Supreme Court should not have block the views are the abortion right. Clarence Thomas and his wife should be fired. Do you know what they're coming into Supreme Court judges they were not here trying to make money what they are trying to do that's a bunch of BS
"The only incentive you need to be a model citizen in this country is have an intolerance for stupidity. Once you become intolerable to stupidity, you'll do whatever it takes to avoid the justice system in this country because it is full of our stupidest people from county level all the way to the Supreme Court."
"Where's the bombshell?

"Weird, I thought it was liberals who were activist judges who legislate from the bench."
"It's easy to be pro-life politically, but when your wife, or significant others life is hanging in the balance, and her life is to be sacrificed, to save a non-viable pregnancy, then you have finally faced the failure of this regulation of the human body, in protecting life."
"Who needs a Constitution, a Congress, or a President when you have these unelected life-term authoritarians forcing their vision of America on us.  They have made it clear that THEY ARE THE LAW!"
"Haven't we been told criticizing the court isn't protected ""free speech?""   The court needs to issue a ""gag order."""
"Best ju$tice money can buy. So, you think Alito leaked, or was it Thomas? My money‚Äôs on Alito."
The corrupt states of America.....ü§Øü§Ø
"Probably leaked by Stephen Breyer, on his way out the door."
sounds like one of the conservative justices leaked it to force the other conservatives to vote in favor of overturning Roe...  Clarence Thomas and Sam Alito are more like politicians than justices..
Our Supreme Court cannot be trusted !!!!!!!!!
"Let's remember for all RBG is revered, she caused a shitshow by not retiring while a Democrat was President and could have named a successor.  They're all the same, their love of power and the prestige that comes with it is more important than anything else."
They didnt want to miss an opportunity to get paid to rule.
Treason...
To me it is all wrong. A tiny group of people (supreme court) decide on something that can affect a population of 300 million.  This should be decided by a referendum - people can vote for what THEY want not for what 5 people want (supreme court is 9 people but you only need 5).
"Traitor appointed corrupt judges, they are waiting for his commands."
"Who done it? This abusive Supreme Court! After 50yrs of a woman's right protected, this Supreme Court broke that trust for protection inside a patriarchal society!! The background of women ""oppression"" for ions...using oppression over women for power...power over! Here we are again...justices need to back to the drawing table and right their wrong...stop trying to control women and their bodies!!! Easy for you to pass viagra though! Sick."
"This whole affair makes the US Supreme Court come across as just another political arm of the far-right.  They show their theologic ties.  Someone needs to present the arguments that justified abortion.  It requires an understanding of the nature and science of reproduction.  The anti-abortion faction live in religious fantasies.   Every time a women menstruates, she is ""killing"" a human being.  The far-right feels no shame in diminishing the value of humans after birth.  They deny the value of funding humanitarian efforts."
THE NOT SO ‚ÄòSUPREME‚Äô court
Am remembering the judges who lied about overturning Roe when they were being interviewed. Crooks and liars on the Court..
Thanks MSNBC news
They‚Äôre coming after birth control next.
Republicans contradict themselves in word and deed daily. More so than some dirty Democrats
OBVIOUS from the Beginning... CONSERVATIVES Leaked to lock in Votes. We CHEER these dumbasses for their induced consequences that are demolishing the GOP.
United States Supreme Court is simply the upper house of the Republican Party.
"The other Conservatives might have giving cover to Amy Comey Barrett during the early stages through her initial vote to not take up the case.  Because of the inappropriate look, much as a legislators are given cover on votes that damage their political position in getting re-elected. When their vote is not needed to pass the legislation."
I think Alito or Thomas definitely were behind the leak.
"Is it possible that people on the left could consider that may be the people who are against abortion truly believe it is wrong just like you might believe killing puppies is wrong, and you might want that outlawed. I'm pro-choice but I understand the argument on the other side and I don't think the people are evil"
"We NEED so much more transparency from the Supreme Court bc if this is true, then they didn't really ""lie"" to Congress in their approval hearings to get their seats, after all...but, my strong sense and from all we know now of all the  Trump's appointees he picked for top positions throughout America's institutions during his term is that everyone was made to sign NDA's and promises of lip locked loyalty to him, without questions and it may be that he's got the Rs on the bench, divided for a reason...not his but whatever HIS puppetmaster tells him to do...he does!  He's not to dumb to know that he's clueless when it comes to politics but he's taking his orders from our staunchest foreign enemies!  I've been consistent on this point from the very beginning, no matter how he ""acted""...that's not part of my decision that he's on the side of every one of our adversaries and treats our allies like dirt...he does this in plain sight, why is that ok with some American's?  I've ALWAYS been on the side of the underdogs but this is NOT that...watch how the leader of China and the likes use these mind control techniques...it's fascinating when it's happening to others way over there...that's all I can say...thank God ppl here are saying
..lol sorry so long! ü§êü§Ø"
"She was just using smoke and mirrors.  IF she was serious , she would have voted NO in the final saying.
However there is also an element of control ....she is still a lower being, being a woman.

So much corruption."
All they're doing is kicking the ruling back to the states which is where it's supposed to actually be
"The US Constitution specifically forbids any attempt to establish a state religion.
It follows, then, that any evidence that relies on the supposed words of some invisible, unseen entity, the evidence for whom relies entirely on the words in a single, ancient, unreliable, self-contradicting book which few of its self-professed adherents have ever actually read, should play absolutely no part in law-making.
In other words, if you want the USA to follow the laws of a god, then he/she/it should be ready to appear in court to justify and explain those laws.
You know the sort of thing - why slavery is good, genocide encouraged, as are stoning naughty toddlers to death and banning women from holding ""holy office"".
The silliest thing is that the organisations that claim to believe these things are not US taxpayers - but they still bleat and whine about tax dollars being ""wasted"" on things that the supposed founder of their religion commanded they do.
The really funny thing is just how few of them seem able even to spell ""hypocrisy..."
"So, if this Investigative Reporter delved deep into the situation with the Supreme Court and the ""alleged leak"" of the draft decision, then why didn't her investigation reveal the culprit who leaked the draft?...."
"And USA justice system is corrupt,  what is going on in this country,  is it just the beginning of a total collapse as it sure seems so everyone is just in it for themselves,  what a corrupt corrupt country"
"RBG was good, but should have retired during Obama administration."
"These people want you to believe their conclusions are valid, even though the evidence of the corruption of SCOTUS is obvious. The duplicitousness is of a trumpian scale."
REMOVE THE ENTIRE SCOTUS AND START OVER
Term limits and accountability for the supreme court now!
"2:00 in, nothing! When Chris says I forgot about the details, I have not!"
"If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's a duck."
The 1973 SC decision said that women had the right to bodily autonomy & the male justices on the present SC said NO they don't!!!
This makes me upset! The fact that people have the power to harm people! Women are being treated like second-class citizens!
Trump wanted to seat justices that would overturn Roe.  So the SC Justices went with politics their religious beliefs & not the Constitution.
"This Supreme Court's conservative men are about politics. They are fabricating legal interpretations, that magically align with their personal political leanings. That makes them nonelected lawmakers and not interpreters of the law."
"These kind of wherever they are are claim they are religious and good people but you look at their faces and you can see the nastiness and hatred there because of all the pain they carry around with them. 

When you're this evil, the Universe won't let you be happy!"
Obama for V.P.
"Trump figured out how to tear down the trust in every America institution in 4 years in office. Why are these justices using their beliefs or opinions as metrics for which to judge. Your job as a judge is to follow the law, the Constitution. It has nothing to do with anyone's political opinions or religious beliefs. The entire GOP is dirty and trying to destroy our nation."
Of course.  The newly appointed justices committed perjury during their confirmation hearings.  They were inherently uncomfortable about striking down Roe vs. Wade.  They wanted a period of time to allow public acceptance of their tainted confirmations.
"John Roberts has a lot of nerve to talk about this leak being a ""breach of trust"". The SCOTUS has broken the trust of the people. I literally see them as enemies of liberty and democracy at this point. None of them care about justice or do process. Just more greedy little children."
@ManassehIsrael1025 ... You are taking the Lord's name in vain. Fake Christian.
The most corrupt Supreme Court in American History
She is field dependent and unable to weigh other concerns.  She is deaf to human concerns other than being the darling of zealots.  She IS a zealot and so is Alito who is back in the 1500s.  He hates women
"It shows to all those watching,  how easy it is to take over powerful positions in USA & you better believe they're watching!! üåé"
"If something is being leaked it means something is being hidden. Hidden from ""We the people"". We are not governed, we are ruled."
"She has seven children and an army of people to care for them.  She could have advocated, as a woman, for some concerns that are now evident: she did NOTHING."
Jody Kantor is clear concise. Thank you for your insight and reporting.
Contact your federal legislator and say you wont vote for them unless they bring legislation to codify roe into law. No compromise.
Barrett‚Ä¶..‚Äùcover your own butt‚Äù
The Supreme Court needs to have their medical license revoked.
"""Relisted' a crime against humanity."
"So, MSNBC is just realizing they were eagerly waiting for RBG to die so they could do this. 
Now?!?!  Seriously?!?!"
It was either Alito or Thomas.  My money is on Clarence.

"All medical decisions should NEVER be made by anyone except a patient, family and the doctor. Doctors are THE AUTHORITY for medical decisions. They have more education than a lawyer and they know their patients better than any politically-appointed judge."

"The Supreme court under Republicans is corrupt, The Senate under Republicans is corrupt, The house and Congress under Republicans is corrupt and the presidency under Republicans is corrupt so can your Imagine what would happen if all those ducks line up?"
Anyone that thinks the SCOTUS is not corrupt this is all the proof needed that they are.
"Women's bodies, women make decisions.  Not you!  Shams."
Republicans are trash
Whoever was responsible for the binder at the time of it going missing should be questioned and held accountabke.
You can bet that wealthy Republicans will have access to abortion and will use it.
it is absolutely sick what is going on in the US. my honest take on what is going on is that every single woman in the US should leave the country all at once in protest. that might get their attention...
Democrats are something else boy SMDH and I used to be a democrat in 2008 but they are pure evil now
"The thing this tells me is the court must be much more open with their deliberations. This was all very underhanded, and clearly an abuse of the respectability of the court. These justices don‚Äôt deserve the secrecy they demand, and we can‚Äôt afford it."
It was Alito and Thomas who leaked the draft.

"What's next?  Atheism becomes illegal? Childless is illegal? Fahrenheit 451?  Slavery returns?, Child brides?. Burkas? It sure seems like the States is already sliding down the slippery slope. Never say never."
They have not held up their oath of office. We do not need justices on the Supreme Court who respect the oath they took!
Conservative means to not allow progress and control all our lives to keep us all in place because of an ancient religion brought to us from The Old World?
The current US Supreme Court is a breach of trust
Term limits now! Omfg disgusting and outrageous! Omfg!
"The Supreme Court smells like bad fish. I don't trust them at all anymore. Lifetime Appointments should be stopped IMMEDIATELY. All it does is breed corruption. What motivation do these Judges have to play by the rules when they don't have to answer to anyone, and can't lose their job no matter what they do? üá∫üá∏"

Im just astonished how they are allowed to serve AFTER lying to Congress/Senate and taking bribes etc. Smh

I've got my money on Ginny being the leak
Amy changing her vote on taking the case is meaningless. It's just for appearance and changes nothing about how I see her. She's still a dreadful person.
The blame should fall on Ruth Bader for not stepping down when she could  have been replaced. Her desire to clutch the power until it had to be pried from her dead hands cost every woman in this country their right to choose.
"Ruth Ginsburg should have retired when Obama asked to, but noooooo, she had to play ""justice"" 'till she died putting herself above country. Shame! Power corrupts. Now women pay the price."
SCOTUS surely torpedoed the GOP. They haven't won an election since.
Why does not the news report the truth. They ruled that we have no rights to privacy

Lawrence needs some yacht time to think about it.
"Repuglicans had been politicking on abortion for decades and then when they finally had to votes to overturn Roe v. Wade they had to choose between enraging the evangelicals or the rest of the country.  May they go down with the evangelical ship.  There's a reason religion is in decline, some people recognize hypocrisy and unethical behavior."
"The American Evangelical Fascists would have been OK to elect the devil for President, if he helped them to overturn Roe v. Wade, and they came very close to the dark Lord with Trump."
"This Christian fundamentalist SCOTUS is severely overstepping their boundaries & duties, overturning Roe was purely politically & ideologically driven. They were more interested in shoving their personal opinions down the throats of the American people than following the law & settled precedent.
Also, I'll never forgive RGB for not stepping down during Obama's 1st term when she could've allowed him to replace her with someone like minded"
Love that all their machinations have actually increase support for abortion. Who'd have thought???
Term limits and rights of recall.
"When I think of supreme court judges, I think of liars and paid for tools."
"Contrary to what democrats/liberals and their propaganda outlets are trying to make people believe. The US Supreme Court did NOT ban abortions.  They simply and constitutionally ruled that abortion is up to each individual state and not the federal government.

So someone saw them scheming the American people behind closed doors and leaked the document in hopes of a change. Good on whoever did that. That's more American than what these religious zealots are trying to do.
It‚Äôs absolutely hilarious how stupid MSNBC‚Äôs reporters make FOX look. It‚Äôs real reporting with undeniable evidence. Hayes is the man!!
Let's just hope Americans vote blue and make Republicans pay for taking away rights
Abortion restrictions have already been influencing elections.  I'm sensing a crushing defeat for the right wing in 2024.
Excuse me??? Since when is determining Constitutionality done in secret? Leaks within the military is treason.  Maybe the court should focus on billionaires destroying this democracy.
"Justice Clarence Thomas should do the right thing and resign. It's probably the biggest, single, immediate step that could be taken to restore faith in the Supreme Court. I'd be fine with replacing him with another conservative provided they were someone with integrity, competence, and loyal to the constitution."
"And Alito is scum‚Ä¶along with Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett. All of them are liars."

"We Liberals can cry all we want but RBG new she wasn't going to live forever. She should have stepped down when Obama was president and the Dems had control of the Senate but  NO she evidently thought  she would live forever. So I blame her and I blame Obama when he nominated Gerrick and the Senate led by McConnel stalled - Obama should have gone ahead and appointed Gerrick saying the Senate's Role was to ""advise and consent"" not to stall. But NO!"
The problem is the majority of WW voted for DT in 2016. And in TX 62% supported Rs being elected. (Which now TX has a full court with Rs serving.) Beto should have won.

"I wonder, given the damage the Dobbs decision did to the Republicans in 2022 and in the many referendums on Abortion and GOP Special Election disasters, if this Conservative Majority would have overturned Roe given the devastating fallout for the GOP?

Roberts says this leak was a breach of trust. Not as much as the breach of trust created when they betrayed their oath and the nation playing politics with people's lives and bringing suffering to women everywhere in their effort to turn back the clock to a time when women were the property of men.
Justice Alito was and is the leak.
How dare they make killing babies illegal.  That‚Äôs transphobic!
The SCOTUS is so corrupt. How can we ever respect their opinions? Such a disgrace to our country. üòîüëé
Let's get to the bottom of this.
Just the fact that they discussed the scheduling of the hearing of the case shows what a f'd up clubhouse the supreme court is now.
Literally everyone upset about this are godless baby killers
"The supreme Court is long overdue for a tune-up if not a house cleaning. I wish it deserved the title ""Supreme"" but lately it feels more like Substandard. So disappointing."

"Let‚Äôs make this very simple.  When one party intentionally stonewalls an appointment, and then presses forward multiple appoints by their own party to create a conservative majority that results in the changing of law that the majority of Americans do not want, it is absolutely political.

There needs to be SCOTUS reform, oversight, ethics standards, and term limits."
A corrupt bunch.
Lock trump up now!!!
"Oh please. We all know that a Republican-stacked court was always going to overturn Roe. There was absolutely no chance it wasn't gonna happen. This has been their goal for decades. Well, one of their goals. This was inevitable. If it took Republicans another 30 years to get a majority, they would have still overturned Roe the first chance they got. The only way you can stop this is to stop voting for Republicans. Period. If you want to keep your rights and you know the Republicans are against you, absolutely never vote for a single one of them and always vote."
Literally everyone whose pro abortionist are godless baby killers
"RBG should have stepped down in 2014. She didn't, and Amy Barrett will now be a reliable right-wing vote for 40 years.

Conservatives will reverse the ban on abortion when they realise that the growth of non-white populations is increasing significantly.
"Roe vs Wade was always going to be tossed out by this Supreme Court. The whole song and dance of ""careful deliberation"" was just as much a song and dance as the GOP swearing to listen to the evidence against Trump for his impeachment and then openly saying ""we'll never vote for impeachment."" The Democrats know it, the Republicans know it and even the neutral voters know it."
So they conspired strategically.  It was all step by step plan.  And what about all these cases conservatives are putting forward that are fake? Like the wedding planner who wasn't a wedding planner who made up a case and got it all the way to the supreme Court!?!  I call BS.
"Truly awful reporting, The Court didnt take Dobbs to spit on Ginsberg's grave. They already had the majority. Ginsberg herself said that Dobbs was bad law and would get overturned. At least the guest host tried to tamp down on his conspiratorial claims."
What does this have to do with ‚Äúthe law‚Äù?? This is ENTIRELY political!!  Worrying about appearances over substance is always political. This is just disgraceful!
"The SCOTUS itself is a breach of trust...
In 2023 Trump's SCOTUS is corrupted to it's conservative, authoritarian, racists, misogynistic core."
"All six members shown on this video should be permanently removed from the SCOTUS, disbarred, and placed in prison for their levels of corruption."
"When your country start stripping you of basic human rights, and civil rights; you no longer live in free country. You live in a country ran by the church via the old prunes elected into office. Over half the civil and basic human rights taken away from Americans have come with this phrase said by the politicians that supported it. ""It's against ""my"" religious views and in good faith I couldn't support or pass a bill that goes against my god."" 
You want freedom, it needs to start with all that serve federal and public office to sign a neutrality agree. This would have them agree that they will not allow their religious or personal beliefs or feelings influence the laws they pass. Rather they will do what the people want, or what is best for the people (you know the ones of many faiths and cultures). Second that is, all members of both houses of government shall serve a max of 2 terms of 4 years each. These terms start via election at same time as the president elect is chosen. Third, no one that has been impeached shall be allowed to run for office. That includes the POTUS, any federal office, and public/state office."

"The Supreme Court sucks...""leaks"" are happening frequently & that just confuses  people. But I have to believe the Supreme Court will protect mothers as well as fetuses. No woman should d*e because the fetus they are carrying has catastrophic futures. Women aren't incubators! The recent woman who HAD to have the procedure, to save her own life, should not be decided by legislators, politicians. Doctors know what is best for patients, not Judges, legislators, or politicians. The Supreme Court HAS to see medical complications as actual real life scenarios....this isn't what ifs?"
That will cost many lifes.

I like Jodi Kantor's analytical mind. I wouldn't mind seeing her on more often for future discussions.
Ginny Thomas leaked the draft to Politico. Sam Alito and Clarence Thomas were in on it. None of these three people can be trusted to tell the truth about anything.
This nonsense will hand Democrats wins next year.
Breach of trust? This right wing SCOTUS is beyond trust . They are a kangaroo trump court .

Clarence Thomas had an abortion!!! Actually still does!!!!! His wife!!!!!!
no report on the american people being removed from homes to make room for ILLEGALS?
"So, the Supreme Court ISN'T above playing politics?  This is a thing I so do not want to believe...but the evidence is incontrovertible. And that Beerboy Kavanaugh should openly suggest deceiving the American people so that Amy Conehead can look good? Well, that one is NOT a surprise. What's most disappointing is, where were the liberal justices during all this---why didn't they speak out to the American people once it became clear that trump's patsies were working to make themselves look legit, like right after they'd lied to congress about Roe. All I can say is, they'd better stay holy on the presidential immunity case, b/c now all eyes are on them."
"So, Americans are by a strong majority pro-choice, but a strong minority of religious fascists is anti-choice. 
But against all logic, abortion will be banned for decades. This is a disaster and shouldn‚Äôt happen in a democracy. The US political and judicial system is perfectible."
Communist Democrats and their terrorist Projecting their Thirst For Murdering Unborn children and Women's rights
At best these dishonorable agents of Christian apologism use their power for flagrant abuse of religious  dogma that gets metastases into secular Law now dripping with the venom of christian nationalism.  This is basic treason and an overt denial of their oath to our Republic!
"Biblically-speaking, life begins at birth. Read the bible and note the many passages with the phrase ""breath of life"". This isn't some superpower of God. This is God defining life as the moment when a person takes their first breath! This whole debate is a farce by an extremist group parading a deceitful interpretation to gain and hold political power."
So we are blaming the right wing justices for all the abuses they are committing‚Ä¶when in fact they were appointed by one Leonard Leo and confirmed by one Mitch McConnell and his right wing republicans‚Ä¶these right wing justices were carefully selected for that purpose‚Ä¶and if we think is only about abortion think again ‚Ä¶don‚Äôt forget that are there for life and they were selected young in age for a reason ‚Ä¶.we are in big trouble on this country‚Ä¶..and if we think the abortion ruling is based on on religion then we are been fooled ‚Ä¶.that ruling is all about money and power nothing to do with religion believe‚Ä¶since the Bible doesn‚Äôt condemn abortion ..so we are in danger with this right wing republican justices of losing our democracy‚Ä¶.beware of all the right wingers with deep pockets cause their power is not limited to the Supreme Court..all the federal courts are in this ‚Ä¶Texas comes to mind ‚Ä¶wake up America let‚Äôs vote all these right wing republicans out of every office of legislation in this our republic‚Ä¶.enough‚Ä¶
Medical procedures getting politicized is practice of medicine without a license. There is a reason why obgyns got to school for 12 years
The last thing you want to happen is for them to find out who ignored the confidentiality of the court and blabber mouth they were taking up the abortion issue because you know it was a leftist.
And nobody saw this coming ?  From the moment of the decision of Roe versus Wade the Conservative Political Wing pushed via their appointments to move back toward abortion restriction.
Nothing more than a bunch of overpowered silly figures !
Don't forget that these justices lied under oath about RvW being settled law.
As a retired judge I have long held the Supreme Court in high regard. I know have nothing but contempt for the body.
"They're mad about a 'breech of trust' on their side to distract from the 'betrayal of faith' for faith put in the Supreme Court that the vaaast majority of Americans support roe v. Wade and this isn't about law at this point, it's about not having proper separation of church and state because clearly woman with their doctors should determine what's right for the woman not politicians. Stealing or rights and trying to silence the majority, all thanks to corrupt Republicans."
"A bunch of Catholics deciding it is women & r*ped little girls jobs to HURT, SUFFER, & CRY to pleasure their sadists selves."
A clear case of how politicized the Court has become; another stab in the back of its legitimacy as the arbiter of American justice.
"""ordering an investigation into 'who did it'"" but no investigation into the crimes (violations of laws committed by regular citizens are crimes, but not if a SCOTUS justice like Clarence does it, not recusing in a trial against his wife9), and not investigating corruption.
Biden should have nominated 4 justices and the new majority should have passed ethics rule - even with the option to kick out corrupt and criminal justices; now Trump will nominate 4 more justices, like ""judge Aileen"" and Jim Jordan - only condition is absolute loyalty to Trump against the Constitution."
Yes No Trust for The DOJ

The Supreme Court didn‚Äôt take abortion rights away. They moved the decision about abortion rights out of the Federal government and closer to the people- just like Republican Constitutional Democracy demands.
The Supreme Court is corrupt!

And that leak changed absolutely nothing, I don't care what the justices claim: they went in with the sole purpose of overturning Roe."

"Women need to start thinking about the laws needed to control men's bodies the way they control women's bodies. Fornication and adultery are prohibited in the bible yet men do it all the time and get away with it and they cause unwanted pregnancies. Ther must be laws set in stone regarding men's bodies, in our judicial system and its time to balance the scales. Men cannot have their cake and eat it too!"
"I no longer trust the SC. Corruption has already entered the SC. By keeping it a secret, they denied the voice of the people to share their perspective. They slapped the majority of Americans people while supporting the minority group. Will never forgive the SC."
"It's not about politics? Remind me, don't we have a highly corrupted judge that still resides in there, with bribes from rich business people?"
"The Supreme Court, Government has no right in the rights of a woman.Why is they still fighting slavery."
What is so Supreme about a Court of 9 people stabbing each other in the back and leaking information? Was  Clarence's the only person who knew Ginni was working with insurrectionists?  Yeah Right!
If the American people vote for a referendum it can introduce a term limit
"Justice Roberts should have shown the same amount of outrage about Justice Clarence‚Äôs behaviour, and lack of ethical standards being demonstrated by his fellow judges! And, leave women‚Äôs rights alone."
"Was the plan leaked by Alito's office?  It certainly looks that way.  It was a means to expedite the clampdown on and removal of civil rights in the USA.  Filthy business.  Never turn your backs on these ""justices"".  They have no justice intended for YOU."
The next time the Democrats get all three branches of government they have to fix the supreme Court what a disaster
"We are doomed as it is nearly impossible to amend the Constitution partly because any Amendnent can be blocked by a mere 13 States  withholding approval. And since the Constitution is the Supreme law of the land, it cannot be changed by any process except for another Amendment. Does this directly effect the Supreme Court, I don't know, but I'm guessing it does. The Equal Rights Amendment ( Sorry Ladies) is still in Limbo a century after a guarantee of Gender Equality was proposed to Congress....The ERA was proposed in 1923 but did not pass Congress until 1972. And under U S law Amendments to the Constitution must be ratified by three fourths, 38 of the State Legislatures and do not require Presidential Approval..."
Rules for thee not for me.
The problem in the US is that Presidents are allowed to nominate their choices for the court.  This needs to be taken away from politicians and done by some other means that removes partisan politics from the process.  There's is no way it's a fair and balanced system if the court becomes another arm of the party in power.
"this is clearly disgusting...they all must be laughing their way to the bank, both figuratively AND literally...did that earn Thomas and his wife another hefty deposit to their account? No amount of $$ is worth the pain and suffering to anyone that needs an abortion, then to take the RIGHT to choose away!"
"Chris and Jody, I applaud all that you do. I implore you to always include commentary on the right's agenda to eliminate the separation of church and state as nothing more than a lever to clutch on to power at the cost of women's rights. Women know when they're ready to be moms. It's not up to anyone else. Also, please always include framing on the societal impact of underparented children.  The right's pro-life til birth and pro-prison til death are a contradiction that are both morally and fiscally bankrupt.  Nutured children push themselves to become capable adults. Unwanted/undervalued children push away, struggle, & need grace from others. All the sacred texts discuss this. To limit yourself to one book or, worse, someone else's interpretation of one book is America's new pandemic."
"Surprise Surprise, a bunch of men decided to strip women of our bodily autonomy asap...disgusting!"
"In making their judgment, the conservative justices, helped a lot of Republican politicians lose their jobs..."
"ah, yes, blame the leaker, not the poor justices."
What's up with Rudy?
Chris Hayes ‚Äúreading into things‚Äù that people didn‚Äôt say sorta seems like a conspiracy theorist‚Ä¶

‚ÄúBreach of trust‚Äù who‚Äôs?
Who listens to MSDNC
They all lied under oath
SCOTUS is the breach of trust
"Who keeps these republican RICO political honest? Their actions smell, what will they hide when the Insurrection and republican attempts to destroy our democracy surface üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üòÆüòÆüòÆ"
"Ginsberg stood in the gao as long as she could, keeping American women from being chattel, and now she is gone, and so are women's rights. Amy Coney Barrett is the worst kind of traitor."
"Breach of trust is what these Supreme Court members did to the entirety of the American people. To be exact, their decision opens the legal door to declare all rights not written down in the Constitution and amendments as not rights at all.

To be crystal clear, rights written into the Constitution are legally called ""enumerated rights."" Meaning they've been written down in the Constitution. Before this abortion decision, there used to be rights called ""unenumerated rights"", meaning they are not written down anywhere in the Constitution.

Unenumerated rights were ones like a right to travel. A right to wear the cloths you want. A right to eat the food you like. Madison pointed this out before the Constitution was finished in the Federalist Papers and was deeply concerned because he believed a Supreme Court might nullify all unenemerated rights in a decision. And this Supreme Court did just that with this abortion decision saying, ""The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion"". The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to wear the clothes you want either. See it now?

What this Supreme Court has done with this abortion decision is say, there are no unenumerated rights. That you do not have a right to eat what you want. You do not have a right to travel. You do not have a right to wear the cloths you want, and all similar things. This because those are not written down in the Constitution. ""Enumerated"".

This is what Madison was terrified of. That a Supreme Court would make such a decision. And they just did. So believe it or not, Americans no longer have a single right to do anything that isn't outlined specifically in the Constitution. They've declared all ""unenemerated rights"" as unconstitutional with this abortion decision outlined in their opinions. How's that for a wake up call? Bet you didn't know either did you?"
Man it must be a pain in the backside for the honest fair thinking more intelligent Democrat Supreme Judges dealing with the corrupt bias less intelligent republican Supreme Judges who hold the majority
Thanks Trump and the Republican Partyüò°....You Big Dummie's...Fred SanFord.üòé
The six justices who are Roman Catholic should have disqualified themselves - it's like Christian Scientist judges banning appendicitis operations.
Mthe conservatives on the bench are owned by the Koch's??
"Six of the most hated and  vile people on the courts. We wouldn't be going through all this upheaval if they had just left Roe as is. It's clear they hate women and consider us to be 2nd hand citizens to be barefoot and in the kitchen, or bedroom, and nowhere else. I hope women unite and get each and every one of the GOP     out and vote Blue for all women out there.  This, SCOTUS is the beginning of the end."
Most of the people who claim to be against Roe have never actually read it.  It had different requirements for each trimester of pregnancy.
Abolish lifetime appointments
Old news!
"so my takeaway is that Supreme court judges do not just benignly sit and wait for cases to reach their court and then let the law decide in honest and open debate.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  They have pre determined agendas and they play politics (lie, cheat, steal)  to achieve it. Bending the law to do as they (their billionaire owners/donors) want."
It was Ginnie a bet it was Ginnie
The supreme court is corrupt and not a democratic institution....it is an archaic model under the fashion of a monarchy or Roman republic. There should be no positions for life in America. It was all a well played Game.
"Collectively, we deserve everything that is coming including this topic. Of course I do not agree."
"They acted like vultures, they lied. Corrupt. Not ""for the people"", they are for their own agenda, for theocracy. üò°"
A very corrupted Supreme Court and even lower courts.     All these justices have been bribed.      It is about controlling every aspect of women's lives.
That‚Äôs exactly what it looks like üòÆ
"I‚Äôm so NOT surprised. The only thing supreme about them is their hypocrisy, entitlement and total lack of integrity"
The breach of trust was done by the lying members of SCOTUS that wouldn‚Äôt reveal their bias stance on Row v Wade. We have No sympathy for you Supreme Court! üòä
"98% of biologists agree that human life begins at fertilization.  You might as well argue that evolution is ""just a theory,"" at that point.  The fact that human life begins at fertilization has more scientific support than global warming does among geologists.  Let that sink in."
"Don't we all know it was either Alito or Thomas (or their staff on explicit request of the Injustice) who leaked the oppinion to pressure Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett?"
"Got to rework laws governing the SCOTUS. We now see this is  a court of greed and corruption. They make the Roman Senate and the Chief Priest and the Pharisees of JESUS day look like school boys. To be fair not all but enough of them. Known Crooks passing judgemental it some cases to the highest bidder. GOD hated corrupt judgement so bad HE said HE will clothe HIMSELF in righteous and fight against it ISAIAH,59.. If GOD said HE hated it, they are not getting away with anything."

"It has a separate DNA from the mother, it has a separate immune system from the mother, it has a separate heartbeat from the mother. It has separate organs from the mother. 

The argument that it is not a human life suggests that because it relies on the body of the mother for survival it cannot be viewed as an individual life with constitutional or even basic human rights.  That is the weakest argument because the same could be said for any vulnerable human especially babies.  

Face it, that is a baby and abortion is murder.  It's not an opinion, it's a fact."
America just need to stop voting Republican and the problem would be solved.
"Mindblowing to me, as a german, to appoint anyone for LIFE in such a position of power with no good fail safe to prevent abuse of power"
"BIDEN NEEDS TO EXPAND THE SCOTUS to 11 and/or we NEED to impeach Clarence Thomas for bribery (Which we already 100% have factual evidence of) and investigate Kavanaugh who was never properly Vetted and screened. This is not partisan, those are facts."
"The hypocrisy of this court is beyond belief.  First of all, two of the justices positions should have been appointed under Obama and Biden,using a rule that Mitch McConnel set up and then only abided by the rule when it helped him get two more seats.  The fact that they seated a Justice a month before Biden took office is unbelievable.  And, both of the new justices told Congress they would support established law when specifically asked about Roe vs Wade during their Congressional interviews.  You would think the Supreme Court would be an example for everyone to follow instead of being a politically based joke."
"States with restrictive abortion laws... With the exception of texas... Represent less than twenty percent of the national g d p.  They are welfare states that depend.

Their names are smeared in excrement and will be for eternity. These people have no doubt convinced themselves they'll be remembered in history, but their egos don't allow them to realize they'll be remembered with utter disdain and total loathing for generations to come
They think they're going to be remembered like Jefferson, when in reality they'll be remembered like Aaron Burr."
This is the FIFTH video in a day that I heard someone's fire alarm beeping that it needs its battery replaced. üòÇ

Disturbing to see that the shallowness of American thinking extends all the way to the Supreme Court
"America treats this as a purely personal issue. But it isn't, at least not in a wider context.

So what‚Äôs the news on alito and Clarence not making public all the lavish gifts from billionaires
We have fascists at very level in this country .How can the average American defend against?
Corruption at the heart USA justice. It's the problem of corrupt political lifetime appointment who are often bribed.
"Amy Coney Barrett,  Brett Cavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch all said that Roe v Wade is settled president during their confirmation hearing which amounts to purgury."
"This is all the result of one man's lifetime quest to overturn RvW, and why he allowed Trump to remain president. 
This is evil of the highest calibure, All for the sake of ideology, in something that has NO benefit or loss to them."
No one trust the Supreme Court anymore
So phantom dark money's work behind closed doors selling out good children's everywhere.
Sickening judges
"It‚Äôs the Christian/Catholic Supreme Court now, and you liberals will henceforth refer to it as such!"
"4 of these ""judges"" are clearly NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE! Three of them appointed by Trump, 1 appointed by Bush! Thomas has shown himself to be a TOOL of the Billionaires  he sups with for a long time..."
"BS judges 
There is no fairness in the u.s. system. I give no respect to judges choose side."
She s maga also so there was some hidden petty reason I m sure
What this shows is that the Supreme Court is a political entity plain and simple.
We cant have a supreme court relisting their votes es its nit right. Our laws are our business . Also no more lifetime terms for them. Transparency.
"Please, leave abortion aside. It's a shame we have several overtly corrupt, crooked individuals, enacting laws that rule our country and society. It's an absolutely abject situation we take like it should be the norm. Thomas, Roberts,  Alito, and Gorsuch should have been investigated, tried, and put behind bars. Instead, these judges have made their own rules that make them immune to prosecution. The rest of the civilized world looks at us, laughs but feels nauseated."
"For me,  The only bombshell from this story is that ACB wanted to wait until next session. I was expecting more details about the actual leak and not the consequences. Interesting but no bombshell."

Why would you need longer than 15 weeks to make up your mind? Democrats are sick.
"LOL, if whole cemetaries can still cast votes and help the favored politician get elected.  Death should not hinder the Supreme Court.  Justice Ginsberg can still cast her vote dead or alive."
Anita Hill warned about Thomas
"They need to be shamed.   Every time they show up to court, protesters need to shout shame shame shame. They know what they did, and expect us to forget and forgive."
It's time to add more seats to the SCOTUS bench.
Alito leaked the decision- it‚Äôs not a secret. Roe was settled law so there was no reason to take it up other than to overturn it. They all lied at their confirmation hearings before the American people when they promised they wouldn‚Äôt review Roe.
"The [supreme] court is a corrupt band of MAGAT supporters. They are a clear and present danger to our democracy. Look no further than Ginny Thomas. By the way Clarence, how much does it cost to buy a supreme court justice? May be we should ask your owner, Harlan Crow."
I have no confidence at all in the us Supreme Court. It needs radical changes. Appointees by a panel and term limits to start. How is it a good idea to give anyone a job for life?
"The forces that passed all these bans in the wake of Dobbs would have worked around, if not danced and skipped around, a 15-week 'compromise'. The exceptions would still be written on air, water and sand, while the restrictions would steel-reinforced oak. They were horrible in Dobbs, but SCOTUS was also explicit: Do it because we can, and talk big about what's to come. Those two aspects were the only favors they did for reproductive rights, making it crystal clear they were there to erase progress, reason and hope."
The supreme court has too much power in all things
"These CORRUPT JUDGES need to be removed from the Supreme Court! Bribes, breaking your oath of office are illegal under the law!üá∫üá∏"
You were so close at the end when you suggested barret was only holding out because she was being pressured by the other justices that oppose the reversal of roe.... in fact its the inverse. Barret is suddenly changing and withholding her vite so get a better deal for herself from the other judges that want to reverse roe. Remember how much corrupt backdoor donations clarance thomas received and never reported. How much you want to bet all those kickbacks happened during these secret court talks they dont let the public know about.  Corrupt at the highest levels  and the only thing holding it all together for so long was justice ginsberg keeping people honest.
"Ginsberg should have retired during Obama‚Äùs presidency, she was very selfish and now women are dying"
Why hate black conservatives???? Thomas is probably the best supreme justice America has‚Ä¶ and if he went on a trip with a rich person so what there friends aren‚Äôt gonna be homeless‚Ä¶ where do you think the bidens were staying in Nantucket ???
kick out all christian judges.. no faith should be taken into account with these issues..
"''Leaks'' of explosive political decisions are never ''accidental''
Leaks are a good way to gauge the likely response  by the public when 'Officially'' announced.
All good news decisions are announced on Prime Time TV  during Prime viewing hours in a glare of publicity.
All bad news is released at 1 minute to midnight on a Saturday evening..Preferably during some or other catastrophic event, Earthquake or Hurricane or mass shooting..
Carefully choreographed"
"RBG was a remarkable person who led a courageous and honest life and made huge strides for women and all humans. 
  That said, I wish she had decided to retire early in Obama's second term."
Pack the court
Whoever leaked the decision was for sure someone affiliated with the Federalist Society and Leonard Leo. The evidence of that is that Leo had a party the night before it was released at his home in Maine with a number of big players in the effort. My money is on Alito from the jump.
Democrats had 50 years to codify Roe and decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it. I blame democrats for our liss
Imagine having a Supreme Court the composition of which is dominated by liars.
"If decision was made based on culture change and religion headings views, your reverting removing rights, as what the British government did when the first colonists came here for. Your argument option would have be all allowing of people, not history telling us this, but human rights and civilization history. It‚Äôs sad this pushed the nation backwards and looped, people die from this stuff, only hope and faith something restores the future, brighter future forward as one nation."
These MAGA GOP justices LIED UNDER OATH During their Confirmation Hearings! REMOVE THEM!
"Great reporting by New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Adam Liptak.  So Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch were very excited to get their hands on that case. Not surprising.  Alito and Thomas are the true enemies of women in America, more so than the others.  John Roberts legacy will be tainted, and he will be seen as a weak Chief Justice during his tenure. The corruption of the court is what he will be remembered for."
these people are called judges.....ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
"It is simple, there is no complete sepatation of church and state. You guys remember when Trump posed with the Bible. This should tell the influence of the Christian religion."
"Sadly, the USSC too often strikes me as the final means by which a minority view can be imposed on the majority. This is not Justice, it is tyranny."
"How Roberts Replaced Scalia ???
Scalia told Obama that ""Obamacare"" was ""UNCONSTITUTIONAL"" ! Obama started to Look for a ""REPLACEMENT"" !!!  He Interviewed Roberts, Before Scalia's, DEATH ???  Roberts Agreed, to Uphold Obamacare !  Robert's was Easily Blackmailed, for Illegally Adopting Irish Children... Obama gave Scalia one last Chance,,, when he Flew on Scalia's Plane with Scalia, to Texas. Scalia, again, said NO ! Obama then,,, Had Scalia MURDERED !!!"
They are like War-what are they good for?....Do we really need a SCOTUS! It‚Äôs like they are Gods-& can make laws that all have to abide by! But they in turn-can be bought -by the highest bidder & don‚Äôt have to be accountable to anyone. It is said - ‚ÄúNo Person is an Island‚Äù-well these SCOTUS are CONTINENTS!!!!!üò¢üòÆ

The Supreme Court has never been non-partisan. The law is always a reflection of the politics of the people. And the Supreme Court will always reflect the politics of the judges on the bench. How is that hard to understand? There is no law independent of politics.
"Republicans, one and all! Republicans are all for personal responsibility, and freedom unless we don‚Äôt approve!"
The 6 justices pictured above are no less corrupt than a Jim Jordan. It‚Äôs organized corruption in fact.
Every time you think the US cant be any more of a clown show they go and prove us wrong.
"It's not about abortion, it's about imposing control over other people.  It's about taking away the rights of females.  Next will be the right of women to vote, or the right of blacks to vote, or the right of xxx.  The movement is about removing the freedoms of the constitution away from the people of the governed. Just take as example the women in Texas who could legally get an abortion due to one of the exception, who was attacked by the attorney general of the state. Laws for the governed not for the elites."
"These judges are just like trump,a bunch of liars,"
üá®üá¶üëç
Delay to gain votes and change minds
Barrett isn't even qualified to be a Justice!  Ginsberg should have left when Obama asked her to retire
Wah wah wah. Them some tears there.
Wasn‚Äôt it Trump it‚Äôs not that hard to figure it out
The most bereft SCOTUS money can buy!
"( 7:03 ) why is Justice Samuel Alito allowed to collude with bro dude Kavanaugh about how they would vote on abortion rights?  Alito had already written the outline of how to challenge Roe v Wade, why is he allowed to know how any other Supreme Court justice will vote?"
"It doesn't ""look like"" it's about politics and power.  It IS about politics, power and most of all money.  These people are easily bribed and they don't do anything to hide it.  Nothing can be done about it because the people that have been appointed have no morals.  These are the absolute worst people in the world to appoint to lifetime positions where they have power over everyone."
Very telling that a bunch of old men demonstrate their power by deciding what women are allowed to do with their body.
"The behavior of the Right Wing super majority of the Supreme Court of the United States has done more to undermine trust and respect in that institution since before the Civil War.
Reform is long overdue."
Their appointment should not have a political attachment

üí•üí•Your Whistleblowers have been saying this for a long timeüí•üí•"
Completely pointless clip
"( 2:22 ) we already know there was no debate on *how to decide any challenge to Roe vs. Wade* - Justice Alito had already written the outline of how the Supreme Court would overturn abortion rights. That has been public for years now, but our news providers only talk about what is ""new""."
Jodi was very good. Uncanny resemblance to Tim Roth in a wig though.
No surprises that the religious bigots of the myopic regressive Roberts SCOTUS acted as such. It's who they are. From now on when any Dem in congress refers to Cheeto Mussolini he should do so as 'Der üçäF√ºhrer'.
Elito leaked it.
"I didn‚Äôt need the recap, I wish you‚Äôd have cut right to the story."
I‚Äôm not sure what is new news here. It was pretty obvious why there was a leak and the whole investigation around it a sham. Is this just confirmation?
"Supreme court of chaos robs millions of pregnant women of civil rights by abandoning their sacred duty to protect citizens from unconstitutional state legislative action criminalizing health care.
This is an autopsy. Trumputin, and his cohorts in congress made this happen, ripping the seams from the democracy of the United States."
"They should be impeached, instead of Biden, the took an oath and they stated that Roe was precedent. So they broke their oath. Why else take an oath to the constitution ? id it written on toilet paper ???"
Payback to Trump for their appointments
The judges gave in to pressure. What a shame for judges who should NEVER let outside influence sway them.
"For the judge who uses the threat of changing her vote from one position to the complete opposite, this is a political decision rather than a moral or legal one.  The leak exposes this and exposes her immorality.  Obviously, she feels no self-blame, self-guilt, nor self-disapproval for her own actions, regardless of whether the country criminalizes abortion or not.  That is unsurprising since she was placed on the bench with the other two corporate lapdogs, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, to go along with the billionaires' house laborer, Thomas.  Thomas went ten years on the court without speaking a word.  He was a Monsanto corporate lawyer who decided over their deadly cases for American agriculture.  Now the situation is volatile because without abortion, the population of unwanted children rises, and they become the Most likely ones to commit homicide.  So, homicide rates will skyrocket in fifteen to twenty years, depending on the outcome of this case.  Of course, corporate elites would prefer this to distract people from their money and asset collection."
So ironic that justice Ginsburg (who refused to resign during Obama's presidency and a pro choice supporter) death caused this law to unravel.
The fix was in. Corrupt Supreme Court.
"Do not assume this is a change of heart by the various right leaning corrupt Supreme judges. This is a political move, pure and simple, the single most contentious issue that will swing many voters in the up and coming election is women's' freedom to choose, take this issue away and many voters may return to supporting trump, a purely tactical decision!"
"It is about politics and power, not law and reason.  The Extreme Court celebrates the Fascist five."
"A great deal of discussion that ultimately changes nothing. This is an illegitimate court, purpose built for the intent of dismantling 80 + years of socially progressive jurisprudence."
"""Elections have consequences."""
"The pill is not an abortion. There is nothing but sperm swimming. No viable anything. And a man should never be able to decide. Women make up over half the population, in America and, the World. Equality Must prevail!"
"Supreme corrupt court does not see women as equal humans to men; thus they took away women's rights to healthcare and autonomy over their bodies and life decisions. America is much more fascist than we were made to believe. Notorious RBG worked so hard to finally install women's right to choose and these MAGA fascists just decided to destroy people's lives just for control purposes. Too much nasty ""religious"" people in politics that use their faith to suppress people that think differently!!!"
"You are praising her for voting ‚Äúno‚Äù on hearing the the case are over-the-top. She knew it wasn‚Äôt going to matter. 
This was her attempting to set 
 boundaries amongst her coworkers  (specifically her party members).

Kavanaugh was duplicitous at his hearing- not a leap to see he would be more so behind closed doors."
"Regardless of Barrett‚Äôs original stance against taking the case, the conservative justices overturned Roe for Dodd and now women have to travel over state lines for abortions.  They‚Äôre probably proud of themselves believing they‚Äôre doing God‚Äôs will.

I just hope the child baring women of today keep eyes on who took away their right to choose and ability to terminate non-viable pregnancies."

"Funny how certain supreme court justices who've used their federal jobs of being court employees that have enriched their and family bank accounts, whove certain scj chosen to be knowling in the pocket of dark money influences and bribery by giving luxury vacations buying homes and vaction homes and paying for schooling for family education.  And  certain actions of scj have continualy shown  that these certain scj are being corrupted and manipulated either thru blackmail attempts or finicial improvements..the doj and irs need to do investigation for rico and false tax statements, if hunter biden is being investigated by irs as private citizen than certainly by federal employee standards of received vaction .vechiles .homes education these certain sitting judges should also be investigated  in the end they are just federal employees and should be held to same standars as other employee's actions codes and ethics across america.."

"Justice Barret has seven children who had the good fortune to be wanted and born into a well-to-do family; and I do know that the well-to-do have existential problems of their own to deal with.  
But not having the financial means to properly raise a child ain't one of those problems.
1. The Supreme Court Justices should be at least subject to a limited term of civil service,  since they are not elected but appointed.
2. The Justices should always have the ever-present precedent of financial needs in mind when a mother to be makes the decision to have or Not To Have an abortion based on her future economic ability to properly take care and be able to raise her child.
3. In my Personal opinion The US. Supreme Court needs to have ""its Buble"" Bursted."
There are countries that separate all three branches of government.  Presidents are not allowed to involve themselves in installing anyone.  Legislators have no say in the other branches and the judicial are not appointed but investigated and screened by a body experts in democracy.

Senator Susan Collins should not be surprised at being deceived during the confirmation hearings of prospective justices. Any dismay she may have felt is pointless as the damage has already been done.
"This is so stupid. Amy Barrett did not change her vote for any philosophical reasons, only because voting to overturn roe v Wade too soon makes her look bad."
"It is a major disappointment when those, selected to ensure that others abide by the law and do the right thing are themselves unable to do the right thing."
"Never again should the supreme court decide against the wishes of democrats, they will be haunted, attacked and slandered until the left influences the outcome to get their way. America's long known glory downhill moving so far under these woke authoritarians"
America continues walking meekly into arms of fascism...F
SCOTUS has no room to talk about breach of trust!
"two members of the supreme court were appointed because they said R V W was law & they wouldn't support it, so shouldn't they be sacked for lying at their interview?"
"Before attempting to carry out their obvious agenda, the ""honorable"" justices would do well to remember that we all know where their homes are."
"Her point for changing her vote was to try to look less guilty.  She was never gonna be persuaded,  periodt. There was no question."
"And what  this proves, beyond a shadow of doubt, is that the decisions of the SCOTUS are strictly political sugar coated with a legalese spin."

Crooked Clarence Thomas has embarrassed himself and the court.  It will never be the same.  It has lost the respect of the nation.
We need to stop allowing judges to come from the bias and completely corrupt federalist society who we know have a blatant agenda.
"Brilliant Jodi and Adam,  for your hard work...excellent job..thank you.."
We should all be ashamed of what has happened to the Supreme Court.  Corruption is destroying our country.
This is why Biden should load the Supreme court now.
Their decision to overturn wasn't based on law. It was based on their own  personal views espoused to their supporters down the years. It was politics not law and that shows that the SCOTUS is in practical terms corrupt.
"Women who voted Republican for decades are to blame as well. They couldn‚Äôt wait to overturn Roe. 
It‚Äôs absurd watching the Trumpers get excited about things they don't understand."
How can the whole USA be held in the hands of 9 people !!!....
"A Justice who even threatens to change her vote based on a political perception, shouldn't be trusted with a SCOTUS position. They are there to interpret the law, not make it to favor their own priorities."
The Robert‚Äôs court has abandoned precedent which will allow future courts to correct the rulings of this court.
The Democrats should never again approve a Republican nominee justice if they hold a Senate majority. The duality of the GOP's handling of Garland's nomination and Barrett's appointment is so appalling and has led to a SC that in no way represents the majority sentiment of over 300m Americans. There's no point the Democrats acting with  decency and civility for future appointments in the face of this.
An unhealthy leadership leads to an unhealthy populace.
"The federalist society knew very well Amy would cave without much pressure. In spite of her switching vote to hold off taking the case, they went ahead anyway and therefore she will now be frowned upon as corrupt and rightly so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è SCOTUS is corrupted and Ailito and Thomas"
I don't understand how can someone support killing unborn human beings.
"Every one of those conservative justices lied under oath saying they would never change roe, they all did the second they got a chance. Why we are allowing any judges to come from the federal society knowing they are corrupt and have a specific agendas.  it should be common sense not to allow these people to even become judges. they are bought and paid for political operatives. And we appoint them to the highest positions and government with lifetime appointments."

Here is a thought how about someone in the media asking Merrick, Garland How is it possible that the one person who has stolen more top secret and classified documents in our history still walks free!!!!

"If ever there was a time to expand the court to 13 it is now, this would have the real effect of restoring faith in the independence of the court and removing the corrupt and corrosive effect of the American heritage foundation that has hijacked our supreme court.

"What is the purpose of the Supreme Court and how does it function?

The purpose of the Supreme Court is to adjudicate conflicts and disputes between the States and to resolve petitions for redress of grievances when properly legislated laws are made by a properly assembled and operated legislature disproportionately affect, or otherwise disenfranchise, a State.

This necessitates that the Supreme Court must be assembled by a consensus choice agreement between the States where every State participates by making a list fixed number of candidates from their own State, and the aggregate list of candidates must be reduced to a pool of judges, no less than 7 and no more than 9, for 5 judges to be selected by lot starting with the petitioner to hear and decide the dispute or grievance. The States must be involved because they have agreed to abide by the decisions of the court for their grievances and those decisions are final, not mutable, meaning they cannot be changed, or overturned, by a later court.

We tend to forget this fact today, both in the assembly, which is different than replacements for vacancies, where the President is required to provide a list of nominees for the States to consider, a number and required qualifications is determined by the States in the Senate as part of their role of Advice and Consent, and established by Senate rules for their proceedings, and the President too must be chosen by Consensus Choice with the same requirement for the States themselves to provide a list of all the candidates that will be considered for that purpose through their electors, making the President‚Äôs lists of nominees also indirectly a choice of the States.

Here is where the Supreme Court was originally established by Article IX Clause 2 of the Articles of Confederation, and the only difference established by the Constitution of the United States is that the pool of judges will be continually seated during Good Behavior, and the appointment of a Chief Justice to Preside over the Court proceedings, but not participate in the those proceedings as one of the pool of justices. Everything else is the same, including that all petitions must be made to Congress as the last resort on appeal, not directly to the court, and Congress is then required to ensure that the petition is properly adjudicated as required by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

A.IX.C.2
[The united states, in congress assembled, shall also be the last resort on appeal, in all disputes and differences now subsisting, or that hereafter may arise between two or more states concerning boundary, jurisdiction, or any other cause whatever; which authority shall always be exercised in the manner following. Whenever the legislative or executive authority, or lawful agent of any state in controversy with another, shall present a petition to congress, stating the matter in question, and praying for a hearing, notice thereof shall be given, by order of congress, to the legislative or executive authority of the other state in controversy, and a day assigned for the appearance of the parties by their lawful agents, who shall then be directed to appoint, by joint consent, commissioners or judges to constitute a court for hearing and determining the matter in question: but if they cannot agree, congress shall name three persons out of each of the united states, and from the list of such persons each party shall alternately strike out one, the petitioners beginning, until the number shall be reduced to thirteen; and from that number not less than seven, nor more than nine names, as congress shall direct, shall, in the presence of congress, be drawn out by lot, and the persons whose names shall be so drawn, or any five of them, shall be commissioners or judges, to hear and finally determine the controversy, so always as a major part of the judges, who shall hear the cause, shall agree in the determination: and if either party shall neglect to attend at the day appointed, without showing reasons which congress shall judge sufficient, or being present, shall refuse to strike, the congress shall proceed to nominate three persons out of each State, and the secretary of congress shall strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing; and the judgment and sentence of the court, to be appointed in the manner before prescribed, shall be final and conclusive; and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit to the authority of such court, or to appear or defend their claim or cause, the court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence, or judgment, which shall in like manner be final and decisive; the judgment or sentence and other proceedings being in either case transmitted to congress, and lodged among the acts of congress, for the security of the parties concerned: provided that every commissioner, before he sits in judgment, shall take an oath to be administered by one of the judges of the supreme or superior court of the State where the cause shall be tried, ‚Äúwell and truly to hear and determine the matter in question, according to the best of his judgment, without favour, affection, or hope of reward: ‚Äúprovided, also, that no State shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the united states.]"

"Listen; roe v. Wade never gave a woman the choice to have or not have an abortion. Never. The way the decision reads gives the womans Dr. The athority to make the decision wether to terminate the pregnancy or not. Over a short time Doctors would just go along with the woman's choice not because she had the right but because it makes billions of dollars every year. Abortion isn't cheap and alot of money is made from the sale of the placenta etc. Ruth Ginsburg states the decision should have gone back to the state of Mississippi. Simply because some states are very liberal and some, for example in the bible belt are very conservative 
The decision was never implemented correctly in the first place. To bad."

"The republicans majority Supreme Court was created to make law those laws republicans elites wanted but r too unpopular for congress, who can be voted out, to pass w/out losing or risking their seats. American voters need to wake up. We‚Äôve had a Republican Supreme Court for at least the past 150yrs, which would not be possible if we were a democracy. The Republican Supreme Court is also created to overturn or weaken any dem policy that does manage to pass. We saw the same thing around 1933-1970‚Äôs when FDR and dems were passing the bills we needed given the Great Depression. At first, the republican Supreme Court was oberturning or weakening every bill FDR got passed until fDR, who had large enough margins in congress threatened to expand the court. Only then did the republican Supreme Court moderated their views/decisions. I‚Äôm not sure this far-right Supreme Court would change w/threats. Even if they did, dems deserve a turn to have the majority on the Supreme Court and majority among the entire judiciary. We need to be electing more fat-left and left dems whenever possible. We need a landslide election for a far-left dem president. Landslides presidential elections r the only election that result in more significant changes. FDR, a far-left dem, won 4 landslide elections w/dems winning the majority of local, state/state legislatures, and federal government, minus the judiciary. That was a clear message to all government officials that the voters wanted change and the change FDR was bringing. We maintained FDR policies from 1933-1970‚Äôs. That all ended when voters foolishly fell for Reagan, a then far-right republican, w/a landslide election. We‚Äôve been on Reagan policies most of the time since 1980. It‚Äôs those republican policies that have brought us to where we r today. As long as we elect enough gop candidates to either give the gop majority or to have divided government, where when the minority of times dems did win majorities in the house, senate, and WH, little significant changes occurrs bc dems in purple districts r concerned about losing their seats and we have divided government where about 50% want dem/progressive policies and the other 50% want far-right dictatorship. Aside from a landslide election of a fat-left dem, we must get margins large enough to expand the court and carry that out, which means the ppl have to apply massive pressure until it‚Äôs done."

What a friend we have in Jesus,
all our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
all because we do not carry
everything to God in prayer.

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy laden,
cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge;
take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In his arms he'll take and shield thee;
thou wilt find a solace there.

"The disingenuousness of Alito is the most offensive of all. We all remember how he was pointedly questioned about the status of Roe during his confirmation, and he kept saying that in his opinion, it was a matter of firmly settled precedent. His insincerity is breathtaking."
"The only reason Roe was overturned is the far left and Gen Z either voted for Trump or Jill Stein, or stayed home to protest Hillary, and elected Trump in 2016. And the crazy thing is, they are doing it again in 2024."

"So you can‚Äôt confirm that the leak was definitely Alito


Right‚Ä¶ got it"
I think all of the Supreme Court Justices who stated that Roe was established precedence indicated that they would not overturn Roe during their confirmation hearing should be impeached.

The Supreme Court is staffed by politicians masquerading as judges. It‚Äôs shameful. It‚Äôs wrong. It needs to be changed. Increase the number of judges to 12 (like a jury in the past) and give the chief justice a casting vote!
Supreme Court nor politics have no place making a decision over a women‚Äôs body..  This is a decision between a woman and her doctor.  The majority of people making such decision is(old men) senior citizens:-(
"My theory is that it was one of the conservative justices who leaked it, to damp the outrage when the decision was to officially announced."

"Call it what it is court of bribery, the justices that are in there now was more a test on how much money is a chosen verdict cost. (Edit) Also not the first time Kavanaugh lied about doing something at a minimal morally wrong if not illegal in court."
The Supreme  Court  is a  good  example  of our entire  country  being corrupt. Its about  politics  and power.  Not law and justice.
"I think the biggest thing that we should not forget about these justices is that they LIED.    Each, under oath, were specifically asked about Roe vs. Wade.  They ALL said that it was considered settled law.  They said that knowing full well that they were lying. They were intending to up end settled law.  This turned the Supreme Court from a judicial body into a political one.  Yet no one wants to address the fact that basically they had committed pergery to get their jobs.  And now we know they were given their jobs to do exactly that.  They were chosen by the Federalist Society because they were known to be willing to lie in order to achieve the highest-ranking court in
 the land with the help of the Federalist Society.
In my opinion, this single act has discredited the whole institution.  Once you lie, you can not ever be trusted.
Amy Barrett is the worst of them because she professes Christianity.  The 10 commandments clearly state, ""Thou shalt not commit false witness.""  So she isn't even a true Christian.  She has lied before her God."

"This is the beginning of the end of SCOTUS.  They have declared their corruption and made their rulings illegitimate.  They have made themselves nothing by the abuse of their power.

Even a powerful group can delegitimize their power and authority by abusing it.  Flagrant abuse of power and obvious corruption has a corrosive effect on the roots of the body politic.  SCOTUS may continue to exist in some form, but they have destroyed the basis of their authority.  Which is not the Constitution,  but the citizens' belief in the *idea* of the fairness and impartiality of SCOTUS.  The Constitution is an important document - but all governments exist due to the consent of the people.  Once belief is destroyed (and it is) the inevitable corrosion of the power begins."
"The entire American system of judges being political is moronic.  The British system has non-political system for judges which is a million times better.

People in the US can't get a fare trial because the political position of the judge decides whether someone will be found guilty and not whether someone has broken the law.

What laws are should be decided by people who are elected not unelected like these judges, this is undemogratic."
All this behind the scene politicking between just the justices show how little they consider or care about the purpose of their job. Like them being so concerned about public perception of themselves and when or how long they should take before taking any specific case and all this... it doesnt serve their appointed position or the country.
The current Supreme Court is illegitimate.

Yo why does that guest look like a dude but dressed like a woman?
Disgusting beyond articulation
The court shouldn‚Äôt back pedal on people‚Äôs rights
Window of persuasion? There doesn‚Äôt appear to be any change of opinion to take away an existing right. The NYT still playing ‚Äúboth side-ism‚Äù.
"The corruption in the supreme court is mind boggling
They have to drag the justice's out of the court and fire them and disbar them"
ARE THEY THE SUPREME COURT JUDGES OR PERHAPS ENEMIES OF MILLIONS OF DECENT HARD WORKING AMERICANS!
I want a public accounting of how many abortions were purchased by every member of congress and Donald Trump.  Hypocrites.
Weak reporting.  They know full-well who leaked the decision - it was to make sure none of the conservative judges switched their votes - because they'd get death threats from their rabid supporters if they did.
Why is she trying to sugar coat ACB? Stop trying to launder that ideologue.
ruth's body wasn't even cold
It‚Äôs up to the States to decide Abortion. Abortion is not a Constitutional right.  So abortion it legal/illegal depending what State you live in.   What‚Äôs the issue
"Ya ya ya.... Blah blah blah.... Everything is a bombshell or breaking News with all these criminals, and yet nothing happens to them! So why bother? üôÑ"
The US Suoreme Court is the most fraudulent group of Reublican Stormtroopers . God please add new Justices to take the number of justices to 11. They lack any intellectual integrity or honesty . DISGUSTING.
"Vote Trump  , Democrats are a joke"
So this is just proof of hypocrisy from the scotus? By the entire right calling kb a political appointee they were just projecting what this court would become: a political vehicle for unpopular legislation to pass. The amount of hypocrisy from Alito saying how Democratic controlled states would not abide by his ruling while he allows GOP control states to put up the middle finger to scotus decisions. In the history books this Court is going to be seen as both anti-american and anti-democratic
"The breach of trust was when these robed lying pigs said R vs W was settled case law but then overturned it. It‚Äôs not the supreme court, it‚Äôs the lying cheating hypocritical court."
Amy Coney-Barret was only concerned with her own legacy. She is not less reprehensible than originally thought. She was driven by self interest.
"As a woman with two daughters in their 20s, I am very relieved that we do not live in America! I feel desperately sorry for women who live in the GOP states, these Taliban-like, medieval states that dictate what women do with their bodies! It's 2023 for goodness sake!!!"
And who should we thank for the this mess? Trump !! He put three judges on the court who made this nightmare happend
"Oh surprise, the court that was stolen by the Republicans under Mitch by abusing the system of appointing justices then decided to impose their personal religious views on the American people while being corrupted at its core by billionaire influencers with similar religious views, and the way they did that was even more corrupt and sinister."
Cavanaugh has resting punch me face.
Breach of Trust is the court of liars..
Term.     Limits.
üòÆwhy no one just say 4 of these so call justices lied to congress and they lied to the people
And then people are blamed for being swept away by conspiracy theories. This doesn‚Äôt bode well because it injured women across the country and this very much damaged the court.
"Chris used the word 'jurisprudence' in the same sentence as 'Supreme Court', lol."
"After the GOP STOLE a SCOTUS seat and five of the Justices voted to overturn law they ALL acknowledged was ""settled law"" in their confirmation hearings, I can only see SCOTUS as a Kangaroo Court at this point...  and THEN you've got Thomas's and Alito's indiscretions and clear conflicts of interest as well...  how can anyone respect this body at this point?"
"I already read the NYT article. Where is the ‚Äúbombshelll about the leak? There, in the NYT report, it even says that no one knows who leaked the report. Still."
"They, SCOTUS justices,  are 100%corrupt,  because they know they are above the law and they have jobs for life . I'm starting to feel that dictators, such as Pukin, for example, are more trustworthy than American government officials . Why, you may ponder,  because they are honest about their intentions to stay in power and keep control over their ppl, no matter what they have to do . I'm not saying they are good or admirable by any stretch of the imagination but, at least the citizens know what's going on in the minds of their leaders  . American government, on the other hand,  is full of lying,  cheating, corrupt ppl who smile in our faces and stab us in our backs, all while denying everything"
When was the last time a conservative spoke without lying? Not in my lifetime and I'm 62.
Why can't those justices be impeached for lying under oath..
"Is this journalist really trying to tell me that ACB had a slight moment of self awareness even though that theocratic nightmare overturned Roe anyway?  That's super gross and disingenuous. What do y'all mean what is happening? They were appointed, NG's seat was full on stolen, precisely exactly to overturn Roe. And duhhhh it was leaked by Alito's dinner buddies to cement the vote, duh. It didn't do the Dems any better to leak it just 6 weeks earlier either way it was before the midterm."
The supreme Court has been bought and those justices that accepted bribes should be in prison!
"It has been so long since I heard anything on this srory. And of course now it is being drowned out by the horror stories coming out ss the result of the overturning of Roe vs Wade..But I am glad that people are still looking into this. There is clear evidence here that the ethics of the Supreme Court has be irreparably compromised. The more we hear about this, the deeper the rabbit hole goes. 

The irony is, if Roberts had managed to push Roe vs Wade to 15 weeks we wouldn't be in this mess. The right would still be trying to push back the date, but we'd all be naiive and complacent snd letting them continue to do it. Instead, ee've got Lindsey Grahan saying ""Well, what about 15 weeks?"" And we're all like, ""Oh, no, we were willing to go for that, but that wasn't good enough for you! You had to have a total ban or nothing!""

Honestly I don't know why the Supreme Court hasn't turned on itself yet. I don't know how they can pretend to trust each other."
Didn't this actually happen over a year ago?
"Hey! From what you are saying, it's almost as if the SCOTUS judges are not quite honest .... !"
Amer*ca: where they celebrate your t*ts (Hooters) but they regulate your cl*ts (SCOTUSSS üêç)
This is a kangaroo court anyway. They all believe in the great white replacement theory.
Thank Mitch McConnell
NY TIMES.....Gets it right every time. Thank you.
Ginsburg should have stepped down long before she did. Anyone with any sense knows she was not ruling in her last years definitely not the day she died but she was a democrat pawn and they used her vote however they chose. Trump picked out of a list provided to him so a group of people put a list of people they wanted and Trump picked his choice of their list. Ginsburg's selfeshness to stay relevent hurt the democrats no one else the process and life moves on. I find it ironic a woman is picked to be a supreme court mainly because she was black and a woman  becomes a justice and then for the first time in history of the country we have a leak.
This is what happens when you don't have term limits and you don't have Justice in the supreme Court they're bigger crooks than people on the streets but yet they're allowed to stay there Thomas should have been gone a long time along with many others who have been proven to be just as guilty as himüò¢
This is collusion. Political collusion. These justices should be tried.
"Oh the divisive left, strange bedfellows, like Joe and Kamala, Bill and Hillary, or Dylan and bud light."
"I don't buy the argument that the new radical, right-wing justices seriously considered going back on their oath to the Federalist Society cabal to overturn Roe.  It has been building to this for a very long time. As the right-wing, theocratic, anti-constitutionalists that they are, albeit that they claim to be strict constructionists observing ""plain meaning, it was always clear that they could hardly wait for Ginsberg to die.  Why else did they lie openly and operate corruptly during the selection process to get anti-Roe, fundamentalist Catholics on the court?"
"Double win for the right wing extremists. The supreme court has lost all legitimacy as a fair arbiter, which further damages democracy, as well as making arbitrary undemocratic decisions."
"How can you have them for life? This is why corruption grows in Supreme Court, look at Clemens ü§®"
"Our not-so-supreme court, full of corruption and injustice."
If Trump wins in 2024 there could very well be pressure for Thomas to resign do he can be replaced with another young conservative judge.
"Everybody has the right to LIFE,liberty and happiness.except an innocent,unborn child."
5 rotten liars.
RBG had just passed a health screening btw
leo.....all over this he is.
"Any Judge who uses their personal beliefs and/or their political affiliation to make a judgment is not being impartial and should not be serving as a Judge.  We have too many on the Court now that are doing just that, and some are in the pockets of some wealthy people, is that being ethical or having any integrity?  I think it is time for some real changes in how they are selected and voted in, and having some strict oversight over all their actions. in fact, the way things are now, we need this for all our Public Servants and not have any Political party involved.  Yes, the Supreme Court Justices are Public Servants."
SCOTUS is illegitimate.
"I guess Coney Barrett and Kavanaugh were reluctant to take the case up immediately since they had just recently testified that Roe was established law during confirmation hearings just a few months earlier. I guess they figured the public memory is very short, but in this case the public still remembered they were lying during their confirmation. 

Just another in a long line of politicizing the Supreme Court under John Roberts, who stalled on partisan gerrymandering until wavering justice Kennedy retired and Gorsuch took the seat Merrick Garland should have had. And they wonder why respect for the Supreme Court has plummeted under Roberts. He's the head of the judicial branch of the evangelical and corporate controlled Republican Party, not a non-biased judiciary that respects the constitution and decades old precedents confirmed over the years in judicial decisions. And of course second guessing what the men who wrote the constitution intended. Which miraculously always ends up being what they want it to be. As if James Madison could envision civilian weapons capable of killing 20 people in one minute, or that massive corporations would control taxes and limit the right of workers to exert power through assembling in unions. Originalism is one of the biggest cons the court has foisted on the public since the early 1900s."
No ore lies like the new York try imes
It sounds like they got even.
If you have already taken a side on a case before it's happened you Don't deserve any official seat nor are you qualified to fill it.
I think the Supreme Court judges should either ride a horse or pedal a bike 35 miles to work each day. Let's see how many of them want to stay after that.
Wimpy ü§ìnewsguy Newstime
"They violated the rights of every woman and girl in the Country.
They violated their paths, several lied under oath"
"This is corrupt kangaroo court, DEMS should get fill the courts with more judges to protect this country"
"Oh, yeah. That leak to Rupert Murdoch."
Such a bunch of  weirdos on the Supreme Court. Get rid of the compromised weirdos
The abortion debate is not about right and wrong. It is about cannon fodder and defense industry labor. In 1973 we were done with war. Now war is in the offing...
All I can say is I told you so...they just want to sort how to take rights away and this was just the beginning...and yes they were waiting for her to die change laws and they were not going to be transparent with people in this country...and they never will be...I guess I am amazed that you were shocked...this is a test run... They will look at other rights...
The justices aren‚Äôt so  just.
Bring back Medhi
"So all 3 Trump appointed Justices are LIARS. 
All 3 LIED during their confirmation hearings."
WHY TF DIDN'T SHE RETIRE WHEN SHE SHOULD HAVE. RBG's arrogance undid her good entirely and aided their evil. shame.
The current Supreme Court is one big breach of trust!
Supreme court must to stop Biden to help Isreal‚Äôs war.
You know what was a breach of trust? OVERTURNING ROE V WADE!!
The supreme pos court.
It's ok if Trump becomes president there will be no Supreme Court because dictatorship don't need them
"I wonder how many women have died through illegal""back street""abortions since Roe v Wade was rescinded?"
The fact that a republican appointed judge to a Supreme Court already has an agenda on an issue like this is bulshit
The current court is illegitimate. We all know it.
"It's been pretty obvious to me from the beginning that Alito or one of his staff leaked the draft to have exactly the effect that it caused, ending any chance to change any votes."
If you are going to allow abortion up to 15;16;20 weeks there shouldn‚Äôt be any restrictions at all.  Women past those dates needing abortion are for medical reasons.  But men would never understand that
Although they cannot expose who leaked ‚Ä¶ personally I suspect Justice Thomas or someone on his staff was the leak.  But it was just a suspicion and we do not convict someone on suspicions.
"Al Franken said he believes it was Samuel Alito who leaked it to seal the votes ahead of the final voting, just as suggested here. And since they never found the one who leaked it, this makes perfect sense."
"""breach of trust""??? more like an eye opener to the inner corruption and political orientation of the highest court-- and it s melding with $$$$ interests -- forget precedent???? what rabbit hole is this Country sinking into? rights won... rights taken...."
The only people who support the killing of the unborn are Godless people.
"""Government has no say over the body of a pregnant woman, but does have unlimited power over the body of everyone else"".  - Democrats"
Why don't we ever talk about the fact that Trump acknowledged in a media interview in the 80's that he'd paid for 3 abortions of girlfriends?
"""A breach of trust"" from a radical, activist hack who's protecting corrupt SOB Repugnican operatives in the SCOTUS?!?
Reich Wingers are _SO_ lucky hypocrisy isn't lethal."
Conservatives will not be happy until they ruin our nation.
"When you fear integrity and accountability, you are NOT the good guys!"
"The religious right are trying to impose their religious beliefs on to the people of America, separation of church and state."
"Without hate or fear in your heart, the Republican party can't control you."
"The Supreme Court is disgusting and a joke!  I've given up on our country! üò¢ It's hard for me to feel proud of my country anymore. Why does any count have a right to tell me what to do with my body. My neighbor or friend is pro-life and that's great, but why should they decide for me their belief. Maybe I don't believe in their church of choice, but should I be forced to go to their church because that's their belief."
There is no honor or objectivity in the Supreme Court.  It's just another group of politicians.
"In  Canada, Justices have a 25 year term limit, and must retire at 75. Just sayin....."
"""It's no longer about justice and reason; it's about power"". This is our theocratic present with the GOP dark money SCOTUS."
I honestly believe the GOP was PAID to tear their own country apart.
"Republicans are liars.
These liars are imperial legislators masquerading as impartial judges."
"Roberts is a disgrace as chief justice.  And, he's too old to grow a pair."
"So am i understanding that during the pre-leak time that it was actually possible one of the conservatives may have been considering upholding the Roe v Wade decision if it was a private vote/decision but the leak forced them to do what they were being pushed to do by upending it? Which seriously makes me question if it comes from one of the conservative judge group. I got that with how the woman was talking through the video. Or I'm wrong and its still likely one of the Progressive side that did it in hopes it'd shame them in order to keep precedence. I just don't see any true ""conservative beliefs"" in how that Court handles it. Them and the Republican party are trying to force a political view/stance/opinion that is gradually going away but use tactics and behavior that doesn't feel conservative or morally right that real conservatives speak of. Lots of that side are fakes who don't really believe in conservation or whatever they say: recent example would be the Moms for Liberty group founder revealed to have done non-conservative bedroom activities. They're all hypocrites and liars."
"For some reason, I can just imagine the Justices looking in the mirror, in the morning, saying ‚ÄúI AM THE LAW‚Äù like Judge Dread."
"i mostly hate feminists but on this one even i can't disagree this is just pure misogyny... absolutly disgusting, these people are not christians"
"Why exactly, is this news a ""Bombshell?"""
Ginsburg said years ago she truely believed that Roe VS Wade was in orrectly adjudicated and she believed it would eventially be overturned.
THEY ARE DOING THE SAME W VOTING RIGHTS
I wish I had access to the article because I didn't follow this.ü§î
Cavanaugh  is a right wing zellot!
SCOTUS is bought and paid for.  America is over.
To me I think it's obvious that Ginni Thomas is the leaker
They have destroyed an entire branch of government
"üëâ Obviously ""THEY"" knew all along exactly what they intended to do. Each and everyone totally lied during their confirmation. Nice to know that the Right Wing justices on our highest court in the land are just simply LIARS !!! üò°"
This Supreme Court is illegitimate. Expanding the court is the only option.
This is what it looks like!  MEN WANT TO TAKE AWAY WOMEN'S RIGHTS!
Pffffsssssssss‚Ä¶..
"Just wait until the bought and paid for supreme court gives the Koch family all they ever wanted, to destroy the US government. Once the corrupt justices rule that the US government can no longer regulate anything, the country will grind to a halt."
1 year delay doesn't seem like an evolution of the law... it still very much feels political.
Turning women into secons class citizens is FAR more evil and enraging and horrible than who leaked the draft.
"RBG was selfish. Obama was in the WH and should have had an appointee. Ginzberg had had many close calls and was obviously  working on fumes concerning her health. Yet she clung to power, leaving us with Barrett.  
It's difficult to get over her hubris; her belief that only she could do it; extending her time in the sun. I was angry."
"Impeach all Republicans 
Trump For Prison 2024"
Leak=timed release to the press to keep people distracted
"SCOTUS -Guaranteed a lifelong  job with power since 1789...once a human gets power U find out what their all about. Everybody has a personal agenda ...I just can't believe that it took 234 years for the dirty laundry  to be revealed...The Law of the Land....I hope the corrupt judges that have already been identified, get  removed from the bench....there are terms for political offices  and so should there be terms of 2, 4 or 6 yrs at the most.  As a youth I constantly haunted my parents about the SCOTUS setup, and how could this be a part of a democratic society and I think I got my answer - not what we have been led to believe is ALL GOOD‚Åâ Please fight to save our freedom Vüß¢TE üóΩ"
"So, they agreed with RBG that Roe v Wade was bad law, and should be decided by states."
Abortion is murder point blank.
The amount of comments supporting murdering innocent life is crazy evil .
Thanks so much for doing this piece Chris!
"Four of the conservative justices on SCOTUS are proven liars.
This court is  USA's supreme arbiter of law.
Such is the ethical standard of  USA."
"‚ÄúRoe Roe Roe your votes gently down a stream
merrily merrily merrily merrily‚Äîabortion rights were but a dream‚Äù"
She also wrote decisions prior to her appointment that clearly show she supported anti abortion.
This goes to show how desperate the labour party is
"I thought this click-bait was about the SCOTUS ""leak"".   Nothing in this really focuses on the ""Leak""."
"Imagine if American women were legally allowed to forego motherhood through abortion and adoption, without being legally responsible; yet American men are unable to legally forgo fatherhood without permission from women and are forced to be legally responsible. Double standards and female privilege are fun kids. Hands off women's bodies, Hands off men's bodies"
too much power for too long with no controls LEADS TO CORRUPTION
"The labour party is looking for votes trying to rile up the women's  vote the labour party is lame and disgusting, msnbc you are disgusting"
This is sickening now that we are now hearing this‚Ä¶ how disgusting‚Ä¶.
"SCOTUS

"The Supreme Fraud. These court traitors are bought off by the Koch Brothers and other billionaire neo conservatives. Shame on them; they need to be impeached, convicted, and ousted!"
and people wonder why conspiracy theories are so prevalent...
Should have been investigated ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù. Is Roberts trying to save face‚Ä¶just think‚Ä¶ they may be hearing Trump‚Äôs immunity claim??? This is very scary. The decision was political period‚Ä¶.
Inappropriate?  Sounds like a job for Thomas!
So much for basing any decisions on the law.
Typical NYT apologist.
"Enough BSNBC, who freaking leaked the report???, why is this so hard...
Who leaked the report, who leaked the report, who leaked the report, who leaked the report, who leaked the report,????"
Like we are gonna take MSNBC seriously
The Supreme Court is corrupt . How can we trust judges who can‚Äôt be held accountable or punished in any way? Thomas along should be removed for working with Billionaires.
SCOTUS best supreme court money can buy.
"Those very white people will nit lije bsbies being left on thier door steps . Let one of thoer daughters get pregnant . D AND C , NICE AND LEGAL ."
IMO‚Ä¶It was intentionally leaked before the actual decision was announced to quell the potential backlash and unrest that would have occurred if was announced on a Special Report on TV‚Ä¶
"The Supreme Court, and therefore the entire justice system, is tainted and untrustworthy. It is shocking how low the United States has fallen. Facts are arguments don't matter. The Supreme Justices have already made up their minds. They only want to get appointed in order to impose their will and turn women into forced-birth wombs for the State."
"Roberts is a  hayseed travesty of a justice,"
"This sounds like a big nothing.  An appeal was made by a state, and the justices considered how to proceed.  They tried to persuade one another.  Something that happens in most cases.  As far as delaying the case, and not telling this to the public, this is up to them to decide.  SCOTUS will take up a case, and decide it when they decide it. Nothing super unusual going on here."
Defund the Supreme Court. They no longer represent justice
JOE BIDENS HOLE FAMILY MUST STAND TRIAL
Look at all the baby killers thristy for fetal blood in the comments. Sick. Satanic
"If it was a Liberal Justice, it would of 100% been reported to the press... that's how you know who leaked it."
"The people who invoke the bible (or ""buy bull"" as I call it) in this debate cherry pick to extremes.   And?   It is usually MEN who decide about women's rights.   Yeah.   Not good."
How old is this bombshell?
The leak is a breach of trust but lying through your teeth about your intentions before the committee deciding if you should be appointed isn‚Äôt a total breach of trust to the entire country.
"We have the votes. Now we just need to fill in ""the law."""
This is a ‚Äúwhat about is is I‚Äôm‚Äù and no one give a flying Fuxk about it!!!  It should been at the state level always!!!  Full Stop!!!

Who else thought they clicked on the wrong video? üòÇ
How the politicians treated RBG after her death was nothing short of criminal.
It was a pre-determined verdict in search of a case.
"Ok, the Stock market is now the highest ever, and did not plummet like Trump projected, and Biden created 14 million jobs, more then the last 4 Republican presidents together, and oil production is far far higher then under Trump. Still we need to support Trump as Trump is the only one who will join the Russian alliance of Russia, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea and Nicaragua. We need to become close to these countries and stop our Western alliances! Also, only Trump will support the top 1% incomes of the USA! Also women rights went out of hand!!"
"I feel these Justices decided on their own religious beliefs and not on our constitutional rights.  I feel in doing so they gave permission to states to become dictorial over women and caused pain and suffering to women who are being forced to carry unviable fetus' and in some cases forced to surrender their own lives.  They are threatening doctors to lose their licenses if they make decisions that are best for their patients.    Brett Kavanaugh and Amy C. Barrett have proven themselves untrustworthy because they said before our country they would not overturn laws that have already been established, such as abortion.  Then President Trump revealed he would use the Supreme Court to pass laws according to his voters religious beliefs instead of our Constitutional freedoms.   All three of these persons have proven to be untrustworthy as well as unconstitutional.  This leak is important, I feel the motive is to show how Amy C. Barrett wanted to deceive the people by rejecting the case but knowing full well she would vote based on her own religious beliefs and not our constitutional rights.  This leak proves how untrustworthy this conservative SCOTUS is. And even more important to point it out  due to the upcoming vote on whether a president is immune from criminal prosecution."
"The Supreme Politicians of the United States presented the reversal of Roe vs Wade was an opinion based on reasoning that the court should not make the laws but only interpret them. Laws are the responsibility of the congress or the state. This reasoning is a complete hypocrisy while qualified immunity is still being applied, it was created by the supreme court and is used in states where no ""laws"" exist for or against. If the court reverses Roe, it should also remove any use of qualified immunity where no state or federal laws are applied after all the court doesn't make laws.
-MG"
The supreme court is not relevant anymore. They can't be trusted and should be disbarred.
IT WAS ALITO.
Amy Barrett and Clarence Thomas are disgusting pieces of filth.  Cavanaugh also.
"Wow,,"
"A key factor in Trump getting the 2016 GOP nomination was he agreed to stack SCOTUS.  This was pivotal in him gaining the nomination.

This leak is motivated by many of the lawyers working in the court who respect the law above politics and are disgusted at the stacking of the court they see justice as being one eyed. They have had enough.  Alito is not a Judge he is an agent."
What is hard to understand it's back to each individual state?? I don't really understand what everyone is so upset about? If you want an abortion go to the state where it's legal? You don't have to broadcast to the world what you're doing. I'm sure the abortionist won't tell. Most people want to vote on it... we are a republic... voting counts.
"There was no true window of ""persuasion!"" The SC is corrupt and the hubris is outrageous."
"‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt say for certain who leaked it‚Ä¶ But we know the deliberative process was at play‚Ä¶ and then the leak comes along, and those efforts are hopeless.‚Äù 

So‚Ä¶ Alito."
AHH YES!! Justice Barrett the hero for not wanting to take it earlier upon giving the Optics that she might be considered to blame for the law of Roe versus Wade being rescinded. So is this what MSNBC is now ? You guys now celebrate the mediocracy of politics?
Barrett only voted no because of political reason's at 1st. The next term she would have been fine with it. Her no vote was just to make it look good. She's no hero here.
Where does the Judicial oversite committee stand where there is evidence of compromised Justices being bought and sold which subjects the SCOTUS to Rule on matters based on personal emotion while withholding logic.
Unelected Kings and Queens with Supreme power for life.  Does that should like democracy to you?
Maybe presidents who didn't win the popular vote shouldn't pick judges?! Or remove the entire process from  partisanship! ?
This is a gross anomaly.  It will be overturned.  The only question is how long it will take.
Talibangelicals. Women are livestock in these people‚Äôs eyes.
"You know who leaked it , the same one that leaked last time . Starts with an ""A"""
SCOTUS is a corrupt institution. A great country cannot remain great when the justice system is corrupt.
It's not about strategy it's about THE LAW (something SCOTUS has completely forgotten about)
"""We just don't know"". Here's some more worthless discussion on the fact that ""We just don't know""."
Strange this woman claims she is able to read justices minds.  Get that woman a crystal ball.
Hmm‚Ä¶ Did the leak come from the Alito camp?
Still baby murder
The person who leaked this information is at least lacking integrity but more likely absolutely a criminal and got paid BIG bucks from Biden admin and Democrats.  Clear this absolutely benefited Biden‚Äôs corrupt Administration
Sure is interesting of him how all of the right-wing bot farms are targeting progressive channels and comment sections and YouTube does nothing about it.
Murder has never been a  right.
"Woman is not too smug,huh? Knows it all... another one üòÆ"
Any and every courts authority hinges on perception of its neutrality.
"This shows that the Supreme Court is now nothing but extremist Conservative politics and NOT actual law and order. This nation no longer has a system of law and order and once again its thanks to right wing Republicans conservatism as it's all about power grabbing and destroying democracy, burning the constitution and setting up a Russia style autocracy government under only right wing politics."
More propaganda. Big liars.
Political judges have lost all credibility. The day is coming when they will be ignored and even pushed aside.
All the SCOTUS did was took Roe v Wade out of Federal hands and handed it down to State by State laws.
I got a question. if we are over taxed under represented and can't choose our laws. what is the point of that system? we have reached a new low if justices are 'pocket judges'..
Only Trump's Supreme Court can fix this.
Blatantly political RIGHT WING justices who were hellbent on an outcome instead of following jurisprudence...and we've learned that John Roberts is not up to the heft and import of his job.
"The Supreme Court has become as twisted and corrupt as the current GOP, and taking away our faith in justice. The lunacy of the Republican Congress, the MAGA cult, is all based on lies. Trump has the record for more lies than any politician in Americas history. To see our country go down this path is disgraceful, and aggravating. Lock Trump up and shut him up."
If some leftist clerk thought the leak would save Roe....    And the leak cemented the positions....then that Asshat shot themselves in the foot.  The pro-life side should thank them if they are ever caught.
"With the Court‚ÄôsRoe decision, the Court lost even the pretense of being impartial.  The Court. Has become an extension of the Republican Party."
"OMG!  What a painful segment.  Why did this steal 10 minutes from my life?  Can I have my 10 minutes of life back?  What is the point of all of this?

They are judges, they talk among themselves, they have to discuss their opinions and the language that goes into it.  WHAT IS THE POINT!!! What is the purpose of this?"

"What's the bombshell, Pat the It?"
Just plain corrupt. PERIOD!
The deck was stacked when wealth began to be concentrated. SCOTUS has been focusing on their grand theories & forgetting the lives of 90% of Americans.  The ones without money to pay for lawyers & donate to politicos.
Can't Supreme court Justices be Impeached?.ü§î
Overturning Roe led to the open corruption today with Thomas and Alito.  Using deceit like this paved the way by introducing political considerations.
"Blacks get the most abortions, win win"
"Abortion isn't a guaranteed right under the Constitution, and Roe was poorly decided; challenged by fetal recognition as human by lower courts; especially in homicide prosecution. Increasing fetal viability during gestation further weakened Roe. Abortion assigned to the People to decide under the Tenth Amendment with legislators answerable to constituents is best."
We have fell into the mindset that killing our babies is a personal right. This is an immoral way of thinking and it has been politicized where people don't even realize how it has marginalized to an extent to where they are playing god and that each fetus is a fleshand blood human and the act is murder. Stand in a mirror and tell yourself that you were once a fetus
"Everyone forgets that there are 9 supreme court justices, 5 were nominated by republican presidents and 4 were nominated by democrat presidents.
The ruling was 6 to 3 with judge roberts voting against overturning roe v wade that made the vote 4 republican justices for and 1 against.
Where did the other 2 votes come from?
roe v wade was overturned because 2 democrat appointed justices voted yes.
Everyone is blaming the wrong the wrong group, it was overturned because the democrat justices voted yes to overturn it.
Wake up the democrats don't care about women's rights they only care about controlling power.
Think of how much money the democratic party has made pushing this issue."
"Impeach the whole Supreme Court and replace the with term limits and congress interview of appointees with a special election to be approved by the public, we vote for the Supreme Court along with the president every 4 years, they can‚Äôt get any more corrupt"
"I love at 6:50 how Jodi Kantor says, ""Yeah, I see what you're saying but here's another perspective."""
"Great the right has  cheated to get in the court. They have been taking bribes while on the court.
Now we hear that they don't care about law because they are more equal than  the 215.000,000,000 people in the country who think abortion should be available."
So it probably Alito who leaked it.
"Why can't she tell us who leaked it?  Does she know who did?  What happened to the Republicans ""investigating relating to the leak?"""
MSNBC saves my political sanity. Confirmation bias? Sometimes. Sometimes not. But my tribe üòá
"They're already corrupt, might as well get paid for it."

After all these years we are finding out justice is not blind.
Cases are decided by powerful people behind the curtain.
"Amy Coney Barrett said when questioned in the Senate hearing for her nomination, ""Roe v Wade is the Law of the Land"" ""I would not change that."" So she and Kavanaugh lied, which is illegal I thought."
"Pro-life people will never convince pro-choice and vice versa. Never. Even if you could prove when life began pro-choice people wont care. There will NEVER be all one way or all the other. You either compromise or we keep going back and forth. The supreme court was right, until congress passes a federal law it is a states rights issue. Stop blaming conservative justices for basing law on the constitution. That is their job and they ruled on the case before them not the hypothetical in their nomination hearings. There neds to be a compromise on a federal level and put it to bed. Enough is enough. MSDNC stop acting as the moral authority, you could not be more bigoted and biased."
Alito did it himself to torpedo the compromise Breyer and Roberts were lobbying for. It also reminded me of how RBG undermined Roe by hanging on when Obama could have made an appointment had she stepped down.
"So if these hookers said they wouldn't reverse Roe, but now reversed that, are they not impeachable?"
VOTE BLUE
"Remember,  justices serve  based on ""good behavior "". Justices are not guaranteed a lifetime appointment. That's one reason why SCOTUS dont want an ethics standard."

Always remember that everyone who voted for Trump in 2016 is responsible for this.

Over 60 million children murdered by abortion and these two are talking about politics.
I think the Supreme Court needs to go.
Are their confirmation hearings done under oath?   They all lied about the support of overturning Roe.  ‚Äú It‚Äôs settled law‚Äù.  I feel betrayed.
"Back when the first leak happened I said there were 13 more decisions than were written more than 3 years before ACB was put on the SC.
She wrote these decisions a decade ago, to destroy rights in America.

The person who leaked the 14 decisions installing a Sharia Law government and Religious Law, they were VERY clear with the people that they gave copies.

They told them when they could release the other decisions before they are handed out, but there were other notes that she wrote about Making sure they don't take away birth control before they have a majority in the house and senate and they have a Republican president.

The conspiracy is super clear in her notes that go back a decade

The BIG question is, WHO GOT THESE FILES OFF HER LAPTOP??!!!

This has to be someone who had intimate access to her

Most likely someone who was in her house A LOT

I believe she knows for sure and I think the SC knows now who it is that got the files off her laptop.
And it is a person in her inner circle and they did not know this person was not a true believer and they believe in freedom, not religious law, and is a Traitor to her and the other half of the government who want Sharia Law and ban all birth control and make it a death penalty for anyone who is caught trying to get it.

Some day we will know who the leaker is, and it may be one of her kids.
Or her husband."
is there anybody still trusting this fraudsters? they are lawless and still have the power to do what they want. why don't they chance the law in senat or congress - well wherever in US law is installed? why are they not in prison? the whole world knows they got paid for their ruling. us US now a lawless nation? what is it worth???
The Supreme failure...
These new ‚Äújudges‚Äù are money plants in the Supreme Court
"While I certainly understand it's a matter of contention, I don't understand where it's a ""right"" to end a life at its beginning.   I personally have seen several times where abortion was used as a form of birth control. There are dozens of forms of birth control, abortion should not be one of them."
"Roe V Wade was decided based on policy preference not what is constitutional. Supposedly it was based in a right of medical privacy. But Homicide was never subject to 4th amendment protection. It""s a shame that it took strategic planning and politics to allow a correct ruling. It should have never taken 50 years."
Anybody with common sense will not vote for biden.
Joe biden is a War criminal.
They should have this removed and put back as was. As it only hurt Republicans. They have been losing to Democrats like crazy ever since. And even if Trump gets to run he will never win because of this. As long as abortion is not returned to as was. Trump and his GOP will lose more and more power.
"I don‚Äôt want fake judges in the Supreme Court 
These are fake judges"
Who is upholding the constitutional rights to ones person?
How sad Ruth Bader Ginsburg was replaced by the nutty Amy Coney Barrett. Breaks my heart. RBG was so brilliant.
These judicial activists forget they hold neither the purse nor the sword. Vote. Organize. Focus locally but network. SCOTUS is like FIAT currency. Its only as powerful as our confidence in it.

"When the gears of our branches of government become so mired in self dealing they lose sight of the current ethos on an issue. Abortion and their position in every way departs from evidence based reality. What they claim simply does not happen in the context they say and people know it. They also know a judge deciding what's best for a woman's health is farcical in every way. We know this. This will be the course correction that's needed coming from the people. Question is, is it still possible given the gerrymandered state legislature's control of mapping and courts deliberately buttressing their arguments. This will be pivotal fulcrum within these times of unimaginable consequences."
how can they know any of this when the court and the justice system can't seem to find out who even leaked it?
Roe V. Wade was overturned in exchange for Kamala Harris being put into office.

How can we even TRUST the Supreme Court? I know I don't.

It's clear that the Robert's court is corrupt and is not working for the American people. We need to hold them to account and put in people who actually care about the well being of Americans and not just those who bride them.

This from the same people who consider corporations ‚Äúpeople‚Äù it‚Äôs insane.
Everyone knows who the leak was. Why won't you say it?
"It cannot be a surprise to anyone that the decisions to take the case and the decision on the case to overturn RvW were political. Literally r=everything we do in life is on some level political because we are choosing and making judgements all day every day. Weighing out what we believe what we think is right or wrong or what is the least bad or the most good with everything. And those decisions are about our politics in the widest down to the narrowest definition. RvW when it was first decided was a political choice made by supporters and detractors and SCOTUS at the time. There is no surprise here. The real question is why are so many GOP leaders and why is Trump and why is does SCOTUS appear to be so ready to make and force political choices that are not reflective of where most people‚Äôs choices are today? What is driving them to make such bad political choices. I really don‚Äôt think the media has asked the question widely enough. What role has the slow but progressive change in our climate played?  What role did the pandemic play? What role has over population played? What role has the migration of peoples away from poor economies and Authoritarian states played in the highly charged situation that the world and the US finds itself today? Are there other, are there better choices and is there any ability to change the choices we seem driven to make? The media simply needs to do a better job than they are doing by talking about Trump 24/7/365 when he is likely only a symptom of much larger problems that need to be addressed."
So what does this mean exactly? Nothing can or will be done about it.
America is tied of these liars all in the fascist republican party. That is why America is going VERO forevermore until the republican party is gone üíô
MURDER / ABORTION HAS NEVER HAD ' RIGHTS'
I don't understand how a Supreme Court appointment should ever be a life time appointment. They should be removed if not ruling for the constitution or against the people of the United States. I believe that the setting president should be able to send a removal to the senate just the same as an appointment.

Seriously. Nothing but cuss words in my head. Yup. The court is 1000% corrupt.
"I'll never understand why they keep pursuing this poisoned pill. Gen Z turned up in droves after the last time and helped turn what was supposed to be a red wave into a red sprinkle and historically abortion have always been popular. But, if it ends up costing Republicans votes, as it already has, and hastens the death of that ghoulish party then so be it. This will just force more people to vote which has historically been bad for Republicans who havent pulled out a W on the peoples vote in 2 decades."
"The Supreme Court is corrupted to its core. This is a dictatorship with no accountability to the law, and the ability to change the law at will to suit their own belief system is the dictatorship ethos. Judges must be held to the higher court of a citizens review authority based on majority rule. Had that been in place over the year, many of the attempts to deregulate corporations, Citizens United,  and yes abortion rights would never have been accepted into our system of government. In my opion, yes opinion, this started with the Lewis Powell appointment to congress in 1971. He is the infamous writer of what is most often called the Lewis Powell Memo. Since then the Court has systematically sided with corporations over the wellbeing and rights of the vast majority of American citizens. Hense here we are with even the middle class preceeding into homelessness and poverty due to a biased Congress with the aid and comfort of the Supreme Court. I think a civil oversight with authority to bring Court decisions to the process of a national vote before institution would align the Court more closely with the Constitution."
Buy and Sell - give me a break!  They were bought!
Even Ginsberg thought the original ruling was wrong.
"Fortunately, the re-criminalization of abortion in Canada through legislative and/or judicial means will not see the light of day.  Evidently, abortion has long remained a 'proverbial' third-rail of Canadian politics."

Should this extraordinarily unfortunate situation ever become reality, then the United States will definitely cease to the 'the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave.'

"People need to stop getting mad and vote. Voting results are why we have the current court we have. Voting is why Roe was overturned. Voting is why you have Republicans in states like Texas who absolutely refuse to allow women to have autonomy over their own pregnancies. 

All of the things you see happening are because of the ways people voted. If Trump didn't win the presidency, you wouldn't now have a 6-3 majority Conservative court. Which in turn, not only struck down 50 years of settled law, but went against the majority of the will of citizens in the US. 

You have women in this country who keep voting for a Republican party that historically, over the past 50 plus years has been overwhelmingly ANTI-WOMAN in its policies and legislative voting record. But women keep voting against their own interest by voting Republican.

If you want something different, than do something different. If you want different legislation, than VOTE differently and put DIFFERENT people in office."

Religion is wrong people. It‚Äôs racist. It‚Äôs sexist. It‚Äôs evil. There is no place for religious buffoonery in modern society.
"You didn‚Äôt have to give the leakers name.  The only Justice that would have a motive to leak this and force a vote to go along with this, whether he wanted to or not.  Alito  forced this into the spotlight to cement this and make it happen.  Alito
was worried about Kavanaugh‚Äôs vote.   

The timing though; that‚Äôs too convenient.  The election was less than 2 months away and as long as Ruth was still around they couldn‚Äôt do it.  This whole thing smells.  There are no coincidences.  Amy is in the wings and they needed her vote to make this work.  This whole thing was orchestrated to appear coincidental and perfect timing."
Vote Blue!
"It is amazing to people outside of America the justice system there is not about the law, it is about politics......................"
You've been sentenced to one night of rehabilitation
"This ""Supreme"" court is actually a religious tribunal... there's no court to be found. They create law to fit their christo-fascist beliefs and they twist facts to serve their religious agenda."
"The federalist society owns the supreme court, x45 was just the clown that drove the bus."
Alito leaked the decision IMO
"30,000 babies were saved since abortion Roe/wat !!!!!"
"I don‚Äôt understand why Roberts is so mad? It‚Äôs almost like he thought the court had some sort of RIGHT TO PRIVACY and *HE* should have been granted some sort of RIGHT TO CHOOSE  *if or when* to release a document concerning the difficult decision to TERMINATE A RIGHT THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN CREATED and was WELL ESTABLISHED instead of some random person who somehow found out and made the decision FOR HIM!

I‚Äôm so sorry Justice Roberts. I have a great deal of sympathy for you. This whole leak seems like a gross violation of trust. I can‚Äôt *possibly* imagine how you must feel!"
"RBG would have retired and let Obama replace her, but knowing the chosen one could not be beaten by Trump RBG decided to retire after Distillary was elected, allowing the first woman president to replace her in an historic event. Sadly Distillary lost and RBG bellied up while Trump was president, and for that I will always thank her!"
"it's not interesting that these activists politically one sided people  , liers, call themselves judges over the population on personal issues based upon someone religion overturning and retracting long established personal freedoms that evey other wealthy democratic nation defends.   those are supreme Ayatollahs not supreme court judges based in constitutional government."
NOTHING LIKE TELLING WOMEN HOW TO LIVE THIR LIFES!!!!!!!! DISCUSTING AND BULLCRAP!!! JUST VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE BLUE VOTE üíô  BIDEN CAN STACK THE COURT AND MAKE IT FAIR AND THEY CAN PUT ROE BACK IN ITS PLACE!!!!! VOTERS RIGHTS ARE ALSO ON THE LINE!!!!!
Forget abortion. SCOTUS is going to take away our country when they say Chump can't be tried.
"This is a bombshell MSNBC?  A politically stacked court go against presidency and remove human rights, but one wanted to wait 3 months.  They Tok away rights from women in 2022! A bombshell would be that the right wing crooks on the bench all decide to resign because of the damage that they did to the court."
"Half of the supreme court is fascist, America!"
"Nothing new here.  Certainly not ""bombshell"".  It's just a leftist theory.  Fake news again."
Barrett was likely playing judicial politics in tgst she knew the 4 votes were enough.
Ginsberg was the least corrupt
My vote is Alito was the leaker!
"Corruption in current SCOTUS can be ameliorated by setting an age limit of 70 years.
So sick of old men destroying the lives of people who still have their own hair, knees, and teeth."
The supreme court judges are just corrupt career politicians with the title judge. Their ambition and greed has destroyed Any integrity and sense of justice they once may have had.
"Ok, what's the over/under on Kavanaugh being the impatient pissant who leaked?"
"Their decisions are leaked intentionally, by them."
"Sure, the problem is who leaked the information. Not the corrupt justices that work for their oligarchs."
Sneaky corrupt judges!
Please get to the point of the title
"The mind reels that a ‚Äòcivilized‚Äô democracy could even consider such medieval, cruel, misogynistic and barbaric behaviour as the banning of abortion. I am 73 and my generation fought INCREDIBLY hard to have medically safe abortions become legal. This reversal in the U.S. is just mind-blowing, and so tragic for women. So very grateful that I am Canadian. üíñüá®üá¶"
Why do I get this weird impression that they're suggesting Amy Coney Barret leaked the draft?
"This is one thing about the Dems that ticks me off . they as far as I can tell aren't doing anything to prevent it !!!!
They have had numerous opportunities and options to fix this ....still waiting ."
"What this absolutely clarifies is that it was someone on the (anti-American) religious right who chose to leak specifically to subvert a (slightly) more reasonable compromise.  It's hard for me to fathom why each and every Justice isn't thoroughly investigated (on a routine basis), for clearly many are so thoroughly corrupt they have no business not being in prison.  Without true transparency there is NO justice, anyone who believes otherwise is dangerously delusional."
"This isn't ""fascinating"" as Kantor puts it. It's just despicable partisanship and self-interest. Those things aren't fascinating. They're lizard-brained. They're low."
"Dollars to donuts the leak came from a conservative justice's staff. That's why the ""investigation"" quietly went away without any information on who leaked it."
"8:18 bahh ......... they want that freedom they need that freedom ......... and when they're gonna do something UNTHINKABLE, they leak it"
We investigated ourselves and we found we did nothing wrongü§¨.
It was a political stance that had no bearing on whether or not she would vote to strike down Roe v Wade. It was all about keeping up appearances. They lied to get their positions and they'll lie to keep the people satisfied to keep them there.
Abortion Leak‚Ä¶
"Every situation should be looked at individually, not all cramned into one abortion bill or law."
Austin powers.    Its a man baby..   lol.     üòÇ
"I'm so glad that the justices were not on the court when I had my ectopic and lost the embryo from the uterus. I would be dead and unable to care for my seven y/o. I had an emergency ultrasound and then emergency surgery that night. I was having pain so I was able to take blood tests on Sunday + for pregnancy but level low indicated ectopic likely. Pain starts becoming more intense on Monday. Ultrasound and emergency surgery. This is how fast things can evolve, thank God that I was an RN and know the ropes. I believe in choice and medical emergencies DO happen. These decisions are made between a Doctor and his patients."
"OMG have them finding out the truth about the Supreme Court... That is not in the Public interest..."" And move along there is nothing to see here says the un BIASED Justices who don't want things they do in PRIVATE and their Rich-$pecial $$$ friends to be known to the public..."
"When your Supreme Court is bent, a country's not in trouble... it's in crisis."
"'No One Is Above The Law'

Exceptions: Ex-POTUS's, SCOTUS Judges, the rich...yup, No One!"
women now have to turn to lawmakers to make decisions about their healthcare. I guess we should seek legal advice from doctors
Sooooo.....Trump set the tone.üòÇ
They didn't care what case it was they took. They were just waiting to overturn Roe and took whichever one came along.
They couldn't wait till RBG died. Corruption  runs  rampant in that court. I never thought I would distrust the Supreme Court  of the US.  I'm 75 years old. I worry for my grand and great grang childern.
"With the 932 comments already posted, I find it fascinating that almost none of them discuss what Hates and Ms. Kantor are talking about...because it was fascinating. Was everything involving Justice ACB smoke and mirrors? What WAS the motive of the individual who leaked the document? Was there always going to be a 5-4 majority? No one seems to be talking about these things.

Rather, most of the comments are ""a woman should have a right to choose"" and ""vote Biden 2024 if you want democracy"" and ""the Supreme Court is corrupt,"" all things that fall on the probably-to-definitely true spectrum, but most of which misses a lot of the points made in the above video."
RBG should have retired when Obama was in the WH and they had the senate.
Biden 2024 protect our daughters!üíô
I can't understand how corrupt judges make these kinda decisions.
"Once again the word ""Bombshell"" is overused in social media. Jodi Kantor gave us some interesting information from behind the scenes, but it wasn't a ""Bombshell"". With the majority Right Wing Justices this was going to happen."
"Perjury trials for SCOTUS that lied during their confirmation hearings saying that Roe was established precedent... Liars, under oath... There are penalties for that..."
"I don't understand why democrats let religious fanatics talk about abortion on their terms.
It isn't about the ""rights"" of fetuses, it is a religious (Christian evangelical fundamentalist) view on women designed to control their sexuality and essentially making them second class citizens.
If it was about minimizing number of abortions mandatory vasectomy on all males of age would be a far less intrusive or dangerous way to go.
Forced birth and the loss of bodily autonomy is basically criminalizing  female sexuality."
Is this interview a joke.
It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄúConsrervitive Super Majority‚Äù. It‚Äôs a privately owned by Leonard Leo as tool to bypass the democratic process.  This is direct attack on the U.S. Constitution.
It was Ginni!
"Pro choice IS ‚ÄúPro Life‚Äù life of the mother, life of children after they are born."
As the Republicans racist as a were prevented the first black president in American history from sitting a supreme Court Justice because what he was black or half black. Then they let dogs a Trump have the supreme Court they said when Obama tried to fill the supreme Court you can't it's too close to an election and we have to let the people decide they feel Ruth bader Ginsburg seat while before her body was even cold which was a very Stark difference from the year and a half Obama had to wait to not be able to see the supreme Court Justice
"SUPREME COURT JUDGES SHOULD BE ON TERM LIMITS, PERIODT."
The last 3 Trump appointed Justices all told Congress that they felt that Roe was established case law. They LIED! Simple as that.
Deciding the law guided by political expediency - exactly what Supreme Court Justices are required to be above.
"Ms. Kantor is already a great journalist, and I look forward to all her future endeavors.

Oh, yeah, and Alito leaked his own draft, the POS."
Policians shouldn't be making medical decisions
"They don't even look judicial, look like they have an ulterior motive to me.n"
"Can someone at least explain why the leak cemented votes? Like, if I'm a supreme justice... I control the rest of the story. I write the endorsements. Why feign disapproval for 3 months?

This is the kinda crap which seems dismissal in coincidence when it first comes out, but becomes a national embarrassment in 20 years, once they've made life altering rulings without any consequence"
"Makes me think about the same person that suggested to our former president, that it was a good idea to appoint fake electors to overturn the decision they didn't like from the voters."
News flash: Roe has publicly said she‚Äôs pro life.
"If SCOTUS Justices are allowed to lie under oath during their confirmations, why would you expect better from regular folk and politicians???"
SCOTUS = CORRUPT! ü§•ü§ëü§•ü§ëü§•ü§ë  üòíüôÑüòî
we don‚Äôt need Supreme Court at all all this 6 of them involved either the money and they have to make decisions for all American people shut the door
The satanic left gets FURIOUS when people try to stop their sacrificing!!!
This should be the topic of an expose film and soon.
"Samuel Alito was the leaker. This twisted man‚Äôs hatred of women is so intense that he leaked this document, and people need to stop dancing around it and him. He took a victory lap and spat in all of our faces. He tells us every day that he is untouchable, and we can‚Äôt stop him. Democrats need complete control of the Senate to remove that man from the bench."
Vote blue
Trump needs to be made ineligible for the presidency. He's a criminal
"Like trump, the conservative justices  are liars. Everyone of them is for sale."
Thank you Chris. I appreciate your clarity and evidence of the values that you uphold.
"filth that doesn‚Äôt work for the American people


absolutely DISGUSTING"
Clearly overturning Roe v. Wade also highlighted why America's Founding Fathers never even considered allowing women to vote.
A great trip Mick.  So good to see behind the helmet so to speak.   Niceü§òüèΩ
"We are two completely different countries that are trying to be one. We need to let these Republican states exist on their own. They wouldnt want that though,  because most of the government assistance money comes from Liberal states. Tired of these Christian psychos forcing their delusions onto us"
WELL complicated. my two simple cents. seems after the leak they SAVED face for the HARD RIGHT. Not a way to adjudicate THE law of the land.
Love this supreme court
The havoc the Supreme Court unleashed on women is despicable and please stay out of women‚Äôs healthcare
It should be pro-choice and anti-choice
Blackmail.
"Pro Choice here, but it is hard to see how the 14th Amendment implied the right to abortion.  We wasted 50 years when we should have passed legislation permitting abortion.  But we couldn't even get the Equal Rights Amendment ratified, and that was as spicy as rice pudding."
They should realize that if Trump is re- elected; he won't need ANY of them!
The SCOTUS is a BREACH OF TRUST. The entire court is CORUPT!
"Overturning Roe was one of the stupidest things the Right has ever done. Not only did they galvanize Left, they handed the Left a winning platform on a Golden platter."
"They all lied about changing president  ,They need to be removed for lying.."
"The way you all - journalists express yourselves WITH THE WRONG WORDS.: FASCINATING POSITION - the barett , and then Hayes making a statement: ITS FAAASCINATING!!! LALALAAA, CHRIS. IT IS APALLING!"
"The great thing about banning abortions, it nullifies qualified immunity. You can‚Äôt have female cops on the force with protections not afforded to them under the constitution or the Supreme Court. How is a female cop going to face her accuser in the court of law when that‚Äôs also her baby daddy!"
You do know Jeffery Epstein lawyer became a judge and was the one who signed off on mar a largo search if not then your not paying attention
Why don't they ever have arguenents about how to prevent Conception? Why are all the Arguements about what to do after the woman conceives.
They lied in their conformation hearings commitimng perjury in the senate AND should be removed
The Supreme Court now is only about politics and not about the Constitution.
This has nothing to do with the Constitution. It is simply about fulfilling a minority political agenda.
"And people wonder why Trump succeeded? And why he's going to succeed again? This video tell all. It's a sham. They seem to be against Trump, but are fully supporting him. Disgusting on all fronts.ü§Æ"
I always think Alito himself may have leaked it!!!
They‚Äôre appallingly evil!
"Well the satanic church supports abortion, kinda tell you all you need to know about it"
"It is politics even when the court is right, this court makes it decisions out of donor ownership loyalty."
"This isn‚Äôt a country, it‚Äôs a criminal enterprise."
This was over a year ago u think
It's good that the Supreme Court banned Abortion because now I can have tons of kids!
How can this court be trusted - bet the court  will rule that 45 has immunity
Bombshell ... u told me Nothing .. what a scam ..
Elevating Trump led to 3 more Saltine Supremacists on the Supreme Court.
My takeaway from this is that decisions regarding what constitutes ethical conduct are more realistic when made privately rather than publicly.
The source of that leak has been obvious ever since it happened.
"Democrats appoint a woman to the court that doesn't know what a woman is, and have the audacity to complain about decisions made concerning women. Their cognitive dissonance is on full display."
Geees. You lazy people. They sent it to the states which means  you cant have a say so in what the law says and does. Do your friggin jobs and call your elected  officals and hild them responsible. They work for you not the other way around.
"This is exactly why SCOTUS has become a joke. Many conservative justices were bought by billionaires and sold their votes long ago. Is it any surprise that SCOTUS rulings are being scorned and ignored? These justices have lost our respect because they didn‚Äôt have any respect for the positions they hold or the bench they sit on. We need SCOTUS reforms now. 13 justices to match 13 federal courts. Set term limits. Impeach Thomas and Alito. Finally, vote Blue!"
There were 3 breaches of trust when 3 Supreme Court justices said under oath that roe v wade was established precedent and no intention to overturn.
Take that liberal idiots.
"Trump campaigned that he would pick judges that would overturn Roe. Liberals stayed home in 2016 and gave them  3 judges. The liberal government had complete control and didn‚Äôt codify anything in 2020 -22, because they believed lying judges when they said they wouldnt overturn the decision. . We then get the leak and people still didn‚Äôt believe they would do it. Now here we are with abortion banned all across the US and liberals are once again thinking about doing a protest vote in 2024 against BIDEN. Mark my words, if people stay home and Trump wins, they would find a way to make the ban a federal law."
"She needs the cover for the SCROTUS investigations that SHOULD be conducted.

"Even the infamous RBG said, Roe V Wade was judicial gymnastics, and wondered why it has been challenged in court before then"
Please end abortion. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Stop minority religious cults from enslaving women.
"Ah so Democrat hate Supreme Court, the Constitution, who wouls have know"
If the justices on the Supreme Court think that abortion is wrong then they should not get one.  Period.
Omg the Supreme Court had a Abortion......
This court needs to be investigated and corrupt justices need to go. How do we action this?
wow
Brings on a trans guy as an expert on how women feel.  How about stop killing babies?
It's as simple as it gets...People like this just want to pretend they are gods!
Vote people into the House and Senate who will vote to have accountability for Justices. Why am I held to a more unfair system of justice than our SCOTUS?
The republican justices on the Supreme Court Lied to get on the court and Lied when they did end of story .
"Advice to Chris: Stop laughing through important points you're trying to make, it's reminiscent of Carlson's hysterical cackle!"
Time for Biden to PACK THE COURTS and outnumber the criminal corrupt maggat theocrats!!
Justice Coney Barrett is as culpable every Supreme Court Justice who overturned a woman's right Health Care I don't care how you want to rewrite history the end result is women are second-class citizens and the Supreme Court Justices are at fault
Both bought and stolen court. Not living by a thing they say. We need term limits yesterday.
"Seems to me that this is an ethical situation. Didn't SCOTUS just adopt a new ""Code of Conduct?"" Guess we will have a front row seat as we watch the justices investigate themselves for unethical behavior. Because waiting for your coworker to die seems pretty unethical. And even more unethical is the suggestion to operate on secret decisions without the American people knowing. That's not just unethical, that's deplorable and scary. üíô"
"THIS IS A POOR EXCUSE  TO TEST, WHAT???? TO TEST WHAT??? TO EXPERIMENT WITH HUMANS' LIVES ??? EF SUPREME COURT!"
So which one of them is the rat? That's what everybody wants to know
Biden also needs to appoint a judge ASAP. Don't let the Republicans play the games they did last time saying we cant appoint a judge during an election year. Tired of their crap.
It is about politics and power. That is what SCOTUS has become.
"Oh yes, leaking their corruption is a breach of trust... Republicans really do have no bottom that they won't drop to in order to show how vile they are."
Bombshell. I thought Brett may have had an abortion or something.
Alito did it.  Makes me a little sick that he was chomping at the bit to take away women's right to control their own bodies.
They are the worst ever
"At a minimum, all Trump judges need to be expelled as soon as Orange turd is convicted."
"Wow! Of course, the overturning of Roe did help to get people out to vote and may have worked against the Republicans"
Justices lied to Congress when they said Roe v Wade was settled law.
"I like how we still pretend that we don't know which side leaked it. Robert's still working on that, eh?"
"Good people don‚Äôt lie, and do not try to control females, I don‚Äôt see the freedom gop claims they support"
When was the leak again cause that's how long late you are getting this news out there it was Clarence Thomas was the lake 90% the other 10% is one of the other conservative justices I knew like within a couple weeks that was a conservative justice probably within one week that was a conservative within four or five it's Thomas
The Republican Supreme Court is ruled by large financial institutions and wealthy donors instead of evaluating based on the will of the people.
"This lady , Jodi Kantor, talks with a natural delay. As if the audio/video is not calibrated correctly.. but it is! .. off topic? yes... Fascinating? YES!"
Illegitimate SCOTUS.
The problem is the political appointment of judges and justices. A better system would be promotion on merit within the department.
"Deciding not to take the case based on how it will look is saying - it doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with LAW.  It presents as ‚Äúwe want to do this, but don‚Äôt want to look eager to do it‚Äù.  That is a POLITICIZED court - not LAWFUL."
"Don't like abortions don't have one. 

Don't push your pro life views on others unless you also support other causes with the same fervor. 

Those causes;
Childcare, Healthcare, prenatal health, education, prison reform, police reform, voting rights, food security, environmental protections, limits to corporate power and influence, not sending troops to die for profit."
CHRISTIAN NATIOLISM WON..in the making BEHIND THE SCENES for the past 2 DECADES..and everyone FELL ASLEEP
"I'm with Chris, Barrett voting no first go round was personal coverage. She hasnt given anyone anything to think about when it comes to her. Alito, Thomas, Kavanaugh, and Barrett all lied during their interviews. Regular people get fired for jive like that depending on the severity. And their lies fall under sever"
Only white males will have rights.
this guys is a great liberal partisan
"Roberts has failed as the Chief Justice and needs to be removed from his position by Congress. Every federal group Constitutionally overseen by Congress is in a state of failure, every one! Changing Presidents every four years has stopped working so maybe its time to change the way Congress functions."
There is no more Justice and Freedom in America now. All are controlled by Corrupted people.
"Maybe I'm not hearing this right from this NYT reporter .._""blah, blah, blah""_  What difference does it make?"
Curse the court!!!
"I said when it was released a conservative judge did this.
They knew that released in June the anger would be felt at the polls in Nov, but released in February the people will have some other noise to distract their attention and by Nov the affects on the election were the pink trickle instead of a blue wave that may have occurred if it had been released under normal court calendar schedules.
üò≠üá∫üá≤ü§¨üá∫üá≤üò≠"
Remember this when you vote in 2024: The orange con man nominated these bozos.
They still could have changed their votes after the vote.
I don't trust Supreme court!
Old news
Poor little trumpies üòÇ
crazy times
Could have thought of a better video title?
"It's so sad that those ""Justices"" had their privacy violated."
Who cares
"""Part of what we need to remember,"" says the Kantor, thanking Chris."
Don't say 'abortion leak'. Could have chosen better phrasing.
Wouldn't it be nice to be completely untouchable and knowing you can be for the rest of your life. Corruption unmatched in any society.
Why does no one acknowledge that Ruth Bader Ginsberg was highly critical of how Roe v Wade was decided
Why do the majority of the supreme court justices  ignore the seperation of church and state in the constitution  ?
Roberts is concerned with his reputation than the country and the legal traditions they are supposed to uphold.
"There is NO trust in the Justices of SCOTUS ,,"
Another trumpazee justice that isn't a trumpazee
"I am very impressed by Jodi Kantor as an investigative journalist.....intelligent, sophisticated and nuanced reporting on this story. Having said that, I am convinced Justice Alito most likely instigated the leak."
"Listen to you snowflakes crying, you want to about feeling a law. Let‚Äôs talk about 1618, the constitution(in its original format), Dred Scott, the savagery of the south after they lost the war and implemented Jim Crow. Cry me a river. I know the real reason they want to ban abortion, Dr. Frances Cress Welsing.üòä"
"I don't feel any different about Amy Coney Barrett, because she just didn't want it to look as bad on her because she knew, just like the other 2 trump nominated, that regardless of the lies they told in their hearings, they were always going to overturn Roe. She just didn't want it to be so soon because she is a chicken üí©."
I pray that they are seeing what they caused
Let's look at this pragmatically - what was the real effect of Barret's deny? Nothing. It's all theater.
"So the chief orange justice worries about the leak, not the consequences of his decision on the lives of Americans?  These orange activist judges need to be impeached asap."
Lol freedom OF faith or religion AND freedom FROM religion or anothers faith. No law shall be made that violates one's own faith of beliefs or religion to be another's same faith of belief or religion that goes against the others own faith of belief or religion
There's nothing Supreme about any of them.
"So much for the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. 

Biden needs to pack the court. Too much power in too few hands. Hands we cannot trust that cling to power for far too long."
"They'll be coming after everyone's rights. Best wake up and smell the cocos.
The goverment and the courts have no business in people's medical care and they certainly have no business in people's bedrooms. They have no business saying who people can and can't love.
Enough is enough with these clowns."
"SCOTUS is ruled by a group of individuals that lied to get their positions, are blatantly political and the most corrupt group of justices in the history of America.  It is time for the lifetime appointment to be removed and that several of the current SCOTUS justices be charged for their own illegal practices."
"Supreme Court doesn't care about people, they just care about who is president.

That is why it was overturned in the first place.

Not to mention we have very large corruption of the Supreme Court Judges."
I knew it.
"This country is totally effed up. My body, my choice."
"remember, republican majority put roe v wade into place to begin with.  if they try to tell you it's some evil ""leftist"" thing they're fighting, this fact alone makes it obvious it has nothing to do with saving babies.  if that were the case, they'd be talking about how to curb gun violence in the house instead of going on about public urination, the ""left's"" war on gas stoves, hunter biden's laptop, etc"
I never thought they waited. The minute Ginsburg died I knew we were doomed.
"Unfortunately, there are only a couple of Justices that will simply apply the law, then you have the balance interested in using their power for money and favor....This court needs to be dismantled with interims until such time this can be rectified period!!!"
Most Constitutional juris prudence experts say that the SCOTUS to include all courts grant a hold while the legal aspects are being sorted out. The Conservative justices took 10 minutes to decree an opinion.
I have no trust nor respect for the Supreme Court. Taking money and expenses gifts from millionaire and billionaire is wrong. The Court is tainted.
"This court is a joke, they are in it for themselves!!"
"The overturning of Roe shows a failing of the Senate in the confirmations of the newest Justices. All three were asked if they would overturn Roe V Wade, and all three evaded the question and replied that 'it was settled law.' And, instead of pressing for an actual answer, the Senate allowed that answer to stand. All three of the newest Justices should have been pushed UNTIL THEY REPLIED with a REAL ANSWER. 
The Senate dropped the ball."
He did it!!! Alito spilled the information.
"Abortion on demand. 
No Questions Asked."
This is further proof that the Roman Catholic SCOTUS is not independent and is not to be trusted.
Alito was the leaker. A criminal in robes.
So what are we supposed to do if the highest court in the land is morally corrupt?
"Coney-Barrett belongs to an extremist charismatic christian group, People of Praise.

POP is verifiably and creepily out of step with sane American values. Survivors' stories illustrate the horror any sane adult would feel at the usurpation of self-determination.

Buck the patriarchy!"
The lying nine
The US Supreme Court is illegitimate!
Nothing will happen to these traitor justices  .
The leaker didn‚Äôt commit any crimes.
"So there is no bombshell. Its just what we already knew. It was likely leaked by a conservative judge like Alito to force the others into line. The new judges were only concerned that it looked bad for them personally because like only 5 minutes ago they were swearing under oath they considered Roe settled law. Who would have thought that a political organisation grooming and promoting judges for appointment to the court could make the court look political when the organisation that put them there openly states the the reason they are being promoted. 
America is a backsliding democracy, and it didn't have a great one to begin with."
üö®üö®Fake news
"SC Justices are there to decide issues of law, not to plot to ‚Äúmake‚Äù law. That is usurping Congress, not to mention an abuse of power."
"""It can look like politics and power.""  Yes, because that is exactly what it is about."
"Trump's Supreme Court. Are they bright people who are just oblivious to the Pandoras box they've opened? Or, are they just not very bright.......period. Trump's Supreme Court.......what a winner! Aren't we blessed!"
We need to win house and senate and Oval Office so we can add to the court
Sorry to interrupt I would like to ask question. Why are we not talking about how the third party candidates are hurting the Biden administration for re-election and the reason Trump will be again a president. Dictator is because of third party candidates that are taking away the vote and have no chance zero chance of winning. They should own up bow out after supporters to vote for Biden. Otherwise well we know the outcome and that is trumpets. Victor

Just want to point out that these ghouls literally started looking for a conservative replacement for RBG before her body was even cold. And by literally I mean LITERALLY.
Sheldon Whitehouse has been sounding the alt on the supreme court that billionaires bought...

    It's pretty simple, if your against abortion then don't get or have one! No one is forcing anyone to get an abortion! But stripping that right to away from others who have different beliefs IS WRONG!
  We are a nation of many different people with many different types of belief and no one form of belief is superior to anyone else's..just different!! 
 It seems the conservitives and fundamental christians seem to have more in common with the Taliban-believe MY WAY or else!!üò≤
FREEDOM=CHOICE!!"
Term limits please
The meaning is nothing. Her vote to not take the case on was purely because she had JUST testified that Roe was settled law. And her voting to not take up the case means nothing at all when she then went and voted to overturn Roe.   Just typical two faced lying from right wingers.
three daughters vote blue
Ginny Thomas was the leaker.
"It was a shocking decision for the Conservative SC Justices to overturn R v W but no one should have been shocked. We knew that the list of recommended SC Justice nominees submitted to Trump when he was President was a list compiled by the Federalist Society. The Federalist Society was only going to include on the list, nominees that had already ""pledged"" to overturn R v W. You didn't pass muster and make the list if there was any doubt about how you would rule regarding R v W. It didn't take much to imagine that Trump, in his one on one's with nominees, demanded they pledge to him that they would overturn R v W--it was a personal promise they had to make to become one of the Trump nominees. There should never have been any doubt that R v W was going to be overturned--that was ""the deal""."
"The ones who promised to never try and overturn Roe Vs Wade during their hearings and then did so, should be charged with purgery."
Click bait!!!!!!!!!
"I know she's a hero, but RBG didn't do the country any favor by not retiring when her health was getting bad - so Obama could have appointed her successor.  Now, thanks to her decision, we're stuck with a corrupt, right-wing extremist court that frequently serves political power grabbing by the GOP - not what's honest and best for the American people under the Constitution."
Republicans will never win another presidential election thanks to the overturning of Roe vs Wade.
"Precedent is just thrown out the window, nothing existed before the revolution."
So much for precedent and the word of the Supreme court  justices.
The court made the correct ruling. We should all celebrating the wonderful caring ruling that shows we as a country are not selfish but that we value life.
"So Republicans claimed it was the libs that leaked it to help their case,but it was the conservatives that knew it would end persuasion or compromise."
"Supreme Court  ""Justice""s"
I remember thinking in high school that the US Supreme Court justices must be such great human beings to have made it to positions so incredibly important. I thought so highly of them- sad how wrong I was.
I'm grateful someone spoke up .  These judges think they can do what they want without consequences or accountability this is the problem in America today.
The United States Supreme Kangaroo Court.
I am done with the men on the court. They hate me and want to control me. DONE. How do we remove them NOW.
"No trust in this court at all. No ethics, and full political. 

Term limits with stronger standards or codes than the lower courts. To start immediately."
Even the judges at the Hague only get 9 year terms .... these clowns get lifetime gigs...

"I don't believe those conservatives justice thought twice about over turning Roe, they dont care. Vote Blue üíô 2024."
IF IT WAS A RIGHT IT COULD NOT BE TAKEN AWAY.  ROE V WADE WAS A MERE PRIVILEGE and was taken away. Women have less rights than a corpse.
They want to go back to medieval times. Suffering is not the only option. We have modern medical science now.
"She looks like Tim Roth. 
This all goes back to billionaire money running everything."
After Alito makes his reasoning I hold no faith in his judgement.
Time to impeach these judges or change law from lifetime appointments to time limit‚Ä¶
The Corruption Court
My body my choice.
Most of them can‚Äôt fathom what it is for a woman to have one so why should they even have a say?
"They want to overthrow row vs wade, but don't want the bad rep of being the ones doing it, and failing at it. 

Pretty sure they'd be the most hated judges if that happened. Both by their own supporters and their oppositions."
I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt help feeling angry at Ginsburg. This partly due to her selfishness.
"Awesome, we love your Bombshell reports DNBC and msnbc. We keep waiting for Bombshell follow up reports,  but never see them. Would this be called Spinning perhaps, or just plain propaganda?"
"The bible is neither antiabortion nor pro-life, but does provide a biblical basis for the real motivation behind the antiabortion religious crusade: hatred of women. The bible is anti-woman, blaming women for sin, demanding subservience, mandating a slave/master relationship to men, and demonstrating contempt and lack of compassion: ""I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."" Gen. 3:16 What self-respecting woman today would submit willingly to such tyranny?

The antiabortion position does not demonstrate love for humanity, or compassion for real human beings. World Health Organization estimates maternal deaths at 500,000 a year, with at least one in five stemming from unsafe, illegal abortions. Thousands more are hurt and maimed from illegal or self-induced abortions. Unwanted pregnancies and complications from multiple pregnancies are a leading killer of women. Why do antiabortionists want North American women to join these ghastly mortality statistics? Every day around the world more than 40,000 people, mostly children, die from starvation or malnutrition. We must protect and cherish the right to life of the already-born."
How much more BS does Americans need‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..Biden need to expand SC and stop the destruction of democracy!!

"It has ruined lives in Oklahoma. Women's Healthcare has ceased to exist. The all white mostly male Republican state legislators wrote and passed the strictest abortion ban in the nation. Obstetricians and Gynocologists have fled the state. IVF and fertility programs closed. IUDs and Tubal ligations are illegal. Gov Kevin Stitt appointed a TASK FORCE to monitor all pregnant women from conception through giving birth. Doctors are required to give the Task Force information on all their pregnant patients. Any pregnancy that does not end in a live birth is investigated starting with the woman, her doctors, her family and friends. All social media, texts, emails and cell phone conversations will be searched. Vehicle license plate tracking history will be used to determine where she went during the alleged pregnancy.  The state supreme court issued a decision that abortions are legal if the doctor determines the woman's life is in danger. The state legislators are ""thinking about it."" In the meantime they are working on a complete ban of all contraception. Most woman aren't getting obstetric or gynocological healthcare. They're going to General Surgeons for hysterectomies, Physicians Assistants for ovarian cysts, Urgent Care for prenatal care and ERs to deliver babies. One hospital ER no longer treat pregnant women fearing legal liabilities. Most woman aren't getting pap smears or pelvic exams. And if they think they're pregnant, they're terrified. Woman are suffering. Mortality rates for woman and infants will soar in Oklahoma.  It's only going to get worse ü•∫"
Lord help us especially all the Ladies the justices of the high courts are CORRUPT
Completely corrupt court.  Bought and paid for.
"*When will it be called corruption?*  Until the media uses the proper English the way we the normal people do, the effects of the MAGA are being normalized."

They got paid to over turn Roe VS Wade
Who cares about a leak about something you were about to immediately do anyway
Justice kavanaugh should be nowhere near the law because he has no idea what an entails or how to interpret it. Clarence Thomas is completely corrupt and Alito lives in the 19th century

That's the FIRST crime against Americans.  Then, even though they all declared the Roe v Wade Setteled Law, they went back on their Constitutional requirements and re-adjudicated it according to their RELIGIOUS BELIEFS.  
Now, who can I take breach of trust to for a hearing? If the #1 court in the land can toss out the separation of Church and State,  we've lost the core of America's founding.

The Supreme Court is about politics and not justice.
"mccarthy cult, goldwater cult, nixon cult, ford cult, reagan cult....... IT'S A CULT! IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A CULT, just slightly different packaging."
Amy Barrett is a lowlife fake. She and that other drunk that got appointed. Its time to CHANGE those lifetime appointments. They should have to run every 4 years like the rest of the politicians and there NEEDS to be term limits on ALL politicians. The choice to have a bunch of kids is hers NOT everyone else! She is a FAKE Christian TOO. She doesn't have the right to bring her personal views into politics
"A Breach of Trust to the Women of America. Shame on them. Do these unqualified Justices now see what happens when they let the States take care of it. Women are usable to get the care they need because wrinkled assed old white men know more than the doctors. Shame on the last three for lying. America now in some States are worse than third world Countries. I don't care if Amy had 17 children, she was part of destroying Healthcare for Women who have no power. SHAME ON THEM."
"Next up, take away women's right to vote... courtesy of this Supreme Court."
More political BS by desperate Joe Biden‚Äôs lovers!
"So what I'm hearing is that 9 adults have their internal meeting notes exposed to the public, and they all decide that means they have to immediately freeze their decision-making ability? That they just can't continue as though that leak never happened, that they can't say ""Yeah, well, that's a draft, and it's not a done deal, and there's no guarantee that we're going to do that. It's a work in progress""? What kind of spineless idiots are on that court??"
every time this happens every time
That court is corrupt.
"Just imagine America, what our Supreme Court will become if another Republican gets elected President in the next two or three presidential elections. They will be ruling against the will of most Americans for the next two generations at least. Vote Blue across the board. This is not time for those who love American democracy to lose focus."
Why is it surprising that Kavanaugh is a weasel?
"SCOTUS: Gronk, Shag, Mlor, Breer, Bos, Clon and the other cavemen in the group are certainly America back... hundreds of years."
"very interesting, great job!"
These people aren‚Äôt pro-life. They‚Äôre pro-birth. Once a child is born they don‚Äôt care what happens to it.
We knew most of this already: we knew that Alito himself leaked the decision to cement and consolidate it.
I am absolutely dry heaving sickened.
The whole Supreme Court is a breach of trust.
"Fixed terms that have to be renewed,"
Everyone knows it was Alito; he is pretty stupid to think we don‚Äôt know it was him because he did it before.
"When it comes to 'standing' legal precedent, which Roe has stood for 50 years, completely unchallenged, and the fact that a number of yet to be appointed Justices cited Roe as being firmly established, makes a mockery of them."

This SCOTUS is Morally Corrupt & Illegitimate!
See it Supreme Kurt did that turnover roe v wade before the public it a leak from supreme court and the wealthy paid them also !
I don‚Äôt think a thinking feeling fetus should be aborted. A woman doesn‚Äôt need 15 weeks to decide she wants an abortion. 15 weeks is a compromise not a banning of abortion
Americans preach about freedom and yet its being stripped away but hey brother we got guns üî´  freedom woo!
TRUST NO ONE. CORRUPTION
Impeach the court then eliminate the republican traitors
"I love the message we are all supposed to take away is ""leaking info bad"" and most of the comments are talking about how corrupt these justices are. The people have spoken and the government doesn't care.üéâ"
They will all go down in history as the most corrupt bench of our life time!
strongly supports the speculation that Alito leaked it to freeze in the win.  Not only unethical with regard to taking favors.  Apparently the rot is much deeper.
"Term limits & expand the Court! Now!
The only answer at this point.
The Supreme Court has lost all integrity now.
Corrupted beyond belief!
Thomas needs removed without question."
"How do ""We the People"" change this? There needs to be term limits."
It would be interesting if Barrett has a pregnancy where she needs to get an abortion
It's not like people have any confidence in the supreme Court
Meanwhile thomas is bought and paid for by harley crow and other rich white men
"These folks on SCOTUS all said they considered Roe settled law in order to get seated/confirmed by Senate. This is not just about politics and power but about one side who believes the rule of law only applies to the weak or naive. I am disgusted. Kavanaugh, Barrett, Thomas, etc. should be impeached and removed. Merrick Garland deserved seated instead of Gorsuch."
I‚Äôll never understand America. They protect your right to carry guns but not autonomy over your own body. You can take away a life to protect your own if it‚Äôs  with a gun but not a medical procedure. Law and religion are supposed to be separate.
When are Republicans and  SCOTUS going to repeal a woman's right to vote?
"How many leaks is this?
Leak?"
"Finally all things are coming to light!!! 
Hopefully we all will be more prepared to fight fascism. Everything ends in the same point. Fascism. Love for power. Narcisism. Evil. It's going. It always come back unless we do not allow to happen again."

But why? Who is the real winner?
"Trump's Republican Fascist Party including Trump's Republican SCOTUS agenda is  CONTROL, OPPRESSION, and POWER.          Anti-Democracy.  Anti-Freedom of Choice."
This is one of many reasons why I don't and won't trust  the Supreme Court of Injustice.
"The decision whether or not to have an abortion should be left between a woman  and her medical professionals, and everyone else needs to mind their own gd business. An embryo's potential ""right to life"" should *never* outweigh the mother's  very real right to life."
"Delay, delay, delay; sounds like the court uses the tactic similar to 45, for political persuasion."
Chief Roberts is like the policeman who blames you for possessing valuables when reporting a robbery.

They‚Äôre going against the majority of citizens. Get out of our body‚Äôs! Corrupt court!
"So, the only thing this reporting really reveals is that Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett wanted to hide SCOTUS's decided plans about overturning Roe v. Wade from the public for a period of time in order to make the Court's action -- which was blatantly political and about power -- look less like it's political and about power. Did I miss anything?"
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that much of a mystery‚Ä¶ Amy cohen Barrett changed her yes, to a no on taking the case on simply because the end result would be the same. It only takes 4 justices to take a case. She would‚Äôve been the 5th and she thought, why dirty my hands on this decision when at the end of the day I can say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm distancing myself‚Äù from it and still get the result I want.

"Republicans are ready and willing to lie to your faces about what their plans for reproductive rights are- the truth is, and what they have repeatedly proven is that what is happening in Texas, Idaho, Florida and Louisiana  is what they want for all 50 states. And don't think for one second contraception is safe because repubs have several bills in 3 states targeting access to birth control."
Apparently stare decisis only applies to liberal justices but not conservative justices.
Halls of Justice???
Saved the right for abortion?
The Supreme Court is a breach of justice.  No one respects them anymore.
The Catholic witch is showing her colours.
A woman  body is her own. A woman body is not owned by the churches or the government.  Do you understand.
lester is such a fn corny blockhead
‚ÄúAbortion leak‚Äù are two words that shouldn‚Äôt be paired together.
"Breach of trust to We the People, SC, knew back in February they over turned it, yet KEPT it from WE THE PEOPLE OF THE USA üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏"
"Biden/Harris 2024 üá∫üá∏ SCOTUS, particularly the political hacks appointed by the ‚Äúformer guy‚Äù and the bribe takers Thomas and Alito cannot be trusted. Vote Blue so we can have much needed reforms to the SCOTUS, like binding ethical rules!! The People deserve better than the current CORRUPT Court."
"Ah, yes.  Our illegitimate Supreme Court.  Religious fanatics violating our Constitution daily.  It's a GrEaT time to be alive ... if you're a man, right?"
"So, the point in time that the question comes to light does not freeze considerations for the opinion.  You call that freedom, I call that Justice Denied!"
People who exclusively vote Republican are ignorant and selfish people. Mainstream Americans can't even talk to them!
That's a breach of trust but not a corrupt bribed Justice on the court.
The SCOTUS is the breach of trust!!
"Anyone remembers the Pelican Brief??? Every one of those justices that said that they wouldn't overturn precedent, should be fired. The Supreme Court is the ONLY job that you lie during the interview, get the job, and when people find out that you lied, nothing happens and you still remain at the job, FOREVER."
"Definitely, the Beatle members were much deeper thinkers than any of us fully relied.
Only much later on did we come to know of their true inner feelings, their profound thinking.
We actually were a good bit of their anxiety and pressure, because we idolized them so.
We  probably drove them into isolation."
tRump is a *TRAITOR*
You mean the justices that swore under oath that they wouldn‚Äôt mess with ROE under oath in their senate hearings because Roe was settled precedent were uncomfortable taking women‚Äôs rights away? Shocking. Yet they still did it.
Don't tell me Justice Thomas is'nt the only one With a Sugar Daddy.
*if republicans had the White House they would of expanded the Court a LONG TIME AGO..Hint..and who gives a F about the leak*
The end of RvsW is completely and solely the libs fault.
The greatest influence on SCOTUS  was Mitch McConnell. üò≠
Trump rigged court.
Kavenaugh is a lying viper  who should never be trusted. Vote term limits for members of SCOUS.
"The great majority women of this country deserve and support the right to our bodily autonomy. SCOTUS ruling undermines our human right to absolute control over our bodies and our medical care. Republicans thought we would forget by the time the 2024 election. They are wrong. When it comes to our civil rights, women will not forget. 
We will never forget"
"What was the breach of trust was the fact that 3 Supreme Court Justices said during their Senate confirmation hearings, under oath,that Roe v. Wade was decided and law , that they wouldn't touch it,yet committed perjury and overturned it!"
it sounds messy to me....
How can a throne of iniquity like the Roberts Court investigate itself. Psalms 94:20. It can‚Äôt!
"Every Trump appointed SCOTUS, LIED, to get ON the Court, to begin with. Just to overturn Roe v Wade. This is PROOF."
"""A WOMAN'S BODY.....A WOMAN'S CHOICE"""
"GOP want to control your body, what words you can say, what you can read, what you can wear, how you identify and who you can love."
"Brent might need abortions legal, his college age daughters will soon be playing that game Devil‚Äôs Triangle, unless he cares who knocks them up, he better keep his options open"
Trump has paid for his share of abortions
"All of the Supreme Court judges swore under oath they considered Roe v. Wade settled law, during their Senate nomination interviews."
FJB and ALL his MORONS üòÇüòÖ
The most supremely corrupt court.
Blacks for Trump
Republicans stripped away the Rights of more than half the population. They will continue to pay bigly at the ballot box. Look at the reality in Texas.
The sad thing is Biden is useless - and he is in office now & women in Red states are suffering- Biden is not saying anything .. to the red states!  Ignoring us
The most corrupt Supreme Court.
"Thank you president Trump for your great Supreme Court, the greatest gift to America üá∫üá∏"
We all know the SCOTUS was bribed. That's all they do is pander to the highest bidder.
The Supreme Court is corrupt... the justice system is bought by billionaires.. our democracy is UnderThreat.
Abortion is murder.
It was about politics! The court was packed illegally as an appointment was taken from President Obama! Then the political move by Republicans letting trump appoint during his last year of office. I call BS
I do not trust SCOTUS any longer.   It is tainted and needs to be sanitized.
What happened to republicans demanding states decide?
Term limits
"üá∫üá∏ Trump/2024 üá∫üá∏

"Calling abortion a ""women's right"" is like calling Chris Hayes a journalist."

Mississippi is the poorest state & many black‚Äôs & uneducated and poor whites. They really needed abortions to be legal. Sad üòû- if u are against abortions do not get one.
"The united state's supreme Court cannot be trusted anymore !!!

They are not going to clarify anything except take away more of our rights
"If your amniotic fluid broke at 18 weeks, the doctors should have been able to determine whether the fetus was viable through a c-section or not. Lastly, the should have been able to determine whether her life would be at risk especially since the fetus would no longer have the safe environment of the amniotic sac. This sounds more like gross negligence/oversight and had nothing to do with the abortion law. Condolences to the family and glad she is physically safe now."
"Sue Texas, screw these stupid laws, and impeach the Supreme Court. politics needs to stay out of the medical field"
"This whole story is BS ---  What they described is a miscarriage, NOT AN ABORTION 
 They claim the doctors told them, ""Tough noogies. Our hands are tied because we can't read the law.""  ??
  *50% of the story wasn't told* - Notice they have only the interpretation of 2 traumatized, biased, activist people with no legal or medical education. 
    What do the doctors have to say? they didn't ask the doctors any questions about the case....   

NO doctor is going to send her home and say, ""whoops! Maybe you'll live or maybe not.  We don't know what to do with a pregnant woman or baby.""

 in the written article, the woman claims they reasoned that it would be too dangerous to drive 8 hours to cross state the line to obtain a ""legal"" abortion in a neighboring state *but waited 3 days at home w/o using her prescribed antibiotics* and developed sepsis.   *REALLY?*   smart choice?

TX law :     (b)  The prohibition under Subsection (a) does not apply if:
 	             (1)  the person performing, inducing, or attempting the
 	abortion is a licensed physician;
(2)  in the exercise of reasonable medical judgment,
 	the pregnant female on whom the abortion is performed, induced, or
 	attempted has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by,
 	caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at
 	risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a
 	major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced;
 	and
 	             (3)  the person performs, induces, or attempts the
 	abortion in a manner that, in the exercise of reasonable medical
 	judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to
 	survive unless, in the reasonable medical judgment, that manner
 	would create:
 	                   (A)  a greater risk of the pregnant female's
 	death; or
 	                   (B)  a serious risk of substantial impairment of a
 	major bodily function of the pregnant female.
 	       (c)  A physician may not take an action authorized under
 	Subsection (b) if, at the time the abortion was performed, induced,
 	or attempted, the person knew the risk of death or a substantial
 	impairment of a major bodily function described by Subsection
 	(b)(2) arose from a claim or diagnosis that the female would engage
 	in conduct that might result in the female's death or in substantial

that's not so difficult to interpret that the hospital's lawyers and doctors would do what this article claims."
"Let's deal in facts.  It has already been put that the doctor was incorrect and told so by legislation.  Unfortunate as it is, it's to be expected.  When measured against the lose of life of unborn humans, this isn't extreme."
"Obviously, these so called ""Pro-Lifers"" don't care about any Lives at all, all they really care about is Control and Power, no matter at who's Expense."
These stupid politicians don't know how to balance.
So she's alive and this is just to make a point. Weak.
That doctor is at fault. Obviously she was in a state of life threatening doctor should've done his job that's not legislation that's malpractice
"This is extremely sad and my heart breaks for them and everything about this situation. I hate saying ""because I'm nurse"", but I knew this during my clinical rotation in OB that after a woman has been in labor for too long after her waters break, you give antibiotics! It's open surface and any organism loves them, as well as if a woman that tests positive for strep B you automatically hang antibiotics as soon as they go into labor to protect the baby. I don't care if she was about to miscarry, she should have treated like anyone other women with a viable baby that waters broke too early. This woman/husband might now be able to have a baby now. It just goes to show how twisted some people can be in their own beliefs when they choose a living human over a baby they say won't survive. I highly doubt this is a doctor mistake because they would be suing for malpractice too!"
"I don't underestand..her water broke and they said there was nothing they could do? Why didn't they perform a c section or an induction and try to ssve the baby üò¢..and if the baby died and she got an infection they still should have done a c section or an induced delivery

Those doctors are idiots.

As a doctor you took an oath to provide your patients with the best possible healthcare so they can live happy and healthy lives. But her water broke too soon and these doctors just go damn that sucks..sorry? Umm sounds like a personal problem. They should be charged."
"If I were to become pregnant and see, the baby had no brain stem, and the doctor said this baby is not going to be viable. Or if they told me you and the baby could die from this. And see the baby and I die. My thoughts are one they can do medical research testing on me and my child, learning from my child and my death. We do not know God‚Äòs plan if we are meant to die, then we are meant to die for a certain cause maybe. TRUST IN GOD üëè Not mankind."
"The difference is an abortion kills a living developing baby. This is very different, this is a situation where a baby has died but was not expelled which is bizarre because if your water breaks you usually start labor and deliver very shortly afterwards. If anything she should have been given oxytocin if labour didn‚Äôt start. It seems to me like something is missing here"
Story sounds traumatic and horrible but I can't believe anything CNN promotes. Can we fact check this?
She almost died from septic shock. She wasn‚Äôt developing sepsis. This is absolutely abhorrent and the medical professionals should be punished.
sue texas broke. texas is a dumpster fire of regressive & barbaric ethics.
The way these bills are means doctors have to Wait till what they Know will be life threatening Becomes life threatening üò¢
"There was zero need for an abortion. Early delivery should‚Äôve been done straight away either with an induction or c section. Her doctors are idiots that‚Äôs the real crime here, not an abortion ban"
So how did they remove the baby? Did they give her a c-section or did they do the same process as an abortion?

Texas is THE battle ground state! All you self-righteous Yankies get your asses down here and fight with us! The fascists would never win another election if you did!
"THIS IS ABSURD! listen, I am PRO-LIFE. but when I women‚Äôs fucking water breaks you deliver the baby! You don‚Äôt have to abort it first but they should have delivered her! Ugh prayers for her experience. I‚Äôm sorry for your loss!"
Texas yall gotta get your shit together. You continually fail to make change and actively contribute to killing people everyday
"She was SEPSIS !! 
 My GOD they WAITED UNTIL SHE WAS ON HER DEATHBED before she got the healthcare she needed??BARBARIC! 
VOTE ! BLUE! TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY & OUR FREEDOMS! 
 In the 1800‚Äôs , pioneer woman died in childbirth quite often , because they had no proper healthcare care available. 
 PIONEER DAYS have long since passed! 
 OR HAVE THEY?? 
I wonder if the people who outlawed medically unnecessary abortions would be OK WITH THEIR PASTOR‚Äôs WIFE being LEFT TO DIE?? Or THEIR WIFE or THEIR DAUGHTER?? 
Pro life my foot!!! 
 IF your religion requires you to be left for dead that‚Äôs your choice! 
Others may want to LIVE! That should be THEIR CHOICE!!!"
The all-or-nothing attitude toward abortion is not a solution; it is a problem. Amanda's harrowing story at a committee meeting in Texas was ignored by Cruz and Cornyn both.  That's what I have a problem with:  MAGA mobsters who clearly think that they already know everything there is to know.  They think they own this country.
Soo sorry to hear that you guys went through this‚Ä¶I say this with tears in my eyes
Oh yes you can finally have an abortion when you‚Äôre hours away from dying like wtf
"Explain this to me. In relation to abortion laws most Republicans are pro life. But in relation to gun laws most Republicans are pro what? Selective outrage is real and the motivation is not life, it's greed."
Really feel for the women who will go through this in Texas and other states willing to curtail personal liberties and access to health care.
The GOP have shown and time and time again that they hate women. They‚Äôre not ‚Äúpro life‚Äù they‚Äôre pro misogyny and patriarchy.
Medicine does not end at conception.
Inhumane to treat women like this.
"For the men that want to control women and are happy with this shlt controlling monster law, yall will get back the fck fired, mostly on the red states theres going to be a big wave of women not wanting to date men/hook-up/serious relationship or even marriage because they will be god damn scared to be pregnant basically sperm is going to be considered a weapon so get ready to either be gay or accept trans woman as your new girlfriend/wives/ intimidate partner, get either your balls snipped or be single forever without any women sleeping with you. (This only goes for men that support this law im not saying ALL men, I know there's amazing men out there that are against this and respect women and are decent human beings)"
"She's lucky she didn't lose all her limbs from the sepsis. Or die, like Savita Halappanavar in Ireland."
Nonsense. What a poor story. Shame on you CNN.
There's also another scenario. When a woman gets pregnant and needs to go through chemo for cancer or something like that...
Lies.
"It ain't pro-life, it's exchanging one for the other. Oh and btw...for some of those people saying that it's only 1 percent...you wouldn't feel that way if it was you in that group and that 1 percent of a population of over 300 million is about 3-4 million people. Forcing Women to give birth is a form of mass murder and torture, especially if it's forced nationwide. Let me know when you Feminists are done playing games with the men, drop your failed ideology and join with the Gynarchists to form Gynarchic communities. they are murdering Women with these laws and they won't stop with abortion. Some of them have gone online and advocated to take away your right to vote. Sooner or later, submissive, straight Women and their dominant men will strip away your civil rights. After decades of arguing, discussion, of tireless education, what did that bring you? There's still rape and sexual assault, sex trafficking is on the rise internationally, your civil rights are under assault, your issues are downplayed, minimized, ignored, denied, and your dignity and autonomy are trampled on daily by men who care nothing for you beyond what you can do for them. Is this the kind of life you want for yourself? No more arguments, or discussions with the men who keep abusing Women and their enablers...it's worthless. Become business owners, form Gynarchic intentional households, then communities, learn Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, etc. Economic, physical and social power will get you a lot farther than wasting your time elsewhere. Real power is what you can earn for yourself and frankly, power is the only quality that men respect at the end of the day. To the men out there who have made themselves enemies of Women and their rights: you waged a war against the third and fourth waves of feminism because you were afraid of people like me and of Women ruling. Ironically, those people you attacked weren't Gynarchists at all. All they wanted was to have the same privileges and to be treated with fairness and respect. However, i know what you're like in private and what are lot of you really are when Your Mothers, Sisters, Cousins, and Aunts leave the room. The reality is that men in general will never see Women as equals and will keep shining them on, until they inevitably strip away their rights. It's all tactical for them and once they finally manipulate you into a position of political vulnerability, you'll see what they think of you. You were afraid of me and my brothers and Sisters and perhaps you were right to, because there's no evidence you'll ever change collectively. You'll learn that unlike the feminists, Gynarchists have no fear. Unfortunately for you, we can't be bargained with and won't listen. You had your chance with the Feminists to be reasonable and you threw that out the window. It's interesting that You attacked them, when you know nothing of what authentic Gynarchists believe or why we think the way we do. In a way, i thank you for doing this because it showed us how you think and operate and what your weaknesses are. Gynarchists are doers, not talkers. Self-cultivation is the path to salvation, not waiting for the ethical and moral development of men. And even if they do get what they want, do you honestly think that's a good use of your time? Arguing and discussing things with people who are going to do what they want to anyways, regardless of what you say? Coding, mathematics, science, work-related skills...these are the keys to winning in life and it's a real investment of your time. To the dominant Women and submissive men: The time is coming for us to join together, to fuse our energies and bring balance to Gaia. There is no need to ""smash the patriarchy"", patriarchies are self-sabotaging and self-destructive. When the men have finally fucked up beyond any doubt and the culmination of the cycle of resentment, destruction, abuse, and violence leaves billions in it's wake, our time will come. Survive, and thrive, my Sisters and brothers."
Texas republicans will live to see brown immigrants breed them out of existence....
These laws are insane
Abortion is murder
Republicans don't care. They want to torture women.
"ohhh, so sorry, are you being subject to the consequences of your beliefs and actions????"
Based Texas law
Well it was the woman fault for getting abortion and killing her own child
Every man or woman who wants an abortion must be sterilized. Playing parents is for mature people who are responsible for their sexual conquests.
"As long as people like them live in Texas, they'll always be in a prison like environment without any control over their own bodies. The only solution for them is to relocate to a State where the State Government doesn't interfere in their personal lives."
IF SHE died that is one death. Compare that to 50 million babies murdered since 1973.
I am so pissed this isn‚Äôt right and now these people may never be able to try again for another child because of something preventable
They could have not listened to the doctors and had faith. But no. They speak nothing but negative now. And are used by a network that drip feeds child murderers who are desperate to f*ck and kill.
Old white men who control Texas decide when a woman can get medical care or not. They way they feel is woman are nothing more than a host for a baby.
Absolutely horrid and a total shame üòû
Not being able to murder a baby did what üòÆ
Almost only counts in Horseshoes
"This woman was sacrificed to make a stupid point. The fact that the law was vague at the time was all the more reason to go ahead and perform the life saving procedure. It was a stupid defiant excuse to wait and not help this woman. Why do people have to be so extreme? Is balance too hard of a concept for humans? On one side they want to abort all and on the other side they want to separate none from the mother. None, why not?  Isn't that what the NICU is for? Also how difficult is it to check for a heartbeat? The baby was obviously on its way out. They could have checked for a heartbeat everyday until there was none. They could have induced labor. They maybe could have replaced the amniotic fluid and repaired the sac."
I am glad she cant have kids because having kids is selfish and horrible. But I am also glad she still got to get the abortion. Pro Life should really be called Pro Sadists because they only want you born so you can suffer. They only care about us when we are not born. Once we are born they just want us to suffer. Thats why I wish all women would get an abortion because every abortion saves a child from being born in this trash world. I am for everything Trump does but the abortion bans are the only thing I dont like because I am only for abortions because I wish I was aborted and every time an abortion occurs a child is spared from being born and having to deal with this corrupt government and crooked school systems. Hopefully she wont be able to have kids because its not a good idea to force another human being into this trash. But I am also glad that most women know that when abortions are banned they can just end the pregnancy themselves. Thats what most women do anyway. They either end the pregnancy themselves or go out of state. Abortion bans only stops clinics. Not the actual abortion. Thank you to all the women out there who had an abortion. You saved a child from this trash world.
The infection is not what caused the scarring. It was the abortion. Abortion causes scarring and damage to the uterus because it causes trauma to the tissue.
Sounds like the doctors killing people cause they're afraid of liability.
"There's so many people being killed, why? Because their being told that life has no value! Do you value life? Give the baby a chance. Do to others as you would have them do to you. Matthew 7:12 If the tables were turned would it have been okay for your baby to abort you? Instead repent/believe in God's son Jesus, he loves you and can change your heart."
"Maybe people should care less about an unborn child and more about actual fully grown human beings
People are getting dumber by the day"
Sue the Texas legislature and sue the hospital
"The Texas women who voted for Abbott and the Texas GOP, I have no sympathy for you when you find yourself in this situation this is what you voted for! Beto would have got rid of this extreme law SB8"
That is awful...smh. Ridiculous.
"Abortion = killing in horrible pain of unborn children. Abortion by saline injection feels like being burned alive, while abortion by curettage rips off all the child's body parts (imagine how that feels). The nervous system is already developed at 6 weeks, so that the pain these children feel are very real (but unlike pro-abortionists, they do not have a voice to express themselves). With the exceptions of the pregnancies that put the mother life in danger (which are very rare), abortions should be illegal. If a driver kills a pregnant woman on a pedestrian crossing, that driver faces TWO charges for murder (in that context, the life of the baby matters). Instead, if his mom decides to kill him in horrible pain, suddenly that is not a crime anymore?"
"Well, this really wasn't an abortion because the baby was essentially dead already.   Needless to say, no doctor wanted to touch her for fear of being sued or prosecuted.   Texas anti-abortion law probably needs to be tweaked."
üò¢
To hell with Greg abbott and to hell with this rotten anti abortion movement
"Do a caesarean and try to save the baby. Prob wont make it, but thats more prolife"
Dont kill babies
"This is totally BS, they let people have abortions in life threatening situation's, incest or rape, another out right lie of the radical enemy of the people CNN not surprised, some people need to wake up, their book smart but don't have any common sense what so ever, y'all better learn your rights so people and establishments like this can't incite and brain wash you!"
"Babies this age are usually born totally fine without any complications. If your water breaks before 34 weeks, your doctor will probably give you antibiotics to fend off potential infections, plus steroids to help your baby's lungs develop. You may have to stay in the hospital to be monitored for signs of labor."
"None of cnn's story made sense medically, if her water broke she should have been made to deliver the baby. When your water breaks it doesn't mean your baby is going to die, it means you have to give birth, Cnn is getting desperate. Like wtf"
Such a disgusting lie. You don't perform an abortion for PPROM you induce labor. CNN is lying through their teeth right now. Virtually all abortions are performed to terminate an otherwise healthy baby.
What an awful situation.
"I was certain comments would be turned off. Another unnecessary tragedy. Hope they had the best insurance you can buy, being bankrupted is the next notch in the American way"
Imagine having to keep A DECAYING DEAD BABY INSIDE YOUR UTERUS becasue of the government
"Don't tell the truth here and expect it to stay, tried twice now and realized it was CNN, move on."
I‚Äôm a Christian. So obviously I heavily disagree with abortion. No one I know is for it. So I want some people to reply why it‚Äôs right. Especially pro-life Christians. I want it to be a respectful debate so I can understand why you people think abortion is right
"This doesn't make any medical sense whatsoever. 

If your water broke, delivery should have been induced. 

None of this adds up. 

But keep pushing this propaganda as if it's factual."
If the doctor cant set his foot down and say the only way we can save the woman is to deliver the baby (and pray work and hope the best for the baby) the doctor laces  bone in the nose and should not be a doctor    and that people working in heltcare  are turning this uppsid down putting people at risk to make a point  and te point being we dont have the balls to stand upp for life Just hiding behind the law of No abortion to not take a needed desision of delivering to save the women is putting bouth the lives at risk  I am pro life all the human lifes and sometimes hard desisjons have to be made  bretter to save one than none but if possible tray to save bouth
"‚ÄúWhen pregnant, the cells of the baby migrate into the mothers bloodstream and then circle back into the baby, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúfetal-maternal microchimerism‚Äù.‚Å†

For 41 weeks, the cells circulate and merge backwards and forwards, and after the baby is born, many of these cells stay in the mother‚Äôs body, leaving a permanent imprint in the mothers tissues, bones, brain, and skin, and often stay there for decades. Every single child a mother has afterwards will leave a similar imprint on her body, too.

Even if a pregnancy doesn't go to full term or if you have an abortion, these cells still migrate into your bloodstream.

Research has shown that if a mother's heart is injured, fetal cells will rush to the site of the injury and change into different types of cells that specialize in mending the heart.

The baby helps repair the mother, while the mother builds the baby.

How cool is that?

This is often why certain illnesses vanish while pregnant.

It‚Äôs incredible how mothers bodies protect the baby at all costs, and the baby protects & rebuilds the mother back - so that the baby can develop safely and survive.

Think about crazy cravings for a moment. What was the mother deficient in that the baby made them crave?

Studies have also shown cells from a fetus in a mothers brain 18 years after she gave birth. How amazing is that?‚Äù

If you‚Äôre a mom you know how you can intuitively feel your child even when they are not there‚Ä¶.Well, now there is scientific proof that moms carry them for years and years even after they have given birth to them.

I find this to be so very beautiful.
Just a clump of cells right?"
Don't Murder Your Children
Prefers the castration cry from school kids due to school imposed sex change...
"The Republican Church- ""That's too bad. But Our imaginary deity still wants us to force all women and girls to comply with our religious beliefs."""
I call B.S. SAVE THE BABY MOMMA'S GOING TO HELL
(Murder) MAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE!!!!
Why do they continue to vote üó≥Ô∏è for abbot against their self interest? He just won re-election despite all the things he‚Äôs done and continues to do
Texas is a pro life state. Murderers of innocent babies need to live elsewhere. We don't have 20 pro life cities in the state for no reason.
"The GOP do not care about this.  They don't care!  To them, a few dead women here and there, a few women in ICU who become infertile after being denied treatment - this is a price worth paying.  Don't expect sympathy or revised laws from the GOP.  They do not care about anyone other than ""the fetus"", right up until it's born.  Then if you dare ask for assistance, you are a deadbeat welfare cheat, sucking the nation dry on benefits."
Abortion should remain legal but only for liberals same as suicide
"Well, I hope all you anti abortion people are happy"
So it's apparent the baby died?
My mother is a cps worker and saw she was so upset and asked her what was wrong . She came to see a child that was in a watchlist. She found out the girl was pregnant. She‚Äôs only 13 . She was molested how can she be a mother . She‚Äôs barely trying to figure out her life. I don‚Äôt understand why a child needs to be forced to have a child ??! I don‚Äôt understand why people choose to point fingers at women who aren‚Äôt even ready to be mothers yet there is nobody doing anything to help out in adoption centers.
"There is nothing in Texas that prevented Amanda from receiving the medical procedure to remove the already dead baby. This is not an abortion and not related to pro life bills in any way. These are activist doctors who played with a woman's life rather than giving her the care she needed. We now have activists pretending to be journalists using this woman's tragedy to further an agenda to electively murder as many babies as they can.

You people are vile."
"I love how abortion is ""murder"" but creating a law preventing a women from being saved when she's dieing isn't. What the actual fuck. This is such a violation of women's rights is sickening."
Ohno
These anti-abortion fantastic need to say out of people‚Äôs business
What this coouple went through is horrible and inhumane on multiple levels. And what happened to them makes me very glad to be living in California.
Oh well....
"And 63,459, 781 baby girls and boys have actually died because over 63 million women were given one."
"I think those elections need To be scrutinized , gone over with a fine tooth comb. He cheated I know it."
She needs to SUE GREG ABBOTT THE CAVEMAN
"So tell me, how did the caveman  abbott get reelected ???? Don't get pregnant in texas...that's all I gotta say..."
So I'm guessing the killer mom killed the baby?
What I want to know is did she voted for GOP politicians who pushed for abortion ban? If she did then she'd needs to shut and put up with GOP policies/laws. What did women in these red states think when they're voted for Republican politicians? Republican politicians do not advocate for women!
"I am a republican, and I am first hear say how sorry I am for Amanda. Next these abortion laws need to be for causes between a woman and doctor but only for the right reason. Not just to get an abortion because you don‚Äôt feel like you want to be pregnant that is murder"
Yes women will die and you can thank Republikkkans.
It's always a bad idea for ignorant politicians to make decisions that a Doctor should make.
Right-wing and Christian conservatives don't care if you almost die after being denied an abortion. They care if you have sex.
How all the babies died in the abortion
"I had severe sepsis after getting some of my bowel removed. I was septic for 3 days and was told it was in my head. I prepared for death and everything. Told my parents not to come visit me that day. I was very very lucky because usually when sepsis symptoms shows itself, it's already too late. Was revived 4 times in the OR"
"Never forget: ""pro life"" = ""oppress women"""
Awful yes. But this is a VERY isolated event. Doesn't happen very often. Leave it to cnn to push an agenda and try to make the public believe it's a national emergency. Just like covid which was bs too
Now do one about how thousands of children die daily BECAUSE they're aborted.
"Let people make their own choices, and let God discern their hearts not you. People wish they were masters over others, smh. Grow up."
"That's what you get for living in Texas, a state where people elect a government that enjoys your suffering. Enjoy 4, 8,16, possibly 32+ more years of this happening to women in Texas, where ""God"" guns and football are more important than your freedom"
"Abortion is a disgusting act. But Abortion should only be applied under certain circumstances. It's shouldn't be I got pregnant I don't want the baby I am not ready , my body my decision type of reasoning to get rid of the unborn because that would only promote irresponsibility on both men and women. On her case on other hand, the doctor or the hospital should have done something about and put it into details why she is required to have one. It is their responsibility to defend the need of their patient since it a life threatening case. It is common sense. I'm pro-life anti-abortion. Again Abortion isn't applicable to all so don't abuse it."
"This is beyond ridiculous and barbaric in 2022. She almost died amd now likley can't have children. It's like the government in the U.S. have zero education, common sense and empathy.  
 Come on!!!! We have the resources to help and save lives, relieve suffering. What happened to her medically wirg the pregnancy was tragic enough. This is not the 1700s."
Some lawsuits needs to be filed
Yea got no shame pro choice all day

"Of all people you would think that ""oppressed victims"" would be the ones to care for these little ones ¬ø¬ø Every man for himself I guess ?? ..or shall I say every ""victim."" 

Imagine a world where people don't care about babies being murdered in the womb, and where Life itself isn't a basic human right ?? Now add a zombie apocalypse and rants about ""justice"" and ""equality""?? 

..or here's one ""stop controlling my Life"" followed by fighting for the power to snuff out someone else‚Äôs Life ¬ø¬ø ü§® ..yes I need the freedom to snuff out a perfectly healthy little baby in the womb because I'm against ""crazy people trying to control women"" ¬ø¬ø You just can't make this circus show up, it's pure comedy yet still very twisted and sick."
"You all in Texas still put back the idiots in power, so!!!!!!!!"
Remember the Republicans are the prolife partyü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
"Basically turning a perfectly healthy baby into hazardous medical waste is now ""healthcare"" ?? 

Via ""a woman'$ medical deci$ion"" hundreds of thousands of pre-born black babies are aborted every year, and millions have become hazardous medical waste since 1973. All we need now are some white robes and pointed masks ü§´ Who would've thought?? ..all this woke ""liberation"" is starting to make Republikkkans look like a bunch of saints.

..and how odd it's only ""a baby"" when it fits the narrative ¬ø¬ø We need to care about mothers being in danger while our most vulnerable in society are being murdered ¬ø¬ø ..and tough luck I guess you can't be ""oppressed"" or a ""minority"" if you're in the womb ?? ..there's no place for you in this WORLD OF VICTIM$!??"
"This is unfortunately the inevitable consequence of this fascist and insane policies by republicans.  But republicans don't care if women die because of the sick and intolerant policies.  To them it is all about maintaining power at all costs.  

At some point the public will become educated enough and remove the cancer that infects Texas politics as well as many other red states."
"This is not just a problem in states with anti abortion laws. 

Catholic hospitals will never provide abortions as medical care. They will let the mother die to save her immortal soul."
Get a good lawyer! This isnt right!!
This is how GOP cares about people?!
"So, I wonder what all the pro-lifers have to say about this that all said that the mothers life isnt at risk and when it is she can abort..."
SUE THE LAW MAKERS!!!!! SUE SUE SUE!!!!!!
"Barbie's Abortion ""Barbie's Abortion""
https://youtu.be/RW1f3yLHiY4"
"Exodus 21, for example, suggests that a pregnant woman‚Äôs life is more valuable than the fetus‚Äôs. This text describes a scenario in which men who are fighting strike a pregnant woman and cause her to miscarry. A monetary fine is imposed if the woman suffers no other harm beyond the miscarriage. However, if the woman suffers additional harm, the perpetrator‚Äôs punishment is to suffer reciprocal harm, up to life for life."
Yet Texas keep going red.
Laws made by people in offices sick
A New Jersey woman was killed waiting for a gun permit because of her abusive boyfriend. You know. An actual right that none of you seem to care about.
Maybe women should do a better job at vetting their sexual partners. This is 100% women‚Äôs fault. Maybe they should be more responsible eh?
Restore roe!
Oh come on already. If it's a medical emergency it can be done.
Where are the pro-life Republican commenters at? What do you have to say about this? I noticed none of you are commenting. Because there is no defense for controlling a persons life.
CNN is ran by Satanist
Mother's killing their children . Change my mind .
Sorry don‚Äôt believe this
Quit voting for republicans.
As more cases are Iike this happen it wiII turn the most conservative person and their entire famiIy to vote bIue.
Horse crap. I work in obstetrics and they could have admitted and given IV antibiotics to mom to prevent infection they do it all the time. Infection is not the fault of the baby and abortion would not have prevented it. Dumbass people believe whatever for the benefit of this assault against unborn babies and children. üò°
Time for governments and insurance companies to back out of health care.  Leave the decisions up to qualified physicians.
"This is what happens when you rush through a law without thought or discussion. It is MASSIVELY irresponsible on the part of lawmakers. Folks, get the heck out of Texas and Florida, before this happens to YOU."
Apparently Pro lifers don't care about the life of the mother
It sounds like she was just used as a political piece of the game.  Her abortion was medical needed. There was no reason doctor didn't give her one. They knew everything that would happen to her if they didn't do it. Abortion that are just use by women as birth control is what should be stop. Not this.
"Ah.... good ole Texas..... the hell hole of America.

Thank god I live in a blue state.üôèüèæ"
They both look like they need more sleep
"Well, women in Texas have done this to themselves. Good luck, you keep voting for misogynistic men and this is what you get. Women literally voted for turning women into property."
"Texas  white women voted overwhelmingly for walking crime wave  Cheetos Jesus,   Who put  Far Right Extreme Judges on the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade. Yea!  do that,  Vote for him again."
"Kinda like the babies life that is denied?  Gtfo out of this country, u sex obsessed disgusting baby killers"
Prayers for this couple. This is the true consequences of not thinking through  overturning Roe vs Wade. Hope more women and their partners see this so they make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen again.
"I worked in womens health always did d&c after incomplete miscarriage
Why is this a political issue and not a medical issue because their asking for trouble if this continues and women could sue the government for negligence of care"

How did we lose Gen Z vote üó≥? 
Anti-woman policies!"
They won't answer because there are all stupid people.
If the GOP now pretends to moderate on issues like abortion - don't buy it! The will LIE like their scotus nominees. 2024 must be more blue (or independent). Pro-choice Republicans want to have their cake and eat it too. It won't work. Fanatics never rest. MAGA = Taliban
The healthcare in US is so much worse than in many really poor countries. Its not socialism to pay for your healthcare via your taxes...
So then maybe you should stop voting for people who would rather let you die .
OH. NO.... NOBODY SHOULD BE PUT THROUGH THIS.  .I COULDN'T IMAGINE.. ..MY PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU GIRL.....YOUR. FAMILY IS BEAUTIFUL.... GREATFUL SHE HAS A GOOD HUSBAND.   THIS IS JUST WRONG.

What ever happened to separation of church and state ?

We are not England."
Being a Texan is often embarrassing.
Her race isn't the most terminating babies. Its blacks
Stupid Texas laws.  Last year I had a Septic infection in my bladder from a kidney stone day surgery operation that went bad.  I almost died and I was rushed back to the hospital by ambulance when I had a temp of 105.  It was very scary.  I was in the hospital for 10 days on IV antibiotics.  This is not an infection to play around with.  This lady could had died because the doctors had their hands tied for these ridiculous barbaric laws.   If I were them I would move out of Texas.
"You get what you vote for. Leave Texas, if you're smart."
Move out of the state . I feel incredibly sad and bad for this couple and so many others
"Texas state elected legislators not doctors almost cost this woman her life with their ignorance and may have destroyed her ability to have future children. This is why a bunch of idiots shouldn't be given this kind of power. I hope she sues the Texas State lawmakers to Hell and back.

In what can only be seen as a punitive and hateful punishment of women who have abortions, Tea Party Georgia Republican Rep. Terry England, in support of a bill which would ban abortions after 20 weeks (HR 954), says that women should be forced to carry dead fetuses to term. Why? Because cows and pigs have to do it and that‚Äôs apparently how his god wants it. Never mind the health risk to mothers being forced to carry dead fetuses to term. Republicans hate mothers and want them to die early and often.


Legalizing the Murder of Abortion Doctors Tea Party 2012 
South Dakota tried to pass a law to make the murder of an abortion doctor legal as self-defense
When South Dakota was forced to drop the idea of murdering abortion doctors, Nebraska and Iowa picked up the idea See also HB 3308 Life Defense Act of 2012 which has implications in this regard."
Made up story
"RIP Little Angel Vote does those idiot‚Äôs out of the SENATE,the House never another President who doesn‚Äôt support abortion rights üò¢üò¢üò¢"
"So.... old guys determine that women are not allowed abortion. They don't have a womb so they can't give birth. How can they even think about it. These old men have no clue at all, let alone about politics.........."
"Nothing to do with the anti abortion law.
This law doesn't prevent abortion if the doctor judgement feels that the mother is risking her life.
So it was a WRONG human medical decision.
My prayers for Amanda and Josh, I know what they feel."
This is bullshit propaganda. Dislike.

I'm just saying ü§∑"
Most women who want to get an abortion aren‚Äôt at risk like this lady üòÇ Pro life and pro choice are both wrong. It should be in the middle closer to pro life. You have 8-10 weeks to ‚Äòfigure it out‚Äô or else you gotta keep that baby. Simple. You pro choice retards get your choice and you pro life morons get your wish.
...
There was a good set of reasons for ROE v Wade.... we WILL remember WHY it HAD to pass.  The toll of human suffering was abhorrent.   If Anti abortionists don't want one don't get one.      SHOW us FIRST how you became the superior person....     Save Up and Adopt EACH AND EVERY ONE of those wee babies birthed by ill prepared parents. Gonna do that?       Not Too Chickensh*t are ya?             WRITE THE CHECK and keep your Mind on your own damn crotches....
"How many more lives will be at risk of being lost needlessly? How many more will suffer damage by these barbaric restrictions? How many more lives will be forever scared?

So sorry for your loss and your health issue. You telling your story helps so many more to understand the reality of the new law. Please know that the majority of Americans believe your heartbreaking story should never happen again. The blessing is that you both have each other and your Love is probably stronger as a result if your tragedy."
Yep welcome to 2022 inconceivable and what a shame that men laws can decide how a woman can do with her own body.
Fake news.  Doctors wouldn‚Äôt leave a miscarriage to decay.  Don‚Äôt believe the propaganda.
"People just don't realise how disastrous being anti-abortion is until it hits them, personally. I know that life is precious. This woman's should be JUST as precious as her unborn child's was. But, that's not how she was treated. Shame on the doctors!

I'm sorry for what they went through. It didn't seem to matter to the rest of Texas, though. They re-elected Abbott and I'm sure all of their House Representatives on the national level are Republican.

No amount of stories like these or what happened to the 10 year old in Ohio are enough to sway these monsters."
"Put aside the fact that they had to focus on a ‚Äúnice, white, homely couple‚Äù who ‚Äúmet in kindergarten‚Äù, when there‚Äôs undoubtedly 100,000 of the same stories in black & brown communities, THIS is the travesty of American anti-women laws. You‚Äôre abhorrent USA."
"Common, those that voted for Republicans to represent them, your vote for any republican has caused this and many more. Own this couple's pain and anguish, i hope this pain befalls all that voted republicans into office.."
Shame on people who vote for this
"Abortion is every woman's choice across the majority of the world.
Republicans are like Taliban men dictating what subjugated women should do. Land of freedom?
The US constitution has been amended 27 times and is the reason they are called amendments."
And yet they kept electing those same people that are opposing those laws or just they didn't vote... The only people i'm sorry for are the people that did vote for the right persons and get dragged down with the rest of the stupid fanatics
This is all GOP BS.  Punt Abbot for his ineptitude
She's high risk for issues with another pregnancy and does she want to risk that while living in Texas?  She could die for sure.
"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners, immigrants, the sick, the poor, widows, orphans. All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible, they all get thrown under the bus for the unborn"
I'm so sorry for your loss and heartbreak.
"She‚Äôs not dead though, and most abortions aren‚Äôt to protect the life of the mother.  Most are for convenience."
"Nothing is going to change in Texas until businesses and more citizens affected by these extremist laws start standing up and speaking out to not only Abbott's office but to the state's courts as well.  As long as you live in Texas with Abbott as governor, he will continue to force you to live by ""his principles!"" Blue voters need to start reaching out to rural and suburban Texas because those are the places that kept Abbott governor of Texas. He probably thinks you both are sinners and deserved what happened. Imagine someone running your state that thinks that way about you. üò¢"
One shouldn't get pregnant in such a state. Young couples should leave. Too much risk.
This is going to become a more and more common story if these barbaric anti-choice laws continue being implemented ü§¶glad she didn't fucking die.
"That sounds more like a hospital who didn't know how to interpret the law. It's clear in this video, she qualified the moment her water broke. She should sue the hospital."
republican polices are responsible women are second class citizens thanks to them
"Almost died = still alive.
Am I correct?"
Texans who voted for Abbott and the other Republicans should share the blame for this!!
"Well, Texas‚Ä¶ They keep on electing the same people who brought them nightmare."
"Blame the republicans and their barbaric christians "" pro life """
There has to be a law firm willing to take these cases pro bono & sue the States.
That is despicable that Amanda did not receive the care she desperately needed üò° Shame on Texas and their barbaric and backwards laws. I would never live in that state even if you paid me . God bless you Amanda for your strength.
I just think that baby almost died before she got done an abortion
They should sue the state!
"And yet, most Texans still voted Abbott in as a governor!!
They will never learn!!!"
"Used to want to go to Texas...but with these barbaric laws, the racist governor,  & judges giving murderers bond...it would be the last place I'd want to go !?"
I hope we elect Warnock is so much more competent. Pro-Choice and he was co sponsor of S.53 - Raise the Wage Act of 2021. Hope it passes in the Senate. Too bad we don‚Äôt have the üè†.

"Dose CNN Ever report About a baby that was not Murdered üòÆ. 
Or report alive saved from somebody‚Äôs bad decision from a night of drinking üò¢
However medical required termination should be automatic if Complications arise."
By the GOP packing the Supreme Court and planning the demise of abortion rights more women might end up like that woman or die. Roe vs Wade MUST BE CODIFIED.
It's incomprehensible to me how people keep voting for people like Abbott and his cronies from Hell who make these laws.
You didn't mention the names of the ones you contacted and refused to comment. Why?
She doesn‚Äôt have to live in Texas. There‚Äôs plenty of states she can go to vacuum her baby out if her. She didn‚Äôt die so what‚Äôs the fuss? The left is all about killing babies and grooming children
"Doctors could stop this. They are cowards. They could easily band together and do right by their patients and  not the expedient political thing.  But their country club lifestyle is at stake, can't have that jeopardized."
And yet Texan still voted for Republican. So what that tell u?
I think America needs the Iranian women to show them how it's done
Thanks to Republicans.
Based Texas.
Sounds like they passed laws halfbaked.
Talking about one woman we are talking about thousands of babies being murdered. She is still alive all the babies are dead.
I guess this is what happens when politicians make the medical  decisions and not the physician. We already have an AG threaten criminal case against the physician who performed the abortion the 10 year old case. So I can see why physicians feel like their hands are completely tied with anything concerning abortion.
"After being a republican for almost years 20, I'll never vote for them again.  This makes my blood boil."
≈ªurawski is a Polish surname. Unfortunately similar cases caused deaths of women in Poland because of barbaric law. People do fight for our human rights across the borders!!!
No story on the guy whole stole billions of dollars and funneled it through the democrat party through Ukraine our tax money what nobody cares about that. That‚Äôs just shows you how messed this world really is
What a bunch of bull shit. Talk about pushing an agenda. Just call yourself the Democrat news network
"This is a Governor that believes he is making the right decision for all women regardless of the outcome and Texas keeps voting the 3 pack back in. Women need to unite and bring a major lawsuit. 
I am so sorry for what this young couple had to insure. No one is a second class citizen. Blessings and love from San Antonio Texas. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
These laws are pro death if anything.
You need to move to state that can help you when pregnant for all women.
Murdering a million Americans with covid wasn't enough for the bloodthirsty pro-life crowd.  They're going for another million in childbirth.  They have zero respect for human life.  That's always been fake news.
Where I come from doctors would put saving a life before the law and the courts would agree.
"Thanks to the unaccountable Catholic oligarchy known as the Supreme Court, woman like Amanda can now be hunted by vigilantes for a $10,000 cash bounty and force to prove, in court, that they suffered a miscarriage, not an abortion.  Morally foul religious right builds its path to power on the *destruction* of women."
"Politicians who try to kill pregnant women must not be allowed to stand for election in a free democracy! Even the Taliban are more advanced in human rights then Republicans these days!
Wake up, American conservatives, you are voting for criminal assault and female mass murder!"
Thanks Greg.
This makes my blood boil. How can Republicans be so f..ken stupid.
The government should not have the rights to a WOMAN'S BODY!!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
ü§°
good heavens. i say those doctors are cowards.  they could have defended earlier actions to save her life...blessings to all
"Republicans would rather have a fetus burst through a woman's abdomen like an Alien then claim it was ""God's Will"" with a Trumpy smirking shrug than let her terminate an unviable and deadly pregnancy."
Crazy shit! Leave our bodies  ourselves!!!
Nazi doctors were better than republicans
I‚Äôm so sad and angry. I think this whole situation is ridiculous
My biggest nightmare is literally coming true. Wtaf. All decided by men who will never ever comprehend or understand the joy and horror of carrying life.
"This story just breaks my heart in ways I can't describe!!

Politicians need to get OUT of our Healthcare!!!!!!!!"

"How about all the failed abortions on when the baby was born and taken to a room to die??
They were issued both life and death certificates

"This is TOTAL OUTRAGEOUS!!!

GOT OUT OF TEXAS.... FAST!!!"
"And what about all the babies that did die because they were denied a life to live? It‚Äôs crazy how people don‚Äôt care. Reproductive Rights, oxymoron. Call it what it is, Terminating Rights."
SWEETIE I'M SORRY...WAS RAPED BY 10 MEN. AND WHAT IF I HAD GOTTEN PREGNANT...WAS LEFT FOR. DEAD.   MY. HEART GOES OUT TO YOU ..I CAN'T HAVE KIDS CAUSE THEY DAMMAGED. ME.....I AM PRAYING FOR YOU ALWAYS... . MATHEW 4.24 ...BLESS YOU BOTH
What a nightmare! I'm so sorry you lived and are still living through it. :(
Young parents do not have a certain future in Texas and neither do children. Neither do doctors. Death to barbarism.
How is it an abortion if the cells are already dead? I‚Äôm so confused.
If she died trumptards would say it was god's will. üôÑ
"I almost died walking across the street, what‚Äôs your point?"
One of my best friends died from sepsis two days after her child was born.
She probably would have gotten less  time for shooting a Texas politician than a doctor performing a life saving abortion in some states. This is what it has come down to.
I know this network isn‚Äôt considered a news station. But don‚Äôt they have some sort of obligation to telling the truth or is it simply what democrats want to hear? Where‚Äôs Jackie?
"Welcome to America in 2022 ...moving forward :(
And for all the dems wins...there are so many places now where womens lives are at risk daily.  So sad...but we still gave women killers the house...:("
"My heart goes out to Amanda and her husband. The anti abortion laws should be fine-tuned to better address Amanda's situation. But there should still be a total ban on elective abortions. The extreme cases like Amanda's are extremely rare (less than 1%). I'm not mad that CNN is showing the extreme cases, one life lost is many. But the lawmakers should fine-tune the laws to serve the people better. Our mantra is ""Save them Both"". We need both the mother and her child alive."
omg this makes me so sad.
"0ver 300,000 babies murdered in one year by Planned Parenthood!!!"
Thanks Ted?
"Marsha here. ABORTION HAS NEVER BEEN A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT??? Planned Parenthood, which has a financial interest in keeping abortion on demand legal, will keep fighting at the state and national level to make abortion a (BS) constitutional ‚Äúright‚Äù again. The organization‚Äôs most recent annual report showed a record number of abortions (383,460) and a record revenue ($1.7 billion)."
All the dumbasses who want abortion banned no matter what üñïüèº
This could have been prevented by not fucking in the first place
"While I detest the idea of abortion (I believe it's murder), I also believe there are certain times when an abortion would be necessary. For instance, if the mother's life were in danger. The people that make me mad are the ones who get an abortion ""just because"" or ""it' an inconvenience to me"" or worst of all, they see a potential human being as nothing more than a mere parasite. Abortion should be left for each state to decide, not the federal government as a whole. All life is sacred, no matter where you come from, and all life deserves a chance to enter the world."
That's what happens when the Republicans (particularly the ones in the Supreme Court) decide to do more harm than good.
The US is quickly becoming a global pariah
Lmfao. False. Can't believe anything from CNN. Trump 2024!
"üìùüñåüìùüñåüìùüñåüìùüñåüìùüñå‚úèÔ∏èüìùüñåüìùHOW TO BE SAVED:
There Is only one God, in three persons, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.  ONE God.
Humans are ONE person ( in three parts) The body, soul and spirit.  Three parts, ONE person.
The Bible says that we are all sinners.
As it is written:  There is none righteous , no not one.  Romans 3:10
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.Romans 3:23
But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness are as filthy rags. Isaiah 64:6
For the wages of sin is death. Romans 6:23  (The word death in this verse means eternal separation from God in hell).
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Isaiah 1:18
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that He was buried and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures. 1Corinthians 15:3-8
In whom we have redemption through His blood, even the forgiveness of sins. Colossians 1:14
For by grace ye are saved, through faith; and not of yourselves.
It is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9
I do not frustrate the grace of God, for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.  Galatians 2:21
If you would like to receive Jesus as your Savior.  Realize that you are a hopeless sinner and tell Jesus that you trust in Him and only Him to save you from hell.
Your trust in Jesus and His shed blood on the cross to pay for your sins, is what saves you from hell.
The moment you trust in Jesus and only Jesus, you are saved.
Then, you should be  baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
"Hello bots üëã
And the women who almost die from getting one?
Won't cover that. SANTINO BLANCO"
"But it's okay to kill the baby, huh? This is political BS, and you think it's all about DEMOCRACY at stake? Our democracy will never be at stake, for we are a constitutional Republic! Definitely need some term-limits on our SCOTUS though, Left and Right!"
you should be protecting the option of abortion for people who weren't impregnated by their high school sweethearts.. that was an unnecessary detail.
"This is why the government should never get involved in a woman's health care.  An abortion is a medical proceedure.  It is up to the woman, her doctor, her family and her god.  It is no one else's business. Period!!!"
They still voted for Abbott sorry you get what you vote for sorry but they will be more
The GOP doesn't care about women health or rights.
"It's not pro-life or anything, ots BEING RESPONSIBLE WITH WHAT ONE DOES WITH THEIR OWN BODIES BEFORE THEY NEED SURGERY  (and then special cases: incest victims ,rape victims and special circumstances that threaten life) so stop the fighting and realize it's ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE!!!!!"
"I think these doctors are cowards, they take the hypocritic oath and do nothing. In the past people with clout have gone to jail for their believes .It happened in ireland and a woman died, but the laws were changed she did not die in vain.If a doctor had aborted the fetus no court would have convicted him there would have been hell to pay."
Absolutely abhorrent. These laws are insane. Shame on anyone who pushed for this.
"There is nothing at all ""pro-life"" about a Doctor having to wait until a woman is near death, suffering through Sepsis with a temperature of 104, before they can legally remove her naturally dying fetus."
Here we go again with CNN not using common sense just common ignorance. Any FACTS on the total number of people that this happens to. CNN thanks for the useless non-information again. How many clicks did you get?
Propaganda roll out post midterms
So sad. This didn‚Äôt have to be this way. This story needs to be told so the law can be amended to protect Moms.
Also Republicans: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt understand how we lost women and Gen Z in these midterm elections. . . ‚Äú
I am Still surprised Kkk QOP Abbot still in office .
An abortion always ends a human life
They call Texas The Lone Star State not because of what‚Äôs on our flag but because that‚Äôs what our state is rated‚Ä¶‚Ä¶one star!
I believe there will be more of these stories over the next 2 years. I‚Äôm sure it will affect the next election.
"When our border is secure, we can deal with this."
"If you want somebody to blame for this, blame Christians."
"So Republicans,  you're now feeling the ramifications of your laws. Hell hath no fury than a woman scorned or suffering.  They'll make you regret passing those laws."
"Texas is like living in a other country, and I can't tell you what country but it's a very discrimination nation."
Why anyone would live in a 3rd world $#it hole like Texas is beyond me. It's hard to believe that place exists in a western democratic country.
"One thing that we the people know: Social Conservatives follow the principle of ""the ends justify the means.""  They lie, cheat and deceive for what they claim is their God.  Doing such immoral actions for God means that they can justify any unethical behavior (e.g., winning at all cost, God sanctions slavery, flying jets into World Trade Center buildings, etc.).  And they do justify any and all of their unethical behavior.  Nothing good nor decent has ever come from social conservatism."
"Bs. Here's one, Equality is a two way street. If you wanna keep pushing infanticide and calling it ""bodily autonomy"" then it's time to talk about ending routine infant circumcision and starting federal protections for bodily autonomy for both genders, and address the fact that only one gender has had their bodily autonomy protected by law for decades now. You can't only focus on women's issues and not even try to cover men's issues any, it doesn't work that way if you want true equality."
When a man can birth a baby out his body then he can have say as to life in the womb.
"This is the biggest bullshit story EVER !
So after all she got here abortion. It wasn‚Äôt as fast as she wanted. 
Where are the doctors  ? Why aren‚Äôt they there to confirm her danger ? Why are they there to confirm how sick she was ?"
I‚Äôm so sorry for your pain and sorrow. I say bring suit to the Texas legislature that made this stupid law. It is barbaric.
Fake news if a woman's life's in danger she can have an abortion that's between her and God.
"Anytime a woman is attacked over her healthcare it's misogyny. Anytime a woman nearly died or does die, it's misogyny. Any time a woman loses her fertility because of treatment delay, it's misogyny. Anytime a child who is raped is denied an abortion, it's misogyny. So called ""pro-life"" people are hypocrites who hate women and don't even support fully funded child care."
All hail Texas!
So sad
"Why can't Republicans ignore abortion? You know, like they do school shootings."
"Despite the economic downturn,I'm so happy‚ò∫Ô∏è. I have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my $7,000 investment every 13days."
"Explain the 600,000 babies that actually DO die each year from abortions. Please report on this truth. She had a bad experience. 600,000 babies have a worse experience than her each year because of abortion. Can you please do a story on these 600,000 babies killed each year by abortion instead of the one mother that never came close to dying?  You liberals are propagandists. You all suck!  Fact!!  Cheers woke low IQ liberals!!"
I would advise any women of child bearing age to move out of Texas until those barbaric laws are changed. Those abortion laws are written by misogynistic power hungry men who have no medical knowledge or concern for a woman's health. And they are backed up by the corrupt members of the SCOTUS! üò°
It's just awful what Amanda and Josh went through. It's tragic that she might never be able to have a child. And I know this isn't the only case like this. The government has no business interfering in  a woman's medical decisions.
CNN this is beyond bs your creating hate and war.
"Don't Ya Love Cold Blooded American  Capitolism and Americans,,""Trumpers/Christians  telling another to medically receive  treatment They Only approve of!? Ain't that Coll. Go ahead, keep voting Republicans, Trumpism ,lol."
"Republicans can be pretty stupid at times, literally the only thing they are good for is kinda protecting the second amendment but they fail at that also"
You mean the baby almost lived
DEMS LOST THE HOUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY RIGGED IT BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Can anyone here fathom 230000 illegals in a month? That's 30 days. Absolutely unbelievable. Wow!
Maybe take steps  to prevent pregnancy next time ?????
Come Back to the modele age.. How sad‚Ä¶ Hope the doutor take off the dental anesthesia when those stupid and low  lawmakers and politics need dental care..This is America now ‚Ä¶
Anyone who can see stories like this and still say abortion isn't health care is crazy... it's not pro life..
"Whooptie do.,."
Don‚Äôt expect republicans to care.
When y‚Äôall are ok with removing a full term baby piece by piece from the mom‚Äôs womb I have no sympathy
"Republican: ""Well, I guess she shouldn't have had sex with her husband anymore if she didn't want to die from an infection.""
Yes. Because that makes sense..."
More fear mongering.
Texas lawmakers CAN'T spell!
If she hadn't made it? There would of been incoming lawsuits towards law makers.
"It seems the law statement applies to the situation she was experiencing. The doctor seems the most liable to have not reacted, responded appropriately. Unfortunate their loss of the baby, seems they really wanted to deliver and care for the baby."
And Texans still voted Republican. Sick.
I have nothing to add but ARRRRGH you idiots. You're killing already born people to save wishes and prayers.
"So she could have one, except her doctors decided to play politics by blaming the laws even though it‚Äôs clear to any moron the law says she qualified‚Ä¶ blame the activist doctors. üëçüèª"
"Boy, if I didn‚Äôt like this, I‚Äôd move to one of plenty of other states that do allow doctors to preemptively kill babies for ‚Äòhealth sake‚Äô"
"No government should get involved in such a delicate, and private issue. Women would be encarcerated for political power, if it wasn't for the Democratic Party who has worked none stop to secured woman's protection from unscrupulous politicians, like Herschel Walker..."
As see the New Russian Republican party ‚ò†Ô∏è üñï ü§° üí© üá∑üá∫  dosen't care if women will die. Because the Supreme Court and the Republican party wants  to run there lives.
I am so sorry to both of you and your baby. Willow is a beautiful name. This is because of politicians and doctors Running Scared. My mom had sepsis and died. I'm so happy you lived. Peace and love.
"HOW BARBARIC!! IS THE CORRECT WORDS. PRAYERS AND LUV FROM ONTARIO, CANADA."
And that abortion is as safe an operation as appendicitis? No woman was harmed during an abortion? the next step is forced abortion. The banks will decide if you have the means to have children. It's fair too
"Texas, explains everything."
That's what radical Republicans want for America!!Keep showing these stories until 2024 when  Democrats take back FULL control of Congress to codify Roe into law!
WTF already!
Texas does not care...hell under wheelies texas froze and children also the elderly passed. Do not forget the gun bill which is one of the reason why the tragedy in Uvalde happeded...texans choose that for them.
Nothing like a bunch of self riteous old men deciding health decisions for women.
"The USA, the first officially recognised 4th world country in the world."
Omg!  But still you voted for Abbott so....I guess other Texans don't care about you Amanda...how sad is that?!?!?  I pray you do have the children you so very much deserve!!!
You need to have abortion in law because of this shit ü§¶
Texas it's the America's Afghanistan :D
"Amanda I am so sorry you had to go through this much  heartbreaking pain, stand strong, keep your hope and health up, we will fight with you."
That's so wrong!
And then we prayed ‚Ä¶. Nope
How many more women are going to suffer or die due to facistism laws?
Wow situations like this kind of make me glad I don't have any kidsüò≤
Yet these geniuses voted for these disgusting so called Republicans again!
Texas sucks!!!! So thankful I live in California
How did the baby fare?ü§î
Sickening psychopaths.
"Stupid, right wing regressors. Uneducated, buybull driven idiocy. Trash that must control a woman. smh"
She was already born so the GOP don't care about HER life.
"Gen z voters got suckered by Joe,  no student loan handout
Use a coat hanger and keep your legs closed"
"Yet TEXAS voted for ABBOT ‚Ä¶ voted him in for a third time !!! Shame shame shame on all those that voted for that man !!!! 
They were sacred someone was gonna take away their guns ‚Ä¶ as if that would happen ‚Ä¶ well as I said SHAME ON TEXAS üò°üò°üò°"
Omg
"Big shout out to the GOP winning the house majority,  now subpoena Pelosi over January 6th"
What does this have to do the title?   CNN bullshit.
"Abortion on demand. 
No Questions Asked. 
It's not your business."
Thanks Lying Ted Cruz.
Did the baby survive?
I almost died skiing once I don't know why It didn't make it to CNN ü§î
"‚ÄúHow come when it‚Äôs us, it‚Äôs an abortion, and when it‚Äôs a chicken, it‚Äôs an omelette?‚Äù (George Carlin)"
"I'm standing up for the victims of abortion because they, obviously, lost their voice"
Torture and death is the point of the GOP. They want to make women suffer and slaves.
What a bs story.
"So there is a reason to kill a child ? A friend of mine was pregnant with a child that had Trisomy 18‚Ä¶ these children typically pass away within hours after birth.  My friend was told she HAD to have an abortion, but she went full term and got to hold her child for several hours before God took his life.  The parents wouldn‚Äôt have had it any other way‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs impossible to know a parent will feel when a child is in these critical situations, but WE shouldn‚Äôt be the ones to terminate Any life from Womb to Tomb.  There are also countless times an unborn child is Misdiagnosed and is killed out of fear of a defect, only to find the child was perfectly healthy. Put it Gods hands‚Ä¶ PAX"
"abortion is 94-97% of the cases BECAUSE THE MOTHER DOESNT WANT A BABY.... look at the stats... for the outlier cases saving a mother's life, the baby is dead , the doctor will make the health care decision....HOWEVER, 'NOT READY FOR BABY,' 'RAPED' 'TOO YOUNG' TOO IMMATURE' 'TOO CARELESS' 'TOO PROMISCUOUS'  are not acceptable reasons, and result in murder of the baby....as the baby could be given up for adoption.  FULLSTOP"
"ATTENTION LIBERALS!!!    If you're upset about Roe vs Wade being overturned, you should be upset at the Democrat Party for doing NOTHING!!!!

In 1976, Jimmy Carter was elected President. He had a Democrat majority in the House and Senate his entire 4 years - why didn't they codify Roe into law??
In 1992, Bill Clinton was elected President. When he took office, he had a Democrat majority in the House and Senate - why didn't they codify Roe into law??
In 2008, Barrack Obama was elected President. Not only did he have a Democrat majority in the House and senate when he took office, one of his campaign promises WAS to codify Row into law - why didn't they codify Row into law, after making it a campaign promises??
In 2020, Joe Biden was elected President. Not only did he have a Democrat majority in the House and Senate when he took office, they had a 2-month notice that Roe was going to be overturned - why didn't they codify Roe into law, knowing the ruling was going to be overturned??
If you're upset, the only people you can be upset with is the Democrat Party for doing absolutely NOTHING when they had the chances!!"
"To say that some women use abortion as ""birth control"" was utterly shocking and offensive.... and just goes to show the incredible judgements people make about abortion, without actually knowing real womens stories behind it..... because i know many women who have been forced to make that choice, and i can not think of a single ONE where abortion was being used as a form of birth control... i can not think of a single woman who was so irresponsible, and selfish that they did not care about getting pregnant, because abortion was an option..... thats so ridiculous, it would be laughable if it wasnt so offensive and evil to say....and i firmly believe that the energy you put out into the world, comes back to you..... and sadly, i think thats what happened here.... i feel horrible for her, and im shocked and disgusted that she was forced to endure that.... but sadly, i dont think the experience has changed her ignorant thinking on abortion... because apparently she is the judge of when it is acceptable.... yikes.... karma!"
"Stupid people doing stupid things . ""Every vote matters."" Even stupid ones. Too bad democracy in this country seems to work only if it results in a stupid outcome"
"No she wasn't forced to carry ,..all she had to do was go to a state that allows abortion,.... No body would have known anything about this .... except for wanting attention"
"Do Republicans understand they are voting themselves out of exsistance?  First they come for the ""gays"" next... they come for you. This is T$&rrorism..."
They got what they voted for.
"Funny how pro abortionist will cite this as a reason for legalizing abortion, but they still want to be able to kill a perfectly healthy child for any reason."
"Biden may be Doomed, in 2024, by the Electoral College. Can he Really win Arizona and Georgia again?? And, ALL of those GOP candidates are BAD. The College is Inherently Unfair to the DNC, Despite Trump's Ironic Claim that he was ""Robbed."" 

He Lost because he Screwed Up the COVID response. He WON, in 2016, Despite losing the Popular vote-by Two Million Votes-to Ms. Clinton. And, THAT Election may have been stolen by collusion with the Russians. 

My Solution?? Democrats in Deep South states, where their votes count for Little, should move to Texas. And, some of us Northerners can retire there, and marry African Americans from AL/MS/LA and Oklahoma. I would get a Prenup. (The Vast Majority of AA are Democrats these days. If you know someone of a different ethnicity is a Democrat-marry them Instead.)

Florida Democrats should,  by the same token, get hitched to Atlanta Dems. Florida has been a Crucial Swing State. It's Too ""Red"" nowadays. GOP Governors there have refused to let Felony Ex-Convicts vote. Even Today, they are making them pay Restitution to victims, after they get out: Elitist Double-Jeopardy. I sent money to ActBlue to help pay those fees. 

And, it's Not simply because of the above Law, either. Texas is the QUEEN of the Electoral Chessboard. If we Steal it...we will have the Whitehouse and The House, Basically-Forever. 
It may Eventually turn Blue because of Latinos obtaining Citizenship in that State, but that would take Too Long. The Senate is Already ""Blue"" but just Barely so."
"You KNOW...the Only Blessing here (albeit in DEEP Disguise) is that this shows how Dangerous the GOP IS...and what happens when Dubya, Trump, and the rest, put a bunch of Ayatollahs on our Courts.

We on the Left bear some of the Guilt, Too, by refusing to Back the Late Hubert Humphrey (because his Boss, LBJ, got us into Vietnam) or voting ""Green Party"" or sitting out the 2000, and/or 2016 Elections, because we couldn't stomach Moderate Democrats. 


I concur that Ninth Month Abortions are, by their very nature-Controversial.

This ""When the Sperm meets the Egg"" Crap, However, needs to GO.

Among First World Democracies, we are Almost Alone in this type of Lunacy."
absolutely disgusting these hypocritical right wing lawmakers push nonviable fetuses to be born. why do people vote for these awful people?
If you don‚Äôt want an abortion don‚Äôt have SEX‚Ä¶
God forbid you have the baby and love the baby until the baby passes.  There are places that will help a family through something like this.
"This is an exception, nonetheless it‚Äôs a human baby in utero, something pro infanticide advocates never admit to, they blatantly ignore biology, pick and chose what‚Äôs beneficial to the horrific agenda. Also careless adults use abortion as literally birth control which is wrong and irresponsible it‚Äôs the era of taking full accountability for one‚Äôs actions."
Keep your legs shut and you dont have to kill baby
"I looked for a really lovely interview I‚Äôve seen from them and like four other couples who wanted a baby, but had issues and texas refuse them abortions and the mothers we‚Äôre going to die and the babies were going to die and they still wouldn‚Äôt do anything and I can‚Äôt find those interviews anymore they‚Äôve been scrubbed from the Internet. They were well done and the couples got to tell their side of the story. It was well done like very classy and everything but now its scrubbed off the Internet and this is all I can find is pissing me the f off."
"When the power you held over men is then given to the state and leaves you powerless. Karma, dealing with what men have dealt with for years. Abortion rights should have never been passed on lies, which it was. Abortion should have never been used as a contraceptive for lazy people which it was."
"My sister-in-law carried her baby that died one week prior to the due date, my brother-in-law bought her a little baby dress, it was sad but dignified, she was named Cristy, she was a baby, she was buried, she wasn't thrown away or ripped apart, she was a human just like the rest of us.üíî"
"So the baby is only estimated to make it a year‚Ä¶ by that logic, you should be able to muder any human as long as theyre less than a year old and just call it abortion. Diminished quality of life doesn‚Äôt justify killing someone."
QUESTION: I know this may sound insensitive... but why aren't they going to other states where its still legal? I know that in Kentucky you can still get a pregnancy terminated if its an ectopic scenario (even after the overturning of RvW).
"As a woman, I refuse to deliver 9-20 babies in my lifetime.  I have other plans, 1 or 2 ‚ù§children and a career in engineering.  I‚Äôd NEVER live in a state in which politicians decide my life and death for me."
She deems it necessary in her case. How blind can she be
WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR IN 2016?  ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES.
The baby should get that year to live rather than straight to heaven right away tho ‚ù§
"It sucks, but at least this child got to pass away in the arms of her family instead of being ripped a part in the womb. She will be given a proper burial and be mourned and her family, mother especially will eventually heal from this tragedy if they have faith in God's plan. It doesn't make sense to us now, but one day it will. This little girl is an angel baby now. ‚úùüôè"
"Top tier Karens who ""religiously"" take away people's basic human rights in the voting booth. It's only ""unfair"" because it happened to them. *massive eye roll*"
..soly mom......
"So, the citizens of Texas can legally go out of state to have an abortion?"
This will never stop being funny that a Trump voter is whining about not being able to get an abortion.
"New Mexico does not have a cut off of a certain amount of weeks. Maybe that particular clinic has a rule, but there are other clinics in the state. And I love how she thinks she has the right to decide for other mothers if an abortion is needed or not. No one is using abortion for birth control, Kylie. I can tell they voted for these laws, so let them suffer whatever consequence comes to them and stay TF out of New Mexico, we have enough people to serve and don‚Äôt need any anti-abortion hypocrites coming here when they suddenly realize that abortion is healthcare. They deserve whatever comes to them."
"These anti-abortion laws are the sort of sh!t that I would expect from groups like the Taliban, or ISIS. It's the Christian version of Sharia Law. Astounding that these laws are being made by people who grew up in a (supposedly) modern, advanced society. The GOP and religious right are living in the freaking Dark Ages and think they have the right to drag everyone else backwards too."
"üòÇ she was fine with forcing others to abide by her opinions üòÇ

May it continue to happen to pro lifers"
"GOP politicians if you want to be doctors , be doctors.  If you want to be teachers, be teachers.  But goodness sake you don't have the knowledge of a doctor so you are hurting innocent people.  YOu are scaring doctor so they cannot give the best care to pregnant woemn.  I would imagine that we have the fewest medical students going into OB this year. YOu intimidate teachrs, so now we do not have enough teachers.  The funny things is you are not doing the things the tax payers want you to do as politiicans like regulations for industry,rrailroads. and enforcement of regulations  You are all talk, cruel hateful talk, and no real positive action except for futher cheating to gerrymander and take away voting right s and that does not count.  I am doing a search of all the stories of families have suffered already. I have sent a letter to my Governor about this issue.  I guess I need to investigate further who has authority of making these laws that don't have the proper prodicol for women in an emergency situation. They wanted to do something , they could have that from the OB doctors in a week. So what kind of sick stunt.  I wonder, is there any GOP party member who actually cares about the well being of his or her consituents.  I think not.  The democrats have been very helpful.  I just don't get it.  But I guess it has to do with the Trump cult.   I don't get that at all, but clearly Trump does not care about women and theri heath."
Not the whole true story. But what does anyone expect from lying left wing marxist devolving abc in the forced socialist dystopia coming full scale in the 21st century.
There is no restrictions on abortion in NM.  Why is she saying we have a cutoff of 23 weeks??
"1) Abortion bans do nothing. Women will always have the option of abortion, whether it‚Äôs banned or not. 
2) Abortion bans actually increase the number of abortions, ironically. So I guess you people really aren‚Äôt about saving fetal lives so much as virtue signaling.
3) Fetuses now have a right that no other human being has, and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another person‚Äôs body to stay alive. No other human has ever been granted that right. Even if you stab someone and they‚Äôre bleeding out, and you have matching blood types, the government cannot force you to give them your blood to keep them alive. Or if you use a mask, gloves, etc. but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organs start shutting down, the government cannot forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organs. You used protection, so the chances of giving this person the disease that you‚Äôre a carrier for were very low, but it still happened, and now they‚Äôre dying because of you. Guess what‚Äîthe government does not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive. That‚Äôs exactly what an abortion ban attempts to do, however. So I‚Äôm not sure why fetuses should have that right when no one else does."
"This story is concerning regarding Kylie‚Äôs health, and the precedent that Texas law sets here regarding the rights to a fetus. In babies with alobar holoprosencephaly many are stillborn and if they do survive the birthing process only 50% of patients survive by 4-5 months of age and 20% of these cases survive by 12 months of age. 1 They also have major physical deformities including a single eye (cyclopia), epilepsy and seizures, intellectual disability and problems regulating their own body temperature, heart rate, and breathing which requires them to spend their entire life in a hospital. 3 This is a severe economic burden to the family and to the state and could be a major emotional burden to the family involved. This is also without taking into consideration the dangers that come with childbirth especially when compared to the abortion that Kylie was seeking. The pregnancy-associated mortality rate among women who delivered live neonates was 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births. The mortality rate related to induced abortion was 0.6 deaths per 100,000 abortions. 2 With that in mind I believe the laws in Texas endangered Kylie‚Äôs life and encroached on her medical autonomy and her ability to make a medical decision that was in her best interest and safety. It could be said that Kylie could just go out of state to get an abortion, but this places undo financial hardship on a family when there are capable medical facilities much closer. I understand that people might not agree that the risks to Kylie here outweighed the fetuses right to life, however I think one needs to consider the quality of life here. I think the laws in Texas as they stand could cause undo morbidity and mortality to mothers in Kylie‚Äôs situation and encroach on ethical principles that are generally agreed upon in the medical community."
"Welcome to the consequences of your beliefs! Interesting how these people think that abortion is primarily a form of ""birth control""! Same people that ban the teaching of sex-ed at schools and discourage teenagers from having access to contraception that might prevent them from having to be in this situation! They are now also looking at banning birth control pills. We screamed at the top of our lungs for decades why reversing Roe vs. Wade was a bad idea .. now, welcome to your consequences .. when you think something like this cannot happen to you or your daughters in the future!"
"As you can now see .. the issue of abortions has never been about ""saving the baby"" .. it's been about some weird ultra Christianity radical agenda that republicans have been pushing on all of us for decades! Now that the supreme court cracked the door open (again republican doing) you get to see states not thinking about the laws they are passing .. they are passing extremely oppressive laws that never take into account that abortions' are a medical procedure which is sometimes very necessary to save the mother or deal with complications that would let a child suffer unnecessarily with crippling defects that are sometimes horrific! The crazy thing to me are ALL the republican women who still vote to keep these men who are taking away their rights in office. Do they NEVER think such an issue can happen to them or their daughters? A side effect of all this are the closing of delivery hospitals due to lack of qualified doctors because they are leaving for states that haven't gone crazy .. because why risk your medical license in a crazy state that wants to make you a criminal for performing a procedure .. a procedure that is medically necessary a lot of the time! What people forget is that Row vs. Wade .. was not opened ended .. it had limitations as to when abortions was allowed and when it wasn't. Good luck red states! Hope you thought carefully about your choices .. prepare yourselves for 2 things 1. Increase in the deaths of pregnant women due to complications 2. Dramatic decrease in people getting pregnant .. because why risk it in a state you can't be guaranteed medical services if you needed them!"
"""Pro-life"" means ""return women and girls to where they were before 1900: *Property of men.""*

That's the (current) endgame for these single-issue activists. It's not a return to the ""traditional family"", it's not a return to some moral standard that only exists in propaganda, this is turning back the clock on women so their only station in life is pumping out [white Christian] babies."
"People only care when it happens to them. Did they think about the women who were raped and forced to keep the baby? But since now it's happening to them they say it's not fair for women. Every decision made has an impact and, sadly, that's what it took for them to realize that."
"The typical people with the land, tractors, the food making capability and means of production of industrial works, do not believe in abortion. If the non-productive people like to kill themselves and their young, I guess what are we to say to that? Less welfareüëç?"
"I say let them abort, it's usually the ones we don't mind anyway"
"Terminations/abortions/procedures, should be available to women. It‚Äôs 2023, not 1923, c‚Äômon. Wealthy women have access if they choose but try to convince us that women should not have access to medical care!"
"Anti-abortion people think women wake up everyday hoping well get pregnant just so we can rush to have an abortion. It is a painful procedure that no woman wants to experience let alone do it over and over as a form of birth control. Sometimes, it is necessary for many reasons and non-medical professionals, like politicians shouldn't have a say in it. They are not qualified to say if it should happen"
A life is a life.
Prayers for this family.
Ban abortion. Imprison anybody that wants it legal. Demons will respond negatively when you speak up for innocent babies.
They'd rather a woman die from a dead fetus rotting away inside her because they're not prolife theyre pro forced birthüíñ
Good
"Wait a minute, who has to pay the bill which can be tens of thousands of dollars once the baby is due? This is so unfair! I'm asking as a concerned neighbor from Canada"
There are always consequences to choices that involve forcing personal beliefs on others..... Enjoy üòè
"""Unless it affects the mother"", right... as if the mothers mental health means nothing. Try carrying a dead baby to term and not lose your sanity. Jesus fucking christ."
"It‚Äôs wrong that women, parents, and children suffer because of a ban. Once a child is born, no one will be there for it. There‚Äôs not enough resources and money to make sure every child is taken care of properly. Then you get cases of child neglect, abuse, or death because other people choose that it was wrong and a waste of life. Those same people aren‚Äôt there to raise the children born with health issues/problems, aren‚Äôt there to protect a child from an abusive parent/guardian/foster parent/adoptive parent. They aren‚Äôt there when a child has to live like this poor baby or be there when a baby is carried full term only to die/suffer seconds/minutes/hours later due to a foreseeable illness that could‚Äôve been prevented if given an abortion later on. Unless it happens to you, you don‚Äôt think about other people‚Äôs lives till then. It‚Äôs does effect everyone in the end, more negative than positive."
No Joe or Jane average should have ANY SAY in another persons medical choices! PERIOD! Funny how ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù think they get to control everything including other peoples choices!
Who cares that‚Äôs what they voted for
"Nobody should be forced to endure this horror. Sick mentally. Sick emotionally. Sick before God in heaven. Sick before U.S. Constitutional Law. Cruel and inhumane. Grotesque. It is sick that a minority in the U.S. is being allowed to force their sick, unbiblical religious beliefs onto the majority of U.S. citizens. It's unconstitutional.

Prepare to witness this and other horrors over and over and over again. Just like we did in the 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's, and 60's......... women will die unnecessarily because of these situations, and their babies will die along with them."
I tell everyone whose pro life in their politics THIS is why I'm pro choice politically...banning abortions leads to health complications and poorer health services for women through studying countries with complete abortion bans we can see it leads to NOTHING good for women
This is so sad and not right. I can‚Äôt believe this is happening in America.
But..but..freedumb!!!! What a joke...
Good it should never be ok to slaughter unborn babies for your own selfish benefit.
No one is forcing her. Go to a midwife and get misoprostol put it in your vag and it will release the baby.
The only moral abortion is MY abortion. This is what you voted for.
Birth control is to prevent pregnancy. If you're pregnant is not birth control. Abortion is not birth control.
"It is so hard to see these people struggle with the loss of their baby, and now on top of that, this woman must wait to become sick before she can get help. The abortion laws are getting out of hand. The government is sentencing women to the brink of death before allowing medical professionals to intervene and putting healthcare providers between a rock and a hard place. However, what is the government doing to provide women of childbearing age with the resources to prevent getting pregnant in the first place? The answer is nothing. Obtaining birth control can cost hundreds of dollars a year, something some people can‚Äôt afford. Sexual education classes are being criticized and removed from schools, not allowing the public to gain information and make informed decisions. Now in South Carolina, a bill is being considered that a woman can be eligible for the death penalty if she receives an abortion. I struggle to see how this is beneficial for anybody. These laws infringe on patient autonomy, making it difficult for medical providers to care for these women because they will also be punished. This is one time that laws and medicine should not be mixed because it has poor patient outcomes. Who is responsible for the patients? Medical providers are not the government. More dangerous things are happening in the country like gun control and school shootings that are on the rise that needs to be addressed first, not a woman‚Äôs health that should be between her and her doctor only."
"It‚Äôs important to remember that abortion is healthcare and there are many reasons why somebody may need or want to have an abortion. Regardless of the reason pregnancy, even the most uncomplicated ones can cause adverse health effects, and no one should be forced to make a healthcare decision they don‚Äôt want to. I also want to address that the vast majority of people receiving abortions are not using it as birth control. The Bronx abortion clinic reported that about fifty percent of the women who receive abortion used some time of birth control. In addition, more than fifty percent of the women receiving abortions had never had one before. While I want to emphasize that not all abortions are because of unplanned pregnancies, this should not limit abortions to only those cases. Some people who have unplanned pregnancies may want to continue with it, but if they do not it is unethical to make someone continue a pregnancy. This will violate many people's autonomy if they have no choice in what changes occur to their body."
"Republicans always ALWAYS vote _against_ themselves, then blame the Left for everything bad in their life."
What about if the pregnancy is ectopic. That‚Äôs a situation where the baby absolutely cannot survive and the mother could bleed to death.
This is what voting for Greg Abbot gets us ü§ß
"The fact that she said ""I don't believe in it as a form a birth control"" just goes to show the LIES conservatives are told"
"Texas mother banned from saying, ""Welp, kid's gonna die anyway, so we might as well torture and butcher 'im to death for grins and giggles."" FTFY.

There is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON WHATSOEVER to torture children to death. If your three-year-old were dying of cancer, would you proceed to dismember and disembowel them? Or would you put them on pain meds and hold their hand until the end like a NORMAL human being who is actually capable of love? Why should it be any different for any child younger than that?"
That's really sadüò¢
Lol you got what you asked for. üòä
She says that she doesn‚Äôt see it as a way of birth control but if she does it while pregnant she‚Äôs literally controlling a birth By stopjng it from happening
Karma is a bitch.
Abortion is murder
It‚Äôs a baby no matter what. Carry that baby and nurture it best you can as long as you are healthy and God will take care of the rest. Just because it doesn‚Äôt have a brain doesn‚Äôt mean you can decide to abort it.
I believe it was said before that it's easy to have beliefs but it's difficult when those beliefs conflict with your or your family rights/freedoms.
Welcome to the consequences of voting for an abortion ban.. you are at the receiving end of what you voted for.. stop complaining.  This woman lacks compassion for other women who needs or wants an abortion is the root of her problem
This is the america y‚Äôall want so what‚Äôs the problem
HUH MAYBE WE SHOULD BE PROCHOICE?!??!?!
This sickens me soo much dont people get it these laws hurt womenüò¢
"Be careful what you wish for/ vote for....
Hypocrites! Its good for me but not for thee.
Welcome to your own nightmare."
"THANK U ABC FOR BRINGING TO US EXTREME CASES, AND PLAY WITH EMOTIONS, HOW ABOUT YOU BRING THE MANY WOMEN  WHO HAVE ABORTION AFTER A ONE NIGHT STAND AND COULDN'T BE BOTHERED."
EVERYTHING that has breathe praise the Lord. üôå
Glory to God for life ‚ù§
Thank God I'm Australian we're so sorry üò¢
People need to see that sometimes abortions are necessary.
When she calls it a procedure what she means is an abortion is healthcare.
No men or women in cults should be allowed to determine the health for all other women.
Its disgusting the greed and selfishness of other people I don't even have to watch it to know this is evil. anyone against abortions are EVIL. and here is why. Medically they are needed for things like this not every pregnancy is healthy and can survive. say a mother has 5 kids already and now a 6th on the way and the baby passes she gets septic she dies that's 5 other children without a mother because her choice was taken from her. no its not the case for every pregnancy but that's where its up to the individual you are a pos if your getting abortions because your irresponsible not because a rape an accident from failed prcations I'm taking about your 2-4 in because you cant be responsible which at that point you shouldn't be having sex. but that's not always the case there are cases where a child being born can subject them to more suffering then living. there's documented cases look them up I'm not here to make you grow as a person and change your mind I'm here to explain that your very close minded and ignorant to have to go through these things in order to understand they are real after some easy googling can educate and save lives and or prevent them for the better.  Its evil to subject people to this.
"I'm so sick and tired of people saying ""Abortion isn't birth control."" No one anywhere is having unprotected sex under the thought of ""Oh. I'll just pop into the abortion clinic next Monday.""

Also, I'm low-key loving that people like her are part of the ""Take responsibility for your actions"" crowd. Guess what, sweetie? You're learning about the consequences of your actions... you voted for these laws. You got 'em."
She voted pro-life and that‚Äôs what she got. She only had compassion for herself and not other women that desperately needed abortions across the country. No sympathy for her.
"""never in a million years would we expect"" Yeah exactly. YOU didn't think this could happen to you, the rest of us KNOW it can happen to anyone."
"I know people who have suffered due to her voting, I hope she knows the consequences of her actions to the fullest."
Hurts my heart that voters can‚Äôt imagine instances like these where abortion is necessary until it affects them personally. How ignorant. I do feel very sad for their family though.
"That is so tragic, I‚Äôm so sorry for your heart break."
This is absolute insanity.
This is what I try to get people to understand about abortion but people wanna stand on their views because they know better but they won‚Äôt get it til they go through it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"These people are literally sad because they cannot kill their child. If you stop to think about it, that's what this actually is. It's a tragedy that the baby has abnormalities, but ultimately, they want to destroy the baby because they are scared of having to deal with a child with abnormalities, who the doctor said won't live long. Their solution: kill it! What has society become?"
Living in Texas is living in a fascist state.  Our Republican government is ruining what once was a great state.
üò¢
Everything happens for a reason. I hear so many stories of things like this happening to upper middle class White Texas families. They change their tune on abortion pretty quick. I have little sympathy for them because they made their own bed. My husband and I talked extensively about issues that could arise with pregnancy and birth before we even tried to get pregnant.
Please contact me! I will gladly adopt your child!! I live in Illinois. My oldest son was diagnosed with alobar holoprosephencephaly when I was 3 months pregnant. The doctors insisted I abort and they continuously said to be prepared for when he took his first breath of real air he would die. Let me tell you he is now 12yrs old!!!!! Every obstacle and deadline they gave him he surpassed with flying colors each and every time!! If you don't want your baby because of the chance and challenges that will come with every child give him to someone who will love them unconditionally!!! As a mom of 3. 2 of which are special needs in two very different ways just give them a chance at life because you never know what they can accomplish with love and support around them!
"And these dumb politicians think they know it all... unbelievable, plus people uninformed."
Terminating an abortion because the Baby will potentially be disabled ‚ÅâÔ∏è
So much for freedom in your country! Disgusting and barbaric
TOTALLY MISLEADING TITLE! watch the whole video!!!! THE PREGNANCY IS STILL VIABLE AND THE BABY IS NOT DEAD IN THE WOMB.
"they look like they can afford a plane ticket to another state or drive so get over it, take precautions not to get knocked up in Texas next time, don't like it you are ""Free"" to move out."
"That poor unborn fetus has my sympathy, They should never be put through any of this. Those parents however? I have no more pity for people who can't see something as a problem until it stops at their front door. Maybe they should have thought about this before they went in to vote away their rights as parents."
I'm so sorry..prayers be with you ...
"It's easy to say I'm anti abortion in all instances and tell everyone else that they are evil until you hear these stories. Very few topics are black or white, good or evil , and people need to know that there is nuance to things. Let's expand access to birth control and  stop women using abortion as such."
"I understand political pro life agenda, what is behind it and why they push it, but every day person, especially women, who vote for this seem truly stunted in their critical thinking. Any women voting for this, not getting that they can end up in situations they don't want, that can kill them, that can harm their children (not just the one your pregnant with if you already have children they will be scarred too), men who vote for this not realizing that women in their families, their wives can end up here. How rotten you must be to want your partner and your child to suffer when you can avoid it? Deluded, evil people."
This is bs. As in not true. People really need to do research. There is a very clear difference between a non-viable fetus and a healthy fetus that is likely to come to term. It is possible she may have to carry to term for health reasons as the Pregnancy may be to far along and this is the safest option. So thank abc for being full of it
"""But I didn't know leopards would eat MY face."" says woman who voted for the leopards eating peoples faces party"
stop killing your babies
"Im embarrassed to live in Texas and can't wait to get out.  Everything sux for everyone, everywhere in America. Well, except for like 7 families üòÇüòÇüòÇ  and I accidentally watched this otherwise I dont trust any news outlet."
I thought almost all states don't allow abortions that far along. It's hard to pretend it's just a bunch of cells. My babies started kicking not too far beyond that
I pray for them and their baby and that they give him the most love they possibly can during the life span he has
Should‚Äôve not had that sex if you were not ready for the consequencesüòí
Yessssss! Right it was all cozy in the sheets so take responsibility
"There it is in a nutshell, how quickly the conservative Republicans want to back track once they feel the heat of their own decisions.  Brain dead monkeys üêí."
If the child does die young...at least you did right by him by loving him and fighting for him.
Doctor says abort 1 of 3 because pregnancy is dangerous...mom said no.  Mom has 3 healthy happy babies.
"Last man in Iron lung. Doctor said he was dead to TB.  Another doctor takes him puts a tube in and places him in the iron lung.  He lived.  He became a lawyer and wrote a book.  He is alive today. You love your child, but to an extent.  Thats not unconditional. You never give up.  Especially with your child."
Thats your son and you don't want to give him a chance.  Thats sad you wouldn't fight because doctors have been wrong a lot.
People have no idea how many times a doctor has said there is no hope and the person thrived.  You abort that child you give them zero chance.
Thats crazy!
"I know the catholic position is ""human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception"" and in summary, from the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person. Catholics and protestants often cite passages from Exodus 20 for why they believe human life begins earlier than birth. Even if you accept their argument, it's pretty stupid to force women to carry non-viable pregnancies. These by definitions cannot form human life. I just don't see the point. Often times I can see some self consitancy with people I disagree with. For example, many war mongers just want more land and a larger taxbase, this might not be great for everyone involved, but I understand their position. The law is just stupid even if you believe a fetus is a person. The best non viable preganncies can do outside the womb is maybe have some cells live on as a collection of cell culture to be used for research purposes... although the scientific value of these might be dubious since a tissue culture of kidney fibroblast, hepatocyte, or myocyte from a non-viable pregnancy might be different than a sample from a baby."
"This video title is fallacious. The pregnancy was viable, by definition."
"Honestly, I don't really feel bad for her. 
I DO feel bad for women that didn't want or choose to have their rights stripped from them. 
This woman is part of the problem, and only figured it out when her pregnancy wasn't viable.  
I told my husband that the only way these Republicans were going to figure it out, was when it happens to them. Guess what."
unfortunate but you get what you vote forü§≠
We cheer with every freedom taken away. The insanity of Our New republican religious police state America
"For people who are against abortion, that Is your right you can be against it. That does not mean you can force others to have the same stance. That is their right. You can believe it is imoral and murder, but you have no right to another person's body. For those that are against it for religious beliefs thats fine, but not everyone has the same religious beliefs. I could be wrong here as I have not been church since I have been old enough to make my own choices that I do not follow those beliefs, but it is gods job to deal with those that sin, not yours. So you csn belief these people are doing wrong and sinning, but its still not your place to do anything about it. Instead trust in your God, and let them handle it."
"I believe a woman should be able to do what she wants to do with her body. I just had to do an abortion and it's something i have always said i would never do especially since i always thought i couldn't have children. Circumstances change. I have 3 children my youngest just turned 5 months, me and my family live in a 2 bedroom apartment and only my husband is working now. We possibly can't keep the baby as much as it tears my husband and i's heart it's something we know is the best for our family. And we will try again once we are where we need to be. I feel for any woman now a days who can't get what they need to get done in order to live healthy happy lives."
"And when women start dying from sepsis, because they have a dead fetus rotting inside of them, and they can't have it removed because the law views it as abortion, y'all conservatives are gonna beg for abortion to be legalized again."
That's cruel
Girl bye. Karma got you. For your hypocrisy. For those who don't know the full story. This woman suffers from PCOS. It comes with complications of conceiving alone in the 1st place. And other factors. Regardless your political affiliation & religion. Abortion is NECESSARY. It is a life saving medical procedure. Now imagine for a moment. All surgeries are ban. Sounds ridiculous right? Because it is. I swear people are beyond stupid today.
You reap what you sow.
Do we euthanize terminal cancer patients simply because their condition is incompatible with life? It is barbaric to kill a child because of a birth defect. His life belongs to God. There should be hospice care and palliative care teams helping parents in these situations prepare for the loss. They will grieve for their child regardless. Let it be in the midst of life-affirming moments instead of death inducing procedures.
"Everyone wants to focus on rape and incest ! It happened to me I had to terminate a pregnancy that wasnt going to make it to the end, and everyone ignored me"
"Sorry but I agree with her. I‚Äôve known so many women that use abortion as birth control. Situations like this the abortion is warranted, as well as situations where the moms life is at risk. Period. Some of y‚Äôall are murderers"
"Good for her, she went through with exactly what she believed in üôÑ hope people like her go through with it a thousand times.  They are the ones that put other women through all the pain and suffering"
The title of this video is inaccurate and deceptive. The pregnancy is not non-viable. ‚ÄúCarrying non-viable pregnancy to term‚Äù is an oxymoron. The doctor said that the infants usually do not live to the age of 1. She didn‚Äôt say they usually die in utero. This is a baby with a disability that sadly has a short life expectancy. Calling the pregnancy non-viable is untrue. This baby deserves a shot at life like every other baby.
Sooooo did she get rid of it? What‚Äôs the outcome??? We‚Äôre left with a cliffhanger‚Ä¶.
I think everyone needs to cut her some slack!
Can you believe they have a daughter and voted for this insanity?!! Now they are scared for her??? Noe they hate the law they helped pass?!? Someone please explain this level of cognitive dissonance. My brain just doesn‚Äôt grasp this kind of hypocrisy and ignorance.
See up until 2:52 I felt bad for you. Now I feel like you got what you deserved. Abortions aren‚Äôt ‚Äúonly for birth control‚Äù and even if they were it‚Äôs not up to you to decide what happens to other women‚Äôs bodies!! Enjoy this taste of your own medicine!
"Develop all this technology, to save yourself and then just go back,, I mean we‚Äôre not evolving we‚Äôre regressing."
So SHE wants to abort a nearly FULL TERM baby because he will be handicap and die young but she doesn't think other women with different circumstances shouldn't be allowed...
"I want to feel bad for her but I don't. SHE voted for this with no regard for any other women. She didn't care until it started affecting her. Abortion bans are awful for EVERYONE, not just some women."
If you vote for other women to not be able to have an abortion for whatever reason they want to how can you be mad when you are denied the right to.
You can always go to another state if you feel the need to terminate.
Stop saying procedure. It's an abortion!!
"She still ""deems"" what is considered ok to get an abortion? That's the problem, people ""deeming"" what other people should do. Husband seemed more empathetic with women than her. She should make changes in her beliefs."
"I do not feel bad for her at all. She voted for this, now feel the consequences."
So heartbreaking for this family!! I‚Äôm tragedies like this we should have the right to choose üò¢ God Bless
Interesting how people think that aborting a healthy and viable baby is comparable to aborting a non-viable pregnancy and therefore this woman is a hypocrite. What? It‚Äôs totally not the same thing.
Propaganda post!!
karma. love it
"Ancephaly is always used by abortion advocates.  It is extremely rare.  If mom is perfecty healthy, she should carry baby to birth.  Baby is alive in there. Let baby live life God has willed.  It‚Äôs tragic for parents but we all know pregnancy is a risk."
They said with the baby condition it has less then a year to live. Hopefully thats true because the child was not meant to be born. The pro sadist movement only wanted the child born so he can suffer. I hope something goes wrong and the child is not born. Honestly if a woman is not going to have an abortion I hope they miscarry.
"Good, karma it‚Äôs what she deserves who cares"
"Some parents go that extra mile and step up to try to give their baby the best life it can have while it can have it, and others choose to throw it away bc they aren't perfect. How tragic. And don't even flippin say I have no idea what they're going through bc I do, but I chose to give my baby life, despite her severe birth defects."
She‚Äôs anti abortion. Just getting a taste of her own medicine.
This is a. Hold regardless‚Ä¶. It was conceived out of love‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd want to be able to at least hold my child‚Ä¶ This is truly heartbreaking‚Ä¶
they still voted for trump and abbott
"""there are certain instances where I deem that it is necessary""....but you're pro life, and all life is sacred, right? Oh but you see it as ""necessary"" because it will affect you. Got it. So all life is sacred until it negatively affects you guys. Cool. Hypocrites. 

This is what they voted for, and now they're looking for sympathy. GTFO

I hope they remember that Jesus is watching lol"
"That is a FLAT OUT LIE.
To Expect doctors would intervene in this case is ridiculous."
The husband couldn‚Äôt imagine‚Ä¶. üôÑ hmmm
Maybe let‚Äôs vote for political figures who care instead of those who makes laws who hurt people.
Republicans are monsters. Why force this trauma on people. People can make decisions for themselves. My heart hurts for them.
VOTE TO CHANGE LAW KEEP SPEAKING ABOUT IT TO OTHERS FOR MORE CHANGE
Why not go somewhere else to get help though? She's not a prisoner of texas..
literally no one uses it as birth control!! YOU ARE PRO CHOICE SWEETIE. if people using it as birth control is your worry then vote for free 99% effective birth control instead of free condoms at a health department that are hardly used properly. y‚Äôall voting for the wrong thing. abortion is a medical procedure that has been stripped away from doctors and interpreted into political opinions.
PERSONAL CHOICE.  It can't be OK for you but not for others.
"This is so difficult to go through and sad that your baby has not developed normally. You need to be aware that this beautiful baby is still a baby and not to be discarded  ,terminated or aborted. This baby is precious and all life should be loved and nurtured. The baby might not have a long life, but you need to give the baby as much love as possible in this short period, loving, holding your baby,kissing and talking with it. Whether one has a baby with a heart defects, abnormal  body, missing limbs or any other disability, the baby deserves to be loved and nurtured and a chance of life."
"Be careful what you vote for people.  You have to read it all- the politicians are sneaky and well, are not always honest and forthright.  So heartbreaking"

It may be a moot point as more and more OBGyns ditch the profession or move out of states like Texas. Sadly women and children in rural areas will bear the brunt of that.
"I told my other half he needs to go get his colonoscopy 3 states away. His response, ‚ÄúWhat for?! I live here I should be able to get the care I need. It‚Äôs between me and my doctor.‚Äù Same thing with abortion people, stop sticking your nose into people‚Äôs medical procedure. I‚Äôm pro minding your own business. Thanks!"
That is barbaric and inhumane. That woman must have been so depressed.
"Non Medical people making Medical decisions, just like many Health Insurance Companies, Judge's and politicians. Who's going to help folks pay for the health care in cases like these? How much money is in the State or Federal budget for pre, post natal care?"
Isn‚Äôt this what women like her voted for?

"Does anyone in the comments know these two people personally? No! None of you know a fuckin thing about what these people are having to go thru. This woman‚Äôs life will be in danger until after she delivers then they saddled with the amount of care this child will need until it passes. If it lives after a couple months they‚Äôre looking at millions of dollars in medical debt for a terminally sick child all because she couldn‚Äôt get the care she needed at the time she needed it. Not one of you mouthy overly opinionated & undereducated freaks would be able to do any better. I pray everyday that our country doesn‚Äôt fall into the hands of the oh so enlightened woke people bc the second it does were all fucked.

"I understand where she is coming from but I do know of some women who have gotten 4 or 5 abortions just because they didn't feel like having children. Everyone should have the choice to choose what they can do to their bodies, but some people abuse it."
"I hate when they call it a ‚Äúrare‚Äù condition. Because there are thousands of these ‚Äúrare‚Äù conditions and cumulatively they are not that rare. Almost a year ago, on the 21 week ultrasound, my wife and I found out that that the baby had a severe skeletal dysplasia, with small ribs and undeveloped lungs and would suffocate to death after birth. 

We‚Äôve met many other people with very similar stories from other rare conditions. It can happen to anyone trying to have children."

Who‚Äôs to say that this child won‚Äôt come out normal and live a normal life!
"So this girl (Ashley ) and I had been friends since freshman year. During summer we began spending more time together. We hooked up just one time. That's all it takes. I have to note that at that time I was in and out of jail, on probation, fighting cases, and before I turned 18 I'd go away for 2 years in prison. I was reckless and knew I wouldn't make a good bf. We both had grown some feelings for each other ; hers more than mine. But once she found out she was pregnant and told me , I honestly began really thinking about changing my life. My feelings grew for her and I was willing to grow up and be a dad and bf.. She allowed other people to get in her head and behind my back she went and got an abortion. I found out from someone else a couple weeks after. I was crushed. Even though I lived a rough life and could be violent towards men at that time, I was always real gentle with kids and wanted one. That baby literally could've saved my life. Because I would end up doing a total of 6 1/2 years locked up, not caring about anything or anyone. Later on at 28 I would get engaged to a single mom. We didn't work out but I still talk to the kids. I'm 35 and still no kids, single, etc. haven't been in trouble since 2014 and live a normal life sorta. Haven't dated since though, most people have kids at my age and getting close to kids and breaking up is probably the worst thing I've been through and that's saying a lot.. Idk.. I hate abortion because you deprive the world and others of a life that could possibly change things for the better. Sorry for the long story, I've never talked about this before. Thank you for asking this, felt kinda therapeutic to think and write about it.

Side note: the abortion had a negative effect on Ashley. She started partying, doing drugs, and became promiscuous. We ran into each other when I was fresh out at 22. She was a stripper then and her life was chaos. She later got pregnant and had her son which totally calmed her down and now she seems to be a good mom. I think he's 7-8.  Just wanted to point out that abortion hurt both of us."
Good time to hold you ladies to higher standard. Condoms and birth control exist for a reason. Lets not act like you ladies arent abusing abortion for a birth control. Maybe we need to start making better decisions and choices.
So the states are already overwhelmed with too many children they can't care for and that's all that this is going to do is add to that problem so the people who so badly want this to be legal will be the ones who end up so badly having to figure out what to do about the mess that they made and the children will suffer for it
"They try to control women and their body but men who love family suffer too. It seems just jerks are happy in this scenario for forcing others to live with their stupidness and biases. We came back to hundred years ago, technology doesn‚Äôt bring us forwards, our mentality and respect to other human rights bring us forward. Saudi Arabia has technology but they live in the past. Our society started to backward."
Texas got what it wants. Full control over women. Taliban Texas
I am sorry did you say non viable? Uh wow sorry dear we lost as well..
I'm so sorry women have to deal with this.. No government or Judge should have the right to play doctor unless they have a degree as a Doctor
These people definitely sound like Republicans. You get what you vote for.
"I understand the want to terminate in this case . In Texas when something like this happens, you go out of state. I‚Äôm a Christian and I vote for republican all the way. Abortion is a fine line however. I think it‚Äôs more of a moral issue. I think we should have the choice. I believe we should have the personal choice that we then have to live with for the rest of our lives and in my Christian beliefs, we then will be judged by our maker for that choice. It should still be a choice. It‚Äôs freedom and the Lord gave us freedom. Every choice however has a consequence. The problem is the women that use abortion as birth control happens far too often, this is murder."
Why are they even on tv? They made a stupid vote! They can enjoy it
Ew shut up hypocrites live with your votes!
"When did the government have rule over an individuals body üòÆ its like the twilight zone or another dimension existing in various dimensions, humans are just the energy particles experiencing and observing all at once ü§Ø"
Gone back to the middle ages.
"You reap what you sow, lady. So you should have the option because of your specific circumstance but other women and their circumstances don‚Äôt count? Hypocrite."
I'm so glad I live in a country where I get to choose
This is why it should be a WOMANS choice!!!!!! It is OUR bodies!!!
You never know what God can do. Maybe that baby will be healed‚Ä¶.to make a decision to end his life is foolish. No one has even laid their eyes on him in person. He is still growing and everything. People‚Ä¶..what are you thinking???!!!!
Criticizing and therefore ostracizing this woman isn't the way to build bridges or make progress. None of us are perfect and we have different life experiences and points of view. Support would be a much more productive approach.
"Thank God i was born and raised in North Carolina. And there is no rule against getting a abortion. Thank you North Carolina.. tbh more woman should move here to have there babies. If something goes wrong like this tragedy, nobody can stop you from terminating the pregnancy."
"To me it's an example of one extreme to another. Abortion whenever, use it as birth control, it's a right to sorry carry that dead baby to term, oh you'll die if you remain pregnant?  Too bad.  I've yet see anyone argue abortion is wrong unless the mother could due ( ectopic pregnancies for example) she's raped ( surely there's a way to know if she's lying) and this. Though I know after a certain point, they'd induce labor. This though....oh sorry watch the baby die after birth. 
Though the whole ""have compassion"" argument people are using is just a band-aid to me.  Ok have compassion for the life growing inside you rather than think kill it. Cue the responsibility argument. Another band-aid.  Nothing will change because of this 'one extreme to another ' mindset."
"Conservatives: ""If you got pregnant, now you will bear the consequences for your actions! You should have closed your legs!""
Since you are so obsessed with the ‚Äúconsequences of your actions‚Äù, you are now suffering the consequences of your actions - voting for an anti-abortion law.

Hypocrites"
Look what you've done America. We are in 2023 you have created a world for women that you have gone to war over. What a woman does with her body is between her and her doctor. You have become your enemy in more ways than one
Sorry not sorry. live with your actions.  Maybe your dead baby will end up killing you.  One less idiot in this world.
"God bless you both and protect you and your family. It is an unimaginable tragedy. To think that your own republican congressmen are taking this decision out of the hands of you and your physicians is an abomination!!!

God‚Äôs main lesson has always been to love one another. He also said ‚ÄúJudge not, lest YOU be judged!‚Äù I am so fed up with these bible beating repubs trying to use the Bible against the ‚Äúothers‚Äù as they see them!!

"I have never met a woman who uses abortion as a form of birth control. Many of them used condoms that either failed or were intentionally tampered with, or realized their birth control wasn‚Äôt working as a result of illness or antibiotics. And they weren‚Äôt excited for an abortion either. Smh I can‚Äôt with these people"
"not enough gas to drive to the next state over?
gimme a break"
I'm still Pro-Life.  This story does not change my mind.
"2:50 ABORTION ISN'T USED AS BIRTH CONTROL. QUIT SAYING THAT. BIRTH CONTROL DOESN'T COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. PEOPLE WHO SAY ""I'M AGAINST IT BEING USED AS BIRTH CONTROL"" ARE BRAINWASHED."
"This couple is delusional.  They don't even know what theybare saying. Also they said the ""procedure"" cost 10 to 15 thiusand dollars in colorado and it was out of the question... but they want to have more kids even when they dont have 10k in the bank. Poor mentality"
"""I voted for the Leopards Eating People's Faces Party, but I never thought leopards would eat MY face!"""
Hmmm something tells me this story isn't telling us the truth. Also abortion are murder heart beat means life.
It wasn‚Äôt a medical emergency she wasn‚Äôt dying??? Women lose babies at birth all the time no one wants to talk about that. If she didn‚Äôt know guess what she would‚Äôve gave birth instead of ripping the baby out in pieces‚Ä¶she should be happy she got to see her baby outside the womb and show love for the last time and bury him properly.
Where's your coverage on this story Live Action?
This is so absurd.. Why people are electing these horrible politicians
Your American Taliban
Looks like the shoe's on the other foot...
"‚ÄúI‚Äôm against using abortion as a form of birth control.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ so if some girl was raped and impregnated through rape you believe she must be forced to carry out her pregnancy? The reason shouldn‚Äôt matter, let a woman decide period"
"I'm not for abortion, in cases where people were irresponsible. But THIS is an obvious case. Come on! Common sense."
Hmm not sad for her at all. Now I am supposed to care about what they want. You helped to take away our choice.voting has consequences
"Let me get this straight, she isn‚Äôt carrying a dead baby but a baby that will eventually die at the age of one?"
She‚Äôs concerned now because it‚Äôs effecting her
"So the problem here is that two parents view the difficulty of an otherwise normal pregnancy as a burden because the baby might live long enough to be an inconvenience? Am I missing something or is that the big story here? The big story is that people who identify as pro life became pro choice because of personal inconvenience. There‚Äôs no concern for their child. This illustrates why abortion needs to be criminalized in Texas for everyone who participates in an abortion‚Äînot just the abortionist.  Human life has been reduced to viability based on convenience. We are in a bad way. We need to become abolitionist, not pro life. It‚Äôs a term that has lost its meaning."
Horrible law by America...
They should put abortion on the ballot in every state.
"Is it illegal to go to another state and get an abortion? Genuinely curious.

Not trying to invite people to do it, but I‚Äôd rather travel to a country where it‚Äôs legal. Like Mexico, it‚Äôs legal, safe and cheap."
‚ÄúThe high cost of living‚Äù
You could come to New York State and gotten an abortion. He will do abortions if there's something wrong with the baby up until the day ofYou could come to New York State and gotten an abortion. He will do abortions if there's something wrong with the baby up until the day of the baby's first. Anybody watching desk that read this comment and you need help because your state will not allow you to have an abortion New York state will provide it for you free of charge they will give you a New York State Medicaid so that you can get your procedure done there are places that the clinics know that get donations to pay for your plane ticket they will pay for your hotel dental places that ketchel Nations that pay for everything associated with your travel to New York State the procedure itself Aftercare and the way home. Do not go through something like this because you feel you have no other option. New York state will 100% do the procedure for you and there are places that will help pay for your travel if you can't. New York state allows abortion up to the day of birth even if your past your due date and they find that something is wrong with your baby and your baby is unable to survive and has a terminal condition even if you're in labor they will perform the procedure for you. There was a big thing on it it has not been decided by the Supreme Court it's still allowed to happen do not feel like you have no place to go New York state will help you. I wish I knew of this video or knew of her need I would have told her and helped
So real guys?!!! Men and women too who voted for this live n fantasy world makes me sick I'm so sorry for her
This is political propaganda. So her child is ill. That‚Äôs not a justification for slaughtering thousands of children out of total convenience and selfishness. Abortion was murder before her child started developing properly and it will be murder afterwards. Interview a person who survived abortion and WAS healthy and is now disabled because mom didn‚Äôt want to be a mom.
You can order the abortion pill online from aid access.
Some women thinking it never happen to me until it came . And than anger crying . That what happen when this women don‚Äôt involved fight for their right . One apples is rotten in a basket soon the rest of the apples will also rotten to fungus
I bet this family wish they didn't live in the state of Texas wonder if they thinking about moving out of it like other families and people are doing getting the hell up out of there relocating to another state
Honestly. I don‚Äôt wish these things on anyone. I‚Äôm staunchly pro choice. I don‚Äôt care why you choose an abortion. I hate that it took this for someone to understand why these bans are devastating to more than just the type of women you think need to learn the consequences of sex. But I‚Äôm heartbroken for them anyway. I‚Äôm a mom I have two boys. I love them so much. Could I imagine ever choosing an abortion? No. Do I see every day how it may be the only right option to alleviate suffering for mom and or baby? Yes. I do. Rather we think it‚Äôs wrong or right I believe that‚Äôs between the individual and God and it‚Äôs above my pay grade. Abortion is healthcare and women deserve access to it.
"God punishes the ignorant, and this family is lucky that that doctors saved them from their own hypocrisy.  Selfish brainwashed morons ü§°"
"Forced to‚Ä¶ you would have had to if you lived off the land like humans used to you would have had to done this anyways, and why not? Is it so horrible to see your own child at least one time before burying them, hold them, kiss them, you know be a human? Not just discard it like a bad tuna sandwich, STOP playing victim, this is the natural order of life."
Is the baby growing does it have a heart beat or is she carrying a lifeless baby? She has to keep the baby inside her? Can‚Äôt she get sick or something go wrong?
"Lawmakers cannot be this stupid. 
Make 1 Law that allows to remove a dead baby that miscarried/died naturally 

A 2nd law that prevents *killing a live baby. 

STUPID STUPID STUPID"
It is legal is other states . Always choose life . These rare cases don‚Äôt justify millions of lost healthy babies . Abortion is not birth control btw . Not the same thing at all .
"Good for the baby! It will have a name, there will be challenges but the Lord will show the parents a strength they aren‚Äôt even aware they have to help their son or daughter! Praise the Lord for the life He gives us freely"
"Miscarriage is NOT the same as *murdering an unborn baby. 
1 baby dies naturally,
The other is alive & MURDERED. 
Damn people are stupid!"
This is what happens when our BASIC human rights are violated by very stupid men and a corrupt Supreme Court full of mysoginists. Shameful and beyond idiotic.
"""I voted for the leopards eating my face party and now leopards are eating my face and I don't like it!"""
They not going to let you carry a dead baby. Just stop the propaganda
Sounds like a bs story
"You get what you vote for. Now that it is in your laps instead of in the laps of yet another nameless, faceless family that you never have to meet, speak to, or understand, now it‚Äôs a problem‚Ä¶ I feel so bad for the baby who will suffer without any good reason because of these laws and the beliefs of people like you that directly contribute."
"Bless her soul, so tough"
This is absolutely fucking devastating.
"‚ÄúNever in a million years did I think I‚Äôd be  the one going through this.‚Äù Yup! Exactly the issue, this is how we end up with BS laws not grounded in reality."
I hate Texas
Your baby has a medical issue and you want to abort at 6 months pregnant. Wtf if wrong with people?????
lol üòÇits what yall voted üó≥Ô∏è for
Carry it to term then let the baby die naturally..no meds nothing
"She got what she voted for! If $15000 for the Colorado abortion was too much, wait until they get the bill for the inevitable c-section and NICU.

No sympathy whatsoever for this hateful 'the only moral abortion is mine' modern-day version of Eris"
Thank you Joe Biden for taking our rights awayüò¢
Abortions are health care for women
I went thru the same thing sorry to say. My situation was in 1981.üò¢
That is soo sad üò¢
They need to go back and change these laws. It‚Äôs our bodies and no one should have the right to tell us what we can and can‚Äôt do with them.  I feel so bad for her and can you imagine the mental health issues she will have after this and lasting so long.  Like how stupid is this law.  It makes me so angry!!!
And she still can‚Äôt empathize lol. Oh Christians. üòÖ
Deserved.
Abortion is our right has females
Forcing a woman to carry and birth a baby that won‚Äôt have a good quality of life or that will suffer is just wrong. I don‚Äôt believe in carrying a fetus full term then termination before it takes its first breath but I do believe that if a woman decides early on that she doesn‚Äôt want the pregnancy it‚Äôs her body her choice.
"Obviously she's not a believer because doctors can be hella wrong. My cousin was supposed to be a down syndrome and she came out normal. God created that baby for a reason, this couple is a coward and weak. Even if the child is born with the brain abnormality so what? You still love the child and be there for the baby.... again God created this beautiful life for a reason....the enemy knows this child is powerful that's why he is trying to take him out..... Parents get your butt into church and start learning about the Lord and his miracles... Because obviously you have no clue how to live in this world!!! This is as deep as I can hash it to y'all. I pray for your soul and I pray for that sweet precious baby inside you to turn out healthy like my cousin whom the doctors were wrong about!!!"
Probably wouldn't have happened if the baby killers weren't out celebrating murdering babies and putting on parades and stuff.
This is more harmful than an abortion would be.
"Abortion is no different than murder. You want to legalize abortion? You might just as well legalize murder. ‚ÄúYou are an American, you have the unenviable right to avoid all responsibility for your actions, even if you have to kill your own child in the womb before it is legally born,‚Äù is essentially legalized abortion. (Incidentally, my Mom wanted to have an abortion when she was carrying my sister in her womb, but changed her mind after she got to the clinic. She left the waiting room before it was her turn. I cannot conceive of how different my life would be like if I had never known my sister. And neither can my Mom. My sister also suffers from severe mental health issues. She‚Äôs lived for decades needing even the most basic care, because she is incapable of taking care of herself. But she is the sweetest human being we‚Äôve ever known. She has saved our lives with her cheerfulness more than once. Imagine how many good lives will never be lived because they were deliberately severed in the womb before birth.) I cannot feel any differently about this matter."
"My question is why all these gynaecologists were silent when the laws were passed, why some politician brainwashed by religion should be allowed to make such a choice. 
Are we going back to a Stone Age? Because this is definitely not a democracy, when instead of medical professional we listen to religious demagogues."
Your perfectly free to travel out of Texas for an abortion. No one is forcing you to carry a baby nor to live in Texas.
"I would carry that precious baby. I lost my daughter at almost 4 months pregnant,  and got pregnant again and we lost that baby. In you worry about carrying that baby. I lost my daughter, and the day she left this earth was May 21st. Wish I had more time carrying , because I still cry everyday,  and for our baby we just lost Jan 15th. I do anything to have them both back. üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢"
It‚Äôs absolutely cruel. These laws are crazy to have no type of exceptions. Can‚Äôt believe women voted for that.
This is such a tragedy for this family. To go through a full term pregnancy just for more sadness in the end. God protect this Queen and her family. üò¢
As a Texan myself I feel sorry for all the women living in this state.
My heart cannot handle another pregnancy
Lol so you‚Äôre telling me women have to put their life and their kids life at risk over some dude being able to bust a ü•ú. BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH . ‚Ä¶.and women still give it up??? All you have is to blame yourself ..no wonder they say women are stpd
They voted pro life and NOW they are still against a woman's right to choose but complaining that they have no choice here. Go figure.
"The decisions regarding  a woman's womb need to be done by the woman and her medical caregivers.  Only males who support this stance have a part in the discussions.  If you do not have a viable womb, butt out.  If you are not a certified medical caregiver for the female, butt out unless invited. Keep your praying, prying, protective, and creepy hands off of a woman's body."
Sounds horrible but you reap what you sow.
ü§£ü§°
That's what you voted for.. Now you want to leave the state to get an abortion. What about the women who can't afford to do that...
pro life üíØ
I don‚Äôt wanna see any shocked faces
New Mexico is a safe state still
"There is nothing crazy about carrying a terminally ill, living child to term. Hopefully it will form bonds, honor the baby's life, and provide closure. There is no way around the sadness. Losing a baby is awful."
Omg how sad üò¢but be hard and omg this hearts my soul ü•∫
"If the baby is dead or killing you, then that is one story. If it is a child that you don't want to care for, selfish and a list if you decide to kill it"
Lets just get the laws out of women‚Äôs uteruses already. Side note: it is interesting that we dont need to know if a trans person has had surgery down there in order to respect there identity but yet we so openly have on trial women‚Äôs uteruses. Honestly it should just be between a woman and her gynecologist. üò¢
Sad
Move to California you can kill a baby at any age
Welp
Stop voting for Republicans and you won‚Äôt have this problem.
This woman never expected to be at the receiving end of her own judgments
"What I don't get is why is the husband afraid for his wife? What would be different physically about giving birth to a baby who doesn't live long, vs one who does?"
"I'm very sorry for the loss you both must be feeling. I hope that somehow, despite the politics, you can make your sweet baby boy feel all of your love for as long as he is growing and living. I wish the outcome would have been different, but if he is born and does live with you for whatever time is his, I hope he feels the love of his Mom & Dad and you feel his love too."
üò¢ üòÆüò¢ No words‚Ä¶ sending healing & loving vibes your way.
"She wants an abortion but doesn‚Äôt think other women should be able to choose one. 

Husband: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fair for her.‚Äù Sir, it is not fair for any woman."
To me even though this woman realized her mistake she is still disturbing to me. NO ONE should be able to decide what happens in and to someone else‚Äôs body
Personally I'd carry an give my son the best year he had on this earth with tons of love. He wouldn't have to be perfect to the rest of the world
"Heartbreaking all the way around. No one deserves this situation, Especially not that baby."
"Well, thank the pro life maga conservative for over turning roe v wade and passing these bans as if this won't affect real people."
you get what you vote for unfortunately
I agree with her. Abortion is not birth control
Hod makes no mistakes
"In my country abortions are legal so I have no issue there BUT if states are going to make it illegal, if the baby is not going to survive and will have no quality of life if it does then teminations should be allowed for MEDICAL REASONS.....E.g. brain dead child."
"Yea it's not a big enough issue to turn the abortion ban around. Sounds like a 1 in 10,000,000 problem. Keep trying ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
I think abortion should be available for those women who get raped but those that have a relationship and want abortion is wrong because in the first place there is protection and like this family just because the doc says something is wrong with the kids whether the kid has mental or physical problems does not mean get rid of the child it's called being a parent and dealing with the kid
Christian didn‚Äôt think about this when they decided to push their dumb (fake) beliefs. This is why idiots should not run or country/nation. #selfish #greedy. they should‚Äôve known inbreeds would have issues like this. #CantControlEverything
Why do Americans STILL allow Old White Men to make decision and control an American Woman‚Äôs life.  You can‚Äôt cherry pick either your for it or against it.
Voting has consequences. Maybe people will start to understand that they are subject to those consequences as well. Quit voting for candidates who feel it‚Äôs their right to dictate their illogical beliefs on everyone.
"Fucking Texas.  This woman just needed to shut up after 2:52.  Good riddance, sorry you have to go through this but maybe stop being so rigid in your approach on dictating how other women access healthcare. üò° so you‚Äôre pro choice but only when it affects you? Ugh"
This is so heartbreaking. Literally feels like we are in some horrendous show where people have no rights over their own bodies.
You got what you voted for. Enjoy üëçüèª
Not even conservative christians want to be forced to carry non-viable babies to term. Yet these laws are made by people who think their conservative christian base want this.
"Many conservatives are fond of calling a clump of cells in a woman's uterus, a ""child,"" and of calling abortion, ""murder."" I say democrats don't know how to rabble-rouse like republicans do.

How about demanding social security numbers for the clumps of cells, and that the IRS Code be amended to allow zygotes, embryos, and fetuses to be claimed as Dependants on Form 1040. And make that applicable to ALL pregnant taxpayers. 

There are ways to fight republican zealotry, but democrats are too conventional in their approach."
How funny it only matters when its happening to you. The consequences of your vote.
"Sue your state. Vote Blue! No laws should touch your body or force you to harm your health. Husbands, dads, bf you should stand up for your wives,  daughters,  friends."
I say woman need to stop having sex if they want to avoid this situation or a normal pregnancy. Boycott sex woman. There are toys if you want the big O.
Welcome to the real world.  You don't think other people should be titled to terminate an inadvertent pregnancy but it should be okay in your circumstances.  This is what happens when the State starts sticking its nose into decisions that really should be between a woman and her doctor.
They want to play God
My son might be born disabled so let's murder him.
Praying for baby boy.
Girl come to California. We gotchu.
"If the baby puts the mom's life in serious danger, then it must be killed to avoid the loss of 2 lives. Otherwise the mom must carry on with the pregnancy. You make your bed you sleep in it."
"so even if it already has died and has no brain and is essentially brain dead, she wouldn't even be able to get a D&C? my MIL got a d&C right after she gave birth to my husband to get her tubes tied, this is ridiculous. so she would basically have to have a still birth??"
Now this is a medical reason for an abortion. Using it as birth control is what is disgusting.
If men had to deal with carrying babies this would even be an issue.
Lol get fucked loser. She literally voted for this. She must have thought it through and put herself in other mothers shoes no? Or was she a nasty fucking devil who could see passed her own agenda?
Life sure can humble you.
"and this is why people who aren't affected by the situation shouldn't have the power to vote on it, give the votes to those mothers who are actually facing these issues and we will be in a better world because of it"
I don't understand why she couldn't get an abortion. Does Texas not have medical exemptions? Could she not have gone to a different states?
I get sick of the women in this world that get pregnant and then with to go to a Dr and kill it but will go to hell but I no one thing I don't talk date have sex or marry a what that kills a baby don't care about what people say that u me I want
üôÑ
"I‚Äôm so grateful to live In Colorado. Even as a Christian, we need to save viable lives. Not force others to suffer."
You're either for abortion or you are not in ALL cases. Sick of people only caring when it involves THEM!
It may sound sick but maybe the Texas mom should have her delivery on the floor of the Texas state house while they're in session so they can see the horror they've created
"If the baby is already not going to live, why rush to kill it before it's born? The little boy will die naturally after birth."
Question: Does this harm the mom to give birth to the baby who‚Äôs not developed like other babies? Does this type of birth put her life at risk?
"People absolutely SHOULDN'T have to do this, not in this day and age, and truly they don't. Unless of course they happen to live in a random geographical locale where some politician has decided that they are going to be in charge of these decisions for us, regardless of their lack of education on any of the real issues related to these ludicrous laws. This should never happen, not ever. This is just one more great example of why. They want you believe they are passing these laws because in the majority of cases, ""abortion"" is just used as a horrific form of birth control. So you know, hurry up and take that away, but the truth is, in reality those instances represent a very low number of cases. And EVEN THEN, they still have that right to make that decision for themselves. Unfortunately, the reality is that a large percentage of ""abortion"" procedures, (a term which encompass a wide array of treatments), are performed to end a pregnancy that was VERY much wanted. That's what everyone listening to their rhetoric and constantly repeated sound bites supporting these laws doesn't even try to understand, until it affects them, or their loved ones, which at some point will happen to everyone... We are smarter than this people, come on."
In a rare situation like this the baby will be born terminally ill and will likely be on life support until it passes. I don't see why so many people belive thats any different than a person of any age being on life support or in hospice care until they pass. Its always terrible for a person to suffer and die and its awful for the family members to go through it but we don't just kill everyone who's terminal. Thats so sad. Why kill the baby?
"Anyone notice neither of the couple used the word abortion and kept using the word ‚Äúit‚Äù or ‚Äúprocedure‚Äù? Accept reality and the fact that you are pro life, but want an abortion. Who wants to make their own decision for their own body now? The hypocrisy in this video is remarkable‚Ä¶"
This is so heartbreaking.  Sad for everyone involved-this family is traumatized enough finding out their baby will not survive and then to be told the law is forcing everyone to suffer more is horrific.  I‚Äôm sorry for this family.
"Say yes to live is always the right thing to do.
God will blessed you and your family.
Instead of saying procedure, say abortion and see how you feel.
We women are to give life and take care of the human being when is in the most fragile stage in life.
We women should be against abortion, God created us to give life, not to terminated.
Be open to life and receive blessing for every little Angel."
"I work EMS in Texas and actually ran a call for a 35 year old woman who has this same disease after she pulled her trach tube out. She was in a total vegetative state - absolutely no means of communication or signs of cognitive function. She couldn‚Äôt even localize to objects with her eyes. Her entire 35 year existence has been laying in bed, breathing through a tube and being fed through a G tube with a suprapubic catheter to catch her urine. She has to be turned every few hours in bed (for her entire life) to prevent pressure ulcers. She‚Äôs never been able to talk, walk, speak, sit up, or even eat on her own. I remember thinking to myself how miserable it must be to live like that. And I wondered if her parents knew before she was born of her condition and why they wouldn‚Äôt choose to terminate if so. Seems like it would have been the far more merciful thing to do. Now thanks to the SCOTUS parents don‚Äôt even get to make that quality of life decision for their kids. What a nightmare we‚Äôre living in."
This  kind of news is crushing enough.  To force this woman or any woman to maintain this kind of pregnancy for another 4 months is beyond criminal.
She should have gotten denied. She can vote to get rid of peoples rights but when it comes to her it‚Äôs ok
WWWW
#Prolife
This so what y‚Äôall voted for. Why are y‚Äôall upset?
"The only way to solve this problem is to vote Democrat. There is only one political party that will ensure that women have the choice and the options available to them to safety handle any pregnancy complication that may arise, and it's certainly NOT the Republican party."
This is a lack of good judgment and descernment by medical staff.
WELL... you asked for it. üòê
The system is so fucked up!!!! So they will not allow her to abort but are willing to let her give birth to a child that will die no later than 1 yr after birth? Make it make sense AMERICA!
"A lot of valid criticisms in the comments, but I really feel for this couple and it is a good thing for everyone that they are coming out with their story."
"The doctors said the baby was nonviable. Doctors have been proven wrong before. I wouldn't have an abortion. There's always the chance that nothing will be wrong.  Nobody's perfect. I would love the baby no matter what. Only God should take a life away. Heartbreaking, but no doctor would have the right to tell me to have an abortion. God bless this baby to be perfect enough for these parents."
Oh well. You reap what you sow ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This is outrageous. Filled with rage that women have lost the right over their own bodies and now will be left traumatized over situations just like this one. Lawmakers should be ashamed of themselves.
This is sensationalism... read the laws for yourselves. I've read them.
I‚Äôm snitching and collecting the moola if she aborts in BIG TEXAS ! Chaooo! You get what you vote for ‚Ä¶pow! üí∞üá∫üá∏üòé
"There needs to be exceptions for stuff like this. I think it should be allowed anyway, but if not, at least allow exceptions for emergencies like this."
"Sad, proof that no life exist without a birth in brain....no bible quote says anything abortion specially in political laws."
Don't orient the conversation to support murder. Women culture insistent of murder to children within the womb has DIRECTLY INCREASED MURDER OF CHILDREN OUTSIDE THE WOMB. EVIL IS NOT AN OPINION. KARMA IS UNRELENTING
"If it ain't broke don't fix it; let the lawsuits begin so victims can get a million+ from tax payers money; if only came from politicians, sad."
"Wait until all the compassionate OB/GYN's leave the state so they make medically necessary decisions with their patients and not with politicians who have zero business doing so. This woman and her husband had the means to go to another state, although by that time it was too late. But how many women and girls have to suffer with no hope before bodily autonomy, right to privacy and separation of church and state are given back to them?"

"So, your beliefs/votes actively caused this. So, very sad."
"She thinks she has the right to tell other people what they can do, but she gets to chose.  What a dope."
Her comments indicate she‚Äôs one of those conservatives that didn‚Äôt think this could happen. ü§î üßê
"A fetus without a brain is no longer a baby, much less a pregnancy. It isn‚Äôt even compatible with life. No brain = no heartbeat once the mother‚Äôs circulatory system stops working to keep the fetus from rotting. This is ridiculous and if people knew how toxic a necrotic, dying fetus inside a mother was, they would terminate this lethal mass of flesh inside this woman immediately."
"They are the adults, they are not the victims. This child is the victim and the one who will suffer. Their son will die either way. This is not love or concern or well-meaning or good. This is purely selfish."
"LMFAO natures way of saying FU to the toxic human species.. the human animal will suffer the consequences of ignorance!!!!! LOL i came into early menopause at 37 because of how toxic a civilization we live in, and was never selfish enough to subject any of my would be offspring to the rest of you savages, so as far as i'm concerned im no longer at risk of being a forced broodmare for the state lol!"
The right to terminate a pregnancy should remain a right.
This is why Politicians should not make any laws that have to do with health/medical.
No efffsss giving since more than likely it sure looks they voted for that.
"This simultaneously breaks my heart but also enrages me. 

Like HOW could she be going through this, but also still be so against abortion?!
She doesn‚Äôt support it as ‚Äúbirth control,‚Äù yet she can‚Äôt see the problems that arise when doctors aren‚Äôt allowed to be doctors?! 
As she is learning, she can‚Äôt have it both ways! The state needs to leave medical procedures to practitioners and patients. 

It‚Äôs a case by case basis. Things are not black and white, and politicians should not be able to police a woman‚Äôs body with these laws. Something is very wrong here! 

People seem to forget we don‚Äôt live in a damn theocracy!"
She is the type of person who deserves this
Ok but 20 weeks it‚Äôs too far along. Plane and simple. You do realize that the procedure for abortion at 20 weeks is essentially partly giving birth right? And ‚Äúnon viable‚Äù pregnancy? No. Non viable means baby wouldn‚Äôt even make it through delivery
"1 in 10k is NOT an ""anomaly"" you demented lunatic....thats a LOT of deformity lady what drugs is she on tryping to pass that off as a small occurrence..... and thats without stating the fact this country has the highest of wealthy nations of women dying from childbirth as if there is infinite space and resources on this planet of 8 BILLION dysfunctional savage...with what information is available one would be so inclined to say that you people deserve to suffer the consequences of self-serving ignorance...when the chances are higher for having deformed offspring than the chances for winning the lottery, then I would say that is NOT an anomaly and from a doctor no less LOL no wonder the ""quality"" of people there are in society when so-called educated people say 1 in 10k of deformed offspring is ""an anomaly""...this lady is either downplaying the severity or highly questionable when it comes to math either way this speaks VOLUMES..."
But I was told this didn't happen! Did the pro-birth camp? /s
Oh well. That's the preferred law in texas. This is exactly what they wanted.
"Nah, but you guys don‚Äôt want abortions right? You should‚Äôve stayed in Texas with all the other trump supporters. Hypocrites."
"‚ÄúNot deemed for birth control‚Äù, but now that she needs she is okay with it?"
He‚Äôs still a person üò¢ I would gladly love him as long as he lives. Poor little guy.
What pro-death to human beings ABC won't show you are the 1000's of women who choose adoption or at first wanted an abortion but carried the baby to term and now say it was the best decision they've ever made.
"I'm being punished now with their undesirable whining, not going to let my cat's belly go?  It's skin."
"Whos using abortion as birth control? Its costs hundreds of dollars, so its not the poor."
"They're always whining about me needing healthcare and help, but they've gotten rid of abortion in many places.  Even though I'm an adult, me bringing a kid into the world is child abuse, especially in the US.  Most people have no idea how hard it is to do simple things because of all the roadblocks. We have to do more than normal people, too, and we can only live if we do quantum physics. I'm not kidding. The places I live in become bunkers and a war zone.  The US can't be civil about anything. I have to be hunted and in Hell, for I'm evil. I asked to be sterilized.  They would not do it.  I've only had one true boyfriend for like 6 months.  Due to how I was treated, I don't like dealing with the crowd of cliches.  They want me to join the masses.  I can't.  They did it to me. They'll never say sorry.  Cry me a river."
That‚Äôs sounds like your problem sweetheart. You know you voted so enjoy your non-viable baby.üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Who gets to select the reasons it is necessary? That‚Äôs why it should always be up to the woman and not to other peoples religious beliefs and  politicians.
I pray in Jesus name that God makes a miracle out of that baby boy and that he's born healthy with a fully funtional brain and that this family has beautiful  testimony out of this.  Read the book God Wants You Well and watch the youtube testimonies of the many negative ultrasounds that turned into miracles. In Him
"You don't need to go to Mexico where it could be unsafe or end up with a serious infection ... If you need medical abortion and your life is in danger go to Canada They will help you and it's safe you will be taken care of !! 

This also affects IVF , ( EGG DONATION ,SPERM DONORS , SURROGATE MOTHERS ) making people who battle infertility impossible to ever have any children because no one will be donating with ban laws as ridiculous as this in the USA !! Did anyone even think of that when making this ridiculous Law !!"
"A life is a life and just because they don‚Äôt want to go through the pain of losing him they are willing to put him through pain and kill him? I mean really!? Everyone wants to tip toe around the word abortion and how it is actually done. The fact that you are choosing to kill your child because you don‚Äôt want to live with the consequences of your act of having sex (regardless of that child‚Äôs health issues) is heart breaking and evil.  That child deserves to be loved and wanted regardless of how ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù he is. And lastly, you are either pro-life or pro-choice, there is no gray or in between area. Murder is murder. We have killed more unborn babies in this country than hitler did during world war 2 and that is is sad. I pray we stop acting like we are god and start acting more human with empathy and compassion. We are all give trials and tribulations and our true colors shine by how we choose to act and handle them."
I hope this women sues the state of Texas  for pain and suffering
I‚Äôm sure California would do ti asap and for free.
If they had made me carry to term I would still have a dead fetus inside of me right now lmao. This is insane
"Apart from a 230+ year old document - that was used to justify slavery and deny the women the right to vote - does anyone have anything else beyond pure pragmatism to justify killing a developing human in the womb but not outside the womb?






By the way, a non viable developing human isn‚Äôt alive. Hence, this story has zero to do with being pro LIFE!"
He had a brain. A brain not dividing is way different than not having a brain. Still terribly sad. üòî
People don't care until its happening to them. Body autonomy should be a human right.
Horrible...my condolences
"Sounds more than ""nonviable"" if it can survive for even up to a year after being born."
"Pro choice here. I am not shocked this is happening, I am shocked she still believes she has any right to deem when abortion is or isn‚Äôt necessary. Both of you are dumb and could not make the final stretch. If an abortion in colorado costs 10-15k its HIGHLY probable that abortion cannot feasibly be used as frequent as birth control. however even if abortion was: why would we force them to carry a child they don‚Äôt want"
My heart was restarted twice with adenosine and me and my baby were on bed rest for three months while our heart rates dropped and I had to lay there helplessly as she was on my sciatic nerve and killed the nerves to my knee. I started the pregnancy doing 5K‚Äòs and ended up not being able to walk in a wheelchair.  I literally used my body my choice to try to get the doctors to take her out early when she was viable enough to save her life over mine while they were restarting my heart with adenosine for the second time and it wasn‚Äôt working and she was losing oxygenation to the brain.   Because they didn‚Äôt take her out she is nonverbal and will never speak or have a normal life.   They did not respect my wishes as her mother to save her before me even though I have a life-threatening illness and she had a full healthy life ahead of her if they had listen to me.   Its not our bodies or our choices.  They‚Äôve chosen for us.
Stop voting republican
I had a missed miscarriage at 3 months‚Ä¶ I still had to carry my baby 2 weeks after finding out my baby had passed away inside me. Those 2 weeks were horrible I can‚Äôt imagine having to carry the baby until full term.
Prayers to the family.
Its still murder no matter what its situation is

"We are not a ""Free"" country anymore.  If I was still in my twenties I would be looking for an exit any way I could find.   Good luck ladies.  WE are no longer safe."
"Pro life people act like medical issues with pregnancy are something rare when they are in fact so common. Then they are surprised when it happens to them or someone they know. 

When something is going wrong with your pregnancy the last thing you want to do is fight with the law.

Few women actually choose to get an abortion and most of those women who do are either teenagers, or below the poverty level. The fast majority.

It's easy to say not to get an abortion when you may end up homeless if you don't."
"Society needs to stop pushing their beliefs on everyone else, mind your own business and keep my body out of your business and leave my body in my business where it belongs!"
This is a medical issue and should have been delt with medically. The Dr who did not deal with it was negligent.
"God works in really mysterious ways,really really mysterious ways!"
I'm glad I got my abortion back in 2017 before this banüòÇ nothing was wrong with the fetus I just didn't want it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
What‚Äôs more tragic is that it‚Äôs clear they were pro life voters. You don‚Äôt care until something like this is FORCED upon you.
"Why don't you, ABC, look into the MEDICAL reasons for her carrying to term rather than slicing her children up and sucking them out of her body, or tearing them out a leg at a time.  Birth is a natural process, whether or not the babies are alive.  ABORTION is NOT natural, unless it is spontaneous through miscarriage.  This could have ended up with a dead MOTHER as well as still born babies."
She shouldn't have had sex ABSTINENCE IS THE ONLY WAY NOT TO GET PREGNANT Another THEN HE WOMAN WHO ACTUALLY CANT GET PREGNANT WHICH THAT IS REALLY SAD  WOMAN HOW CAN GET PREGNANT ARE Taking advantage of that she could be stupid and go have a backdoor ABORTION
"My heart goes out to this woman.  ""The pain she has to endure is enormous"".  Can you just imagine the pain a baby, yes a baby, endures during abortion.  Easier not to think about that isn't it?"
So sorry. ü´Ç
"I‚Äôm sure even with the brain being the way it is, this baby would still feel the pain during an abortion at its fetal stage- thank God Texas is saving these poor babies from painful murder."
"Pure evil, someone who wants to kill their innocent precious baby that they created, that God wanted them to have for a reason"
"Oh, oh, it was because God and republicans loved it so much it had to go to Heaven before it was born."
"Republicans: we want less government intrusion in our lives!!!
Also Republicans:  make the government ban abortion!!!"
Boohoo pro life conservative Texas woman can't (in her own opinion) kill her unborn baby. Big whoop. She even judged other women in this interview. This is sweet karma.
Despicable that a women's healthcare decisions are being made by the government.  Patriarchy in all it's glory üò°  A major set back to women.  üò§üò°  A return to days when women has no rights.
Everyone needs to stop controlling women's bodies.
American freedom?!  A husband and wife cannot choose abortion to protect the wife‚Äôs health. But they can own as many guns as they want!
"I‚Äôm sorry they are going through that.  I think it‚Äôs sad that no one feels like this baby‚Äôs life is worth it. Is it traumatic and horrifying to find out your child‚Äôs life expectancy is a year after birth? OF COURSE. But many babies sadly die from SIDS or get diagnosed with fatal  medical conditions after birth and they don‚Äôt live very long. Should we terminate all pregnancy‚Äôs if we know the child won‚Äôt ever become an adult? No. If it‚Äôs not unsafe to the mother to carry, I don‚Äôt understand why she feels the need to terminate the baby‚Äôs life? That baby is beautiful, and precious, and matters, even if we know his life will be short. I‚Äôm praying he is healed in Jesus‚Äô name and that the next scan they will see his brain is forming the way is should be."
"The family shouldn't have ever been in a situation where they weren't in control of her reproductive rights. If you don't want an abortion, then don't have one. But it isn't the place of the government to regulate any woman's uterus. Ever!"
The child deserves to be delivered naturally and feel loved until he passes..that's the right thing to do. She's not in distress but the baby would be.
Women reproductive rights are going to the dark ages and still they vote for the stupidest people that make these laws.
This makes me mad üò° how dare the government make this family suffer with knowing they have a child that will not live they want her to carry full term
What about the mental cruelty she has to endure. Oh my God!  Horrific.
"The majority voted in the politicians that bought these types of non exempt laws to the table. And instead of the public thoroughly examining the bills before siding yes or no blindly, this is what we get. So we all live with the outcomes until further notice.  In the states, where it is illegal, let's not expect any changes too soon."
"Every life is valuable. EVERY LIFE. God gives and takes away life. Wanting to abort even a ""non-viable"" baby means missing out on joy, lessons, growth, and grace that God can provide in such a tragic situation. That baby has an ETERNAL soul and is precious."
So beyond stupid ignorance of Texas
PROPAGANDA.
"If anyone deserves this, it's literally her. She knew nothing about medicine and decided abortion was bad and now she knows 1 thing about medicine and thinks she should be exempt from the rules she voted for. Come on."
"Well, I hope more conservative folks will listen to this lovely couple from Texas. This poor family. The poor baby. Reverse the overturn of Roe vs. Wade. Thank God I live in California. Although I myself would not get an abortion unless I was in a situation where my life or the baby's are in jeopardy, a situation like these people are going through, but I still believe that abortions MUST be legal especially today. You can't POSSIBLY think that no sex Ed in schools PLUS no abortions is REALLY a good idea..."
"I feel for them. She has to carry the child full term, only to see her beloved child with disabilities and deformities. And then to see the child die. That‚Äôs a lot. And if she gets postpartum depression that‚Äôs even worse. :("
Abortion is murder.
"Sad 
I had to get an abortion years ago because I was having difficulties. 
I had to make a decision loose the child, myself or us both in danger of dying. I choose abortion I already had 2 toddlers & a new husband. It would not of been fair for them loosing a mother at such a young age nor my husband loosing his wife."
"This whole situation is scary, and women being rape are getting pregnant early smh ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è what happens now ?!?!???"
Religious turds making laws about crap they know nothing about. Typical right wing stupidity.
are there really dumb people who believe that someone use abortions for birth control ??
"""...that people have to do this...""  -- do what?  I don't mean to be insensitive, but that child will have a full brain in heaven and is a complete person here on earth, whether in his mother's womb or outside of it."
"Such a sad story. Imagine this being your wife, your sister, your daughter, how would you feel about it? Would it change your mind? I am pro-choice, our government has no business in our private affairs. I mean, if a woman is out there using abortion as birth control, perhaps there should be repercussions, but most women have an abortion because they feel they have to, not because they want to, it‚Äôs done out of necessity. This is just crazy. How big is our government going to get? How many aspects of our lives do they get to control?"
I love how all the men who've never been women have the most to say. The fetus doesn't have a brain. HOW ELSE CAN A HUMAN LIVE WITHOUT A BRAIN? NO BRAIN=IMMINENT DEATH... üôÑ
Thank a republican
I'm sorry for your situation.
Women have had to do this even Before Roe VS Wade was over turned.  Please research people becMSM is just playing on your fears n outrage.
So doctor has said your health is not in jeopardy and the baby is alive. God gave you this baby to love for however long he lives. Making this stance for abortion when you don't believe in it is a shame. Now pro-aborts will use your baby and your story to kill many babies needlessly. Please pray about why you are doing this and whose future besides your own you are affecting.
"Man, that ban.... what a setback."
NO SYMPATHY GOD doesn't like ugly
Don't feel sorry for you you voted to overturn Roe v Wade so live with your choice
"Every human has value, even the ones people will deem 'non-viable'. It's not up to us to play God and destroy that life."
Could idk go 1 state over‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. It goes state to state.
"You know, I had sympathy for them until their comment about disagreeing with abortion ‚Äòas a form of birth control‚Äô. Gives big ‚Äòmy abortion is the only moral abortion‚Äô energy. Pointless gatekeeping and splitting hairs about which types of abortions are justifiable is why America is in the mess that it‚Äôs in. They were quite happy to feel smug in the fact that they would never have to deal with an unintended pregnancy but now the draconian anti abortion laws  attitudes like theirs have supported have meant that they are now in an awful situation."
"I think I know what‚Äôs going on. I don‚Äôt know how to put this in exact words but nobody in their right mind is going to do this to another human being UNLESS they are using these poor mothers to show you the downside so well that we agree to reinstate the abortion laws. I have a feeling this is not an accident that they put that innocent poor woman though that without it standing for something. The government is actually really smart and sick for this if what I‚Äôm thinking is true. I‚Äôm starting to think Texas is showing you the actual permanent cruelty making women go through birth regardless of the mother‚Äôs well being. I am personally against getting rid of the abortion  and stories like this really just confirms why this is a bad idea to make abortion illegal to begin with. If the government is going to be this heartless (which is on purpose for a purpose I can assure you) than we really don‚Äôt need to get rid of abortion. This is to much and it sickening. You have to lock me up in prison cause I wouldn‚Äôt have made her go through that. That would have been a big fat yes approval to abort the baby and save the mother. These reasons right here is why people need to leave abortion alone and stop trying to control everything and everyone. This is ridiculous and not okay. Abortion is very personal and very hard and frankly it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business. I would never get an abortion unless I‚Äôm in a situation like this beautiful mother but I don‚Äôt find it appropriate for anyone to judge a person getting an abortion. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business. We all are never going to see eye to eye on this but one things for sure, putting mothers through this is uncalled for regardless of the point they are trying to make. Y‚Äôall really dropping the ball on this. I‚Äôd rather save the mother from heartbreak and devastation she would have to go through after all this. My answer will always be the same. Keep abortion legal!!!! Can somebody please make it illegal to hound the abortion clinics is what really needs to happen. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business, I get it save the children but we can‚Äôt even take care of all the American foster children already and y‚Äôall want more??? I can smell the stupidity from here!!!"

Oh so because it may only live for a year it's worth killing sooner.... Hm
"The forced birth zealots will love this, they have no regard for the women‚Äôs feelings or health, she is nothing to them but a birthing vessel and she loses her bodily autonomy by law and she will be owned by the state until she gives birth."
Thank the old white men in your state ladies!!!!
Are his other organs viable and working? Your baby could save so many other babies lives!
People like them are the reason that those laws exist. They won't even say the word abortion and that woman thinks that there are people who use abortion instead of birth control. No one does that. They are clearly misogynistic Republicans who didn't care until it affected them.
"""It's necessary if it's for my benefit, but it shouldn't be allowed for others"". The hypocrisy is real."
"2:52 As soon as she said that it made me realize she is apart of the reason her (and other women in her state) are struggling to access this type of medical care. She wanted to ban all abortions, she only had a problem with her stance when she realized it would affect her life. It‚Äôs not up to anybody else to make these decisions about a person‚Äôs body, only the person who is pregnant. Hope this experience expands her perspective.

Edit: grammar"
Im glad you are sharing your story and helping to shine light on how these barbaric laws will effect people in reality!!! How your Vote matters! Who you chooseto lead definitely matters!
Could she not drive to another state?
"I couldn't watch this bc I immediately started to tear up.
10 years ago my boyfriend and I decided we wanted to have a baby. We'll I schedueled an apointtment they did a test said it was positive and sent me to a different hospital I thought it was normal bc this hospital was basically for sick and emergencies.. Well the second apointment they told me there were two heart beats and I would have to go to a high risk hospital after my next visit with them.. (my next visit was a glucose test) and after that we were sent to a hospital about 1hr away from where we lived. This is where we found out just how high risk our twin pregnancy was. They told us from the jump that this would go week by week.. we had weekly visists. and each visit they'd say next week we might have both, we might have one, or we'll loose both but lets hope for the best. I lost one at 22 weeks. My body went into labor and I had the second twin living (he lived for about 1 hr) and the other was still born. Their names are Elijah & Gabriel. I had no option to have the still born twin I had to carry him as long as my body would let me and that was less than 24hrs. Had I made it 24 weeks I would have been admitted into the hospital for the ramainder of my pregnancy.

I can research twin pregnancy all day long.. and figure out a game plan. but you never know what will happen. Nothing can stop what is to come. If your doing everything right to care for your unborn child.. not drinking, not doing drugs, taking your vitamins, eating!!
They said one of my twins wasn't getting what he needed.. the living twin weighed more than he did. I took my vitamins and ate as my dr directed. and still one passed away. No one could have controlled how much went to which twin.

So, I think its ignorant for people in the comments to say nobody cares about what shes going through... or she should have thought about this before.
To the people who dont want to abort their child they dont think about the abortion laws bc its not something they want to do. However if you are in a situation like this there should be an option to do so. If the baby has passed on and your body isn't going into labor.. maybe the doctor can induce you. Idk if that is apart of the law that the dr cant induce a pregnancy.. but if the baby.... 

Ok, I stopped typing and watched the video.
This is very sad.
How does a baby or person live with no brain..
Maybe this ultrasounds is wrong.. (it has happened)
I've been there where I was only able to hold my baby for an hour until he took his last breath. He wasn't developed enough and the hospital didnt have any supplies. & this was supposed to be the high risk pregnancy hospital. This was the place they sent people for high risk pregnancies.. if st. jude and leboner can save a baby at 20 weeks then why couldnt this high risk pregnancy hosptial try to save mine at 22 weeks.
I didn't fight because I felt in my heart it was time to let him go. He went to heaven with his twin brother. I knew it was time in that moment to say goodbye. I love both of them <3
two months later I found out I was having another baby and her name is Lailah! She's 8 now <3
I can only imagine trying to care for a baby that is possibly be none responsive..
knowing at any moment he or she could be gone.

idk what I would do in that situation having been through something not so the same before.. but right now I would say I'd carry the baby and enjoy what time I did have with him or her. Hold them snuggle them bc either way that is your baby. It sounds so awful to say ""I dont want my baby bc he doesn't have a brain"".. saying it that way does sound bad.. but listen to them they wanted a baby they dont want to abort their child. but now they are preprocessing the loss of their unborn child. Their child wont live past a year (based off of statistics) and the baby will essentially be lifeless. It's sad either way you go about it. but the baby is developing.. he's growing he just doesn't have a brian.. so I understand that he is living and you cant terminate a living baby. So, I'd say carry the baby to term and enjoy the time you do have with him. Hold your baby and love him bc any second he could pass away."
"She knows that I have a hard time controlling it. It‚Äôs just she wasn‚Äôt expecting it to stop no.  But she just wanted me to learn. That behaviour is not OK you know

Like sometimes people with mental disorders, have behaviours and violent behaviours that they can‚Äôt control sometimes.  But even if you know that you still should put a consequence on that behavior.

Even though he might, or she might not be able to control it. She or he can at least learn that OK yes this behaviour isn‚Äôt ok and I need help you know

Yes, I still had violent outburst. But that‚Äôs not the point the point is that I knew it was wrong. I eventually learned that.  Yes I can‚Äôt control it but instead of hitting I could do you know get a counsellor or do you something you know so that I don‚Äôt act that way in the future


That‚Äôs why she created a consequence because she was hoping that I would acknowledge that and try to get somebody to help me deal with it you know.  And it worked. I haven‚Äôt been violent for quite a few years you know. Because I‚Äôm not in a situation, where I feel like I have to pound the life out of somebody. You know I‚Äôm not in that situation so as long as I don‚Äôt get put in that situation.

You should never see me get physically, and/or emotionally violent again. Because that‚Äôs a problem. If I do end up living in a place where somebody‚Äôs screaming or yelling, you know when they get mad or upset. And it‚Äôs also why they‚Äôre getting upset too that‚Äôs what ticks me off.

Right like I had a roommate that used to get mad and he‚Äôd yell and swear at the support staff for trying to help him do his laundry.

He would get very rude and belligerent if somebody tried to help him with some thing. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even think he was angry. Sometimes I think he just like to behave like that I know sometimes I think he liked the idea of looking tougher, you know

Instead of just saying no, I don‚Äôt need any help with that. Thank you very much though you were very very very kind to try to help me.

You know that would‚Äôve been the proper way you know. And most people do get ticked off and yeah they do they can get physically violent.  But most people choose not to do that, right

But with me, it isn‚Äôt a choice you may ask OK if you can‚Äôt control getting violent then why haven‚Äôt you done that for a few years now.

Well, let me explain that. It‚Äôs because I know I can‚Äôt help it and because I‚Äôm so scared that I will end up in serious trouble you know. That I just try to avoid those situations you know.

Because I know I can‚Äôt I might be not able to control my actions in the moment. So I always like somebody to go with me so that if that happens, I can just tell them.

OK let‚Äôs get the heck out of here. You know that if I were to be on my own, you know. It would be much harder because. Yes I could leave and I have before too as well.

But it wasn‚Äôt as quick thinking. I was actually thinking should I get involved or should I just walk away.  Because I really wanted to do you know if somebody was being mean to somebody I really want to step in there and save them.

But you know my counsellor that I have now says that you know if they were to be like that it‚Äôs better off that wait until they leave and

Then go up and see if the person is OK and offer them support. Because if I went to that person, and I started it all yelling and screaming in his face or her face.

Then I would be just as bad as he is, or she is you know. And I don‚Äôt want to look that way I don‚Äôt want to look like an idiot. I don‚Äôt want that person that is being treated badly to look at me and

I think I am being a bully and not the other person you know because that‚Äôs exactly what they would think you know.  They would think I‚Äôm pulling the bully, and then all the attention will be on me and

I would be in big trouble I would be being a bully, not the other person. So it‚Äôs just good to wait until they‚Äôre done and left and then you go up to the person.

And ask them if they‚Äôre OK and offer support. And say to the person that you didn‚Äôt deserve what happened you know that was completely rude you know

And then that way they‚Äôre still feeling that support from me without being a bully, you know."
I wonder if the anti-abortionist do listen to medical professionals about health.

Elections have consequences.  It all sounded good until it affected her and her life and only then does she feel it should be available under certain circumstances.
"By her own ‚Äúabortions aren‚Äôt birth control‚Äù logic she shouldn‚Äôt be given an abortion. That baby is still ALIVE and the doctors didn‚Äôt deem it medically necessary. Her own lack of compassion for others is officially her problem, and that sucks. I hope others learn from this and start voting in the best interest of the public, not just what they think benefits them at the time or in the interest of controlling other people."
"I‚Äôve done this. I NEVER thought boy I want an abortion. I knew what was going on, I knew the outcome, I also knew god would support me through this. 
I‚Äôm sorry she/they all struggled with this. I know the pain of loss. Either way, grief is involved."
"Oh god, alobar holoprosencephaly is extreme. In some cases, the babies have one eye in the middle of their faces and no nose."
"I thought Joe Biden was going to make abortion possible. But again you people must‚Äôve voted for that lady who wanted she was so against people you know doing bad things that she obviously didn‚Äôt want abortion.

I forget what her name was. I don‚Äôt want to know because people like that makes me sick you know

I mean, there‚Äôs people that don‚Äôt want to have kids and don‚Äôt wanna give birth because they just can‚Äôt handle probably what they hear on a daily basis. Like they don‚Äôt want their child to end up a school shooter or you know a person who kills more than more people add an event on. 

Like sometimes in Barrie, they would have fairs, and that they usually have a fair that goes on in the summer at the waterfront.  And people just like to ruin that for kids and their families and friends to

Like lots of teenagers, go there with their friends, and have fun and have a ball. No just a bunch of innocent people just going to have fun that‚Äôs all.  But people like to use that opportunity, you know to kill them at that fair you know.

Thank God that hasn‚Äôt happened yet thank the Lord.  But you‚Äôre starting to hear more and more and more that now you know would like the July 4 shooting. That one was bad. I think a little boy like five or six years old maybe even younger. Had lost his parents you know

I think his dad I think the boy and his mom and dad are watching the parade and just like everybody else you know they were killed. Lotta people were killed that day you know

So yeah, it‚Äôs very very very scary you know. So I‚Äôm disgusted that doctors can‚Äôt do anything to stop a baby from growing in your belly.  Because I know in Canada, abortion is legal.

And I don‚Äôt know why in the states people don‚Äôt have the option of abortion.  Because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll change the fact that lots and lots and lots of people will still have kids you know I think there‚Äôs so so so many people that would at least adopt. Do you know kids from other countries.  So it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me that abortion is banned because you know.

There‚Äôs lotta kids for adoption do you know nobody Hass to give birth you know.  I mean when you adopt a child, you‚Äôre basically signing lots and lots and lots of paperwork and signing documents, saying that that child is now yours you know.

It‚Äôs exact same thing if you were to give birth because.  You have to sign papers in that too. You know there‚Äôs a lot that goes into pregnancy probably just the same amount as you were to adopt.

Do you know what you need to have a room. Toys depending on how young the child is. You have to buy clothing you know so it‚Äôs still as much work as it is to you know get pregnant you know

And plus I think you‚Äôre allowed to have some say that‚Äôs the only difference is that you‚Äôre allowed you know you‚Äôre allowed to have the same as to what personality of the child you‚Äôre looking for and you know how friendly you want them to be.

Like if you‚Äôre a mother and a father, who likes to go out and enjoy boat rides and traveling. You would want to adopt a child that would enjoy that too. You know

Yeah, giving birth you don‚Äôt always have that choice you know. You got like a 50-50 chance that you know you‚Äôre taking your chances and

When you give birth, sometimes children grow up and they aren‚Äôt very nice and did you get into lots of trouble sometimes they don‚Äôt care about how their parents feel. Like half of the school shooters or mass murders probably have a very loving family and that will never never never except violence in their house, I know my parents don‚Äôt you know they never agreed with violence of any kind 

I mean, if I had to leave from school because of my violent behavior.  Then she will have consequences for me and she sure did you know she didn‚Äôt put up with any of that

Even though she knows, I can‚Äôt help it, right"
"Well, DUH."
This womans experience was cruel and inhumane.
"The government trying to tell women what to do with their bodies is so wrong and so screwed up. To make a woman carry a baby to term that has something wrong with him and they know he's going to die, can cause death to the mother as well. And if that's the case, the husband should be able to sue the government for basically killing his wife. If it wasn't the government that got a woman pregnant, then they shouldn't have any say about what the woman does with her own body"
They should consider suing the state for mental health issues and for medical costs.
Inhumane
Forced birth is murder
"If only y'all can treat gun laws like abortion laws. Guns take more lives than abortion do... Another distraction from focusing on REAL ISSUES! Instead of banning abortion entirely EXACTLY HOW YOUR WONT BAN GUNS INTIRELY! You use the excuse (It's for our safety.) Well abortions can come at a woman's safety. (Men: So, you're prioritizing yourself over another human being) MEN DO IT EVERY SINGLE DAY IN POWER YOU EGOTISTICAL MUTS! Get over yourselves men are continuously trying to tell woman what to do with their bodies. You're not the ones pushing out the babies, you're not the one carrying for 9 months, you're not the one on the delivery bed. Shut up honestly if you can't carry than you aren't part of this conversation at this point. Regardless ban it if you want, you're just causing people to move out of your shitty state which is something my family had to do because she wasn't able to have an emergency abortion due to the fetus (egg) was stuck in the fallopian tube, due that that the baby would either not grow properly if it does pass through at a later point, my sister was at high risk of death during birth or the baby could possibly miscarriage as it's not possible for an egg to grow in the fallopian tube so to leave that fetus inside of her till term... disgusting. GUNS KILL WAY MORE PEOPLE THAN ABORTIONS DO... WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY MORE! Remove guns than you can continue the abortion debate but till than ladies. MOVE! GET OUT OF THERE. GO SOMEONE WERE PEOPLE CARE ABOUT YOU AND PRIORITIZE YOUR SAFETY! WHY RISK YOUR LIFE A CONFIRMED ONE OVER A POTENTIAL LIFE! Be smart! don't let them brain wash you with this nonsense. FETUS ARE NOT ALIVE! A fetus doesn't even have lungs fully working until approx 26-28 weeks. So even if there was an emergency anything prior to that the baby wouldn't even survive without life saving devices. Why would you even want your child to live life like that... It's sad really. BE SMART LADIES REMEMBER WE ARE THE BRAINS USE IT. DON'T LET THESE MUTS BRAINWASH YOU! WE KNOW OUR BODIES BETTER THAN THEY EVER WILL!"

"Abortion is most used in the States as birth control, sickening. Many Prayers for this family. Never forget God is Great all the time! Have faith you will make it thru this."
"The southern border is bringing turmoil to our country. These main stream media news is on china side. They don't give a fat rat assss. China doll news anchors, report cow farted before border crisis. It does not fit the anti American narrative. Msm, is on our adversary side."
It‚Äôs so sad that the government thinks they can get involved in our health and well being.
The entire anti-abortion issue is driven by religion. And religion is make believe. End of discussion - engage with reality it will happen and legal = safe.
"She chose to have a pregnancy. Of course not all pregnancies are the same. If the child is dead, it is a miscarriage. If the child is alive then it‚Äôs a forced miscarriage, also known as an abortion. In other countries they have wiped out the disable kids. Since the doctors see the fetus ‚Äú not developing properly‚Äù and advice to have an abortion or it would look bad. This is only the second case, that has happened and just needs a bit more research. It does not happen that often, therefore making it not necessarily to reverse the anti-abortion laws."
If this woman were to die from complications of the forced pregnancy....her family should be able to sue each and every political figure thus OWNING the state of TX in the end.
"Medical advances are allowing babies to be created...but there are cases where one or both parents have biological issues that would never bring forth a child. 

Medically assisted fetus' that turn out to be (in this case broken) should not be held under this ridiculous new law!!!!"
I‚Äôve lost hope for America. Good luck everyone.
To anyone outraged by this and other recent supreme court rulings == if you were too busy or disinterested to vote in 2016  -- THIS IS ON YOU.
No brain baby that‚Äôs exactly what Republicans want. Someone just as stupid as the rest of them
"Thank the holier than thou brainless GOP.
May they suffer far worse instances of pain & suffering than these countless parents are forced to endure."
"Most people who are anti abortion think it's used as ""birth control"" when it's not used that way. No one uses it that way. People get abortions because they need to. Like ""Its not fair"" when they were the ones to vote for anti abortion."
"üò¢,poor family"
I can‚Äôt believe that people STILL believe in the myth that abortion is used as birth control. NO IT‚ÄôS NOT. Think about it logically. Is it logical to spend hundreds of dollars to get an abortion when you can spend a few bucks on birth control? That‚Äôs essentially what you‚Äôre saying. Jesus Christü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Texas has decided to take control of women‚Äôs lives. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with this.
So wrong on so many levels..wtf.
I hope and pray that baby is  born perfectly normal and they have a healthy baby ! God is always good no matter what ! Amen !
"Women are now second class citizens in states where abortiion is not allowed.  W/O legal, safe abortion, women will die.  We must be allowed to make our own decisions.  I come from the era before Roe and had to get a safe if illegal abortion.  I was lucky, but my granddaughter who is 19 may not be.  If this woman can get to California or Washington, she will be ok.  I encourage you to
do everything you can to get to a state that is legal."
"How is this not considered mental, emotional and physical abuse of a Mother and mental and emotional abuse of the Father?"
Did they vote Republican to support these anti-abortion laws before finding out her baby was not gonna make it? üßê
"So did she end up having her son or is she still carrying him in her womb? We need the whole story ABC,not just some of it. Besides,this baby could prove dr.'s wrong and live past 1 year and so on. It just means he may not be able to walk or talk and feed himself. It's not a big deal if he has to sit in a wheelchair and be fed with a feeding tube device. Hundreds of children are born every day with medical issues like cerebral palsy that make them invalids for life and their parents didn't abort them in vitro just because they didn't know and thought their lives no matter how long and short were worthless and a waste because they can't be normal."
I am conservative but I am pro choice. I believe it's wrong to force people to go through something like this. It's not loving. Someone make a go fund me for her to get her the $15k to get it done in Colorado ‚ù§Ô∏è
"""Cool story, bro"" üòê"
I wonder how they voted
"No matter what the reason for an abortion is, it's healthcare that should be universally available to everyone who  has a uterus. All reasons are VALID! Reproductive Healthcare CHOICES should not be regulated by politicians! You're morals and values (most likely based on religious upbringing) have no bearing on another person's healthcare."
"The best thing to do is have the baby, fruit of the love between you and your husband. They wanted a baby and now his imperfections give them cause to doubt their first idea. Their marriage will thrive if they can accept this imperfect child and love him even for the short time he lives. Watch videos on youtube about how to get through this and enjoy the blessing of the child."
If she‚Äôs not an advocate for birth control and is pro-life why is she bitching.  She wasn‚Äôt ‚Äú forced‚Äù she chose to vote for laws that made this her reality.
This poor lady. How is it right to keep someone suffering like this? These new laws have just caused craziness
"No sympathy for this family. They voted for these laws with no compassion, and in the video still made it clear that the only moral abortion is theirs."
"Exactly. I may never choose to terminate personally, but I will never vote against a womens right to choose."
"Why are people in the comments getting so crazed with her statement of ‚Äúpersonally not for it for the way of birth control‚Äù? That‚Äôs a very fair statement, because there are people who don‚Äôt use any kind of birth control and they‚Äôll get an abortion every time, I don‚Äôt believe that abortion should be for that, you should prevent yourself from getting pregnant not get yourself pregnant and get rid of it.

This situation this woman is in isn‚Äôt wanting an abortion because she never wanted to be pregnant, the baby isn‚Äôt going to live, and it‚Äôs got no brain, that‚Äôs a legitimate reason for NEEDING to end a pregnancy.

People are basically saying you can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it too, but that‚Äôs not what she wants, stop looking at ‚Äúaccidental pregnancy‚Äôs‚Äù and a harmful condition as the same thing."
"there‚Äôs a scene in it‚Äôs always sunny in philadelphia where one of the main characters, Mac, dog gets pregnant and the only way the dog would survive is with abortion, for some preface, Mac is hyper religious and pro life, his response to the vet when he said that the puppies would need to be terminated was to go through with the abortion to save the dogs life. A second main character was at the vet with Mac when he made that comment and Charlie said, i thought you were against abortion? Mac replies, Oh, yeah, but this situation effects me. 
In short, people always want to have an opinion until they‚Äôre effected by it."
"Back to the medieval ages, I guess"
So sad the country is crazy cruel and controlling
Abortion is healthcare
"Family planning laws need to ensure that they take into account medical needs for mom and baby. This isn't a black and white issue. Non viable pregnancies should be an exception to restrictive laws. It's already heartbreaking enough knowing a baby won't live to birth or shortly after, to risk the moms life is too much üò¢"
"This is exactly what happens when women try to dictate the terms in which we can abort. Abortion is abortion. You don't get cookies for using it for medical reasons vs. for a lack of readings or financial wherewirhal. 

I'm not happy that she's going through it but the fact that she draws a line of distinction between motivations is hypocrisy. Let that fetus run its' lifeterm, since abortion is wrong. She chose to get pregnant so that's her burden to bare. Smh


*I hope no one was too dense to catch the sarcasm*"
Can't do anything unless her health is in jeopardy?? Imagine the STRESS and anguish she experienced and what health consequences that has...
"This is cruel to both the mother and the child inside her, this should definitely qualify for a legal abortion. 
 TBH the only time I think abortion should be illegal is for those women who just keep on having them, they should be forced to have long effected birth control. And then I of course don‚Äôt believe abortions should occur after 23 weeks, unless! the baby is gravely ill or severely disabled where they would always be dependent of others, medicines etc. Or if the mother is gravely ill where continuing with the pregnancy would kill her.

There are different circumstances that need to be reviews. Abortion should never be a flat out ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù"
This makes me so angry.  Vote blue.  Vote blue.  Vote blue.  This is absolutely inhumane.  OUTRAGEOUS.
Vote blue.
Everyone always has an excuse for killing their baby. Maybe you should just keep your legs closed.
"So sad. Just because these people want to force their religion on you, people have to go through this"
You are not carrying a non-viable pregnancy. You are carrying a child who will most likely not survive. Sounds like you're pro-choice and using your very small case (less than 3 percent)  to justify the majority of cases of abortion.
Nobody is for abortion for birth control stop believing the propaganda
I always say you can't play a victim when you vote for this. Suck it up and deal with it because that's what you thought when voting.
This is still a very rare case in abortions. While most cases are just people who don‚Äôt take responsibility. In cases like these I believe there should be exceptions
This is basically a late miscarriage!!! What the hell is wrong with ppl !
"I feel sorry for them but I have to say I have seen 100s of miracles of babies fully recovered when born. What if that happens for their baby? There is a purpose and a plan for everything. 

When my mom was pregnant with my sister on the ultrasound they saw everything that could possibly be wrong and that she would die too. She came out miraculously healed of every single medical issue they saw. 

I know there is a chance that might not happen for them but there is another chance it can. 

I believe in prayer and miracles. ‚ù§"
"Well if I hadn't been to a women's conference having the wife of the leader of the UpcI and what I heard awful things said that if Governor Abbott doesn't see things our way we remind him while one of us pushes his wheelchair towards the stairwell, so they're you have why there's trouble in Texas. The name is Bernard's"
"the way she said she never would have thought she would have to go through this, as if any woman ever thinks that. like no one wakes up thinking about getting an abortion, its not an exciting thing or some form of birth control. like i hate women like the one here, and personally have no sympathy for whats shes going through"
Well that sucks.  Thanks to everyone too stupid to vote correctly
üò¢ so tragic...can we spot letting Men decide what we do with our Bodies. Please go vote

"3:00-3:14
It's no fun when the rabbit has the gun. Y'all are okay when other women are affected by draconian laws but when it's your turn wanna act confused."
They look like republcans. I think it'd be funny if she died from it.
"It's so crazy, I am pro-abortion for many reasons, this being one of them. Like how does abortion affect these antis? Does it affect you physically? Are you physically hurt by it?? Does if affect you mentally or emotionally?? It's like when those people say if you don't like it, stop watching. If you don't like abortion stop searching it up, watching videos about it, don't hang out or talk to people who have had or are going to have an abortion, if it's on something, and you don't want to see it, turn it off, look away. All babies know is the womb! They don't know anything outside of the womb, they haven't experienced the outside world, parents don't know what they actually look like since it's a black, white, and gray ultrasound, the baby most likely has no idea what their parents look like, so I see nothing wrong.  

I just saw a video about a woman who had killed her 21 day old something baby, on my YouTube recommendations there was a girl who killed her baby and buried it after prom, these crimes were before this Roe v. Wade, but imagine how it will increase after this Roe v. Wade. All because of these people that chose to vote for anti-abortion, not even looking deeper and realizing why it is needed, just wait in 5-10 years, the affects will be known, and yes now it's showing both sides will have to face the affects of this ruling. 

Yes people killing there children was bad before, and it'll still be bad now, most likely with an increase, babies will still be dying you haven't changed much. This time it'll be babies, that are outside they aren't in the womb anymore, it's the real world."
"Leopards ate her face. You voted for this, I hope you're happy."
"Used to be if you were pregnant you were pregnant. No ultrasounds, no abortions. Get what life gives. Only the convenience of said 'preventatives' leaves people in their feelings of being wronged, unjustified. Rights and autonomy, liberals and choices all modern terms to turn something natural into a convention and then steered back to natural through the grief and unrighteousness of it all ü§¶üèΩ

Disclaimer my condolences to this family and others who have gone through traumatic pregnancy experiences."
"Men can still purchase Viagra, condoms and vasectomies."
"Cruel, vicious, barbaric and NOT Christian."
We is a miracle maybe your baby will survive and be ok
I wonder how many people who are against abortion have ever chose euthanasia for a pet animal?
Having an Abortion is MURDER! No matter what noone had the right to disregard a baby an unborn. They have a right to live and yes even if they have health issues they are Human beings not to be disgarded like a piece of garbage.  If you don't want kids then prevent it from happening.
There should be exceptions in the law for cases like this.
"54% of women having abortions used contraception during the month they became pregnant. Women having 2 or more abortion are more than 2x as likely to be 30 or older and, even after controlling for age, almost 2x as likely to already have had a child.... like this woman here.  These women also are more likely to be using ""highly effective"" hormonal birth control (the pill, injections, implants, the ring). The data that the right-wingers use is from abortions peak in the 80s. Since then there has been a steady decline in them. Make fully informed decisions, don't just rely on what a talking head is saying. Turn the tv off for a night and research both sides. That's what patriotism is about, that's how to be a good citizen."
This is a lie.
"Yeah everyone says this is why the couple should only make the decision,umm they knew the risks of having a child there is no guarantee your child will be healthy and normal. It's a life not a car or object when are people going to realise this that you can't just despose/get rid of because you didn't like the order"
If you think this is wrong you should not have kids.
That's cruel to make her carry to term.
She or any woman is welcome to come to Oregon.
I have an idea. Maybe we should just pay women the respect of believing they know what is best for themselves and their families.
Come to Canada
"Honestly it is sad that they had to get to this point in life and have to carry a baby full term under those conditions. However i cannot feel bad because i can only assume they voted yes to pass the anti abortion law and the whole time the information, knowledge, the empathy to see and learn as to why its so important to keep abortions legal, all at the disposal of our mobil phone! In our world in this day and age there are serial rapist, predators, foster homes, and adoption agencies which are full to the brim with kids that are not wanted any more, or parents can‚Äôt afford medical care or food! We see advertisements on the news to adopt children and yet we pass a law to stop more children who are coming into this world only to be given up, removed, raped, or in this instance live to take a breath and then die. Nobody turns their attention to those kids and want to do something about no! Instead we as human beings want to put our noses in somebody else‚Äôs business and think we have a right to pick for them."
My friend has a 6 year old boy with this!!! He wasn't supposed to live past 1yr!!! But GOD!!! AND WHAT HE CAN DO!!!!!‚ô°
"this comment section does not pass the vibe check
have some empathy instead of gloating over this family's suffering"
"So did she have that baby already or not?  I'm confused. 

Also I'd love to adopt if they don't want the baby. Or did the baby not survive?

 I'm just happy mom is alive and healthy, sometimes the moms die too. Just tragic how these things can end up happening to you and you end up losing the woman you love. 

Whoever voted for this should be ashamed and do what they can to reverse this ruling. They should have been able to abort."

"Not only no, but Hell no.  That isn't fair to the mother, dad or baby"
"Women are under attack. I can't believe we've allowed this to happen. You cannot force a woman to carry a fetus she doesn't want to carry - for whatever reason. The woman's say is final and the only one that matters. You cannot legislate sex. You cannot force the bringing of children into the world - we aren't taking proper care of the ones we already have. The notion presented that there are ""lots of adoptive families just waiting"" is a complete lie - and I know that for a fact. There aren't enough adoptive families for the poor babies who will be brought into this world with no one who will take them. Why can't people see that the purpose is to cripple women and  obtain surplus bodies to throw into war, into prisons (that are now profit-driven), to create an even bigger underclass that the upperclass will use for their own purposes. This insane law is already causing and will cause horrible things to happen. This insane law will feed poverty, feed the sex slave industry, create more agony, hunger and death, dysfunction, mental illness - and further destabilize our country - and the world. There are too many people on the planet now - we are outstripping the ability to feed everyone as it is. No woman undergoes an abortion willy-dilly. Abortion is a sad but absolutely necessary part of conscious, civilized existence. If this law is going to continue, just go ahead and put women into chains and be honest about seeing them as property and chattel and nothing more than production cows. Abortion has been legal for 50 years. It became legal for a very good reason that history taught us. Young women who aren't fighting this attack on their very beings, their very lives, are too young to understand why legal, safe abortions became law in the first place. Those who do not understand or heed history are doomed to repeat it. WAKE UP AND VOTE TO STOP THIS INSANITY."
i‚Äôm sorry for her but all she went through and still sounds like she would vote pro-life again. it‚Äôs interesting to hear stories from the woman who want/voted for this.

People Shouldn't Have Sex If they don't want kids and if they get forced to then use a weapon to stop whoever the guy is
"Hmm, maybe stop fucking with womens bodies. It's not your choice or opinion"
It's so fcked up what the government controls in our lives.
"Come on Doctors of America stand and  fight for something, did you sell your souls to religion and the corporations. I know many women doctors  and nurses are trying to stand up ,are they the only ones with the guts. Of course I know  all this doesn‚Äôt affect you men like it does we women. Your oath is, first do no harm, If you don‚Äôt stand up for that, you are not worthy to be called doctors."
Right-wingers believe selfishness if a virtue. They pass these horrific laws supported by awful people who simply don't care about the impact because they don't think it will impact them. These people are despicable
"clickbait, it's not a non-viable pregnancy.  Sometimes the doctors are wrong, like when they said the baby had Down syndrome they are wrong and the baby comes out normal so you just killed someone for no reason.  Killing someone with disabilities isn't fair to them and they are saying the baby might not live beyond 1 year but they don't know."
No man has the right to tell any woman what they can or cannot do with their bodies.  These men are disgusting.
People want to remove birth control and place hardship on women for getting pregnant but ignore the guys who are so eager not to wear a condom because  ‚Äúhis private is too big‚Äù or ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt feel right‚Äù. Or whatever bs these guys come up with.
"Abortion is healthcare. Calling it ""birth control"" indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of why people choose/ should be able to choose to get it."
"Well it's a conudrum. But I personally will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. I'm so sorry.this is beyond stupid. And who is going to care for him for a year if he actually lives? 
I'm a Christian. But I also still have common sense. And I'm a nurse. And I had an abortion lon ago because I am RH negative and I didn't know it and got pregnant and didn't know it. And I was testing negative. But I was pregnant with an Rh positive fetus and i ws having a severe allergic reaction to the fetus. Crazy as that sounds. Any how i had an awful experience. But I am alive."
i dont know a single woman using abortion as birth control. wtaf.
be careful when you vote against your own best interest.

"So called Christians and  other religious types are the most ignorant people when it comes to the human body, the only reason they know where their heart is, is because it beats and they have no clue as to how it works, just that it beats. They are dangerous and are killing  women with their selfish ignorance. Try talking to one about health and the body. You will be talking to dumb and dumber. Women of America we must fight this evil for our freedom just like the brave ladies  of Iran who are being slaughtered by a  government who is trying to keep  them as sex slaves."
This ban is simply about control and harm to women's bodies and minds.

Uggghh the mental health of it all üò¢
Better pick a better governor next time
"I live in Texas and chose to terminate my first pregnancy last year for medical reasons, it was the hardest and most heart breaking experience I‚Äôve ever gone through, and Texas abortion laws add insult to injury. I‚Äôve always been pro choice but I never thought I‚Äôd personally be in a situation where I would have to choose, you truly don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like until you‚Äôre there"
Lord Jesus üò¢
This is what they voted for. Dont cry now.
Atp I feel like this is a lesson in life for them . Hopefully they will gain some sort of empathy for all women including the one their daughter will be .
"Where do they draw the line with this though? If your unborn child was diagnosed to have down syndrome, it‚Äôs just ok to kill it because you don‚Äôt want it to have a disability?  It‚Äôs a slippery slope"
The Democrats love killing babies
"Well...if you didn't have the ultra sound, you would have never known....and trust me She will survive ( iwe have and we have 2) and you will survive if you choose too.  Haveing a child with special needs isn't the end all to your life.  Unless that is what you choose.  Yep, we got what y'all wanted in Texas.  Now roll with your vote."
This is a valid reason to abort a baby. He's gonna be born without brain and that will affect the life of the family. It's better they abort him than they bring him to the world to suffer. Abortion was banned because of woke women who started aborting babies for no reason.
"Voting matters, tired of saying it over and over yet majority voted for this. A man who forces to carry even in cases or rape AND incest. Bunch of weirdos over here for sure."
PRO CHOICE. Miserable disgusting men making poor decisions based on hate.
Phucking kristians and stupid beliefs
"Guys, you vote for the government, so you got now whay you voted for"
"MAGA evangelicals are not prolife, pro child nor pro family. Their one concern is power to force their dogma onto the rest of America."
hahahaha they are pro life hahahahhahaahahah
Easy to solve......move out of Texas!
And this is exactly why abortion should be legal everywhere.
"In America everyone has rights, that is except women."
"""I'm personally not for it being a way of birth control but there are some instances WHERE I DEEM THAT IT IS NECESSARY.."".    I BET SHE ACTIVELY FOUGHT AGAINST ABORTIONS ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è NOW SHE DEEMS IT NECESSARY.  I'M SORRY BUT IT'S TOO LATE TO CRY ABOUT IT NOW OR HAVE THE RULES SPECIFICALLY ALTERED JUST FOR YOU.

"Why didn't she just go to Planned Parenthood, which is government funded ""healthcare for women""?"
Good!!! Maybe she should‚Äôve kept her legs closed!
"Daddy is sad and mad. I am too. This is obscene. Eclampsia is so deadly for her. Women are human beings even in the Bible Belt. The politicians don't believe this is right, they just want some red meat to feed their mad dog base. I watched one of my dearest friends gamble with her life and get eclampsia if we didn't live right near a hospital she would be dead. Privacy means privacy. Women have always died in childbirth but we live in a modern world why torture women? I've never met a person who used abortion as birth control. They use it because of all the circumstances life brings including the economy stupid."
Criminal. They want to wait for herself to suffer medical problems?? üò¢ I cannot. Thanks for bravely telling this personal journey. It really shows the heartbreak quiet desperation. This is shocking medical professionals should sack up. End this tragedy with some medical dignity for them this should be lawsuit precedence they should get something monetary at least in this ordeal. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
I am pro choice. What happens if a person comes up and ask to touch your belly? Do you tell them the baby has died and because of the abortion ban. Judging and you have someone telling you what to do. People should get facts straight people do not have abortions for birth control.
"If you‚Äôre a female still capable of getting pregnant living in Texas, you need to be planning an exit plan.  Otherwise this could very easily be your future, or worse."
This is horrible.The state they live in had no right forcing them to do what they want. The decision should be up to the parents.
The Devil owns Texas

Can someone tell me why she can't travel to a state where abortion is legal?
When are we going to ban viagra? Needs to happen asap
It is still a baby.  I could never purposefully take my baby‚Äôs life.
Anyone else notice the baby boomers lawmakers want America back to the way it was when they were kids?
These lawmakers are a bunch of hypocrites.
I don't agree with abortion at all. But I do believe that there should be special terms apply to certain cases. This is sad!
"That's horrific, it's abuse and torture to the Woman.üò†üò°ü§¨ She could have died!"
If I had to choose a word to describe this- ungrateful. So someone who has been actively trying finally conceives then would rather choose to terminate that living gift because of his imperfections and possible short life span than to appreciate and cherish his life no matter the length and disabilities. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Unacceptable. Our women deserve better
"This crap is so ridiculous. I cannot believe that our government is interfering with our most personal life choices. It is nothing short of barbaric and frightening as hell. 
And don‚Äôt give me your psycho babble bullshit about the Bible or what YOU believe is morally wrong. All that shows is how truly ignorant you are and have no concept of what people deal with in our PERSONAL LIVES."
"This is a horrible thing to go through. However, I hope her hypocrisy is not lost on viewers. She refuses to use the word abortion, calling it a ""procedure"" and goes on to say she doesn't believe it's a suitable method for birth control. Now that she requires an abortion for her own medical emergency she finds validity in its use. She and her husband may also have voted for the very people that contributed to an abortion ban in her home state. I don't feel sympathy or empathy towards her. They are also showing their privilege in being able to travel to different states to seek out expensive abortions. Unfortunately those states also have their own conservative led abortion bans in place. Will we see these two at a pro-choice rally now that they are forced to carry a non-viable fetus to term? Probably not."
"she literally said it shouldn‚Äôt be used as a form of birth control because realistically no it shouldn‚Äôt. she did however say that in medical instances she supports it. she isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfacing the consequences of her own actions‚Äù and you can‚Äôt assume how this woman voted. if you asked me if i 100% support abortion, i‚Äôd say not entirely. BUT i damn sure did not vote for the politicians who took away a woman‚Äôs right to choose. Regardless of my opinions on elective abortion, it‚Äôs still every woman‚Äôs right to make the choice for her body. Stop attacking this woman who‚Äôs going through something traumatic that most of y‚Äôall have never experienced. It‚Äôs sick"
Oh well.
It‚Äôs unfortunate that women used abortion as birth control for children in utero and even partial birth that had no defect forcing states to take such drastic measures to protect children.
"Pro choice is the right of choice freedom of choice, not pro murder, not pro death. It's pro choice. This is a literal restriction onto women only. That alone is an issue!"
Lady you got what you voted for! And personally I hope your baby survives and becomes the biggest burden to you and your husband!!
You can sign paper and have someone taking off life support
"Heartbreaking for anyone wanting a child to suffer a loss of one. With the current law they could have turned a devastating situation into joy for many others. You're in Dallas there is husband and wife that have had two pregnancies with a similar genetic defect. Before the abortion band went in to affect, they still chose to take the baby to term. Because they donated all the viable organs to other babies who needed them. Their first child saved 12 infants lives and improved the quality of life for 30 more. And when they got pregnant again the same thing and they did the same thing. Every year for mother's Day they get so many flowers and cards from not just the people whose kids are alive today because of them, but from all over the city all over the state. I don't know what they did with their child but if they were to have done that? They would have  zero cost in hospital bills."
Sue the state for emotional damage!
So the solution is kill the baby so it doesn‚Äôt die???
There is no danger to her life but she's complaining that she will have a baby that will die young and she wishes she could just kill it right now.
Leave it to government to control women‚Äôs bodies and choices üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº they must be proud of themselves.
"This isn't dangerous for the mother.
 So, unless it is a perfect child you don't want to birth it?
Let's stop being selfish and start caring for children of all abilities.
If it had down syndrome would she be asking the same ?"
Why would you want to murder your baby at 23 weeks anyways and just carry your baby to term and let him or her go the way they are supposed to??
"Vote blue...esp this family living in that wheelchairmonster greg abbott. Someone needs to put him on a hill and gravity do its thing. Texas is a waste of space, they have that possom facedidiot ted cruz. But i live in Florida where our governor is trash too and sadly my state is full of rural uneducated Florida men or boomers from places like the villages, all are a bunch of fox ""news"" watching, homophobic, racist, insurrectionist loving cruel karens. This poor lady. Texas will always be a red state tho. Too many rural bible thumping cowboys who hate immigrants.  No matter how many people die from a failing utility grid...they will still vote slugs like cruz and abbot in. Until we all vote out every single republican that bans books,  bans abortions, make up ridiculous laws to hurt gays and drag queens, and shipping immigrants all over. There are things that can be done on these issues but both side's keep them as hot button issues bc they need votes every cycle.  They dont want us working on term limits and forcing them to stop taking lobbyist pay offs. Its all a distraction. Get mad and vote blue, the lesser of two evils.  At least democrats want weed legalized. Look at what it did for Colorado, California, Nevada. Instead of being a welfare state places like Kentucky could leave coal mining in the past where it belongs, im sick of the dumbasseslike fucker carlson, alex +, mtg, matt gaetz, lauren bobert...all are huge turds with nothing valuable to add to any conversation."
"I Bet they voted against abortion 
But now it affects them, so it's a problem.  Typical."
I will always stand by a woman‚Äôs right to CHOOSE. Keep in mind it‚Äôs mostly MALE governors who banned abortion care in their states. Women should be making these laws.
Time to crack down down dirty government make dirty law
Wow. Way to make her trauma worse. Didn't think losing a baby could get worse but the legal system really just said hold my beer
Terrible occurrence but you can go elsewhere
All of these politicians have gotten out of hand it's time for this all to stop and make a change going forward not backwards
Oh my sorry hun I can't imagine what you are going thru..Praying for you n your family...üò™üíôüôè
Sues the State of TX for assault. This is a crime against humanity.
"From what I am getting from her comment about it not being a form a of birth control, the definitely voted to pass the law and put those in place who passed the law. I am sorry that they are going through this, but not taking time to think about who and what you are voting for and how it could possibly affect your future is insane. I will keep them in my prayer and hopefully the next time this law comes or up the people in place to make the laws are wanting reelection, they think twice about it."
Unds like she voted for this tho....
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with pro-choice. Don‚Äôt let this Godless society tell you otherwise. Have faith. üôèüèΩ
"I think if her health is in danger I can understand it but if not , this STILL IS a life!"
"it breaks my heart to hear parents talking about the children they conceived in such sterile terms. and the word youre looking for is abortion. dont hide from the gruesome reality of what it actually is and what happens to a developing baby. the child is still worthy to be loved no matter how short the life may be. is it difficult? yes. but the value and principle of life is valuable is absolute, not just when it gets hard."
I had s similar situation. I was 20 weeks along. I had perinatal counciling and requested a c-section and thankfully my insurance approved it and I was given a hysterotomy.. My baby was born and she died outside of my womb but she passed humanly and I didn't have to go through the emotional grief of continuing in a pregnancy to full term.
"I feel for them because I have a friend who has gone through 3 miscarriages despite her and her husband really wanting to have children. However, the lack of awareness is stunning. She‚Äôs making judgment calls on people who receive healthcare when she thinks it‚Äôs used as birth control yet she‚Äôs upset that providers are making the same judgment call on her. Not having the choice to receive necessary healthcare is literally what they voted for - it‚Äôs only a problem now that they are personally affected."
She's not forced. She can drive to another state.
"Terribly sad for the family.  Terribly sad about the circumstances. 
 
But this is what happens when you vote for Republicans.  Ted Cruz, Greg Abbott and the rest of the Republicans are responsible for this dilemma.  They decided that women are second class citizens and voted to strip them of the right to make medical decisions about their own body.  They disregard your health, what kinds of impact this will have on your family, and the financial costs that this will entail as well.
Will Ted Cruz be on the hook for the delivery and any complications?  Will Greg Abbott be on the hook for the child's funeral?
Forced-birthing is reproductive slavery made legal.

I'm worried about another thing, since this family went public, will they come home to find a warrant for their arrest for seeking an abortion too?"
"She definitely alluded to being 'pro-life' later on in the video. I have empathy for her awful situation but does she and her ilk honestly believe pro-choice women want to intentionally kill babies? The reality is not all fetuses will become healthy babies and abortion is the only option to save the mother. I hate these selfish assholes who have no compassion until it happens to them.

Yet they'll still vote Republicans because they believe the lie that they're better economically, small government and to 'own the Libs' (democrats are awful as well so any attempts at a what aboutism is moot)"
"1 in a million moms, and million babies saved from death and being cut in pieces in their mother‚Äôs wombs."
Texas the most back assward people in the nation
"Republicans talk nonstop about spending to much money, less government, stay out of people‚Äôs lives and here are the fruits of their labor. 
A family that will suffer with a non viable pregnancy, forced to carry to term.  If this child lives 1 year, the parents will have to apply for Medicaid to keep him alive OR allow nature to take its course thus prolonging this family‚Äôs suffering.  It just doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Stay out of these people‚Äôs lives at their most emotional, important, difficult time in their lives."
"Disgusting pro lifers look what women have to go through bc oh save the babies...yeah how about go adopt children in foster care  and save them!
So sorry for you!!!prayers.."
Love the baby anyway. We adopted a baby with this condition and he only lived for a couple months but in Those months he was loved and cherished and taken cared of. ‚ù§ RIP baby Matt Pat
"If Texas wants to make the decisions for people they should pay the costs of pregnancy and raising the children. Including for mother's that must stay home to take care of those children, medical, food , rent, childcare. If they are the ones who think they need to make the decision for others. And if the mother's life is lost they should pay maybe 5million to the survivor?"
This has gotten so out of control. Supreme court has made this chaos happen.
Texas law does not force women to carry a nonviable fetus. Physician ignorance or fostering an agenda?  Stop the lies and fear mongering.
"Now this baby is gonna die if t does grow and leave the womb or it‚Äôll never become anything and I‚Äôm all for women‚Äôs rights and we should be able to control our own body. But at the same time woman let‚Äôs get smarter. Stop having sex without condoms and thinking birth control is gonna help you. Stop having sex without condoms cause the guy doesn‚Äôt want to wear it or you don‚Äôt want to wear it and look for holes and get the right size if it‚Äôs too big for him the cum will slip down and into you. We shouldn‚Äôt need abortions you should be careful when having sex unprotected and protected! Even if you two have known eachother two years now, no keep that condom on. You didn‚Äôt want any kids but you‚Äôre letting him cum in you come on now! GET SMARTER WOMAN!"
"""'I never thought leopards would eat MY face,' sobs woman who voted for the Leopards Eating People's Faces Party."""
This is so very unfair. Maybe we need to look at men's responsibilities and men birth control. And what about that little blue pill? Can you imagine the outrage if that was taken away? It is despicable that women are treated so inferior. Things would be ALOT different if this were happening to men. They would be screaming like little girls!
This is so STUPID.
Abortions are free in california.
This is not pro life.
Hop on a plane. Goto a safe abortion state. Done.
This is why nobody likes Texas
This is what happens when you vote against women and need the service you voted against. Karma.
May they enjoy their child as long as they can.
"But essentially what they‚Äôre fighting for is birth control‚Ä¶ your either stupid or haven‚Äôt been in the business of politics long enough to realize it. Sad that this wonderful fam went through that, sad that abc took it upon themselves to find this one in a million couple to make an example from  when every 45 minutes a baby dies from abortion without any underlying conditions ‚Ä¶. Good job nation wide media"
She should‚Äôve been more careful that‚Äôs on her..or no sex if you don‚Äôt want kids..
Sad you continue to vote for those that place these laws.
"If the human body will expell the fetus safely in it's own...then there is no need to interfere. If abortions are not necessary to preserve life, then they should not be utilized. Condolences to this family. However, these scenarios will not be used to justify abortionsüòí"
"Yes, instead of injecting euthanasia drugs into the baby's heart (which has been banned for being too inhumane for dogs and cats in most states) and then tear the baby limb from limb, Texas said to allow the baby to pass naturally on hospice with love and care. Pro aborts are truly the sickest people on the planet."
I like how she still can‚Äôt empathize with other women‚Äôs situations when she says she‚Äôs not for it being used a form of birth control. Abortion for me but not for thee.
"This is why sometimes abortion is needed unfortunately. Nature is not perfect, alot can go wrong and sometimes it is sever. Like for example, any years ago a good friend was expecting her first, she wanted the child and was overjoyed. Kept healthy, did everything right for her pregnancy. But, in the second trimester, an ultrasound showed that some of the baby's internal organs where developing outside the body. Heart, lungs, and some of the GI track. The baby was alive but there was very little chance of the child survival when born. She had to make the heartbreaking decision of getting an abortion in the best decision for her baby. There was no ryme nor reason for the cause of the sever deformity from what her doctor told her, simple explanation was these things happen. Things can go wrong unfortunately. Nature is not perfect and can be cruel as we all know. It was no one's fault nor no one to blame. It just these things happen and it is what it is. Yea medical technology had came a long way especially with reproductive medicine but, there is a limit."
So the baby is suffering just because she can't do anything about it. The law is letting this innocent suffer until it's born üò©
Go to Jesus and ask him to heal your child as God to make the child whole and healthy. Stop thinking to terminate only God knows the future. Pray üôèüïäüçºto save the child. God can change anything even this.
"I cannot believe America's lows don't comply with basic human rights established a century ago. This is insane!!! 
The more restricting the lows and the society norms towards women, the fewer babies are born. How long is it going to take to learn this lesson?"
"The Republican Party sure is committing A LOT evil in the name of Jesus. Religious extremists always do. Not only do you have worry about things like this now, but if your baby survives you have to worry about what if they turn out to be Gay or Trans, republicans are writing laws that could have them taken away by the state, placed in to foster care and you charged with child abuse. Republicans are writing laws about how they can and can‚Äôt dress. If a man dresses to feminine in Tennessee it‚Äôs a crime now. Vote Blue and Save Freedom and Democracy."
"Thumbs down for 15 second ads!  Why?  You could do 1, 5 second ad!"
Abortion is genocide.
This is such a lie. Complete and total propaganda. Just like Roe v Wade was. But what else can you expect from ABC.
"Abortion is the voluntary termination of a healthy viable fetus, & should absolutely be illegal. She didn't need an abortion, she needed medical intervention to terminate a nonviable pregnancy. 

It's pretty simple."
"Death unfortunately occurs either way. It is devastating for the family, specifically the mother, to have to go through this. I'm so sorry. I hope this baby lives a beautiful life however long he is alive and brings joy that surpasses this great pain. Nobody should have to lose their child whether it be in utero or after birth. It's not fair."
THIS IS SO DISGUSTING AND SAD
"""Blessed be the fruit"" - republicans"
Leave it to God maybe the baby will be OK
And some wonder why many people don't take churches seriously anymore.
"2:54 ""I'm personally not for [abortion] being used as a birth control but there are certain instances where I deem it as necessary""  SO YOU ARE PRO CHOICE.  No one is pro-abortion we are pro letting people make their own MEDICAL decisions. Also - where YOU deem as necessary? Will every woman need to run their abortion by you to determine if their reasoning matches YOUR moral compass?

""Never would I imagine we'd be going through this"" - Conservatives love making rules for other people and have no concept of empathy until the rules apply to them and suddenly they demand an exception"
The fact that you people don't get this this is nature we should not be interfering with nature anyway look at our world because we've interfere with nature I feel really bad for those couple I do but let's get real about this this s*** happens people get pregnant in their babies come out f*****-up it's nature god just nature's basic nature fit kalmanovich ever Phoenix chicken come out weird he's not up to us to decide which one of these creatures come out of whatever Grayson is worthy of life or not or chance are you serious
"The only comment I‚Äôll make is that I hope her OB counsels on folic acid and its role in prevention of neural tube defects. Not saying she was ever deficient, or that lack of folate was the cause. I‚Äôm just saying she needs to be on it, now, during childbearing years, and continue it, religiously, during any future pregnancy. She also, ideally, should let her body recover from this trauma before trying again. This is not only physically taxing, for her, but the emotional trauma affects both of them. 
My cousin‚Äôs baby girl lived for about 2 hours with what used to be called ‚Äúwater head‚Äù.  Not a nice way to say it, but that‚Äôs how many understand what it is. She had no skull, only a fluid capsule with her brain inside.
The doctors immediately put her on a strict daily dose of 800mcg of Folic Acid, and she went on to have a strong, healthy little boy, who is now a US Marine!"
She's no victim. Don't want kids close your legs. Be a responsible adult. Not a baby killer. S/O Texas.
"U people r sick, stop killing children"
What about is abortion wasn't an option because back-in-the-day didn't have that option today major planet your baby was supposed to be born no matter what maybe that isn't your choice maybe that's God's choice and you're wrong in this you really are you're trying to tell me you're f****** addicted to something because you couldn't kill your baby are you serious right now stop it sometimes babies are born again we don't get to just kill whatever it is if we don't feel comfortable with you understand that get real

"The year is 2023 and a young country like South Africa üáøüá¶ which was democratic only in 1994 has more laws that protect women (abortion) and the LGBTQI+, compared to a country like America which has been democratic for more than 100 years, that is scary.

I just stumbled upon this post and I am feeling really sad for Kylie, I believe that a country is not democratic if it is abusing women, especially in this way. The fact that young countries are progressing in making sure that they properly protect all its citizens and America is heading backwards is sad."
"america must wake up see the problems, in my opinions there will be depressions from the mothers and possible suicide rates going up which i fear, bring abortion back!"

"Isn't there a point where it's nonger considered an abortion? Like if there is a known health risk to mother, baby or both... when is it considered MEDICAL? For the sake of YOUR LIFE?!"
Watch... it will come to a point that women won't be allowed to have ultrasounds so that non of these health concerns are found until to late... so sad to see...

So she was pro life until she needed an abortion....üôÑ
"In the beginning abortion was intended for such circumstances.  Then they wanted more, to the point that the child is fully developed, and started using it like birth control.

My former girlfriend and her daughter are anti-abortion and yet they firmly believe it's necessary on occasions like this. They're against abortion yet they are far more rational than the religiously conservative lawmakers who are dragging this country into another dark age.
"Absolutely disgusting having no say over your own body .  Allowing more suffering than needed . The mother and baby were both at more at risk, continuing. Ridiculous"
In yet the no abortion law was passed
"Add another $10,000 on top of that because someone just filed for the bounty on you going out of state for an abortion üá®üá±üí∞ü§†üí∞üá∫üá∏"
Anyone that votes republican is one of two types of people that might hop back and forth personalities. 1: Votes to make money 2: have no idea what they want or talk about. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs sad that they still will bite the same way the next election cycle.
"But she is alive to tell about this so it did not threaten her life to have a baby in this condition which normally would produce a stillborn. What is the difference between an abortion and a stillborn? She just wanted control over the extraction?  It actually may have been better for her health to see all the hormones through such as progesterone, estrogen, and prolactin to encourage easier recovery from the loss. . . The body needs those hormones to balance and promote healing after a pregnancy.  This isn't burger king where you can order what you want without considering the repercussions, are they saying that they know more than medical professionals or that abortion should be like a product and they can have it whenever they want for a reason they are more worried about than professional medical providers? People need to learn their anxiety does not equal medical knowledge and just because they are consumers of medical care does not make the whole industry of medicine like a store where idiots can dictate their medical care without exhibiting medical need.  They definitely should move out of Texas though, there are plenty of states that align with their expectations."
You blame the women who kill babies for fun .
What a sham American ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù is when women have to endure these kinds of laws. There are no words.
"It doesn‚Äôt affect you until it enters your life. Easy to vote for consequences, but often harder to live with them."
"We need people like them to put their vote where their best interest is.
I am currently living in TX. I can't wait to get the fvck out."
This is just so wrong sending prayers for this family üôè
One of those things people don't care about until it happens to them. Smh.
Should be a campaign ad for voting red
"pro life? nah its pro-fit. abortions would cost them money they would make from medical bills, cost of raising unwanted children, cost of funerals for dead mothers forced to carry dangerous pregnancies. every unwanted baby born is just another number in the game of profit and senseless greed. all the religion and pro life bs is a facade."
Absolutely horrible this lady had to endure this!!! Makes me SO MAD üò°
Well this is what you guys voted for to have republican leaders that have a God complex and believe that they are right and nothing else matters
They need to bring back roe vs wade.
One less....
"oh america, what a disgusting fuckhole"
No one uses abortion as birth control. I'm pretty annoyed that a woman who has had to suffer only NOW understands that abortion is healthcare and doesn't belong in the hands of legislators.
"Well I guess it‚Äôs what Jesus would want, and no one is more in tune with what Jesus would do than the entire GOPüòèüòè"
This is why if you're against abortion 'you' should not have an abortion. Everyone else should be allowed to for whatever reason.
This is why we are a secular nation by design. Religious rule is evil.
"It is not only inhumane it is also absolute madness.  I would love to have been born in a State like Texas for so many reasons.  
But these abortion bans are going to cause so many problems for women!"
Wheres the gofundme for this lady!? This is a nightmare!!!!!!
"I'm sorry this is happening to her but did her vote put her in this spot? 
People need to stop saying or implying that women have used abortion as their birth control method.
STOP REPEATING THAT LIE."
"If she's against abortion, did she celebrate the overturning of Roe Vs. Wade? If she did, suck it up buttercup, this is what you asked for."
"This is a tough situation. Brave of them to share this. I feel for this couple, especially the woman. At the same, ‚Äúnonviable‚Äù seems inaccurate because the baby can carry to term and be born, it‚Äôs that the baby has a terminal diagnosis."
what the world
What would you do IF we didn't have ultrasound technology?  Be thankful for your son and the short time you will get to spend with him. He is part of your life journey.
The doctor said most of these children dont live passed a year. Why wouldn't anyone want to be able to spend as much or little time as they possibly could with their child letting it know how much they were loved instead of just killing them because they couldn't handle having such a small amount of time with? Abortion is cruel and selfish and most of all... murder. And i dont care who gets mad or what they say. I have a right to my beliefs just like everyone else does.
So sad! The pain this couple has to endure. Abortion is a human right.
This is what happens when one doesn‚Äôt think in principles.  Banning or creating absurd restrictions on abortion creates situations like this.  No one ever thinks it can happen to them.  What if she develops sepsis?  This is why I changed my mind about moving to Texas.
My condolences to the family. But lets remember we have  great Doctors out there who can help.
"This is why abortions should really only be used in cases of rape, incest; and emergency health complications with the mother and baby."
So they voted pro-life because they wanted control over OTHER women‚Äôs‚Äô bodies and never expected it to actually have an affect on them. Sounds like karma to me.
"Realistically if someone did actually try using it for birth control EVERY time they got pregnant, it'd probably be very stressful for the body. I don't get how some people legit believe women using it as just straight up birth control."
give women power over their body the science is there the preventability is there let them make a choice
üò≥
"What a world we live in! Now they can't differentiate between NECESSARY and  ""convenience""?  Shame on the elites. They WILL be judged one day. And I look forward to that day! As malformities that should NEVER exist, like 1 in 40 children born with Autism climb from 1 in 10,000 - 30 years ago, to 1 in 2 children being born with autism in as little as 5 years -(THEIR claim, not mine), because of the toxic levels of chemicles in our food and world; because of ALLOWING this...NOW they decide to let a BRAINLESSS child be carried to full term! It's JUST LIKE THEM!!! This is an atrocitie!! I'm so sorry for this family. I pray they are rest assured that their child WILL be in Heaven, and one day they WILL get to be with them, in all the beauty and perfection and wholeness that God created that baby with, had our FDA and EPA not been corrupted! Prayers sent for this family. ‚ù§ I am so very very sorry you have to go through this. üôè‚ù§üôè"
"I don‚Äôt get how texas prides themselves on freedom, yet their laws for women are stuck in the past.. youre not free until it applies to us all."
"3 years later : mother forced to sell her body due to republicans fighting against a livable minimum wage and government programs 
republicans : not our problem...our motto is ""from conception till birth"". after that, youre on your own, honey"
Truly appalling. All the states enforcing this should be responsible for all medical bills and therapy as a result.
"That is a 2 heart breaking events in one,one is nature that is heart breaking for them enough, the other one is because the religious dumb F asses in TX!"
"This law is wrong. So wild that it is one. Look at us, all people everywhere. There are too many. Then a family like this is being torn up over some old man's idea about making money and making babies"
"This is horrible, I'm wishing your family well."
What third world country do they live in?
The sad thing though about Texas is they have crappy insurance when it also comes to child birthing as well. Pro-life with crappy insurance.
So cool that the government is getting involved in womens health decisions üòä
"GOOD ,  NOW STP BEING RELIGIOIUS  OR ATLEAST FORCING IN TO OTHERS , SINCE WHEN  AN UBORN BABIES LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MOMS LMAO EVEN IF IT WAS ALREADY A BABY AND NOT A FETUS  THATS CRAZY"
"I hold the same beliefs as this woman. Although I do not consider this procedure to be a replacement for birth control, it should be available in medical situations such as this or other serious issues. Not to mention rape, incest, minors, or medical conditions for the woman that may not fall under the purview of this law. It's insane that this family will be forced to go through this entire pregnancy, only for the baby to not make it long. The additional pain this family is experiencing has only begun, and it's heartbreaking."
"BTW, so few women use abortion as birth control. It's ridiculous to punish EVERYONE when CLEARLY there are good reasons for taking that step in the vast majority of cases."
It‚Äôs always different when it happens TO YOU
The insanity going on in the US is off the chain!!! So a woman could die from disease due to a decaying fetus but that's ok?????? In FL a bill is up that young girls cannot even TALK about periods???? What the hell is going on? Please vote!!!! Get these zelots out and let a woman and her Dr make that medical choice! Not the gov or church!!!
Mistake #1 living in Texas ü§Æ
Conservatives are a menace to society
Blessed be the fruit.
"These Republicans are not thinking of the grief of the parents, or the death or dismemberment of the mother, and how that affects her living children or partner or extended family and friends... it really looks as if they want to just punish women for having female reproductive systems. We also live in a cruel, misogynistic state now, and I hope my daughter is able to move to a safe country one day. Many can't."
Gratitude and respect to this couple for their courage to share their story. I support you and thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm so deeply sorry you have to go through this.
It honestly wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if these very same people voted for the lawmakers to get into office.
"the irony of her situation, yikes"
Absolutely ridiculous come on America we can do better! üò¢
The state of texas should have to pay all expenses for that kid up until it's 18th b-day
Unbelievable nonsense!!!!
"please vote. ALL women deserve so much better and the right to choose for our own bodies, it does not belong in the hands of antiquated beliefs."
This is bullshit. They try to find  a person to fit their agenda and then they try to do a media Blitze. This is not what Texas needs to be broadcasting. What they need to be broadcasting is the border issues and the 100 thousand plus people dead last year because of it. Where are they on the 100 thousand lives they caused to be poisoned. Answer that and then we will think about other things.
This is what happens when crusty old men run the country üòÇ
They got what they voted for
Hearing them both speak on this is heartbreaking
"So whose life are they protecting now? This people who decide how everyone should choose are ridiculous, ignorant. This should be an exception."
Texas and the u.s have regressed to the stone age and it is beyond shameful and against womens rights and health
"Oh, sorry you can't murder your special needs baby ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Also, non-viable with what? Sounds more like inconvenient than non viable"
So this is what happens when crusty old men run the country lolüòÇ
"When the government starts micromanagement of Healthcare decisions, it never goes well. Talk about extreme restrictions of freedom and dictatorship type behaviors. Telling women they MUST carry unviable fetuses to full term and risk their lives to deliver a baby much larger than necessary who has 0 chance at survival. Sick, evil, wicked politicians. Pretending they're a party of freedom while committing human rights atrocities against the American people like this."
"She got what she voted for. Dont see the problem here. Ohh.. she wants access to abortions, just not other women???"
"I was just looking at the background the whole time. Like damn, that's a big fan. As soon as she hit us with how she believes, I have no empathy for them. Separate church from state and whatever ""beliefs"" you have."
This is why people are mad at all the ignorance surrounding this issue. Abortions are not just for people who don't want to be pregnant. #themoreyouknow
We have traveled back in time to a very dark place. üò•üò•üò•ü•µü•µüò¨
I feel bad for them. üôè
‚ÄúNot a form of birth control?‚Äù So what? It sucks because it‚Äôs you? You either support the right to choose or you don‚Äôt.
I'm very sorry for these parents. I can't imagine what they must be dealing with.
"Texas is all in on treason and religious/domestic terrorism, just like all MAGA traitors."
ABORTION IS KILLING YOUR BABY! POINT BLANK.
"Voter of the ""Leopard eating faces"" party complains that Leopard started eating their face"
Why can‚Äôt she travel out of Texas for an abortion???
Horrible situation. We need to change the people in supreme court
Aww
But we keep electing the same governor. How do we expect things to get better if we don't vote him out?
She's terrified because he baby is going to be born without a proper brain? No I'm seriously asking because I was looking for the health reason that puts her life in danger. All I'm hearing is they don't want to have a handicap child; right or am I missing something?
Hate to say it but they probably voted right..
When will these women learn to keep their legs closed she better not get an abortionüò°
And what is scary.. These politicians take care of themselves in these situations. It's never been about babies. It's a political flex.
USA- this is NOT the freedom you boast about.
I bet if it were a lawmaker‚Äôs wife it would be diffeeent.
There are not words in my vocabulary to describe the vile emotions I have for these evil monstrous anti-abortionists.
Let God handle it
"Well , this is really sad and they are doing everything I would have done.  However , it was clear that voted republican and she said never in a million years did she think this would happen to her and she is against using abortion as a birth control.   You voted for this ; we tried to warn you.  This is what happens when you vote against your own interests. Anyway , we are all in the same boat now.  Saddle up cupcake because this is a going to be a bumpy  ride."
No one cares when it was the black woman in NO recently but maybe this white woman will bring more awareness üòî
Going to New Mexico for an abortion is crazy scary. I get it I'm glad she said about not using it for birth control.
This is what happens when a conservative Supreme Court changes laws that are not broken. This woman passed judgment in this interview that she only agreed in this procedure  for her circumstances. That is why she is in this predicament because her lawmakers banned all procedures for all circumstances.
"She is so stupid for going on cameraüôÑüòí,  It's so pathetic our people are so desperate for attention and social media fame. She could have easily just went to another state and got it done, but now the whole world know she's pregnant. Stupid"
We all know the state will not be providing $$ for 24 hr care to take care of the child either.
Bullshit bunch of democrats bs
Just because a doctor says one thing doesn't mean that it will end up that way. My son has a heart condition he should have died from. Yet here he is. Should I have killed my baby just because of his heart condition.
If you want to put out your agenda about abortion maybe the law is not it!  It's so sad yall gonna see a lot of dead baby's in the trash dumpsters because of this law
Merica is such a sick country
I would be so pissed if I had to have a kid I didn‚Äôt want. Especially if it had developmental issues
I can tell by how she described a couple of things that they are pro life. This is exactly what they voted for. They are only pro choice when it needs to benefit them.
"She said ‚Äúthere are certain instances where I deem (abortions) are necessary‚Äù Thats the thing, it‚Äôs not up for YOU to deem. Every single women should make that decision for themselves. It should not be based on what someone else think they should do with their bodies. This is why that ban is so dangerous. Ppl who probably would consider themselves ‚Äúpro life‚Äù are now realizing that this ban could and will negatively affect them and the woman they love."
Give your baby up for adoption. Someone will love him until he passes away.
"Because ""Pro-Life"" craziness has overcome any logic or science. ü•º"
The law is only for the corrupt and to help only the Irish and government!  F the people!
"poor guy, he's taking it a lot harder than his wife. it's different when you're the one going through it than when your loved one is and you're powerless to help them"
I 100% guarantee she helped vote the idiots into office that did this to her. Let's keep it real its white folks that keep voting in evil so don't cry now.
üò¢This is heartbreaking
Texas is so toxic.  I'm surprised that state doesn't implode!
"My niece  had her baby  full term, this beautiful  baby  was born  still born who had the same problem. 
     She was happy she carried  her baby ,knowing  what is happening. 
The child will die, why won't people  let them  do it naturally,  not yanking them piece by piece out of womb.
    What more is more  loving?"
"Conservative Texans: Abortion is murder it should be completely illegal 

Also conservative Texans: oh look another school shooting in our stats let‚Äôs see how good this one was, OH AWESOME 21 people died and 19 of them were kids let‚Äôs go bruh I love this entertainment."
thanks a lot Trump üò†
Give him a fighting chance‚Ä¶so he lives only a year‚Ä¶you let him live!!! You gave him life for a little while! So torture him in the womb?!! Because he‚Äôs gonna be inconvenient to you for maybe a year? I just don‚Äôt understand üò¢
"Isn‚Äôt the point of choice is to use your own discretion on if it‚Äôs ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù to you and the life you want to live? ü´†ü´† 
OBVIOUSLY there are women who will abuse this system and use it as a form of birth control. But you better believe I would prefer that over a woman who is either too lazy, not financially capable or not educated enough to use birth control, to one day have the child due to an abortion ban who will abuse the child she did not want in the first place. We have so many children who are born into families that do not want them, who are being tortured and killed as is. Why make that a potentially bigger number because abortion doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù in your own life. Narcissism at its finest. Not everyone has the life you do. Why choice is important!"
This is definitely a human and civil rights violation!
#1 GO TO ANOTHER STATE #2 DONE AND DONE
The Catholic Church pushed this agenda.
You can go to another state that allows abortion.  There are options.
Stupid republicans doings !
This is why we need to think critically before we take drastic steps without thoughts about the consequences‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
This is so cruel. I'm sorry they had to go through this
Gods will be done . üôèüèª
"nevermind the 2 trail derailments, the nuclear leak and us being on the brink of a world war 3"
Sounds like their position and votes have come back to bite them.   Bet they thought lack of female bodily autonomy would never be an issue for  THEM.
"This is no longer a free country for women!! These laws aren't about the right to life they are all about controlling women and trying to put us "" back in our place"" like in the Andy Griffith days. It is disgusting how far we have fallen in this nation and how Republicans are constantly stripping away our freedoms to force everyone to fit in their cookie cutter box!!!!"
"That is so horrible
Caster oil and certain roots are going to be making a huge come back"
Have faith in Gods will. üôè
"If your wife sleeps with another man will you keep the God giving Child? If your husband impregnated your best friend should he keep the God giving Child? Abortion is murder remember that. You people are Fornicators yet tell LGBT people to live celibate lives because the Lord dislikes it, yet you same people sleep around with your friends from college and high school. Gay people cannot kiss and hold hands because it is immoral yet the pastors daughters have abortions in secret to preserve that good reputation. You people vote to ban gay marriage yet you sleep around committing adultery. People are anti gay yet find ways to justify abortion. ""I don't want my boy to see 2 grown men kissing"", yet she has had 2 abortions lol."
"My heart aches for this family. I was reading about this condition just the other day: a mom expecting IVF twins. She didn't have a selective termination because of the risk to the healthy baby and because she was led to believe the affected child would die... He lived 8 months, never left hospital, and experienced a tremendous amount of pain. Abortion is healthcare."
"So is she going to have to carry full term, and give vaginal birth / or c section to a already dead baby? Thats disgusting."
"This is the problem with conservative people. They get fed through Fox fake news that people use abortions as birth control. Too bad that for small-minded people, it takes an issue like abortions to hit you directly to inform yourself and look outside the box. Tge world is not just black or white."
When passing laws I feel they should add in special circumstances like these
Republicans are traitors
"This is a horrible situation. Texas is wrong for banning abortion. And it's also wrong to abort after the 20th week. First trimester abortion is necessary for population control of unwanted babies. These abortions have been banned because the system supports human trafficking, child pornography, etc. The system needs unwanted children to exist so that they can be abused in this way. Abortion should not be an option because a privileged couple's wanted pregnancy didn't result in a healthy child. It's extremely sad but this couple wants this child, probably planned the pregnancy. This child won't survive beyond his first year and that's heartbreaking. But this child will never be subjected to child porn or trafficking. Abortion should not be an option because it's inconvenient for the couple to care for their unhealthy child."
ABORTION IS HEALTHCARE!
Just travel out of the state. Sucks it‚Äôs our reality but my wife and I just had a similar situation. We live in Texas and got the help we needed in New Mexico.
What does the Bible say about abortion!
Thats wrong
Anti abortion laws are inhumane.  It‚Äôs heartbreaking to (still) be fighting for basic human rights for women‚Äôs healthcare - but we will keep fighting to make things right. üí™ I‚Äôm so sorry for all the women affected by the current backwardness of the legal system. I hope they all get compensation for their inhumane treatments.
"My cousin in Europe was told that her baby boy with the same condition when he was born would live for 20 mins. 
They tried to convince her to abort, she did not want to.  So she carried through with the pregnancy till full term, 
delivered him and he passed away at exactly the time they told her he would.  She goes to visit him daily for years, 
it was her son and she did not choose to abort.  I feel for you that the laws have changed but i understand that 
he still is a human being with a brain and i pray that God gives you the strength to endure this.  I wish you nothing 
but the best outcome possible."
Pro Choice is not pro abortion.  It is pro - patients make their own medical decisions.  It is your choice not the government's choice.  Vote BLUE for YOU.
"It‚Äôs your body, but your governments choice‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ sad world we live in‚Ä¶.."
"Texas. ""Ain't no fun when the rabbit got the  gun"" is the saying about reversal of circumstances. I do pray she survives this ordeal and teaches her daughter about why women should *ALWAYS* vote to have reproductive control of their own bodies."
"""I can't believe the leopards ate *my* face!"" cries woman who voted for the Leopards Eating Faces party"
"Now this is cruel! I normally do not stand by abortion but in instances like this, I would. How cruel. I feel for these parents."
I hope she donates the organs so another baby can live...üôèü•∞üôè
I‚Äôm pretty sure they are republicans so this is what they deserve
The pro-life party doesn't give a flying flip if women die. So much for pro-life. They're all a bunch of lying hypocrites.
"Then don't use it as birth control and mind your business. Remember, NO WOMAN EVER WANTS TO GET AN ABORTION. They are not fun or easy. Everyone that gets one HAS to for whatever reason that is not our business. I cannot freaking believe we are having this stupid debate AGAIN. Federalist Society SCOTUS decision will cause women to die. It will not be different than 1971. They only prevent SAFE abortions with these laws and this will not be the first woman forced to carry a dead fetus around for months and worse for these draconian religious zealots. 
Religious people need to REMOVE themselves from other people's bedrooms and reproductive organs. JFC.... like really, what is WRONG with y'all? Don't give me some saving lives line of crap. Women are alive and you don't care about them. Universal healthcare saves lives, why not back that?"
"Not all pregnancies are viable,  which is why abortion is healthcare.  Caring a miscarriage can lead to sepsis. This pregnancy was wanted. Republican elected officials have gone way to far. It's not a clear cut case of yes or no. It's a maybe."
"And if you voted republican at all, that‚Äôs what you voted for.  I know better.  My body is mine, not yours and I have the right to choose what‚Äôs best for me.  Not you.  So, if you voted for republican, that‚Äôs what you voted for.  Sad, isn‚Äôt it."
"Wow, the people wishing ill on this woman are just as cruel as the people who voted for abortion to be illegal. If she did vote for that, then hopefully she‚Äôll change after her experience. Sometimes, that‚Äôs what It takes for some people. THAT‚Äôs what you wish on others‚Äînot harm."
Wow-just Wow üò¢
Texas and Florida: Draconian Laws against Women
"If you feel bad, remember these people probably voted for Trump, and probably vote Republican"
She could easily drive to another state and get it done.  So she doesn't really care.
This is what happens when you have extremists.. One side wants abortion as birth  control and the other side won't allow it when necessary.
Self righteous Republicans to blame for all these problems
"No pity whatsoever!!!!! You were ignorant and naive enough to vote and support abortion bans THINKING that it was mostly people using it as birth control ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Statistically abortions are more common with miscarriages than used as birth control. Now that you see how detrimental the ban truly is, you want sympathy. Fck no!!! This is what happens when people let their emotions dictate their beliefs and choices. Pro choice isnt pro abortion. Pro choice means i dont know what is going on in your life, but you have the right to choose whats best for you. Yall made your bed, now lay in it. Conservatives need to learn to worry more about themselves and less about everyone else. I said it before and ill it again.... the abortion ban is only the start of unnecessary control and the start of us reverting back a couple hundred years. Look at Florida, perfect example. And Texas seems to keep following in their footsteps. Have fun with that."
"Then you have these people that want to tell you how to live your life and when the tables get turned and they have to follow their own rules they call it unfair, unjust and they don‚Äôt want to follow their own laws."
Most not all. Only God knows. Doctors only predict.
"I believe that in some cases, such as theirs is a compassionate option. For both mother and baby."
Texas is so gross. The other Ohio.
It's sick to make a woman try and live a part of her life knowing there is a dead child inside her and having to still give birth
Guess what y‚Äôall.  She is not in control.  God is.    If I can carry a sick child so can she !!!!!   Mine died in utero also !!!!! I ddnt kill my child because they we‚Äôre sick !!!!!   Still pro life !!!!! When Evil is called good in this world. That‚Äôs when you know the world is mad!!!!
This is what happens when you vote for guns over people. Abbott rules Texas.
What a nightmare for this woman.
No one uses it as birth control. This is god showing you that
Sounds like this is the outcome she voted for. Welcome to the consequences of your own actions.
"They passed this law because of God. 
Also God: Now watch me make a baby without a brain."
Is this what the Texas govt wants?
"‚ÄúNot fair for her or other women‚Äù üòë. You don‚Äôt say. Now here it is they‚Äôre trying to travel from state to state for help for their situation. Why not get the help in the state in which you live? Oh that‚Äôs right, how you vote took that choice away."
Who did they vote for???
Pops has some pretty bad rosacea
"This is why we need separation of church and state, even in a cowardly state like Texas."
Where's the land of freedom and choices pushed by the repubs?
"God gives us free will in every area of our life and lets us make choices, but somehow these unborn fetuses are more precious than anything else He‚Äôs ever created and better not be touched, and the women He chose as the vessels for them do not have a say in anything regarding their pregnancy and they are the worst sinners on earth (but not as bad as those gay people) if they dare make a choice that harms that fetus, even if it mean protecting her life. By the way, if you wanna own a gun and kill somebody, that‚Äôs alright. 

Conservative Christian thinking be crazy."
I felt sorry for her but this should be a lesson to all of you Trump supporters who try to take away women's rights when it happens to you now you understand your thought process was wrong
"Since Texas took control of the outcome of the pregnancy (forced her to carry it to term until delivery), then the state must shoulder the financial burden of all medical procedures related to pregnancy."
"Republicans, listen tf up!!"
This woman and her husband should be the ONLY people who makes the decision what to do in this situation.  What is wrong with people!
VOTE VOTE VOTE
Not an advocate for birth control she says.... this show people only care about certain things only when something happens to them or effect them. I had a lot of sympathy at the start but lost a little after she said that. Now she knows the pain other women are going through
"Don't have sex. 
Thats how easy it is."
"I'm not advocating abortion but all in all, this should be a women's personal choice."
This is what they voted for. This is what they get.
The party of family values folks!
"I feel for them, but as you've heard from her at "" 2:52 "" she is clearly regurgitating one of those pro-life reasons for being anti arbotion. That abortion is being used by people as a form of birth control willy-nilly. She clearly is anti abortion before all this happened to her. She for sure is one of the people who celerated the overturning of Roe. Now she sees the effect of the abortion ban first hand. All fun and games until it personally affects you. I hope she gets her abortion. I hope she fights for that right now moving forward."
Just awful‚Ä¶ prayers for this family!
"unfortunately, the people who are affected by this is quite small so the politicians wouldn't careless. This happen because people believe in the bible."
"Firstly, I am sorry that you are having to go through this. But as a liberal Texan, this is what happens when you vote with no compassion. You made your views known in the video, and now that this is happening to YOU, you're shocked. I swear, the pro-life people are the absolute LEAST compassionate people I know. No grasp on reality or personal decision making within the boundaries or established society."
So she force to carry a baby that‚Äôs doomed to die ‚Ä¶.. well she wanted this
Not the babies fault. Doctors always say there‚Äôs 1% of living. But that 1% can be a miracle baby.
"THAT IS FK DISGUSTING,  WE WILL NOT LET THEM RUIN WOMEN LIFE LIKE THAT , THESE ARE MONSTER , a fk trauma"
So grateful for these brave parents speaking out. My story 24 years ago. It takes past 20 weeks to figure everything out ! üò≠ I had to travel to another state. Please America come to your senses üôèüèº
"That is what religion does to society. The american talibans will force others to hurt in the name of ""christianity""."
How traumatic added to a already stressful and traumatising time
They got what they voted for.
They should sue the State of Texas for mental stress & damages due to her having to give birth to an unviable pregnancy. It's not ok. She should have full medical care & that does include aborting a fetus. Especially that the fetus is unviable. It's  ultimately her decision to make not the State of Texas & not anyone else's decision. No their body or life not their choice.
Awful.
Creepy conservatives asserting themselves in your life never ends well
Texas is sick
People so worried about abortions ....I wouldn't even have a kid in this society in the first place...they have nothing to aspire to anymore ....what to pay more have less credentials are meaningless work experience is irrelevant it's just social economic hierarchy based on things that have zero tangible value truly embarrassing world we have created
