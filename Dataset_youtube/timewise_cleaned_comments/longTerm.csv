"Notwitstanding the evisceration of Roe v. Wade by the reactionary justices on the Supreme-(ly Political Court of the United States, these militant anti-choicers will stop at absolutely nothing until they finally succeed in enshrining the patently odious concept of 'fetal personhood' throughout the American polticial landscape. Should this extraordinarily unfortuante scenario ever become reality, then the United States will definitely cease to be 'the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave.'"
"As an almost 30 year old, I feel bad for all the teens and 19 - 24 year olds that are living with family still (then finally have a kid) and additionally I know the millennials still failing today so people need to shut up. The culture is kind of shit that is all."
Guys use birth control n condom. No need to birth 4 religion n politics
close your legs drunken floozy
why are democrats so stupid
death is death
normal mothers defend their cubs
why do human women want to kill their own? the rest of the universe says no
Why can't these pro-lifers care about kids who are actually alive? Like the kids being killed in schools? Get a job. Stop harassing people outside health clinics. And of course it's all men.

Well maybe you should find out how that happened and do something different. Maybe Keep your Legs Together.
"Fighting for their lives: Women and the impact of abortion restrictions in post-Roe America  ""On the Brink"" Nightline news commentator Diane Sawyer.  Outlawing abortion is insane!!!

"Please keep covering the total disaster of these terrible backfiring ""bans"" and interference in American people's private reproductive health decisions. We the People need to immediately Restore the correct Roe v. Wade decision that is the only legitimate law of the land and only legitimate USA constitution."
Previous conversations especially with high risk mom‚Äôs and viability of a high risk or non viable infant were discussed regarding decisions to carry the infant to term this allowed the mother to decide on what they wanted to do with the pregnancy given just the facts. That discussion can‚Äôt even happen instead we schedule hospice to speak with them to prepare for the unthinkable

"""For You formed my inward parts; You knitted me together in my mother's womb. ‚Ä¶ Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in Your Book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them"" (Psalm 139:13,¬†16)."

Legalized Abortion is also legalized baby killing murder and what we kill we must eat so readily available abortion is also legalized cannibalism. there is a better way celibacy and immaculate conceptions Outer-course which will make Intercourse a interpersonal behavior of the past just like what orthopedic neurosurgeons and psychiatrist are doing"

"Approximately 25,000 children age out of the adoption system every year without ever having found a family.

"Im sorry but i just have to say that the young woman who talked about ""bring back the humanity"" by ""allowing"" a woman to bring a pregnancy to term and seeing that child die in her arms... EXCUSE ME?? This is the type of person who needs to experience the cruelty she inflicts on other women."
If the case of rape.its ok to abortion.if the case is used as birthcontrol or just happen because of your lifestyle then its restricted to do abortion.dont you ever think about the baby that breathing in your womb.it could be your bless
Why are conservatives against abortion so much? It's just a bunch of aborted liberals....
Roe vs wade was overturned in the United States ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§because MOTHERS & FATHERS WHO KILL THEIR OWN CHILDREN ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§DONT TREAT ANY ONE ELSE ANY DIFFERENT ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§A REFLECTION OF WHAT IS HAPPENING
It makes sense why women would want one but for men to support abortion means they don't support equality.
"I have what I need stock piled. Including an ear wax removal kit with a camera on the end. I'm not being forced to have a baby. 

A woman who chooses to give birth is a mother. A woman who is forced to give birth is breeding stock. 

And I want to make sure everyone knows that when dr. Bernard helped the 10 yea old from ohio, Indiana attorney general todd rokita went after her for ""violating doctor/ patient confidentiality"" even though she gave no identifying information.

Meaning, when a child becomes pregnant through SA, keep your mouth shut, because republicans want to claim that it ""never happens""

In fact, the govenor of Missouri states that the only time a woman or little girl gets pregnant through SA is if she ""likes it""

It's legal to not have sex
"partnership of murder and enslavement by the government and women, fathers are either forced to pay 18yrs child support thereby creating 18yrs of tax revenue OR the same biased courts allows the mother to murder the fathers unborn son or daughter without his consent. The government get their slaves and labor force and the woman get to do as she wishes. This is what all men should know from a very young age, long before they fall victim to this steaming pile of complete bullüí©."
"Good people defend the innocent. Protect young people. Evil is not pro-life. There is no Abortion Rights debate! It is all made up for Communism Ideology to thrive. (Communist Democrat narratives lie. Communist Democrat characters are above science.) Science tells us when a human life begins. Science tells us Males are biological male, and females are biological female. Pro-life Republican characters stand for truth. Truth is not a cult, despite tyrant elitist Globalist Communist Democrat lies. An elitist scholarly woman in the UK literally said, ""Truth is a Cult."" Communist States give women the right to murder the innocent. Abortion - is a medical procedure to end a human life. Free People are not against abortion. Free People are against murder. Abortion used, as a way, to murder an individual is still murder. Abortion is intended to preserve life via self-defense. Abortion is used to save the mother‚Äôs life in rare medical emergencies."
Abortion has killed more humans in the past 100 years than all of the deaths in all the wars in that time period. That's a fact and disgusting. Abortion is murdering innocent unborn children.
"The fact that these people are forcing their choice on other people explains how backward humanity is. More shocking from that side of the world. Imagine telling a rape victim to carry a pregnancy from rape. God forbid. Like every other draconian and evil laws, it will be overturned one day, no matter how they think they can impose it on people. It's criminal to take away people's choice or make doctors indecisive to determine the best outcome for their patients. Horror God forbid again. Imagine the case of a man that raped his daughter, and you want the daughter to keep a pregnancy she does not want. Only evil people will support this. People should be given a choice to decide with their bodies."

The Roe v Wade reversal was just a step in the right direction. Abortion is a human rights violation. It needs to be illegal.
What is it to Republicans anyways they dont gives two shits once the poorchild is born
"Children are super expensive. Fertilized eggs get stuck in tubes.
Pregnancies stress the body of the woman (like if she has cancer or if overweigh)
If you'd ask a man to be 9 months connected to another man to pump his blood it would be OK if you for any reason needed to disconnect."
Everyone who is even remotely afraid and is able to afford it should get their tubes tied or a similar procedure. Hysterectomy is a bigger operation and has more consequences but I underwent it and recommend similar steps for every woman out there. No need to be afraid after its done.
Proven fact. 100% of people desiring an abortion were never completely aborted themselves.
It's leading to Reich wingers losing elections.
"For what it‚Äôs worth, Abortion was not just legal‚Äîit was a safe, condoned, and practiced procedure in colonial America and common enough to appear in the legal and medical records of the period. Official abortion laws did not appear on the books in the United States until 1821, and abortion before quickening did not become illegal until the 1860s. If a woman living in New England in the 17th or 18th centuries wanted an abortion, no legal, social, or religious force would have stopped her. When the Constitution was written abortion was acceptable,legal, and practiced."
"The media has hoodwinked the public about this law. The U.S. Supreme Court did not ban abortions. They argued that the decisions on abortions had nothing to do with the Constitution, and the SC deal only with laws related to the Constitution. So, they handed the decicion over to State laws, allowing individual State laws to regulate abortions instead of Federal laws. No one has ""banned"" these rights across the entire country unless the American people vote to ban it on the State level.

Why exactly did the Republicans objecting to the Clinton-pushed Roe v. Wade law? The legal objection was to change the term from 9 months to a normal term (around 24 weeks), and then to allow each individual State to determine abortion laws based on local votes. 

And why? Roe v. Wade allowed women to carry a baby to full term, abort it in the last minute right before birth. The truth was that in some states women, for money, became incubators for the Clinton-legalized baby-organ trade carrying babies for 9 months simply so hospitals could profit from the organ trade in the millions. The Rep's argued that this turned abortion into mu_der since the baby was fully conscious at 9 months. Baby organs were openly traded and sold for enormous profits by hospitals - a trade considered illegal in most countries...."

"It's manslaughter biblically actually is murder. Religious people should only pay taxes for what they support. But non religious people can pay for their own taxes and charity. Its up to 12 weeks unless she is dying. Then you just go to prison for killing a new born baby, or I'm out. Id rather have nephilim."
"What is the definition of a Baby? ‚ÄúBaby (noun): a very young child, especially one newly or recently BORN (newborn). 

Abortion is not murder or a baby! you must be born first to become a baby. Facts üíØ"
"What is the definition of born? ‚ÄúBorn (verb): come into existence as a result of birth.‚Äù

What is the definition of birth? ‚ÄúBirth (noun/verb): the emergence of a baby or other young from the body of its mother; the start of life as a physically separate being.‚Äù 

Given all these current definitions, you do not exist before birth. Your life does not start until you are born. You are not a separate being until after birth. 

Set your morals aside from fact, truth, and law. Your personal morals are not the guidelines that everyone needs to follow."
"You gotta be BORN first to be considered a baby. The definition of a baby is: a very young child, especially one newly or recently BORN (newborn). 

You gotta be BORN first to gain citizenship. The 14th Amendment: ‚ÄúAll persons BORN or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.‚Äù

And lastly, you gotta be BORN first to have human rights. ‚ÄúUniversal Declaration of Human Rights - Article 1: All human beings are BORN free and equal in dignity and rights.‚Äù

BORN humans have clear and concise statements in all of our declarations. What‚Äôs not clear are the rights of UNBORN humans. 

The UNBORN might be human beings, but either way - according to our declarations human beings must be BORN to inherit all these rights.

Here‚Äôs a great example of clear language protecting UNBORN humans: 

Ireland‚Äôs 8th Amendment: ‚ÄúTo recognise the equal right to life of the mother and the UNBORN.‚Äù

Without this kind of language in our declarations - unborn rights are not as clear as born rights. Advocating unborn rights will require reinterpretations of current declarations. Implied interpretations do not override what‚Äôs factual and clear: the official definitions of the actual words being used in these declarations. Born rights are clear - Unborn rights must be clear first in order to even debate overturning the rights of the born human carrying the unborn human."
There is NOTHING respectable about the anti abortion folks. You guys didn't even make a nice life for the Roe vs wade baby. All of us adoptees are shortchanged and none of us deserve to have to live with you guys abortion is better.
"The question of whether or not to have an abortion concerns only the mother (and the father, if there is one). Abortion is not something that affects the whole population. It is the responsibility of the mother (and the father, if there is one). It is not like vaccination, where if you are not vaccinated you can put other people at risk. The same goes for gun laws. So the question is, why do you care what other people do with their own lives when it has nothing to do with you? Why do you feel entitled to tell them how to live?"
"It makes me so sick the lack of empathy or humanity people have for mothers who need abortions. Some of them WANT their babies but their told their baby will be born dead. Can someone tell me what is the point of forcing a mother to continue with a pregnancy for a baby that has a 0% chance of being born alive?! I know some religious women want to keep it so it can be baptised, but that's the MOTHER'S choice. Fetal demise is more common than people think. One woman had to wait for the inevitable miscarriage which was very painful. Because she couldn't have an abortion right away (for a baby that was ALWAYS going to die) her chances of having another successful pregnancy had significantly been reduced because her uterus had been damaged. All the abortion law did was reduce her chances of having children."
"Male bears have been known to kill and eat their own cubs. Worse is America.

Go kill a puppy in public. Abortion kills life or no procedure would be needed. Hide from the Truth, child."
"Where does the US Constitution state when one is Worthless?

Science proves once the sperm impregnates the ovum, life is gained. Only an horrid reality can terminate that life.

Define Compassion.

Science proves in Nature what is NATURAL, related to SEX. Reproduction is about another generation."
Killing is killing. That is why abortion is wrong. I state the obvious because people deny the obvious.
Women & girls have the right to choose.
"So worried about ""controlling a woman's body"" but zero concern for dismembering the body of a helpless human being forming on the womb.

Don't let men use you for their pleasure! DUH!

"If the mother has the option to opt out of motherhood, so should the father, but people don‚Äôt wanna talk about that!!!"
Okay so woman has the baby and she neglects it....does these people even f ing care!!
"Anyone who really believes abortion is murder and wants to prevent it would support birth control counseling, low cost birth control covered by healthcare, sex education, regardless of age. They would also support Universal prenatal and postnatal healthcare, provide healthcare to children, and support subsidized non-profit high quality daycare.  To give that baby the ‚Äúevery chance at life‚Äù. I have never, ever,  heard any pro-life politician or political spokesperson voice support for any of these measures that would easily prevent millions of abortions."
"I had an abortion. I‚Äôm happy I did it, I would do it again. Obtaining it was stressful and expensive. About three weeks into the pregnancy it seemed like I might not be able to get the procedure in time so I tried to hang myself. I nearly succeeded. My partner got to me in time and in the end I was able to get the abortion. I would have tried to die again if I had been forced to stay pregnant. Some people shouldn‚Äôt be moms, some peoples dna shouldn‚Äôt be passed on. My mental health is trash, my whole family has mental health problems. Why would anyone want to put that on a child?"
God bless America.... at least the people in top had the brian to rule out roe v wade

Undated : RU486 abortion pill - medical drugs tablets RU-486
All doctors and nurse practitioners will be able to prescribe the pregnancy termination pills, and all pharmacies can stock it in a major change to abortion rules in Australia.

All doctors and nurse practitioners will be able to prescribe the pregnancy termination pills, and all pharmacies can stock it as new rules are brought in.

Until now, prescribers and dispensers of the two-part medical abortion treatment needed extra certification or registration, meaning only about 10 per cent of doctors and 30 per cent of pharmacists are currently able to deal with the pill.

But from August 1, restrictions around the MS-2 Step will be removed, in a move the government says will ‚Äúimprove equitable access to healthcare for all Australians‚Äù.

Nurse practitioners ‚Äì who represent about one per cent of nurses ‚Äì will also be able to prescribe the medications under the PBS."

And is she mad that she hears people can have kids by Happy mistakes and tragic mistakes to witch should be the person decission . Kids are for life  a debt that a poor person cannot do in his her work life , School and list goes on.  The kids that are grown up in a household that is always broke creates alot more harm then being able to get abortion. Some parents trapped and no where else to go a bottle/drugs in turn have there parents hating there kids for this. I really would like to know if Kristan Hawkins cannot have kids and hating on the ones that can and cannot afford having a kid in there current state of life ? Its just sickening to hear that a person raped now has to raise the rapist kid wtf"
"I just don't understand how can some of those people twist the idea that you are giving back something to people when you are in fact letting government remove rights, remove freedoms and dictate what women can and cannot do with their own bodies, treating them in such a discriminate way. Yet another step into theocracy.
The brainwashing must be deep for people who cannot feel cognitive dissonance from such a logical contradiction.

And again, the problem with all of these people is that they are preaching rules that don't have the effect they idealize in their heads in reality, because they purposefully remain ignorant and don't look at real life statistics, data, and refuse to listen to what the scientific community is saying.

It's trying to pass laws, applies rules, and see the world according to their uninformed, idealistic and ignorant assumptions rather than working with science and years of recorded history to understand the problem in what they are proposing.

The whole problem of trying to criminalize abortion is that you cannot stop abortion by criminalizing it. We have centuries of history to prove that. It's exactly because no woman in the real world would ever consider an abortion if it wasn't her last choice. No women will even enter an abortion procedure as if it was a choice about walking in the park or not. This ridiculous, demeaning and quite frankly sexist idea that women would go to an abortion clinic like they go to a tanning saloon is just plain idiotic.

And so, it doesn't matter what the law says, if you have someone desperate for an abortion, they will always go with whatever choice that is available. Legal, illegal, safe clinic, back alley, a scientific accredited procedure, or a coat hanger. We all know this, or we should all know this, and trying to turn an eye to this truth is just evil, it seems to me like a trace of sociopathy.
Making abortion legal isn't about more abortions, it's about making the procedure safe, it's about regulating and supervising the procedure properly,  it's about saving lives of women who need this very basic access to healthcare that is being taken away from them by politics and extremism.

A well regulated abortion clinic and practice actually protects women, and in several cases ends up protecting babies too, despite what radicals will say. It creates a web of support that prevents women from being coerced into it by abusive spouses, abusive parents, abusive boyfriends and whatnot. This is an entire whole point that is being lost there.
Illegal clinics won't care about that and won't have proper procedures to prevent those. So not only you are removing choice from women, you are also empowering abusive relationships to end up in abortion cases because you are removing the legality of it which forces the practice to go underground.

The real problem with the pro-life people is misinformation, idealism, and trying to fight an invisible enemy they don't comprehend on purpose."
"Stop having premarital sex, stop having drunk sex, wear a condom, take the pill,  get married first.  These are crazy thoughts right?  (Much easier to do rather than getting an abortion AKA (Killing a defenseless baby) which ends their life, triggers your lifelong guilt, and puts your life/health at extreme risk, like bleeding to death after the procedure, loosing ability to have future children, and std's from extremely risky behavior)  Its like smoking:  The label says don't ""You're harming yourself""  but some do it anyway.  Humans.  Seek God....Who commands, encourages, and promotes loving monogamous, married relationships.  Maybe you avoid having to considering an abortion in the first place."

"But that is the thing medical bills are expensive and insurrection company are not cheap and don't always pay for medical bills like giving birth. So, retail companies love to put children clothing, nappies, formulas and toys up very high. Then you got other bills like gas, electric, water, mortgages, and more like food are expensive enough and that means parents work longer hours for very little pay and skip meals so their children can get, sleep and go to school. 

Also, the number of child abuse is far worse as some people only have children to get benefits and not love, care and be a parent to a child that would love them until that uncaring, and abusive parents kill them. Abortion actually saves lives and dying in their mother's arms is more worse because that is physical abuse to the woman.

I am pro-choice I will accept whatever choice the woman wants. Who are we to listen to someone telling us women what to do with our bodies? My ex-husband told me because he is my husband he can tell me what to do like have seven+ children and to not get a tattoo and ruin my body. Well, it is my body not a man's or anyone else's to do with."

"I got a bilateral salpingectomy (tubes completely removed) about a months ago. My doctor is amazing and did it for me without ""husband's approval"" or making sure I had kids already (I don't). I finally made the decision to get it done because of the lack of abortion healthcare in America. I never want to be pregnant in this country. I didn't want to be pregnant anyway, but it would be a nightmare having an unwanted pregnancy now. So I got my tubes taken out."
"Abortion advocates are trying to push for termination up till the point of birth. That means killing a fully formed, healthy baby that can survive outside the womb simply out of spite, there's no justification of excuse for it. They're baby killers and murderers. Women wonder why they have historically been oppressed, it's because everytime they are given rights they eventually push for baby killing and it falls to the men of society and put a stop to their heinous, reprehensible evil actions."
"its pretty simple,  the states where the population wants to reduce access can do.. and the states that want full access can do.. that's pretty much the impact roe v wade has had.."
More women will just die at the end of the day. Some women can‚Äôt carry long term due to other complications with pregnancy. A lot of women can die in pregnancy in general so essentially they are saying kill them both if an abortion is needed.

"My deepest condolences go out to this woman with a miscarriage. No matter what, this is a very difficult time that I‚Äôve walked through with many of my patients. This example is ridiculous though. I‚Äôm a medical doctor and the safest way for a miscarriage to pass is naturally. If this woman is passing the products of conception naturally, this is the best medical option. Mifepristone/misoprostol are the second line treatment options for a pregnancy loss before 12 weeks. Dilation and curettage are third line treatment. This patient had the best outcome after a sad happenstance."

If they want to stop abortions they better offer to raise the babies or give them enough money to raise them. Note that they care about the unborn until it comes out of the vagina then it's your problem. Not having money is a big thing. There are people in the world who have starving children and have to watch them die. Is that humane?
"I appreciate how humanized this news piece has been, but I also want to know the data; have partial or full hysterectomies gone up since the ban? Have women been dying more due to pregnancy complications? Maybe a sharp uptick in new babies being released to the state? Mental health issues? Substance abuse issues? Have women been moving out of these anti-abortion states? If they can't move... Are there underground abortion providers again?

If it be the case that this information is unavailable because these states are not collecting this information, I would think that would be an important thing to add."

And these people really don't care about the human produced from the pregnancy. I'm disgusted."

Planned parenthood is unpardonable planned massacre! No condom shall kills my manliness! Abortion...ermmm, 15weeks allowance, more rapes more allowance. ""knocked""."
"This is not about rape victims! Of course any woman raped should immediately receive drugs that end any potential pregnancy. Incest, of course any girl should be able to end any pregnancy. All other women..really? Sex education. Contraceptive or abstinence. How the hell does any woman get to 3rd trimester and have a right to abort leaving a foetus to die outside the womb. This is not progress, feminism, rights or bodily autonomy. Nope, just disgusting."
"Thanks for highlighting incompetent doctors who should have taken legal advice on what they could have done instead of getting their advice from CNN and thanks BBC for actually reporting it correctly that it wasn't a ""ban on abortion"" (as you did for years) but giving it back to the states which is where laws like this were always held.  If their citizens dont like it - they have to right to vote them out."

Why you turn off the comments on andrew tate video.
"They (BBC) switch off the comment section for Andrew Tate charge video but keep comments on for other videos. See how corrupt the media is in pushing for an agenda they want. They don't report the news. No one does these days. It's all an opinion to push forth their agenda.  Again these charges against Andrew Tate, there is no evidence; they can't put forth anything as they don't have anything. I don't even watch Tate videos, but plainly looking at this using common sense, and oh boy, do I see lies and hypocrisy everywhere from the media side. And if you can't see that, then God help you."

"Say abortion is bad but don't invest into child care because that would be socialist.
Say guns aren't the problem but mental health issues are but don't invest into helping therapy become more available because that is woke garbage. 
Yup, its america time!!"
Abortion shouldn‚Äôt be allowed at all. Someone might say if she was raped then you have up to five weeks before the heartbeat starts. If you having irresponsible sexual then don‚Äôt take your irresponsibility to the innocent child. Give away to adoption or foster care if you can‚Äôt take care of them. How can a human being kill their innocent unborn babies. Some people are evil and heartless and should put to death penalty for killing an innocent child in worst way possible.
The problem for the United States is that the Republicans and Democrats contradict each other on abortion and mass shootings. They are extreme in each case.
The way the leftists have brainwashed kids now and disregarded biology completely. They have now lost all creditability in this issue.
"Frankly, no idea why anyone else should be butting in with what a woman does with her *own* body. It‚Äôs her choice. Simply no one else‚Äôs business. Those who bore on about the ‚Äúrights of the unborn‚Äù seem to be overestimating human life. I‚Äôm willing to bet that if you ask 100 people randomly whether they would have wanted to be born (knowing what we do as humans), the vast majority of them would decline the offer. Invariably, it‚Äôs those holy rollers who adhere to primitive scriptures written by men thousands of years ago who cause all the trouble here. It‚Äôs no accident that abortion rights are such a hot topic in the US, a country with an alarmingly high belief in invisible daddies in the sky. Preventing legal access to abortion doesn‚Äôt stop abortions from happening, it just prevents *safe* abortions as women will seek dangerous underground methods if the legal option is denied them. Another thing that‚Äôs always confused me in this debate is how the pro-lifers in the US are oh so keen to ‚Äúprotect the life of the unborn‚Äù by denying legal access to abortion, but are quite free and easy with the lives of the born, and are all for any Tom, Dick or Dirty Harry buying a gun like they‚Äôre buying candy from a store and going out and shooting up a school every other week. Seems like there‚Äôs a contradiction there. Personally, my only issue with abortion is pain. Does the unborn foetus feel pain? On this basis, it should be done as early as possible in the gestation but the bottom line here is simple: it‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs right to choose what she does with her own body."
"First, it is nonsense to suggest that the law never tells people what they can or cannot do with their bodies. In fact, there are many things which people are not legally allowed to do with their bodies. To name just a few, they cannot sell them for sex, or sell their organs to people who need transplants, or put certain drugs into their bodies."
"Pro-life until after it is born. Not pro-life for the women, or the kid after it is born."
"If pro-lifers didn't want to be hypocrites, making abortion illegal should have been their last priority. 
https://youtu.be/JQoSZixSFEw 
Making abortion illegal doesn't stop abortions from happening, it only stops safe abortions from happening. Instead of women going to a doctor to undergo the procedure, women will try to give themselves abortions through unsafe methods. 

Strong sex education classes and easy access to free birth control are the only effective ways of reducing the actual number of abortions. (People won't get abortions if you give them the tools to not get pregnant in the first place.) However, conservative states routinely try to cut back on both of these while still condemning abortion. 

Pro-lifers go on and on about ""saving the life of the child"", but what about the quality of life for that child? Have Pro-lifers improved America's poor foster care systems? Have they fought to provide financial aid to new mothers who can't afford the children that they didn't want because they couldn't afford them? I haven't heard Pro-lifers mention anything about what they are willing to do to support these unwanted children. 

The United States has poor sex education, access to birth control is restricted in one way or another in many parts of the nation, our foster care system has been neglected, and having children will often financially ruin women who didn't want children. 

Yet despite all those issues, Pro-lifers continue to support keeping abortion illegal, which only exacerbates those issues. 

The actions of Pro-lifers (and/or lack of actions) show their true intentions. Pro-lifers don't really care about the children. They only care about punishing women for being sexually active. That is the outcome of making abortion illegal, it will make women suffer. 
They want women to suffer because those women aren't conforming to their ideals and beliefs."
"You at least have the humanity of a child dying in their mothers arms. Bruh. How do you even come to such a awful conclusion. Oh yeah instead of letting an adult/mother decide on their own, let's just decide it's best for that person to have a baby die in their arms."
You do not have the right to murder innocent unborn babies you sick freaks.
Protect the innocent children from these evildoers.
Abortion is Murder.
"Science¬†makes it very clear¬†that preborn children are human beings. It‚Äôs a scientific fact that¬†life begins at fertilization, with the baby having his or her own unique, individual DNA strand, entirely separate from their mother. Within the first trimester alone, the baby has a beating heart, measurable brain waves, unique fingerprints, and the ability to respond to touch."
America has a problem with cause and effect.
And America Thinks its a free Country haha
It astonishes me that a country which still has the death penalty doesn't allowed abortion in any sense for some states.
God this is depressing

"What about the innocents life? Because it is murder. The answer is responsible sex, using contraceptives."

"Funny, most European countries have had more restrictions than the USA up until now."
"Also, Hollywood needs to stop promoting the wild sex culture that spawns disrespect for women and babies."
"Democrats at to blame here, if they had not pushed the abortion with no restrictions up to birth and no care for born but unwanted babies, the American people would not have wanted to reverse Roe."
"The woman at 6:50 I wonder if she would be happy to carry a pregnancy to term, go through the traumatic experience that is birth for her child to die in her hands. That's such a stupid and entitled statement."
"What these people leave out is if the baby is gonna put the mothers life at risk, is it really worth it for her dying or having severe body damage even if the baby lives."
"The risk is Female led Eugenics. ''I've been pregnant, but i recently discovered that the father wears a toupee...so i no longer want the baby''. ... I think the scales risk being tipped too far in favor of women as to who gets to decide who lives/reproduces and who doesn't. Because the poor/bald/short/black/brown/Ugly/fat, whatever...also have a right to be born safely, and not be aborted, because the irresponsible mother has now decided that she no-longer finds red hair attractive. Indeed It is true that we are all eugenicists to a certain extent, deciding on the characteristics that we want in a baby. But that decision should better be made at the time before a woman decides on whether to go ahead with the sexual act and not after the baby already exists. A human life is not an iphone that you are choosing from a store shelf. Color no longer trendy? No problem! just get another one! Otherwise, why did we fight the Nazis, who had their own national eugenics program that sought to make everyone beautiful, tall, blond, smart and perfectly healthy? In fact, listening to a modern western women's list of requirements for men is eerily like reading Himmler's list of requirements for the SS. Where is the compassion here exactly? The equality? And it is not surprising that the feminist camp are pro abortion, because other than women's rights, it represents ultimate control over men. I dont see them fighting to include men in this important decision making process... Let us see, once men have been reduced to walking sperm receptacles that women can procur from, whether they have the respect for anti-discrimination and tolerance that they say they do, as abortion commercializes human life."
"its not nice to murder a child in the womb, that has to be chopped up to be removed. shame on you"
Gods law is higher whatever wot is wot . Wherever that leads.
"Do anti-abortion men know HOW WOMEN FEEL during their pregnancy and giving birth??? It's unimaginably painful and unpleasant, especially, if a biological father is a rapist!"
"It‚Äôs not the land of the free here, it‚Äôs the land of fascism.

"The problem with taking away women's rights, is that you are opening a door that put us back to past. First it's our rights to our body, next will be our position at work (mostly due to fact of child care but we have been fighting for equality at work for years), after that they will go after the education system for female students... slowly and carefully if we allow them, they will end up putting women ""back in their place"" notice the quotation marks.. because they are too weak and scared of our intelligence"

Hey BBC why aren't you uploading the interview you did with Andrew Tate ?? What's going on ?
"Who Amon you have No Sin Be the One Cast the First Stone.. this is what I remember from the Bible. 
No health situation should be judged by the courts or governments. Plus I can't stand the fact of people outside the clinic or posting comments against others in any situation, especially when they are quoting the Bible or religious beliefs... because if they are very religious as they say then what happened to the Do not judge others, Only God has the Right to Judge, and Most Importantly... Who Among you have NO SIN be the One to Cast the First Stone???"
I'd respect their views if the same people were stood outside care homes and adoption agencies offering support to the babies who have been born. There i said it.
That picture paints a thousand words...

"We're doing great here! It's crazy that women not being able to kill their own fetuses in the womb as some form of petty, primitive birth control stirs so much controversy."
"The pro-choice crowd has had over 30 years to weed out all the ‚Äúunwanted people,‚Äù and no one can argue that they‚Äôve been stingy in carrying out the death sentences. So far, they‚Äôve butchered between 45 and 50 million babies and they continue to kill them at the rate of over 3,000 a day. Meanwhile, we are asked to ignore the fact that, since this holocaust began, America has suffered huge increases in teen pregnancy, homelessness, hunger, welfare, divorce, poverty, child abuse, spousal abuse, deadbeat dads, gangs, illegal drugs, sexually transmitted diseases, high school drop outs, and the list goes on and on."
BBC wants to kill babies
Both sides need to meet in the middle.
Totally unbiased view from the BBC. Abortion is the murder of a child. It is that simple. I can't believe how sick our culture has become that we think murdering children is health care. In the ancient Roman world infant exposure was totally acceptable... So why not also make it legal to murder children outside the womb if we decide we don't want it?
very one sided coverage. No mention about the rights of the unborn babies only the rights of the women.
Infographics like you used sets us back and is why we have a hard time convincing old men what abortions really are.... stop showing full grown babies.
"Baby killers have no place on planet earth

"It' not your body, therefore there shouldn't be a choice to kill an innocent child."
"There should never be an abortion exemption for alleged rape.
It is too easy for a desperate female who ""made a bad decision"" and regrets becoming pregnant to falsely accuse an innocent male of rape so she can gain access to abortion."
The claim that she was raped which she admitted was a lie.

Abortion is to kill
"I am pro life,wish I had all five kids."
"If a woman gets raped and has a baby on the way, then carry it until it is borned the put it up for adoption. But in the same aspect if carrying this unborn baby endangers the mother's life then I would agree to having a abortion to save the moms life. But that is the only way I would agree to having one.
Now here comes the kicker, Some women have children that are on welfare in order to keep the money coming into the house. AND a lot of them have no idea who the fathers are.  So the TAXPAYERS again have to support these families for ever. It becomes a way of life for generations of these garbage people. passed on from generation to generation.
I would like to see welfare defunded and make these people get off of their butts and work for a living. OR work for the money they are getting from the government.  It used to be this way back in the 40's and 50's and some of the 60's.   There isn't anything FREE in this world because someone has to pay for it."
Demicrats wanted the law changed to allow baby murder even after a healthy baby was born. The party of evil.

Just like George Carlin said Republicans only cared when you are still in your mother's womb but once you're born you're on your own. To sum up if you're pre life you're gonna be just fine but pre school then you're definitely f**ked.
Pro choice all day and everyday ‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂ hoping to open my own abortion clinic one day
This is totally false claims. Having a miscarriage is not the same as having an abortion. One is you lost your child. The other is you chose to kill your child. And those medicines and procedures are atill available for those having miscarriages and you are not forced to do it on your own. My life was saved after my last miscarriage bc of these treatments. Killing your baby is wrong bottom line.

"*Abortion Laws in the U.S. in a nutshell:*

Let's say you go the Wendy's I'm working at and I begin making you a burger. You didn't order the burger, you don't want it, and you refuse to pay for it, but the manager will call the cops and have you locked up if you try to stop the burger from being made for you against your will. When the burger is completed after an agonizingly long time and is given to you, it's rancid and shrivelled, like Marjorie Taylor Greene's box. Completely unacceptable for health code standards or social acceptability, but you have to accept it in this establishment. At McDonalds, you can refuse to have it and terminate the unwanted order, but not here at Wendy's."
"A woman I knew got pregnant, was overjoyed UNTIL the diagnosis of CANCER was made. 
Because abortion was not legally allowed, she DIED, so did her son. 
The family of two girls and her loving husband lost her. 
Is this acceptable when it's obvious that women who are pregnant have such powerful hormone changes CANCER speeds up? Women die? 
My own great-grandmother had an abortion when doctors were so ignorant about reproduction, they had no idea how to help. She died at 93 years old, yes, but couldn't have another pregnancy because it would kill her. 
Laws like these ludicrous versions DON'T stop miscarriages, abortion by natural causes. Nature aborts fetal matter in all mammals. We're mammals."
No more abortion.period .
"It's all about control for bullying Religionist Fundamentalists and RepuGNicans, who ONLY care about ""babies"" BEFORE they are delivered. After birth, babies become ""undeserving financial burdens"", and, ""coercive intrusion"" or not, the mothers ""should have kept their knees together""."
"Medically and legally speaking a 6 week old zygote is not a baby. People calling it a baby are factually incorrect and ignore the can of worms it would open to classify it as such.  This isn't about saving lives, if it were they'd be pro-choice because that in fact saves lives  It also just so happens that in the states that are against abortion, childcare and foster care ranks among the worst in the nation.  The federal SNAP program provides a mere $6 per day in benefits to needy families and Republicans want to cut that down even more including many other federal programs like reduced and free school lunches.  Pro life my ass, pro forcing their own opinion on others.  They've completely taken the right of a women to decide what to do with their own body."
It is pure evil to force a mom to carry to term a baby that will die-holding your child while it struggles for every breath isn‚Äôt righteous.
How many women are putting their lives in danger  having to seek backstreet abortions .  Republicans won't pay a extra cent in tax  to provide services to help raise  the children they forced people to have   .
"While I respect the idea of protecting life, many of the pro-life people are also pro-guns.  What I find confounding and ironic is that these people are more concerned about embroyes than the lives of children and adults."

"Abortion is genocide, it's no secret why we need foreigners, eh Britain? I know it's you brits causing problems, your empire can suck shit."
"if you dont like it, move somewhere else, i dont see the issue really"
women just want the freedom to kill babies. stop lying
"Force them to have a baby, and then enable anyone to have a gun to kill the child later on. A country gone mad!"
First degree murder unless it's rape there should be no abortion. It's a crime. Just don't have sex or use protection Ffs
"Obviously, BBC News took the far lefts side because they're yucky #fakenews"
"No matter what side of the debate you stand on there needs to be a serious conversation about expanding foster and adoption care services to take care of abuse, neglected or abandoned children."
That‚Äôs ok. We‚Äôll just enter through the back door.
"You are lying: it was never a right and it s not. The right to live is superior and that s the reason, as you know since you are journalists. It¬¥s called Natural Law."

What happened to all those back alley abortions we were told would occur?
Key campaign issue?  So a vote for Biden will bring back Roe when it was taken away during his time in office?  I don't think so...  Evidently it's extremist in congress to think killing babies is wrong.   Something smells funny here.
"Ok what has changed since roe vs wade was stopped, 64,000 women have been in impregnated   from rape, 20,000 plus women in Texas alone, Abbott should be arrested for that by the FBI, women need to take  this to the white house or Capital fast and as asap about this fast. Rape is still against the law here. Babies are supposed to come from love between woman and man not rape. Thats horrible, My question is, how can a women love a babied that she reared from rape, thats not right and that aganist everything in the bible, that is wrong. Think about this for a minute your mother is rapped by a rapists' and she can't abort that child, she must have it, what about the husband, thats a true divorce right there. that a horror story, I mean your sister who is 15 and a  virgin get raped, she has to have this baby or go to jail, what wrong with these states that want ROE VS WADE OFF THE BOOKS, DID THEY SEE THIS HAPPENING, THE ONE'S THAT WANTED ROE OFF THE BOOKS GET RAPPED, THEY TO MUST HAVE THE BABY'S. THEY WONT DO THAT."

"Stop being easy and getting pregnant and you won‚Äôt have any issues. Abortion although in my personal opinion is wrong, most of the women I saw coming in and out of clinics were prostiutes and frequent visitors. It harbors crime and all kinds of stuff."
"Let‚Äôs see, 10 year old has to leave Ohio for Indiana to get abortion for rape.  Indiana md then sued by Indiana AG.  Would this be possible if men could get pregnant?"
So glad Roe v Wade is gone!!
Lol as a chaotic neutral this is still the funniest thing in recent politics.
What did Biden say??? üòÇüòÇüòÇ 0:50
"If men could get pregnant, the abortion clinic would be a drive-thru! UGH!"
it's all about choice and consequences
"I think that if people were more careful about who they sleep with and take responsibility for the decisions they make, we wouldn‚Äôt need  the government to intervene and tell us what we can and cannot do."
"We should not be treating   an unborn like  an organ being removed.    Ec 11:5  ""As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything.""   Clearly  3rd trimester John the baptist  leapt for joy over 1st trimester Jesus speaks to the personhood of the unborn."
"I mean i think life in its self is more valuable than someone‚Äôs comfort. Excluding rape, you were the one that set up this situation knowing this could happen. And a life shouldn‚Äôt be ended because of someone else‚Äôs mistake and bad decision making. Medical emergencies are also an exception but most abortions are on the basis of economic situations, work life, and relationship status."
One year later and the left is still playing games
"Personal medical decisions should up to individual citizens, not politicians and their big $ donors."
‚Äú.. make decisions about my body.‚Äù You decided to make decisions about your body when you consented to have sex..
Listen to him talk come on...
Constitutional right to abort a baby? Where im the Constitution does it say you can abort a child? These are the same people who think gun control is a good idea.
I‚Äôm pretty conservative but I disagree on abortion. I love it when liberals terminate their pregnancies. Do it more please.
"A completely political Supreme Court decision made against the wishes by far, of the American people, especially unfavored by WOMEN ~ thanks to that trump idiot. He was comfortably, solidly pro-choice until he decided to use the fay anti-abortion political winds in his ambition political sails, prompting him to appoint 3 known anti-abortionist judges to the bench, which is pure hypocrisy! The other thing I will say is that if Justice Clarence Thomas had had his way with Anita Hill, who called him out for prolonged sexual harassment, I'm sure he would have demanded that she get an abortion. The duplicity of these so called Republicans is reason enough NOT to vote for them people."
"Imagine if people just made better life choices, rather than resorting to murdering babies."
Go Biden #Biden2024
"Millions of us democrats don‚Äôt support abortion. Please stop making it a Democrat vs Republican issue üôÑ. This is an American issue! Maybe start using contraception if you don‚Äôt want a baby, that‚Äôs for both men and woman. Tired of my tax dollars being used to pay for abortions!! You get pregnant it‚Äôs on you to pay, period.

"1000000 lives were saved, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happened!"
"A couple of days ago, Zelensky said that Russia mined the reactors of the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant and wants to blow it up. But at that time there were representatives of the International Atomic Energy Agency. They conducted an inspection and the next day they reported that there were no mines and that Russian troops did not store ammunition and explosives inside the nuclear power plant. But the leadership of Ukraine stubbornly declares that Russia has mined and is about to commit a terrorist attack at the station.
I am very afraid that the Ukrainian leadership in the coming days may take such actions and decide on a massive bombardment of a nuclear power plant using Storm Shadow missiles installed and tested on Ukrainian Air Force aircraft, as well as using M142 HIMARS. Although the Russian army has learned to easily intercept missiles from the M142 HIMARS, as well as the Storm Shadow, but using a combined attack they can break through the Russian shield, because even the iron dome of Israel cannot withstand a massive combined attack.
During the hostilities in Ukraine since 2022, it became clear that the Ukrainian leadership and Ukrainian troops could launch any inhuman attack. They killed their own fellow citizens in Bucha and hit ""Point U"" at the station in Kramatorsk, into a crowd of refugees, hits on a bus station in people who tried to leave Zaporozhye for Vasilyevka, Zaporozhye region (controlled by the Russian Federation). Undermining the dams of the Kyiv region. And undermining the Kakhovskaya HPP. To blame Russia for these attacks. But the problem is that the military and officials initially publish in their networks how they shat Russia and then erase their records and blame the Russian Federation for everything. And also the United States transferred nuclear waste to Ukraine to create dirty bombs and stored in the Odessa region.
So I hope the publication of this material will be able to create a resonance so that Zelensky's bloody regime does not repeat the Chernobyl tragedy. They are crazy and will stop at nothing for money.!"

"Constitutional abortion???
The constitution doesn't mention aboration. If anything the Constitution does say, ""endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" It says nothing about abortion which is why it was reverted back to the State's, legislative bodies and the people."
"Bloomberg estimates that there have been 5,000 fewer abortions per month since Roe was overturned.
That means about 60,000 babies are walking, talking, laughing, and bringing joy to people‚Äî when in the past they would have been dead.

"Less death, for one."
"Red states got even shittier and blue states got better since they swiped up all those who fled the red states, namely medical practitioners and other educated people. In other words, Roe's overturn simply increases the gap between red and blue states, with blue states resembling Europe and red states increasingly resembling Uganda. As a blue state resident, it's actually worked out decently for us, though long term it will simply damage the United States entirely by driving away educated immigrants."
"Everything is fine and dandy . The states are making their own rules . As Fare as Joe Briben goes , he's a crooked POS."
"What's changed?  
      Very little... Most of those who were most vehemently opposed to the overturning are still not in need of an abortion."
America: land of the f**king incels
So hot yet they didn't use protection. That terrible how whole girls wanted lose virginity too bad they ain't survived but abortion? Pathetic what you use about it.
"One day society will recognize abortion as the abhorrent practice that it is, just as people recognized slavery as evil in the 1800s. To call the slaying of what are clearly human beings health care is like saying that decapitation is dental care. ""The silence of the good people is more dangerous than the brutality of the bad people"" - Martin Luther King, Jr."
If women could assert a little self control and responsibility abortions would be a non issue. Instead they use abortion as birth control and a get out of consequences free card.
"Imagine if American women were legally allowed to forego motherhood through abortion and adoption, without being legally responsible for child support; yet American men are unable to legally forgo fatherhood without permission from women and are forced to pay pay child support. Double standards and female privilege are fun kids. Hands off their bodies, Hands off our wallets"
The devil speaks
"You beatchiz expect men to keep it in their pants, or become parents, live by your own rules, man-haters.  Whine about how actual, real equality is too inconvenient for your vagina for me below:"
"People just need to be more responsible. If you have sex, pregnancy is possible. Keep that in mind."
That was an amazing day!! Let's keep praying that abortions become more and more restrictive.
"Pro-lifers are truly ignorant of the consequences that they push. They're only concern is saving the life of the fetus, which we ALL deem important. Yes, even us pro-choicers value the infant life. BUT not at the cost of another human life. The life of the mother. The one that is currently living on this earth. There are woman who have faced life-threatening conditions due to pregnancy but they weren't able to get abortion until the last minute when they were near death. That is putting the mother's life at risk, and is happening right now in Texas.

There are also pro-lifers who secretly get abortions themselves. Claimming that their situation is ""different"" or ""unique"". They can't understand that there are many normal people who are like them. Not all people who get abortion are irresponsible. Sometimes accidents happen even with contraception. 

Stop trying to force a life changing decision on another family. Respect the freedom of choice. Let a couple or woman decide what to do with her fate and her family's fate."
Not much
Just the nut balls forcing their beliefs on everyone
Fed should have no say in anything not explicitly mentioned in the constitution.
"Abortion has to be regulated. People should not be allowed to abort a pregnancy just because they want to. It should be banned unless it's for medical, life threatening reasons, or  rape and incest that results in criminal investigation."
Grow up
"What changed is everything Trump said about Biden, Hunter, the establishment, FBI, Hillary, China, Ukraine is coming out to be factual so I'm ready to listen to what his thoughts is on Roe!!"
Remember its a fetus until its chooses its gender at birth.  Then we should respect its decisions
One year anniversary and we still don't know who the Supreme Court leak was.
Nothing has changed except more babies are being born that would have bern killed! It was z good decision that follows he constitution!
That freedom was taken while the democrats are in charge. Democrats don‚Äôt care about American they only care about people overseas that‚Äôs why so many Americans are suffering while they send trillions overseas
"Ban on abortion only affects the poor. The rich will always have a way to access abortion. They can fly to Canada or any other first world country that protects woman's rights. 

But the poor will continue to suffer and born children into poverty. These children will live a hard life and may even become those so called thugs that you conservatives hate so much and don't hesitate to shoot with your guns."
"This is STRICTLY  a woman's choice. I don't understand why government or ""religion"" should be entertained in ANY of it. 
ONE WOMANS CHOICE ABOUT HER BODY. THATS IT. Everything about this is overreaching. It's none of anyone's business."
Fake news selling fear and division for democrats everyone in America knows this. They do it every election. They are traitors to this country.
"So from a president that could care less about the country is concerned about Roe V Wade. Maybe he should be worried about the economy. The Southern border. China's involvement with Cuba, The Russian / Ukrainian war and the money he is sending Ukraine without congresses approval and all the issues he and his son are involved in. Since Roe V Wade was overturned. How many woman have died due to this change. Is there a chart for tracking this?"
Respect the freedom of choice. Let a couple or woman decide what to do with her fate and her family's fate.

"What has changed is this:

Republicans want to enact a national abortion ban, at the same time give the right to vote to corporations. Any corporation. No matter the size. So unless the ordinary person can afford to incorporate, their vote will be diluted into meaninglessness."
"""In January 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7‚Äì2 decision in McCorvey's favor holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides a fundamental ""right to privacy"", which protects a pregnant woman's right to an abortion. It also held that the right to abortion is not absolute and must be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and prenatal life.""

We did not go from ""abortions for all"" to ""no abortions for anyone"". We went from ""you have the right to privacy but can't just get abortions whenever you feel like it"" to ""Big Brother can vax your fetus""."
I don't care
lol and the answer is nothing. Carry on//
What hasnt changed is that mainstream news is dying. Propagandists deserve jail time.
Less babies killed i guess that changed

Oh an one more thing I bet that not one of those people who protesting is not on birth control or using condoms. It is my business what I do with my body. This is the reason why I don't want kids to be brought up in this sick degusting world where perverts are targeting children. Raping children and murdering them. Forcing the devils sins on them.

There is no Constitutional right to an abortion. The word abortion is not in the constitution. That is why the SCOTUS kicked it back to the states. The state legislatures can decide. All the uproar about overturning Roe was misplaced.
I think we need to expand abortion to 3 years after birth. If a young child is affecting my health I should be able to abort them. It‚Äôs healthcare and obviously my health is much more important then a child‚Äôs
I find it hilarious how they say constitutional right. It's NOT in the constitution. Hence why is was overturned.
Never was a constitutional right to harm babies.
Evil brain dead man!  No wonder his brain is shrinking.  And poor VP has no brain!
"Y‚Äôknow, you can just not have sex?"
"To answer the üêÇüí© question on this videos headline.... nothing! The world didn't end, women are not slaves. It was all fearnl pandering üêÇüí© brought to you by networks like CBS, hense the BS in the channels name."
A dumb anchor abortions not in the Constitution
What changed let's see mainstream media still keeps pushing their narrative more and more now than ever they still won't acknowledge Biden is corrupt and too senile to hold office and most of all they still don't tell the truth
"The answer is that no one has learned anything a year later. The job of the supreme court is to uphold the constitution. Abortion is not in the constitution and never was. It belongs at the state level so that the citizens can vote for leaders that best represent them. What do people not understand about this? I might add if they think Biden is going to do anything about it, they are as mistaken as they were about student debt. You may want to start by actually reading the constitution."
"This is too funny: they are thinking crooked, just like satan. There is a whole lot of truth that needs to be put into the equation before the true truth can be revealed to them; they deny and reject this Truth."
"For 50 years the choice could be made at the individual level, which is quite frankly how we should be allowed to make all decisions. Now each state gets to pick and choose for you, so much for small government."
Pro-Life!‚ù§
Nothing has changed.  Abortion is still evil.
People need to just live and quit following trends so much dam
"I don't think pro-choice is enough to get Biden votes this time around. He has dropped the ball so bad, nothing can help him now. He's D.O.N.E."
"Life should always be protected at every stage, from conception to natural death. Abortion is never necessary and as a woman I am tired of all the lies put out there by the Abortion industry. I Pray that one day people's heart's are softened and that abortion is completely outlawed, because all lives deserve to be protected."
What has changed is millions of lives have been saved and less children are being brutally murdered every day in the United States. Thank God for this blessing.
"The baby has a right to live, yes the right to live and grow up .
Why baby‚Äôs have less right to live .
Common senses and love are needed in this world to be good humans ."
"""Letting the voters decide if they want abortion legal in their state is a threat to our democracy!""
Biden, probably"
"It's sad, but it almost nothing to do with choice. Birth rates in the U.S. have dropped to 2.1. This means we're barely able to replace ourselves, as every birth requires two people. This means the only way our population has grown is from emigration. So many abortions were occurring that it literally stopped our country from growing. That weakens our ""hard power"" as people are needed to fill the ranks of our military. This was a strategic decision, not a legal correction."
"Nothing has changed, planned Parenthood still kills thousands and thousands of babies every year!!!"
Should never ever had any abortion unless the mother can't be saved.why are people upset about having abortions anyway you are murdering a baby.and God will judge you harshly for murdering his child.
""" in god we trust"" ?
What a laugh. 80 million babies murdered later..."
If you don't like abortion don't have it. I don't understand why punishing women having abortion. Protect life thats already born instead. That's Republican don't like to pay. Stupid individual freedom that includes women freedom to her own body. That's responsibility only between a woman n God her creator only.
"*Enough of women's rights, let's discuss women's wrongs.*"
Every human should have the right to decide if another human can share their organs.
"Fat ugly white women with purple hair are complaining , who would have thought ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èmental illness is out of control in this country"
Bunch of cold hearted KILLERS
Let's END abortion forever everywhere!  Don't what a baby?  Don't have sex.
The only thing thats changed is DNC paid judges are stopping states from doing the will of the people.
hopefully less children were murdered
It was never a constitutional right.
"I thought Roe v wade overturn meant the states individually get to decide whether it is legal or not‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt ban abortion nationwide lol. So now people have power over it. You can vote in reps that are for it and therefore will keep it legal in your state, and other can do the same for where they reside. Sounds fine by me‚Ä¶"
Even republicans are softening their tone of abortion I point a recent poll here in Florida where many republicans oppose the current abortion law because if too extreme
"For thousands of years, pagans sacrificed babies on stone altars to appease their false gods or goddesses; now radical people worship at the altar of Planned Parenthood and the sacrifice of babies continue. GOD IS NOT AMUSED. Be ready for judgment coming to America!"
"While I don't agree with the notion of a national ban at 15 weeks, I understand that compromise is part of the game.  We had a compromise - it was on the order of about 20 weeks.  That was since 1973 when after 20 weeks, they'd say the decision was the prerogative of the state instead of the woman.  

Part of the problem with what the GOP wants... is a 15-week ban on the high-end while allowing states to further restrict it below that.  That's not a compromise position.  This art has been lost.  While I can't say what our political representatives would actually agree to, but I think Americans on the whole would probably agree with something on the order of 15-20 weeks, nationally.  But not to allow states to limit it below that.  

Of course, that's not how the game is played anymore.  Democrats would see it as ""caving"" and Republicans would see it as ""giving up."""
"This was always only about removing your PRIVACY in Medical records, which is the part they don't talk about in Roe V Wade. No Politicians care about your abortions. Republican's wanted access to your Medical Privacy, and now they got it. Republican's the party of small government that keeps making laws to try and control you, and they are doing it.

By establishing the right to privacy, Roe v. Wade set a precedent that limits the ability of the state to infringe upon personal medical decisions. The ruling recognized that individuals have a protected zone of privacy within which they can make intimate decisions without unnecessary government intrusion."
"Here's an idea: if you want abortion to be legal in your state, elect lawmakers who will make it legal. That's how we do things in our country."
This reporter has it all wrong. It never was in the constitution. The supreme court turned it over to each of the states to decide.
Birth rates are plummeting even faster that‚Äôs what is happening. Soon will be like Poland with a 1.3 birthrate. Women are scared to even get pregnant now.
abortion is not a constitutional protected right thats where the media lies. democrats had time to codify abortion rights but they will not do that because it gives political points when they have nothing else to use
#TheMediaIsTheRealVirus‚Äº
"abuse it, you lose it"
"During the entire segment Republicans got 5 seconds‚Ä¶this media is bias, no?"
More kids being born?
Abortion should NOT be used as contraception. Your chance of being impregnated by rape (not misguided casual sex) is about as common as winning the lottery jackpot. Self responsibility and accountability and you won't have 6 children by 5 different guys or need for Abortion.
"""Extremists"" is a harsh, bullying word. Why is it ok for our Vice President to name call our elected officials?"
"OK all us human incubators the times ARE GOING backwards we LOST CONTROL of our very bodies men have AND WILL ALWAYS hold control over nothing but a female ,the times nearing when each and every human female must get permission to go outside, eat go to the bathroom and I'm surprised that we get to vote!! Employment well your owner will decideif your work ready  that won't it be good to hand over our existence to our masters!!oh so as long as you are fertile and reproduce your OK but words to the young ppl who got minds of your own better get those evil,EVIL independent thoughts outta ur mind and seek validation from the only ones who can make a thought for you ,  .
BTW this is meant to be sarcastic only so don't go thinking I meant it."
"Women when these characters come to take you to jail for 10 years for over an abortion  issue and you have to orphan your little ones left at home, blow their balls off, give them something to think about. At least while you are setting in prison , you can smile a bit through your worry. Sad that freedom has to be fought for  with guns , that is all  sick tyrants understand. This has been going on since the beginning of time. Freedom has to br fight for."
"Abortion is NOT a Constitutional Right!
Who told these people this??"
"Every 20 seconds an unborn baby is killed in the United States.
 Abortion is the most frequently performed surgery in America.
 95% of abortions are done as birth control.
 1% of abortions are because of rape / incest 
 1% because of fetal abnormalities.
 3% due to mothers health issues .
Abortion doesn't make a woman un-pregnant , it makes her the mother of a dead child that she had  killed"
Do people really not have control of themselves that they are getting pregnant every other month? Really it shouldn't be an issue don't be a ho
If women expect to be treated like adults they need to learn to vote Blue.
"these religious nuts have no place in government. no man has any right over a woman's body. I think it's ironic these pro life people have no plan b for taking care of unwanted pregnancies. a bunch of old white men trying to dictate women's lives for votes, meanwhile they can get as many abortions as they want for their mistresses."
"It was ruled unconstitutional...powers not enumerated in the constitution go to the States.
it was never a constitutional right...
another misleading media hook,  just have a national referendum, it would pass and be legal"
"""eliminate the right to a constitutional abortion"" that is propaganda brought to you from cbs.  i do think a woman has a right to choose. i just dont like the misinformation that is broadcast nightly."
Fake News media stirring the pot again.
Lie Lie lefty media ELIMINATED What constitutional right to abortion? News agency READ the constitution no such right!
"nothing has changed, women can still get an abortion if they want one and then they're taking the easy way out and don't have to worry about a baby which they wouldn't have to worry about if they were using protection in the first place.  women don't want to use it though and i'd like to know what the reason is"
Nothing.....thank you for your time.
"States and their citizens should have the right to decide, not the federal government"
I have A friend's and A neighbor's that have been ganged raped and also some have been raped by one individual because they are Catholic they have had too have them babies. Majority ended up on drug's everytime they look at that baby they think üí¨ü§îüßê of that act that happened too them you mean to tell us in USA.? They don't have enough orphanages they need children out of rape with health issues.
whats changed? more and more women choose to sleep around instead of being loyal and starting families
"Nothing changed, it‚Äôs still overturned and the states still have the right to decide what they want to do about abortion"
"less baby murders, i hope... how many women have died ???"
Less black women are aborting their chikdren.
"There will be no national ban, because the ruling a year ago would be in the way. The SCOTUS decided that it is not a federal matter."
"nothing, the left/lib is more blood thirsty and murderous than ever before."
How is this crap still going on? There is a very simple answer.. Con-tra-cept-ion..
Ugh! Despicable
"What has changed is my fear over losing access to contraception. I don‚Äôt have sex and have few options for contraception due to my disability. Contraception helps regulate some of the hormonal issues my disability comes with, plus hopefully prevents pregnancy should I get sexually assaulted. Getting pregnant would be very high risk for me, and I would rather prevent it altogether. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm allowed a hysterectomy, or tubal ligation, because of some nebulous possibility that I would ‚Äúchange my mind‚Äù."
"Since our Supreme Court justices have proven to be corrupt, their overturn of Roe v. Wade should be appealed & heard at another time, by a different court. In my opinion."
A person that supports abortion should not expect child support.
lamestream media
Nothing has changed.  As easy to get an abortion now as it ever was!!  You really think a bunch of decrepit old white redneck men are going to control American women??!!  üòÖü§£üòÇ
"This is where conservatism confuses me. They're all about personal freedoms and limited government, yet they're determined to interfere with a woman's right to choose. It is not the role of government to take away a woman's freedom of choice. Forcing women to give birth at a time when American public healthcare and social services are the laughing stock of the free world is just cruel and unusual punishment to all."
It should have always been a states issue. Overturn from the supreme court was the right thing to do.
"What would happen if they offered men or woman who were SEXUALLY IRRESPONSIBLE with their bodies and their choices $10,000 to get sterilized ?"
Hopefully what has changed is that this less babies are being brutally murdered
6-3 conservative Supreme Court for a looooooooong time. This is what pisses liberals off the most. The long lasting Trump legacy in full effect.
Nothing much just made a whole bunch of hoes  really really mad üòÇ
"One year after the overturn, it has reduced the unreasonable, unjustified, criminal killing of unborn infants and has enabled many states to save unborn lives."
Liars
Still killing babies
"15 weeks is plenty of time to use abortion as birth control. The left is just trying to rile up their base, because they are doing so poorly"
Congress controls the law not the presidency ‚ÄºÔ∏è
God has given liberals a reprobate mind for denying Him. You see reprobate policies being implemented everywhere. Decline and chaos ensues.
"People talk about ""pro life"" or ""pro choice"" but I see it as a transfer of rights. Giving the fetus rights can be very dangerous, where any action the pregnant woman undertakes would have to be weighed against the rights of the fetus. Driving, flying, taking medication, sexual activity the list goes on. 
Every right we bestow on the fetus is one less right the mother has, in a case where the mother can't safely give birth in a post Row world the right of the fetus to live condemns the mother to death. If we continue to give right's to the fetus we take those rights from the mother to the point where the fetus has the right to live but the mother loses that right."
The question is what will change? Republicans will be voted out. The lying traitor Supreme court will be dismantled.  The liars will be removed.
"Opinion from a Dutch person here! I‚Äôm literally just mindblown about you guys in the US, the Netherlands has one of the most free laws regarding abortion and euthanasia for example. Republicans want the USA to go back in time yet that‚Äôs very dangerous and outright stupid. Please understand that abortions can save lives from mothers to maybe even the baby it self if it‚Äôs born with a birth defect or maybe worse. I don‚Äôt care who you vote in but please keep in mind that changing and abolishing abortion is not progression but rather a step back in time."
"Hi all the babies who got to live! We love you! Always sending things to moms in need and babies in need. We do care and we do help. We have clinics around here to help mothers during and after birth. Opportunities and affordable housing! We are in this together! Don‚Äôt take another life! When it‚Äôs your time it‚Äôs your time! Fear no death, for youll be back. I PROMISE. We are ETERNAL and WANT TO EXPERIENCE CREATION. The meaning to life is to LIVE LIFE AND EXPERIENCE IT"
Pro-life for life!!!!!!!
Propaganda! Supreme Court did not outlaw abortions! They left it up to the states to decide for themselves.
This is all about sperm
Actually when a man masterbates he's killin.
Dang joe has his usual small crowd to cheer for his rants and blunders
"Happy Dobbs Day!
Celebrate this great civil rights victory!"
If you want rights for all then abortion is between Dr and patient. How you all hated to be forced to wear a mask or to get vaxxed. Are you kidding me. Many lives lost cuz you refused to mask and vax
"Biden Admin: ""Those are our children!!""
Also Admin: ""We need access to abortions""

Make up your f-ing minds..."
"I‚Äôll tell you, SeeBS ‚Äúnews‚Äù/democrats what‚Äôs changed: 
All your leftist bull$#!+ is now out in the open where everyone can clearly see, even with all your attempts at censorship and lies!
It‚Äôs a demonstrable massive FAILURE!
The world is on fire and you, democrats, are responsible and you all SUCK!
EVERYONE knows it, including democrats!"
"Yes, we trust the CBS surveyüòÖüòÖüòÖ"
"The reason why Roe V Wade exists was women were getting back alley abortions killing Mother and fetus.  If you care so much for the rights of a fetus we need to show more rights to the living. Gun reform. Food support, lower taxes on middle to poor income households"
Overturning ROE is the end of republican party PRO CHOICE OR LIFE...DEMOCRACY ALWAYS WIN AT THE END...üò§üí™üí™üí™üò§...
"Putting aside personal feelings, what people need to understand is that it was never the responsibility of the US supreme to decide on this. This is what is unique in our 50 states. More government is bad. Women don't have a say so with judges but with their own states they have more power with elected officials than ever before. Take it to the vote. Change your state then"
"We need a Constitutional Ammendment that protects gestating babies in the Womb. There are no protections for the smallest and most vulnerable. They are treated as a commodity to be bought and sold if not wanted by the mother. Aborted babies are sold for their organs, and other body parts. Late term abortion babies may be sold alive because as an "" aborted"" baby they are still not protected. This is evil and grusome. This must be stopped!"
Abortion is health care plain and simple. Voteblue üíô üíô
republicons prefer women as slaves because of their tiny little dinky's...
Love how they try so hard to make anyone who doesnt agree with democrats out to be the worst hate group the country has ever seen.  Democrats lost a battle and they cant stand it so much they say that people who oppose their ideas are worse than Hitler.  This is why I left democrats and became indipendent  too many adult children who cry when they dont get everything they want in a country where people of many different beliefs need to get along.  They are so self centered they cant comprehend something like other peoples feelings on various policies.  It all always has to be hate because only the most hateful people see everything as hateful.
"Praise God for the overturning of Roe vs. Wade!!!!!!!! I was hoping that it would be overturned in my lifetime, but never dared to dream that I would be in my 20s when it was!! EQUAL RIGHTS FOR BABIES IN THE WOMB!!!üë∂üçº"
"Nothing has changed, no handmaid tale lol"
"One year after Constitution finally followed. Oh, and SCOTUS leaker still protected."
Stop lying... it wasn't constitional....
"No one forced Christian believers to go have abortions.  Christian believers should have left others to make their own decisions.  Not everyone has the desire in their heart to follow the same religion, nor the same belief system.    Why is it, that that is so hard to understand?  If people do things which are impalatable to God,  do you not believe that God will personally handle that?   Why do you Christians feel the need to intercede, on behalf of the maker of this Universe? Do you not trust His abilities or power?     Your rules are supposed to govern your members, not the members of the entire planet. You people are over-steppers."
If life was so important why do they only give thoughts and prayers when school kids are shot dead. Instead of passing laws to prevent it????????
People say they are pro life and yet they have no problem with the horrible things that are being done to animals so that companies can sell animal products then.
My investment in a metal coat hanger manufacturing plant is paying off big dividends.
"It's hilarious to me that the same people that want to take away guns, because there's a chance that children could get hurt, are the same people that want to make killing babies a right,

and,

they're the same people that will want your children to go to war.

#EnjoyYourSerfdom"
Without protected access to abortions we will continue to see cases like the 19 year old who gave birth and k*led her baby in the hospital bathroom. Why do women have to suffer at the hands of our corrupt politicians??
Nothing
"Nothing has changed , including democrats telling voters they must vote for them to protect their rights, despite failing to do so for 40 years.  The hubris is almost trumpian."
"Imagine being a Trans individual and saying Abortion bans are a threat to their own lives, and then imagine there's people who agree with them, and then imagine those same people getting to walk amongst the rational and reasonable people instead of being in an asylum where they belong."
Too bad people. You can't over turn it again. Live and deal with it!
The babies would probably be better for our country and the earth instead of the creatures that want them murdered
The thing about these CBS polls is they are POLLING AT THE ABORTION CLINIC UNDER THE GUISE THAT IT IS RELATED ON-TOPIC EXPERIENCE...LOL SO EVEN 50% OF THIER OWN ABORTION CUSTOMERS BELIEVE THAT WHAT THEY ARE DOING SHOULD BE BANNED!!!! LOLOLOL
"I‚Äôm against abortion but I would some what agree for it to be carried out for rape victims. The messed up thing about that tho, is that women who weren‚Äôt raped would use that loophole to say they were raped in order to get an abortion."
How did it change? It brought out the mental illness in the left even more!
"It never was a federal issue, it is a state issue. The left just wants total control of everything."
Cut them up just like they do the babies that‚Äôs all they‚Äôre good for
As someone that leans more right than left Roe v Wade should have never been overturned IMO women should be allowed to do whatever they want with their own bodies within reason
Abortion is not a constitutional right that why it strike down and murdering a baby is not a human right just down have sex if don't want kids
Keeping the division alive
"If it has a heartbeat,  ""NUFF SAID""."
"It's true that unwanted/forced pregnancies correlates with higher crime rates, more government spending,  and less freedom for women. But it doesn't mean I have to feel good about relying on it to make it easier for teachers in classrooms, easier for democrat mayors and police chiefs."
Yall think if we make women who dont want children keep their kid that they will take care of it? Thats the downside these women arent going to care and take care of them.
And yet we still have a suicide hotline! We are going to pick who we saveüòÆ
"Lots of babies weren't murdered. If you hate life, that's a bad thing.
If you LOVE LIFE, like God does, it is a GOOD THING."
Fools
Christian nationalists need to actually read their Bible. How many babies did God ordered killed after he hardened the Pharaoh's heart? Isn't the soul introduced into the body upon the first BREATH of life.

Black democrats promoting Black baby genocide is today's holocaust. üò®
What changed is that I had to drive farther to perform an abortion recently
Men dictate. Things move by force
please support high capacity abortion clinics with in the vile disgusting communist democrat communities
starting with a lie. There is no federal constitutional right to abortion.
"Crude social engineering tool. Government sponsored abortions.  That hides the rot in the inner cities, that lowers crime rates, that lowers government spending on social welfare. Without addressing the root cause. Akin to stories about Spartans throwing their kids off a cliff."
"a bunch of children and rape victims were forced to carry pregnancies to term, some of them medically dangerous. 

a larger bunch of other unwanted pregnancies were carried to term, a bunch of lives were ruined, and a bunch of awful lives began with births that never should have happened. and in twenty years, there'll be a bunch of innocent victims of a bunch of criminals who never should have been born and never had a chance to be anything more because they never had a parent who wanted to be a parent.

the supply:demand ratio for babies in need of adoption got even worse.

American judicial integrity, the doctrine of stare decisis, and the legitimacy of a Supreme Court full of corrupt bribe takers appointed by corrupt presidents elected by minority rule was further eroded.

nothing important, rly, unless you care about other human beings or America. Republicans don't, by their nature."
Thank you media for hiding real news with repeat anger propaganda much like the titanic expedition. Please get the people worked up. We need to hide the Biden corruption before the sheep realize he's horrible leach
Women were given dominion over the bringing of life. Anyone who tries to wrest that dominion from her is doing so against the laws of god/nature/the universe. And is doing so for reasons that could NEVER be considered righteous. And you won‚Äôt get away with it either.
"Biden and Harris are just going to release a lot of hot air for the sake of not losing votes for the Democratic Party, but nothing more. They will never fight for a woman's right to an abortion. I strongly believe that a deal was made behind closed doors to where liberals agreed to give the conservatives a break on abortion, in exchange for conservatives backing down on an issue such as gun control."
I am sure that many of the politicians that claim to object to the overturning of Roe v Wade would be afraid to define a woman as a biological female.
"What's changed?
Many babies weren't assassinated and thrown in the trash like garbage.
That's a good thing.
Happy Dobbs Day!"
"Democrats Hate Democracy , Supreme Court already ruled and the left are still crying üò≠.. same Gullible morons that shouldn't be breeding in the first place"
"Abortion laws have always been about controlling Women. So,  why is it no surprise that the most chauvinistic and conservative party want to ban it? After all, forced pregnancy means more women barefoot in the kitchen, making dinner after church."
It‚Äôs amazing the earth is still spinning and all your lives stayed the same
All these people think women's lives are at risk. I don't care what people think. What are the statistics? How many have died since the law was overturned?
The anti Roe peeps think they will win but they won‚Äôt.
Today marks one day since President Biden embarassed himself on the national stage.
Pretty much one side is whining more and the other is whining less. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs changed.
"Hallelujah thank God, ban all abortion and save the innocent babies"
"It's great the women's tone over June 24th has calmed down.
Republicans don't need to worry about Republican women straying over to the dark-Dems side.
Most of the 1960's twenty something women that supported the right to choose, (because they were tired of being barefoot in their kitchens) are past menopause.  The other women are used to doing what they're told, by these old men in today's Government."
Let me help all of the idiots in the comments section that don't understand that healthcare is not a constitutional right and every Democrat screaming that it's taking away women's Healthcare is lying to your fuckinf face and you're believing it.
"And over 30,000 babies saved in that year. Sounds pretty incredible to me."
Rights that Americans have had for a while were taken away for no reason. Gotta love moving backwards
It's interesting women use the best interest of the child in family court yet don't think being born isn't in the best interest of the child
cBS does its best to divide Americans with moronic videos like this. cBS=CNN
IF YOU DONT WANT TO DRINK YOU DONT.....IF YOU DONT WANT AN ABORTION DONT GET ONE......ITS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS WHAT SOMEONE ELSE DOES ABOUT THIER BUSINESS.....
Got a little less windy around here if you know what I mean.
Close your legs if you don't want an abortion
Women should look at ways to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Plan ahead when having unprotected sex. Take responsibility for your actions.
"It‚Äôs not a right for abortion.

It‚Äôs a privilege for sex without consequences.


Also, has Biden/Congress done anything for abortion ‚Äúrights‚Äù or are they going to promise to do it next election cycle like they always do?"
I say the poll is accurate to say the overturning of RVW is mostly bad for America. Why care so much about a fetus that begins life in the womb? Oh I get it. ‚ÄúLife begins at conception.‚Äù üòÖüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Idiot red states will learn the hard way. Everyone else just listened and learned in school. Oh well. Stupid LOVES the redundancy.
Wow they overturned 50 years of bad science.
Women can still get an abortion. They just have to go earlier not at 9 months.

"""Abortion hurts women"" üôÑ These greenhorns have really no clue what they are talking about."
Gotta love a man leading this group.  Just one extra piece of irony.
I am proudly one
"Pregnancy should be planned, it's an immense responsibility, a life threatening risk, and something that you personally would pour all your life and resources into for the next two decades. It is a great sacrifice, and should only be done willingly. They talk about killing a fetus, but nobody EVER talks about prenatal and postpartum suicides and/or life-long depressions. Mother's mental health should be considered just as much as her physical when it comes to abortions. Nothing worse than growing up in a family in which your mother simply resents you."
"I'm a pro-lifer and I commend these young people for speaking out, and I commend the interviewer for having and showcasing a fair conversation. I can see that the people in the comments are already persuaded, as am I, but this is an important conversation and people don't seem to be willing to have conversations like this anymore."
Seriously if you make a mistake and get a girl pregnant why should you be forced to be a parent

"So why should the government be able to force someone to get vaccinated, but when it comes to abortion, it‚Äôs my body my choice?

"If a woman doesn't want to use her body to feed a toddler and the toddler starves that's fine because  it's her body! She didn't want to use her body to prepare and serve food for her toddler. I would use my body to feed a toddler but I can't make that choice for others. 

It's insane that she would go to prison for that. It's her body her choice!"

"What about MEN??? There are quite a few abortions that wouldn't happen if women had the support and commitment they needed from the FATHERS of these unborn babies. I didn't hear any mention about the MEN at this rally...just a lot of people saying that ""women can do it"" and ""there's support out there."" Why are the fathers being held accountable for abandoning these women after discovering that they are pregnant?!?! There are also quite a few ""men"" who will pressure and push a woman into an abortion...because THEY don't want a child, and THEY don't want the responsibility of paying child support for that child. Abortion is NOT just about women being selfish or not believing they can take care of a baby."
"I'm LGBT, and sometimes, when I see Republicans and successful straight people so happy, I think, am I doing it wrong? What if they are right and their way of life is the best, all of us have strayed, and unconsciously, we're fighting for the right to live lives that are unhappy in the long run. Ugh, but I don't want to marry or have kids ughhh"
"When asked about the medical necessary abortions, they don't even have a real answer. I want to say FU to that woman who said pray. The one talking on the conference, also doesn't give an actual answer cause her ""we can take care of both"" is a lie, but they can't say, we don't care if the pregnant woman dies"
"What specifically do you think the government should do to promote the rights of pregnant women and the unborn?  There are valid answers to this question without incorporating religion, but neither side is addressing it adequately.  I'm a Christian myself, but somehow I manage to get annoyed listening to people on both sides of this issue based on how they are presenting their views and demonizing the opposing side."
"So if a woman is at risk of dying if she carries on with her pregnancy, pro lifers think that prayer will solve the problem. One word springs to mind, deluded."
"Ah, the joys of lifelong religious endocrtrination"
"This is the uniquely American approach to public policy, called ""flip-a-coin"" decision making. It's accurate  50% of the time and it's very speedy."
"XD people realy wonder about this look at what you call ""woman"" the left pushed way way way to far and to hard and now the big pushback will come"
"I understand the need for people to express their views, but once you try to make things into law, you are imposing your ideology on everyone and you need to consider the impact that has. This topic is decisive, but it is at the root a moral based argument. This is why it should not enter the legislative sphere. How can you support a secular nation moving into a booming diverse nation by imposing biblical - based moral related laws? THIS IS A MEDICAL CASE BY CASE ISSUE. If you want to allow your wife's life to pass to save an unborn fetus, you can go ahead and do that. But DO NOT tell me that is what I have to do."
This gives me hope
Is it truly that difficult to respect women and their decisions..?
So many people damaged on their heads.
"Abortion is evil.  Abortion activists lie to women about what a pre-born child is and what abortion does to that child.  I think that anyone who realizes this and still supports abortion ""rights"" is deceived and has a piece of their soul missing.  Science shows us that from the moment of conception, a human embryo - zygote - fetus is a unique human person with unique DNA that has never been before and will never be again.  That person, from the moment of conception, is worthy of equal protection under the law and has a fundamental right to live, just like all other people.  To deny the pre born of that right is evil."
"A mother intentionally killing her child is a tragedy. It's wild to me that abortion isn't seen as a human rights issue by the ""compassionate"" left."
"Even though The Guardian tried to spin this as concerning, I feel really encouraged that movement continues with the next generation. People need a hardcore attitude shift about babies before abortion will end."
"""I am pro life, my daddy/church told me so"""
"It is never medically necessary to have an induced abortion. Though, early delivery may need to happen, other procedures can take place such as a C-section. You can do early delivery without poisoning, dismembering, or starving a child."
That march for life guy with the beanie gives off major sociopath vibes.
A compromise allowing some abortion is justified.

"The world would be so much better if people stopped caring so much about what other people do in their lives, and stopped utilizing religion and ""patriotism"" as a way to justify it."
"Why is it a ""my body my choice"" issue when the unborn are more than obviously not her body? If the unborn d1ies, she doesn't, if she moves, the unborn doesn't if the unborn is born, she isn't. The unborn only shares blood flow, just like two headed people."
"If the left is so pro-choice, why can't it stop its agenda on increasing regulation on every aspect of economy and politics? Are they hypocrites? And are they hypocrites for denying the opportunity of future choice for the incoming unborn?"
"If our civilized species is superior to other animal species due to self control and refrainment from impulse, why is it wrong to ""train"" and impose manners on hypersexual, non precaution highly instinct driven individuals who are kill1ng uborn, potential self controlling and highly functioning individuals?"
People who save innocent lives are heroes! Pro-life for life!!!
"Some people should be parents. Some shouldn't. Being a parent should be a choice, not because you can't get an abortion."
"The role of government is to protect the vulnerable. Abortion is so controversial because there's two vulnerable populations: the unborn and their mother. 
Both sides try to downplay the other, but really a college mom is just as vulnerable as the baby she carries.

In Iowa we have legislation coming through that will limit abortion, but also provide funding for programs that help pregnant mothers get the help they need, before and after birth. I think that's the best compromise"
I'm Christian but I think they're hypocrites. Immigrant children at the border are being trafficked or deported. This is not about the children but hypocrisy at its finest.
Insane!

Hahaha. üòÖ They certainly have that look.
"Reading the comments I only can think about that all people here who are for abortion are alive. 
And let's not forget the pain a baby suffers while being 'aborted'."
"I wonder when motherhood went from something beautiful to being seen as a burden. Is it because of the poor economy? Single motherhood? Was it a cultural shift? Every child has limitless potential, they are the future of your nation, regardless of the stance you are on every abortion is a tragedy. So why do so many young woman feel the need to do it(This is excluding those who needed medical intervention, no woman should be blamed for losing a child to circumstances outside of their control.)."
It is truly disturbing how people in these comments justify killing innocent babies. These people are blind to the truth..

I find it hilarious that people will put so much energy into trying to ban Abortions when there's multiple wars happening (and that have happened) that genuinely devastated the earth more than abortions ever will
If you don't agree with abortions then don't get one! Stop forcing your narrow minded beliefs on everyone else. These people aren't pro life. They are pro birth. Once the baby is born they could care less about what happens to it.

Not to mention potentially criminalizing half the population. 

Denial of access to medical care is the greatest injustice to women. 

Monks don‚Äôt get to decide. Neither do young people who know little about life or the impact of unwanted pregnancy. 

The presume there are adequate resources. In a county where a large percentage of people cannot afford medical care or go bankrupt due to illness, these people are imposing their beliefs on others."
These people seem to have little clue about biology and childbirth.

"If prayer can heal women who need an abortion due to their life being at risk, then that should be the case for any medical needs. We shouldn‚Äôt have doctors or hospitals in fact.

"I think that they should just legalize the cases where someone's life is in danger. 

according to the law in *some* states, any removal of matter from the uterus is considered an abortion, there were cases where some women couldnt get cancer-like growths removed because the law technically considered that abortion.

"These young women haven't faced a terrifying medical emergency yet. They may change their tune. Ultimately this question should rest with the individual. Each woman may choose. I would not agree with late term elective abortion (not medically indicated), because she had enough time to think about it. If the pregnancy is quite advanced, the fetus could survive."
They should allow children to have abortion's without showing proof of r*pe. Btw kidnapping is a 5 year jail sentence and you cannot prove r*pe that happened 2 months ago. There will be 12 year old that would give birth and 5 years later her kidnapper gets released and is looking to have another kid with her.
"I want to see these same people protesting children deaths in Gaza, but that would never ever happen, would it?! That's how you know they are just being worked by their local church."

Why are they selling merch? Is it going to fund the mothers and children?
"praying is like a coping mechanism to anything a christian either doesnt have an answer for, or they know deep down is morally wrong"
The irony.. in campaigning against abortion they make us wish their parents had one..
This is why religion and politics should should not mix. Its ok not to agree with something but you should not inforce your beliefs onto people. I hope these people learn from history
People who say that having an abortion is killing a child must also think that eating an egg is eating a chicken.
"These people should go and adopt all the children who are living under bad conditions. Then they'll understand the strain and stress and misery that a child goes through when they're born into bad circumstances. 
It is well known that throughout history, times when abortion was legal have led to lower crime rates and happier families."
I wonder how many of these people care about the babies that are being killed with their tax money right now.
Too much free time
At least half of those younger folks are trolls
"Most Americans  - including in some Red states that have had referendums like Ohio and Kansas - support abortion availability.

Not enough for the right; not enough for the left. Maybe there is room for a negotiated compromise.
"I'm a pro-lifer, but I dont agree on total abortion such as in instances when the mother is in danger during labor. There is something called therapeutic abortion in which the mom is given a choice to abort her child in moments when both of their life is in danger and she has to choose which life is to save: herself or her child. Therapeutic abortions usually happen when the child to be born has very little chance of living and mom is also at risk of dying due to childbirth.

Obviously, I'm against the abortion due to inconvenience or having no medical reasons. I don't believe in the excuse that bringing a child into a financially poor life would make the child's life not worth living. When there is life, there is hope and possible opportunities. Cutting a child before that experience is totally just an excuse for the mother to get away from the consequences of having a child and her newly imposed responsibilities."

"I hope that every woman has a choice.

As a pro choice person what I am taking from this is that we on the left maybe need to rethink our ‚Äúthe younger generation is overwhelmingly progressive ‚Äú narrative. We have been making this assumption and while it is has validity we cannot ignore that there is a conservative undertow.

"I don't get the argument. The lady says about getting her abortion ""I didn't want to watch her suffer, it would have been very hard. She would have been placed directly onto hospice."" OK, so what is more dignified and less suffering, providing palliative/hospice care for the newborn where the family can be together and grieve, and the baby can be made as comfortable as possible, or literally ripping it limb by limb and disposing of it in medical waste. There's such a disconnect. The lady in her own words said it would be hard for HER."

"So they pray over the mother and the baby til death, right?"

"It should be both legal and banned. Legal for the first trimester. That is enough time for a woman/couple to make a decision. After that, tough cookie. There are plenty of great couples out there who are waiting to raise a child if the mother doesn't want it. The only exceptions should be if the fetus is unhealthy or the mom's health is at risk."
These people are not aware of science. They should talk to gynecologists and patients... And stop trying to impose their ridiculous ideas on people.
"Well then, if a woman has to keep a baby. These people can raise the child themselves."
Because a woman decides to have and becomes pregnant a baby gets the death penalty
"so I watched some of the barbie movie now that the hype has died down a bit and I thought it was alright, for the most part.

"I think Abortions should only be allowed as a medical intervention instead of a service. And I don't accept the rational of all life need to be protected at all cost because what of the mother? Moreover, that kinda similar to the rational of calling everything racist that the far left does because it ignores the realities of life, the extreme use cases where it is needed."

"No, you won't ""abolish abortion"" any more than prohibition controlled alcohol. Women will always go to desperate lengths to end pregnacies they don't want. Always will and always did. Causing harm to themselves and their families. The abortion industry is indeed dodgy, for a start it is linked in with transhumanism and biotech, but that's not a reason to totally ban abortion. Driving abortion into the backstreets, where profiteering would be further complicated by illegality and blackmail is not the answer. As they used to say in England ""The rich to Harley Street, the poor to the backstreet"". Please don't let us go back to those days of knitting needles and septic deaths.

"This is misrepresenting the pro-life community. The majority would agree that if the mother was in a life or death situation, then we have the moral responsibility to try out best to save both. That would include considering a premature birth if possible. Immediately jumping to abortion for the means of convenience is what most people fight against."

I've always gotten the feeling that pro-lifers think that women are just thrilled to get an abortion, ‚ÄúYes, an unplanned pregnancy! Can't wait to for my abortion.‚Äù

Pro-lifers are so obsessed with the fetus/embryo, that they- perhaps willingly- forget that there's a woman at the centre of this. A woman with responsibilities, dignity, and humanity.

If any pro-lifers want to have a cordial discussion, I‚Äôm happy to have it, but if you're just gonna call me a ‚Äúmurderer‚Äù, don't waste my time. I've heard if before."

"So, we go extinct by 2030 from the loss of Arctic Sea ice. And.... we're having kids for.... what????"
"This is fine if atleast America had a proper welfare state. Let's be real most people who want to get an abortion would just give their child up got foster care or adoption if they couldn't get an abortion, so if you want to remove abortion, you have to start with better funding for schools and food banks which starts with higher taxes, which judging by the fact that most of these protestors are conservative, they wouldn't want."
More people are killed each year by abortion than by cancer.
Just an astounding lack of empathy
Abortion is a medical treatment just like euthanasia i suppose üòµ‚Äçüí´Abortion is racist. Abortion is ableist. Abortion is classist. However until welfare is fixed i dont think we should be throwing children into a severe lack of resources. I think the resources for post birth babies need to be fixed first. I think condoms need to be more accessible too to prevent pregnant people/couples being in that situation in the first place. Heres hoping history continues to favor activism for those deemed not human by society.
Ok im against abortion but in some cases its justified. If its ending a mothers life or potentially going to cause serious health probalems. Or in the case that the baby also wont survive.
Thank you youngsters  For keeping Yahweh law‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
someone has to give the unborn a voice
Women want to lose their rights to choose if they want baby or not.
"You must be Born Again.

‚ö†  You have been informed."
"If potential brain-damage was a lawful reason for abortion, these people protesting against abortion wouldn't exist... 
Stop telling others, what they should do, with their bodies!"
Am against late term abortion in a fair society we must protect those who can't protect themself with laws.
"Ugh I lived through the 80s wave of this but we still kept abortion legal in many states.  These people are deluded.  Even when I was a Christian, I didn‚Äôt think it was my right to tell someone else what to do with their reproduction"
Half the country wants a theocratic strongman dictatorship while the other half wants a socialist welfare state. Would be happy with George Bush or Obama at this point.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Next step is to abolish abortion by criminalizing it.
"Then you also need to adopt socialism, free education, free healthcare and mandatory adoption. If you are demanding that every child is born."
Like slavery in the US in the 1850s. Human beings treated like dirt and eliminated.
America is healing
"Why are we still having this discussion in 2024? Keep abortion legal but limited unless in life or death situations. I think up until three months or 12 weeks in plenty. Done let‚Äôs move on. Don‚Äôt ban abortions but also don‚Äôt allow late term abortions unless medically necessary. This is very simple. I partly blame the left for this extreme push back against abortion now. If they had not been pushing and getting laws passed to allow late term abortions like nine months, then I don‚Äôt believe the anti abortion push would be this loud and fervent."
"Im Filipino, abortion is illegal in our country, living in this earth is a miracle and blessing, killing babies is evil."
"CGTN The Point-Hub-Heat, Universal Healthcare-Pharmacare-Maternity-Paternity leave-Poverty alleviation... China has amazing family friendly policies.."
Yes Abortion is bad. its your body? so dont give it out to hundreds of men.
"I'm pro choice, but that doesn't mean I think abortion isn't treated in this disgusting, non-chalant attitude, completely disregarding and denying the gravity action you're taking. The longer you wait, the less ethical it becomes."
"fight all day for the ""unborn"", but they couldn't care less about the already living people suffering in the world"
Wow! Morals üòäüíñ‚ú®
Wow I didn't know The Guardian reported positive news. Keep up the fight America! No one should be killed just for existing!
They are wrong because abortions are going to happen no matter what
Don't be fooled. Most of these people aren't really in it for saving babies. They're in it for the control. To tell you how to live your life
these poor women lack self respect to a depressing degree.
"I hope each of these girls finds themselves if the truly heartbreaking situation of wanting a baby but something tragic happens and the fetus ends up not viable 

But they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsick enough‚Äù in the eyes of the law to receive the life saving care they need. 

Amen"
vile
They are free to pray when their loved ones lives are in danger.  Let the rest of us practice our freedom of choice.
It's like watching a flat-earther convention.
Eesh lots of redditors in the comments
"This group of people are also anti-Women
anti-Black
anti-democracy
anti-medical care for all American Citizens 
Anti- social benefits for poor people and thise in need

Yet they do support immediate capital punishment without getting concrete evidence"
The New Middle Ages
"I don‚Äôt see many minorities in bad areas harassing us in the streets like this about abortion‚Ä¶ 

That‚Äôs telling."
The constitution is not a religious document üòÇ
"""...but this nation was founded as a Christian nation."" THAT IS SO TRUE. 
A LOT americans didn't know their history. they dont know that...men and women were viewed differently. men were the primary parents, protectors, providers, leaders of the home, and teachers of the home and the world! while women were their helpers/assistants. men were the one who had custodial rights over their kids and voting rights. that change with women's rights."
"What about the agnostic people that are against abortion? Their are people I myself included, that think unaliving unborn babies is wrong based on rational moral thinking. The left like to lump this in as wholly a religious issue. They are wrong."
"Your body, my choice...  I like the sound of that"
Abortion is the termination of a human life
"Obviously, Google and Wikipedia are triggered, tagging information about Abortion."
"if you have medical complications, pray. 
like no one ever did that before.
and, using their logic, haven't prayers been answered through medical advances?"
"Based. That's what you get when most of the abortion are because they can't be bothered with a child , not because they got r*ped nor victim of abuse. Abuse the compromise and the other will not put up with it any more , it's simple"
"this is why i love americans, not perfect but fight for the weak people and human right for everyone"
I think we need to fund more initiatives to support child care so that the decision to NOT abort is easier.
"Great, they can all get in line to adopt children, if they have time to hold up signs then they have enough time to go adopt children, you know because they need protection."
Finally
"The Peo-Life moment speaks truth.
It's difficult for Guardian readers to stomach, as they've been fed sweet lies, and truth is difficult to digest for the weak of heart."
8:05 scamüòÇüòÇ
So glad to see young people standing up for the unborn.
I approve and appreciate young Americans fighting against abortion.
Scary.
That's right!
"If you're young, female, not cis hetero, not of the ethnic majority, and/or not rich, and you're right-wing, you're doing something unnatural."
"I wonder how many of these ""March for Lifers"" have donated blood."
"Abortion isn't a ""right"", it's a drastic measure. Exceptions are possible, but normalization is not."
"Let's get pregnant then.
5:12 FUTURE UNWANTED KID"
Nothing wrong in supporting an abortion ban üòÇ
wonder how many going take care of children  in  foster care
Who‚Äôs taking care of the unwanted kids who were born?
"No one calling themselves Christian can support abortion other than in the cases of a serious medical condition. The fact that over 250,000 are carried out in the UK alone each year would indication there is either a massive medical issue with millions of women or it is being used for simple birth control."

"""I dont want to impose what we believe on others"" Well, then just stop doing that. Big hypocrite."
"Condoms. IUDs. The pill. Vasectomies. Abstinence. If ppl were more responsible, millions of unborn children would be living their lives right now"
"_It is my body I can do what I like!_ ... Actually, the DNA shows it is someone else's body."
At last some great news.
What‚Äôs wrong with condoms and the pill?
Lol
"I dunno...its a tricky one. Under certain cirumstances, i would want my future daughter to have a choice"
"""She's loved and supported, just not in the one specific way that will actually support her in staying alive"""
There's a weird squinty look these people have in their lower eyelids when talking about their beliefs. It is kind of uncanny. Anyone else notice that?
It's so weird that it's also an election year isn't it?
Delusional people telling us what to do
I think personal responsibility is better option than abortion. Plenty of contraception options out there
"Yall keep on fighting and protesting. The birth rates will continue to fall completely off a cliff. Check the perfect Asian cultures you rave about. No dating, No relations, No babies."
Praying doesn‚Äôt heal wounds medicine does‚ÄºÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏èüíØ
I urge all to watch Dawkins speak on her Youtube channel. She is very factual and knowledgeable on abortion.
A lot of people don‚Äôt realize that abortions aren‚Äôt just about babies. A tumor removal from a uterus is also classified as an abortion. So by wanting to ban abortions they are making necessary care inaccessible
How the turntables
"3:32 It's always hilarious to see those Glowies out in the open at protests. They never speak to anyone else and always hide behind their full face masks. Plus, they always get into unmarked vehicles. The fact that a Federal agency will have it's agents trying to slander people and cause problems, is cause for concern. They use taxpayer money to try and foment hostility and political tension between citizens."
Another step closer to the Handmaid's Tale future! This is sheer lunacy!
"How beautiful to see all those young women fighting against abortion, there is hope!"
PRO CASTRATION
"Nobody force this people to have abortion. 
If you are pro life,  be pro life and don't tell others what to do with their bodies."
y‚Äôall do know that they‚Äôll make a video with the people that sound most crazy so y‚Äôall believe that the pro-life people  unintelligent? Just in case.
The issue with abortion is that it risks leading to female led eugenics and to the commercialization of human life.
This comment section failed the Vibe Check
"What a joke: Trying skip over dealing with rampant child abuse & neglect, aiming right for banning abortion to feel like hero‚Äôs. 

What about the children that are born and suffer!"
"Let's be honest, these women know most abortions are done on healthy pregnancies and they use edge cases to argue for the majority"
coat hanger sales are through the roof
What a surprise Patriot Front was at that rally....
The Christian Taliban.
"No one has the right to ban it. No one. Just cos you don‚Äôt agree with it, it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs right to ever tell any woman she cannot have control over her own body or her own life. The End."
End abortion now and forever!
this hurts to watch
The amount of suffering these people cause and they don‚Äôt seem to aknowlege any of it
maybe they'll just march off the edge of that christian flat earth
"""My body my choice, except when we want to force you to get the jab"""
"Wow, YouTube. Thanks for the medical advice below my videos."
This is the only Gen Z I'm ashamed of
World gone ü§™  when women got the vote
This how Gilead starts.
"They love the unborn until they're born. Then it's ""who cares about you, fend for yourself"""
Terrifying!
"this whole Ban is only to make people feel better. if a woman wants a abortion and the Country makes it illegal if shes desperate enough she will take a more dangerous option than a medical professional. I bet these Bans will cause more deaths than if they were not in law. they would have to lockup every pregnant woman to be able to enforce the bans. not to mention it would create Sketchy clinics who charge a fortune.

TLDR this is a pointless fight that is impossible to enforce. the woman could just hit herself in the stomach over and over and nothing could be done. Stop creating more dangers than it saves. its a pointless law."
Actually this country was built on the principle of freedom from religious prosecution.  Hypocrite solopsism rampant and unchecked.
‚ÄúAbortion should be illegal‚Äù but some of these crazies say that women who need an abortion should be punished with the death penalty ü§Øü§Øü§Ø Is that really Pro-Life???
Why is it in the constitution that there is a separation of church and state if the country was supposedly founded on Christian values?
Make abortion in available and then lose lives of mothers who cannot carry the fetuses to term üôÑ so much for Pro Life
"""...but this nation was founded as a christian nation."" Nope. 
The First Amendment's Establishment Clause prohibits the government from making any law ‚Äúrespecting an establishment of religion.‚Äù This clause not only forbids the government from establishing an official religion, but also prohibits government actions that unduly favor one religion over another. This nation was not founded as a christain nation."
Are there any non-white people there opposing abortion?
Legal abortion for all States 2024 /
"Why don't these anti abortion people focus on contraception, which can prevent abortions,if they are so gung ho about ending abortion!?"
Tiktok first...then natural rights of unborn children.
"6:28 Wrong, separation of church and state. Credibility of your movement, gone."
why do all the prolifers look the same? doesn't seem like they'd have a wide range of perspectives.
"The right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is based on religious morals. It‚Äôs not just religion, but also the US constitution which should protect the life of both a mother and a child."
This was a refreshingly neutral report by the Guardian. Thank you
"amazing how they're outraged at abortion but the not the children being bombed to death in gaza with their tax dollars, their ""pro life"" stance is just bs"
A man fighting for a choice he will never have to make is ridiculous
I thought this is a country of freedom! Why so many people trying to pose their opinions on other‚Äôs body?
"Just google Project 2025, enough said‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre literally admitting their plan of an overhaul of democracy"
"That girl right at the beginning who said ""abortion is the greatest injustice to ever happen to women in all of human history"".... how much of the world have you seen, really?

also, why don't they pray hard for poverty to end?"
I dont agree with abortion but then im not the one going thru that life changing decision. How about each of these people sign up to adopt a child after an unwanted birth? Then theres no need for abortions. Step up and put your money where your mouth is.
"Okay hold on a minute. Legalising abortion does not mean a woman is told not to have a baby, it just means that the option to abort is there for her in the worst of scenarios! It is her right to decide what to do with her own body. And saying that abolishing abortion is giving freedom to people simply doesn‚Äôt make sense, you‚Äôre diminishing their freedom."

they really should fight to take care of all abandoned kids. instead of forcing their ideas on others.
"OHüòÆ THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE,  people have the Right to choose."
"- But what if pregnancy is threatening health of that woman?

This people are lost. This country main principle is the separation of church and government.
The comment section says it ALL! We want the RIGHT TO CHOOSE!
Separation of church and state.
"6:10 Which are the religions of America residing people that DO NOT oppose abortion?? 
I'll wait...

Apart from that, i did not expect actual impartiallity in a video of a hot topic, which is super rare in todays media landscape. Pleasant surprise to see proper journalism."
Religion is holding America back from moving forward in time. It's like I'm looking at 1960 or something!
The women in tan and orange at 2:54 look like handmaidens (from The Handmaid's Tale).
"Any women who does not want her unborn child should sign over her rights to that child to give it up for adoption once it is born and the US government should pay the living costs for that women and child to live until the day the child is born.  If that women engages in risky behavior that causes damage to the unborn child, then she should be charged with child abuse.  Every human being has a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in this nation guaranteed by our Constitution.  This includes babies."
And these people vote

I'm fairly pro-life but the bit baout medically necessary abortions to just be answred by prayer that was ferral
Those 'pro life' are the first choose the abortion if they need to.
"these types of people aren't new, it's always been a type of thing."
feels a bit negligent to gloss over the presence of fascists at the event ( 3:32 )
"Everyone is pro choice. When you choose to take care of your own children but not other children, that‚Äôs pro choice. When you choose which child to adopt, that‚Äôs pro choice. If the government mandated every open pro life individual or organisation to contribute significantly to raising abandoned children, they‚Äôd drop the pro life label in a minute."

There are so many contradictions about their politics
I want to know if they will have the same response/reaction if their life or a loved one's life was at risk and needed an abortion.

These people are absolutely okay with their own abortion
"A man saying that abortion is the greatest injustice to ever exist in America is absolutely insane. This rhetoric is so deeply rooted in misogyny and entitlement. Let a woman choose what she does with her body during the time frame that she was permitted to.

They make me scary
Just Donald Trump alone is my argument in favour of abortion. Vladimir Putin would reinforce that argument.
"So...if politically the country doesn't abide by your beliefs, political rallies, and marches, (actual physical and social actions) are necessary ways to change things. But if a woman is caught in a life-or-death situation...prayer's enough. Why is prayer (a supernatural action) selectively effective?"
The abolition movement means a full ban. They don't believe that there are exceptions for the mother's life. If you die it's 'God's will'
"It's wild to me how few Americans have their facts straight about their founding fathers. They were progressive thinkers (for the time - I know, I know) who were didn't believe that religion had a place in government"
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to impose my beliefs on anyone but I‚Äôm here advocating to impose my beliefs on everyone‚Äù üòÇ
Do people change their opinions when presented with counter arguments? Do people ever change their opinions and what causes it to happen?
6:25 This is what listening to pretend Christian Trump looks like
You can also match to end gun violence and try to adopt some babies.
I wonder how many of the natalists in this video are pro-death penalty?  ü§îü§îü§îü§≠
You mean the forced b√≠rther anti surv√≠vor movement. Abortions being illegal is literally emboldening (child) predators.
"The founding father made sure this was not a Christian nation,pure ignorance behind that statement."
"America once stood for enlightenment, democracy and civilization. Now religious fanaticism, the disastrous school and education system and the unbridled free market seem to be making these achievements recede. The pro-life movement, for example, is a symptom of this organized stupidity."
"It's kind of terrifying when faced with the realities of the situation their response is, ""just pray about it."" If the mother and/or fetus ends up passing away, then it was a god's plan for that to happen. If the fetus manages to live but has life long complications, it was god's plan for that to happen. If the fetus survives but the mother dies, it was god's plan for that to happen. Meanwhile, apparently if the mother had alternative plans they are irrelevant."
"Yeah, she has two other kids already, and an abortion would save her life, but they want her to just PRAY??? What about HER life??? HER life IS SACRED, you mouth-breathing virgin. üò°"
"Rhythm is a dancer, religion is a god damn cancer."
"Abortion was legal for years in the beginning of America! Benjamin Franklin wrote a How-To pamphlet on abortion, for crying out loud. üôÑ"
lol this is NOT the majority lol
"Women have aborted, abort and will abort as long as humans are around. You can‚Äôt change that. Having a child is an enormous responsibility and not being wanted by your parents is tragic."
"Oh look, a religious group celebrating forcing their beliefs onto others, while not being cognizant of what they're doing. 

*shocked pikachu face*"
"""I don't think Christians should impose their beliefs on others, That's why we need Christian laws."" Even if I agreed with this nonsense, that thinking makes no sense."
"I hope they are all out fighting for healthcare for all,safe neighbourhoods and against child poverty and homelessness and against violence and #ape against women,low wages,paternal/maternity paid leave,support for kids in care,wealth inequality,gun laws restrictions,mental health support....and all those other things which enable a life of dignity and REAL choice and freedom.
What the hell do any of them know about bringing up a child in poverty or without support and why don't they go and stand up for better healthcare,education,housing,wages,childcare......telling women they ""can do it on their own..there is support out there .."" also they care so much about the taking of a life..what about protesting against selling of arms to corrupt regimes who use them to destroy innceont lives including thousnads of children"
These beige+orange looks are CULTY!!
Churches need to pay taxes.
Abortion is healthcare. Praying is not. Simples.
How many of these people have ever had an extended conversation with someone who has terminated a pregnancy?
"I know it's an old argument, but the guy at the start says he wants to 'fight for the defenceless' so I'd ask if he will continue to fight for these fetuses once they become children, to make sure they don't live in poverty, get health care - you know all this but just needed to say it once again."
American christians love forcing their dog shit down everyone's throat.
"6:16 girl, I‚Äôm a Christian too but you can‚Äôt say the country they are in was founded as Christian when the land was taken from the indigenous!"
"Few things as gross as telling someone with a life threatening illness that the solution isnt medical intervention, its ~ to pray ~"
"Straight white Christians forcing women to carry an unwanted fetus to full term, even if they were raped or if it kills them from the inside? That‚Äôs America for ya. Freedom for some and justice for none."
End abortion
"Hey look....opinionated white people! Republicans feigning support for children...until they're born, then any semblance of social assistance like welfare or a school lunch program is leeching off tax payers."
Good. Now we know thier faces.
Nice to see young people who still care. 100% of the babies who were aborted would have wanted to be alive. Dont take that opportunity away from them. Don't have sex if you're no ready to have kids. It's that simple.
"For every abortion they stop they should be made to adopt or pay to care for that child OR pay because that woman is suffering bad mental health or is unalive do to her legally not being able to get one and then was bleeding out ( for example)‚ùó
Also all these peopeo are of one shade of people and could be very well off. ‚ùó
I promise you. No amount of government support is gonna give a kid a father or their mother back. Kids are not always a blessing in some situations. They could be born very sick and suffer.
 A woman said she would not abort a couple's child as a surrogate because she vould feel them kick. She even asked for more money when they offered to pay 5k-10k. She left the state. Gave birth. Dumped the poor kid with someone who was blind, deaf, couldnt speak, smile, or react to any stimulus. They child lived until 8. Literally a vegetable. 
A mom wanted her kid born even though he had NO brain or little to NO brain!!!! Like maybe 1-9 percent. He did nothing for almost 2 years. 


Pro life doesnt care about those here other wise they would take prisoners off death row, kids would have nutritional foods to eat, single parents would be HEAVILY supported and not wait up to 5 years to have a housing, a choice of any daycare of theie choice paid for, education for rhe child is paid for as well as her cause they ""care about moms"" and MORE ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó"
Absolutely they are imposing their values and religion on everyone and the US was NOT founded on Christian values.
"Abortion is the woman's decision, not the state's."
Weird üò∂
"It is fine to have an opinion and do what you can in your power to empower those around you and galvanise pressure and votes.

The thing that seems tricky and dangerous is when the person/s equate morality with religion. 

This is because you can be moral or immoral without religious values telling you what to do 

And especially because religious values can be interpreted, misjudged or even abused or indoctrinated. 

This is especially the case of imposing values that are thousands of years old on issues of the current era which can lead to both an interesting discourse or a misleading one"
Fanatics...
"The USA is in a very very bad place now, it is the beginning of the end if any of these Christian nationalist  get their hands on the football they will throw it, it'll be their holy war they have yearned for for centuries also remember they think they have an escape hatch they call it Heaven."
"Wow, none of those kids have any idea what the real world is. All wrapped up in their privilege and indoctrination.  
Not one of the children asked that hard question was able to give a real answer. Oh, we would pray with them and support them, but not agree to letting them be saved?
Every day, the news coming out of that country makes me more and more grateful I wasn't born there. 
And that dreadful female claiming they don't mean to impose xtian values on non xtians... but this cuntry was founded on xtian values, so.....
Don't they realise that xtianity is just pure unadulterated gaslighting? And how dare they ignore victims of rape, they want to force women to carry their rapists child to term? They want to deny those women the morning after pill because it might kill a few cells that might turn into a child? 
They don't have any answers for the consequences of this foul campaign, they're just having fun screaming for a law that denies women control over their own bodies. At least half of the girls in those protests will grow up and realise the in the worst possible way just how gaslit they actually were and how vital reproductive health services actually are for them and having access to abortion is vital."
"This country was founded on freedom of religion, some of these people are nuts"
And none of them are willing to adopt
"Kristan Hawkins is highly unlikely to experience the consequences of her actions, she looks as if she would have insulin resistance minimum, which makes conception hard. She also does not look like the kind of person to suffer a date rape."
"Abortion is the Ultimate Control Attempt by Men over Women, nothing to do with saving a life, etc... "
Anyone have a translation for the woman at 5:30?
"Abortion is healthcare. As a woman i am happy to live in a pro choice state. 

States that ban abortion will lose talent and women. As someone who works in healthcare do you think i will ever move to those states ??? Absolutely not.


Abortion not for you? Your choice. I respect it. Please respect everyone elses choice.


P.s. prayer will do little to bring a person back from sepsis/dying. And we should respect all religions and their beliefs. Not one above  another."
Anti - abortion to produce soldiers.
"""When there is socitial injustice you cant care what people think, so long as you fight for the right cause"" 

Genuinely a terrifying logic in my opinion.... I just find all these people's logic baffling, who are these people to say what people can do in a supposedly free country. They dont have to have an abortion but why should they deny others?"
They are rich so they can afford kids.
"Seriously, extreminist Religious women are destroying the European and Americans movements for feminism for the last centuries. 

Women in the past would revive form their grave if they knew modern women are these nuts.

Anyway, people have tendency to be unempathetic if they did not experience the pain and sufferings of being rape, and among other things. Heck, They did not read the history 

As a man, its very frustrating to proect gender equality if there are some women who are buts to abandon their rights for their misguided sense of justice. üôÑüòÖ

They were like western Muslim women who taught Muslim are for women and lgbt are for Muslims.
Sorry to break it to them but all theocracy hate women and that's a fact. üòÇüòÇ"
This shouldnt even be a debate. How many of these people eat meat for example? Why is it okay to kill a lamb or a chicken and not an unwanted phoetus? Life is life but it has to have dignity. And coherence.
america is beyond help at this stage
All white‚Ä¶.so funny‚Ä¶.
"Protesting is not the most efficient way to bring down the numbers. These people don‚Äôt even really care, but celebrating themselves. If women are criminalised some will turn to medically unsuitable places and methods."
The Handmaids Tale is a rom-com for America‚Äôs religious rightwing.
"My question is simple: ""Who do you think you are?"""
Those old asses denied rights for WOMEN. A great injustice
"Where‚Äôs the help? Instead of saying there‚Äôs help out there show were single mothers can get the help they need I‚Äôll wait‚ÄºÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è the homeless rate are rising, we have a failing üò¢ adoption system, these kids are being forced out at 18 becoming homeless if she gets rape she will be forced to keep it how about women who are at risk of dying is that okay? If you want women to keep there babies than make laws the support families instead of sending our taxpayer dollars to fund wars overseas, maybe you should save the lives that exist now."
"This is some cult-like stuff, banning abortion is the most stupid thing."
"Hitchens was right: religion poisons everything. Keep your imaginary friend and your mythological delusions out of politics.
Christian nationalism is an highly dangerous and extremely toxic neo-fascist ideology. 
It is a fundamentalist far-right ideology, based on a strategic alliance between the far right and the fundamentalist Religious Right, aiming at establishing a US theocracy. It advocates for a society in which minority rule by white, conservative Christians is enshrined, democracy be damned."
What would you do if someone's life were in danger if they continued with the pregnancy - I will pray with her .  NO!  these people are crazy
the level of the stupidity makes this cringe af.
America has become feral
GLORY TO CHILDFREE üè≥‚Äçüåà GLORY TO ABORTINGüè≥‚Äçüåà
"Under-educated fools, religious bigots and the US far-right. The result of decades of anti-scientific disinformation and religious indoctrination."
Yes... Yes... And .. YES.
"Fucktards, all of 'em."
Look at all these crazed individuals.
They don‚Äôt wanna terminate the pregnancy but they don‚Äôt wanna do anything for raising the unwanted child. Kind of sad. These women don‚Äôt have health insurance so they can‚Äôt pay for prenatal care they can‚Äôt pay for delivery care they can‚Äôt pay to raise their child hypocrisy of these individuals is astounding 1:31
