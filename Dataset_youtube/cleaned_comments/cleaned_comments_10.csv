they are not going to clarify anything except take away more of our right
if your amniotic fluid broke at 18 week the doctor should have been able to determine whether the fetus wa viable through a csection or not lastly the should have been able to determine whether her life would be at risk especially since the fetus would no longer have the safe environment of the amniotic sac this sound more like gross negligenceoversight and had nothing to do with the abortion law condolence to the family and glad she is physically safe now
sue texas screw these stupid law and impeach the supreme court politics need to stay out of the medical field
this whole story is b what they described is a miscarriage not an abortion they claim the doctor told them tough noogies our hand are tied because we cant read the law 50 of the story wasnt told notice they have only the interpretation of 2 traumatized biased activist people with no legal or medical education what do the doctor have to say they didnt ask the doctor any question about the case no doctor is going to send her home and say whoop maybe youll live or maybe not we dont know what to do with a pregnant woman or baby in the written article the woman claim they reasoned that it would be too dangerous to drive 8 hour to cross state the line to obtain a legal abortion in a neighboring state but waited 3 day at home wo using her prescribed antibiotic and developed sepsis really smart choice tx law b the prohibition under subsection a doe not apply if 1 the person performing inducing or attempting the abortion is a licensed physician 2 in the exercise of reasonable medical judgment the pregnant female on whom the abortion is performed induced or attempted ha a lifethreatening physical condition aggravated by caused by or arising from a pregnancy that place the female at risk of death or pose a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced and 3 the person performs induces or attempt the abortion in a manner that in the exercise of reasonable medical judgment provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive unless in the reasonable medical judgment that manner would create a a greater risk of the pregnant female death or b a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant female c a physician may not take an action authorized under subsection b if at the time the abortion wa performed induced or attempted the person knew the risk of death or a substantial impairment of a major bodily function described by subsection b2 arose from a claim or diagnosis that the female would engage in conduct that might result in the female death or in substantial impairment of a major bodily function d medical treatment provided to the pregnant female by a licensed physician that result in the accidental or unintentional injury or death of the unborn child doe not constitute a violation of this section thats not so difficult to interpret that the hospital lawyer and doctor would do what this article claim
let deal in fact it ha already been put that the doctor wa incorrect and told so by legislation unfortunate a it is it to be expected when measured against the lose of life of unborn human this isnt extreme
obviously these so called prolifers dont care about any life at all all they really care about is control and power no matter at who expense
these stupid politician dont know how to balance
so shes alive and this is just to make a point weak
that doctor is at fault obviously she wa in a state of life threatening doctor shouldve done his job thats not legislation thats malpractice
this is extremely sad and my heart break for them and everything about this situation i hate saying because im nurse but i knew this during my clinical rotation in ob that after a woman ha been in labor for too long after her water break you give antibiotic it open surface and any organism love them a well a if a woman that test positive for strep b you automatically hang antibiotic a soon a they go into labor to protect the baby i dont care if she wa about to miscarry she should have treated like anyone other woman with a viable baby that water broke too early this womanhusband might now be able to have a baby now it just go to show how twisted some people can be in their own belief when they choose a living human over a baby they say wont survive i highly doubt this is a doctor mistake because they would be suing for malpractice too
i dont underestandher water broke and they said there wa nothing they could do why didnt they perform a c section or an induction and try to ssve the baby and if the baby died and she got an infection they still should have done a c section or an induced delivery those doctor are idiot a a doctor you took an oath to provide your patient with the best possible healthcare so they can live happy and healthy life but her water broke too soon and these doctor just go damn that suckssorry umm sound like a personal problem they should be charged
if i were to become pregnant and see the baby had no brain stem and the doctor said this baby is not going to be viable or if they told me you and the baby could die from this and see the baby and i die my thought are one they can do medical research testing on me and my child learning from my child and my death we do not know god plan if we are meant to die then we are meant to die for a certain cause maybe trust in god not mankind
the difference is an abortion kill a living developing baby this is very different this is a situation where a baby ha died but wa not expelled which is bizarre because if your water break you usually start labor and deliver very shortly afterwards if anything she should have been given oxytocin if labour didnt start it seems to me like something is missing here
story sound traumatic and horrible but i cant believe anything cnn promotes can we fact check this
she almost died from septic shock she wasnt developing sepsis this is absolutely abhorrent and the medical professional should be punished
sue texas broke texas is a dumpster fire of regressive barbaric ethic
the way these bill are mean doctor have to wait till what they know will be life threatening becomes life threatening
there wa zero need for an abortion early delivery shouldve been done straight away either with an induction or c section her doctor are idiot thats the real crime here not an abortion ban
so how did they remove the baby did they give her a csection or did they do the same process a an abortion
texas is the battle ground state all you selfrighteous yankies get your ass down here and fight with u the fascist would never win another election if you did
this is absurd listen i am prolife but when i woman fucking water break you deliver the baby you dont have to abort it first but they should have delivered her ugh prayer for her experience im sorry for your loss
texas yall got ta get your shit together you continually fail to make change and actively contribute to killing people everyday
she wa sepsis my god they waited until she wa on her deathbed before she got the healthcare she neededbarbaric vote blue to protect our democracy our freedom in the 1800s pioneer woman died in childbirth quite often because they had no proper healthcare care available pioneer day have long since passed or have they i wonder if the people who outlawed medically unnecessary abortion would be ok with their pastor wife being left to die or their wife or their daughter pro life my foot if your religion requires you to be left for dead thats your choice others may want to live that should be their choice
the allornothing attitude toward abortion is not a solution it is a problem amandas harrowing story at a committee meeting in texas wa ignored by cruz and cornyn both thats what i have a problem with maga mobster who clearly think that they already know everything there is to know they think they own this country
soo sorry to hear that you guy went through thisi say this with tear in my eye
oh yes you can finally have an abortion when youre hour away from dying like wtf
explain this to me in relation to abortion law most republican are pro life but in relation to gun law most republican are pro what selective outrage is real and the motivation is not life it greed
really feel for the woman who will go through this in texas and other state willing to curtail personal liberty and access to health care
the gop have shown and time and time again that they hate woman theyre not pro life theyre pro misogyny and patriarchy
medicine doe not end at conception
inhumane to treat woman like this
for the men that want to control woman and are happy with this shlt controlling monster law yall will get back the fck fired mostly on the red state there going to be a big wave of woman not wanting to date menhookupserious relationship or even marriage because they will be god damn scared to be pregnant basically sperm is going to be considered a weapon so get ready to either be gay or accept trans woman a your new girlfriendwives intimidate partner get either your ball snipped or be single forever without any woman sleeping with you this only go for men that support this law im not saying all men i know there amazing men out there that are against this and respect woman and are decent human being
shes lucky she didnt lose all her limb from the sepsis or die like savita halappanavar in ireland
nonsense what a poor story shame on you cnn
there also another scenario when a woman get pregnant and need to go through chemo for cancer or something like that
it aint prolife it exchanging one for the other oh and btwfor some of those people saying that it only 1 percentyou wouldnt feel that way if it wa you in that group and that 1 percent of a population of over 300 million is about 34 million people forcing woman to give birth is a form of mass murder and torture especially if it forced nationwide let me know when you feminist are done playing game with the men drop your failed ideology and join with the gynarchists to form gynarchic community they are murdering woman with these law and they wont stop with abortion some of them have gone online and advocated to take away your right to vote sooner or later submissive straight woman and their dominant men will strip away your civil right after decade of arguing discussion of tireless education what did that bring you there still rape and sexual assault sex trafficking is on the rise internationally your civil right are under assault your issue are downplayed minimized ignored denied and your dignity and autonomy are trampled on daily by men who care nothing for you beyond what you can do for them is this the kind of life you want for yourself no more argument or discussion with the men who keep abusing woman and their enablersits worthless become business owner form gynarchic intentional household then community learn brazilian jiujitsu etc economic physical and social power will get you a lot farther than wasting your time elsewhere real power is what you can earn for yourself and frankly power is the only quality that men respect at the end of the day to the men out there who have made themselves enemy of woman and their right you waged a war against the third and fourth wave of feminism because you were afraid of people like me and of woman ruling ironically those people you attacked werent gynarchists at all all they wanted wa to have the same privilege and to be treated with fairness and respect however i know what youre like in private and what are lot of you really are when your mother sister cousin and aunt leave the room the reality is that men in general will never see woman a equal and will keep shining them on until they inevitably strip away their right it all tactical for them and once they finally manipulate you into a position of political vulnerability youll see what they think of you you were afraid of me and my brother and sister and perhaps you were right to because there no evidence youll ever change collectively youll learn that unlike the feminist gynarchists have no fear unfortunately for you we cant be bargained with and wont listen you had your chance with the feminist to be reasonable and you threw that out the window it interesting that you attacked them when you know nothing of what authentic gynarchists believe or why we think the way we do in a way i thank you for doing this because it showed u how you think and operate and what your weakness are gynarchists are doer not talker selfcultivation is the path to salvation not waiting for the ethical and moral development of men and even if they do get what they want do you honestly think thats a good use of your time arguing and discussing thing with people who are going to do what they want to anyways regardless of what you say coding mathematics science workrelated skillsthese are the key to winning in life and it a real investment of your time to the dominant woman and submissive men the time is coming for u to join together to fuse our energy and bring balance to gaia there is no need to smash the patriarchy patriarchy are selfsabotaging and selfdestructive when the men have finally fucked up beyond any doubt and the culmination of the cycle of resentment destruction abuse and violence leaf billion in it wake our time will come survive and thrive my sister and brother
texas republican will live to see brown immigrant breed them out of existence
these law are insane
abortion is murder
republican dont care they want to torture woman
ohhh so sorry are you being subject to the consequence of your belief and action
based texas law
well it wa the woman fault for getting abortion and killing her own child
every man or woman who want an abortion must be sterilized playing parent is for mature people who are responsible for their sexual conquest
a long a people like them live in texas theyll always be in a prison like environment without any control over their own body the only solution for them is to relocate to a state where the state government doesnt interfere in their personal life
if she died that is one death compare that to 50 million baby murdered since 1973
i am so pissed this isnt right and now these people may never be able to try again for another child because of something preventable
they could have not listened to the doctor and had faith but no they speak nothing but negative now and are used by a network that drip feed child murderer who are desperate to fck and kill
old white men who control texas decide when a woman can get medical care or not they way they feel is woman are nothing more than a host for a baby
absolutely horrid and a total shame
not being able to murder a baby did what
almost only count in horseshoe
this woman wa sacrificed to make a stupid point the fact that the law wa vague at the time wa all the more reason to go ahead and perform the life saving procedure it wa a stupid defiant excuse to wait and not help this woman why do people have to be so extreme is balance too hard of a concept for human on one side they want to abort all and on the other side they want to separate none from the mother none why not isnt that what the nicu is for also how difficult is it to check for a heartbeat the baby wa obviously on it way out they could have checked for a heartbeat everyday until there wa none they could have induced labor they maybe could have replaced the amniotic fluid and repaired the sac
i am glad she cant have kid because having kid is selfish and horrible but i am also glad she still got to get the abortion pro life should really be called pro sadist because they only want you born so you can suffer they only care about u when we are not born once we are born they just want u to suffer thats why i wish all woman would get an abortion because every abortion save a child from being born in this trash world i am for everything trump doe but the abortion ban are the only thing i dont like because i am only for abortion because i wish i wa aborted and every time an abortion occurs a child is spared from being born and having to deal with this corrupt government and crooked school system hopefully she wont be able to have kid because it not a good idea to force another human being into this trash but i am also glad that most woman know that when abortion are banned they can just end the pregnancy themselves thats what most woman do anyway they either end the pregnancy themselves or go out of state abortion ban only stop clinic not the actual abortion thank you to all the woman out there who had an abortion you saved a child from this trash world
the infection is not what caused the scarring it wa the abortion abortion cause scarring and damage to the uterus because it cause trauma to the tissue
sound like the doctor killing people cause theyre afraid of liability
there so many people being killed why because their being told that life ha no value do you value life give the baby a chance do to others a you would have them do to you matthew 712 if the table were turned would it have been okay for your baby to abort you instead repentbelieve in god son jesus he love you and can change your heart
maybe people should care le about an unborn child and more about actual fully grown human being people are getting dumber by the day
sue the texas legislature and sue the hospital
the texas woman who voted for abbott and the texas gop i have no sympathy for you when you find yourself in this situation this is what you voted for beto would have got rid of this extreme law sb8
that is awfulsmh ridiculous
abortion killing in horrible pain of unborn child abortion by saline injection feel like being burned alive while abortion by curettage rip off all the child body part imagine how that feel the nervous system is already developed at 6 week so that the pain these child feel are very real but unlike proabortionists they do not have a voice to express themselves with the exception of the pregnancy that put the mother life in danger which are very rare abortion should be illegal if a driver kill a pregnant woman on a pedestrian crossing that driver face two charge for murder in that context the life of the baby matter instead if his mom decides to kill him in horrible pain suddenly that is not a crime anymore
well this really wasnt an abortion because the baby wa essentially dead already needle to say no doctor wanted to touch her for fear of being sued or prosecuted texas antiabortion law probably need to be tweaked
to hell with greg abbott and to hell with this rotten anti abortion movement
do a caesarean and try to save the baby prob wont make it but thats more prolife
this is totally b they let people have abortion in life threatening situation incest or rape another out right lie of the radical enemy of the people cnn not surprised some people need to wake up their book smart but dont have any common sense what so ever yall better learn your right so people and establishment like this cant incite and brain wash you
baby this age are usually born totally fine without any complication if your water break before 34 week your doctor will probably give you antibiotic to fend off potential infection plus steroid to help your baby lung develop you may have to stay in the hospital to be monitored for sign of labor
none of cnns story made sense medically if her water broke she should have been made to deliver the baby when your water break it doesnt mean your baby is going to die it mean you have to give birth cnn is getting desperate like wtf
such a disgusting lie you dont perform an abortion for pprom you induce labor cnn is lying through their teeth right now virtually all abortion are performed to terminate an otherwise healthy baby
what an awful situation
i wa certain comment would be turned off another unnecessary tragedy hope they had the best insurance you can buy being bankrupted is the next notch in the american way
imagine having to keep a decaying dead baby inside your uterus becasue of the government
dont tell the truth here and expect it to stay tried twice now and realized it wa cnn move on
im a christian so obviously i heavily disagree with abortion no one i know is for it so i want some people to reply why it right especially prolife christian i want it to be a respectful debate so i can understand why you people think abortion is right
this doesnt make any medical sense whatsoever if your water broke delivery should have been induced none of this add up but keep pushing this propaganda a if it factual
if the doctor cant set his foot down and say the only way we can save the woman is to deliver the baby and pray work and hope the best for the baby the doctor lace bone in the nose and should not be a doctor and that people working in heltcare are turning this uppsid down putting people at risk to make a point and te point being we dont have the ball to stand upp for life just hiding behind the law of no abortion to not take a needed desision of delivering to save the woman is putting bouth the life at risk i am pro life all the human life and sometimes hard desisjons have to be made bretter to save one than none but if possible tray to save bouth
when pregnant the cell of the baby migrate into the mother bloodstream and then circle back into the baby it called fetalmaternal microchimerism for 41 week the cell circulate and merge backwards and forward and after the baby is born many of these cell stay in the mother body leaving a permanent imprint in the mother tissue bone brain and skin and often stay there for decade every single child a mother ha afterwards will leave a similar imprint on her body too even if a pregnancy doesnt go to full term or if you have an abortion these cell still migrate into your bloodstream research ha shown that if a mother heart is injured fetal cell will rush to the site of the injury and change into different type of cell that specialize in mending the heart the baby help repair the mother while the mother build the baby how cool is that this is often why certain illness vanish while pregnant it incredible how mother body protect the baby at all cost and the baby protects rebuilds the mother back so that the baby can develop safely and survive think about crazy craving for a moment what wa the mother deficient in that the baby made them crave study have also shown cell from a fetus in a mother brain 18 year after she gave birth how amazing is that if youre a mom you know how you can intuitively feel your child even when they are not therewell now there is scientific proof that mom carry them for year and year even after they have given birth to them i find this to be so very beautiful just a clump of cell right
prefers the castration cry from school kid due to school imposed sex change
the republican church thats too bad but our imaginary deity still want u to force all woman and girl to comply with our religious belief
i call b save the baby momma going to hell
why do they continue to vote for abbot against their self interest he just won reelection despite all the thing he done and continues to do
texas is a pro life state murderer of innocent baby need to live elsewhere we dont have 20 pro life city in the state for no reason
the gop do not care about this they dont care to them a few dead woman here and there a few woman in icu who become infertile after being denied treatment this is a price worth paying dont expect sympathy or revised law from the gop they do not care about anyone other than the fetus right up until it born then if you dare ask for assistance you are a deadbeat welfare cheat sucking the nation dry on benefit
abortion should remain legal but only for liberal same a suicide
well i hope all you anti abortion people are happy
so it apparent the baby died
my mother is a cps worker and saw she wa so upset and asked her what wa wrong she came to see a child that wa in a watchlist she found out the girl wa pregnant shes only 13 she wa molested how can she be a mother shes barely trying to figure out her life i dont understand why a child need to be forced to have a child i dont understand why people choose to point finger at woman who arent even ready to be mother yet there is nobody doing anything to help out in adoption center
there is nothing in texas that prevented amanda from receiving the medical procedure to remove the already dead baby this is not an abortion and not related to pro life bill in any way these are activist doctor who played with a woman life rather than giving her the care she needed we now have activist pretending to be journalist using this woman tragedy to further an agenda to electively murder a many baby a they can you people are vile
i love how abortion is murder but creating a law preventing a woman from being saved when shes dieing isnt what the actual fuck this is such a violation of woman right is sickening
these antiabortion fantastic need to say out of people business
what this coouple went through is horrible and inhumane on multiple level and what happened to them make me very glad to be living in california
and 63459 781 baby girl and boy have actually died because over 63 million woman were given one
i think those election need to be scrutinized gone over with a fine tooth comb he cheated i know it
she need to sue greg abbott the caveman
so tell me how did the caveman abbott get reelected dont get pregnant in texasthats all i got ta say
so im guessing the killer mom killed the baby
what i want to know is did she voted for gop politician who pushed for abortion ban if she did then shed need to shut and put up with gop policieslaws what did woman in these red state think when theyre voted for republican politician republican politician do not advocate for woman
i am a republican and i am first hear say how sorry i am for amanda next these abortion law need to be for cause between a woman and doctor but only for the right reason not just to get an abortion because you dont feel like you want to be pregnant that is murder
it always a bad idea for ignorant politician to make decision that a doctor should make
rightwing and christian conservative dont care if you almost die after being denied an abortion they care if you have sex
how all the baby died in the abortion
i had severe sepsis after getting some of my bowel removed i wa septic for 3 day and wa told it wa in my head i prepared for death and everything told my parent not to come visit me that day i wa very very lucky because usually when sepsis symptom show itself it already too late wa revived 4 time in the or
awful yes but this is a very isolated event doesnt happen very often leave it to cnn to push an agenda and try to make the public believe it a national emergency just like covid which wa b too
now do one about how thousand of child die daily because theyre aborted
let people make their own choice and let god discern their heart not you people wish they were master over others smh grow up
thats what you get for living in texas a state where people elect a government that enjoys your suffering enjoy 4 816 possibly 32 more year of this happening to woman in texas where god gun and football are more important than your freedom
abortion is a disgusting act but abortion should only be applied under certain circumstance it shouldnt be i got pregnant i dont want the baby i am not ready my body my decision type of reasoning to get rid of the unborn because that would only promote irresponsibility on both men and woman on her case on other hand the doctor or the hospital should have done something about and put it into detail why she is required to have one it is their responsibility to defend the need of their patient since it a life threatening case it is common sense im prolife antiabortion again abortion isnt applicable to all so dont abuse it
this is beyond ridiculous and barbaric in 2022 she almost died amd now likley cant have child it like the government in the u have zero education common sense and empathy come on we have the resource to help and save life relieve suffering what happened to her medically wirg the pregnancy wa tragic enough this is not the 1700s
some lawsuit need to be filed
of all people you would think that oppressed victim would be the one to care for these little one every man for himself i guess or shall i say every victim imagine a world where people dont care about baby being murdered in the womb and where life itself isnt a basic human right now add a zombie apocalypse and rant about justice and equality or here one stop controlling my life followed by fighting for the power to snuff out someone el life yes i need the freedom to snuff out a perfectly healthy little baby in the womb because im against crazy people trying to control woman you just cant make this circus show up it pure comedy yet still very twisted and sick
you all in texas still put back the idiot in power so
remember the republican are the prolife party
basically turning a perfectly healthy baby into hazardous medical waste is now healthcare via a woman medical deciion hundred of thousand of preborn black baby are aborted every year and million have become hazardous medical waste since 1973 all we need now are some white robe and pointed mask who wouldve thought all this woke liberation is starting to make republikkkans look like a bunch of saint and how odd it only a baby when it fit the narrative we need to care about mother being in danger while our most vulnerable in society are being murdered and tough luck i guess you cant be oppressed or a minority if youre in the womb there no place for you in this world of victim
this is unfortunately the inevitable consequence of this fascist and insane policy by republican but republican dont care if woman die because of the sick and intolerant policy to them it is all about maintaining power at all cost at some point the public will become educated enough and remove the cancer that infects texas politics a well a many other red state
this is not just a problem in state with anti abortion law catholic hospital will never provide abortion a medical care they will let the mother die to save her immortal soul
get a good lawyer this isnt right
this is how gop care about people
so i wonder what all the prolifers have to say about this that all said that the mother life isnt at risk and when it is she can abort
sue the law maker sue sue sue
exodus 21 for example suggests that a pregnant woman life is more valuable than the fetus this text describes a scenario in which men who are fighting strike a pregnant woman and cause her to miscarry a monetary fine is imposed if the woman suffers no other harm beyond the miscarriage however if the woman suffers additional harm the perpetrator punishment is to suffer reciprocal harm up to life for life
yet texas keep going red
law made by people in office sick
a new jersey woman wa killed waiting for a gun permit because of her abusive boyfriend you know an actual right that none of you seem to care about
maybe woman should do a better job at vetting their sexual partner this is 100 woman fault maybe they should be more responsible eh
oh come on already if it a medical emergency it can be done
where are the prolife republican commenters at what do you have to say about this i noticed none of you are commenting because there is no defense for controlling a person life
cnn is ran by satanist
mother killing their child change my mind
sorry dont believe this
quit voting for republican
a more case are iike this happen it wiii turn the most conservative person and their entire famiiy to vote biue
horse crap i work in obstetrics and they could have admitted and given iv antibiotic to mom to prevent infection they do it all the time infection is not the fault of the baby and abortion would not have prevented it dumbass people believe whatever for the benefit of this assault against unborn baby and child
time for government and insurance company to back out of health care leave the decision up to qualified physician
this is what happens when you rush through a law without thought or discussion it is massively irresponsible on the part of lawmaker folk get the heck out of texas and florida before this happens to you
apparently pro lifer dont care about the life of the mother
it sound like she wa just used a a political piece of the game her abortion wa medical needed there wa no reason doctor didnt give her one they knew everything that would happen to her if they didnt do it abortion that are just use by woman a birth control is what should be stop not this
ah good ole texas the hell hole of america thank god i live in a blue state

texas state elected legislator not doctor almost cost this woman her life with their ignorance and may have destroyed her ability to have future child this is why a bunch of idiot shouldnt be given this kind of power i hope she sue the texas state lawmaker to hell and back in what can only be seen a a punitive and hateful punishment of woman who have abortion tea party georgia republican rep terry england in support of a bill which would ban abortion after 20 week hr 954 say that woman should be forced to carry dead fetus to term why because cow and pig have to do it and thats apparently how his god want it never mind the health risk to mother being forced to carry dead fetus to term republican hate mother and want them to die early and often legalizing the murder of abortion doctor tea party 2012 south dakota tried to pas a law to make the murder of an abortion doctor legal a selfdefense when south dakota wa forced to drop the idea of murdering abortion doctor nebraska and iowa picked up the idea see also hb 3308 life defense act of 2012 which ha implication in this regard
made up story
rip little angel vote doe those idiot out of the senatethe house never another president who doesnt support abortion right
so old guy determine that woman are not allowed abortion they dont have a womb so they cant give birth how can they even think about it these old men have no clue at all let alone about politics
nothing to do with the anti abortion law this law doesnt prevent abortion if the doctor judgement feel that the mother is risking her life so it wa a wrong human medical decision my prayer for amanda and josh i know what they feel
this is bullshit propaganda dislike
im really really really sorry for this couple but thats what texan vote for again and again there wa a real chance to change that and bring freedom and safety back for wemon and for school kid but no taxans decide they care a about wemon child and people at all so sorry but now you all have to live with it and you have to make a better decision next time
fake propaganda she could have had a c section and removed the dead baby
im going to tell some thing not expected at all if texas under islamic law non of that happened im just saying
most woman who want to get an abortion arent at risk like this lady pro life and pro choice are both wrong it should be in the middle closer to pro life you have 810 week to figure it out or else you got ta keep that baby simple you pro choice retard get your choice and you pro life moron get your wish
there wa a good set of reason for roe v wade we will remember why it had to pas the toll of human suffering wa abhorrent if anti abortionist dont want one dont get one show u first how you became the superior person save up and adopt each and every one of those wee baby birthed by ill prepared parent gon na do that not too chickensht are ya write the check and keep your mind on your own damn crotch
how many more life will be at risk of being lost needlessly how many more will suffer damage by these barbaric restriction how many more life will be forever scared so sorry for your loss and your health issue you telling your story help so many more to understand the reality of the new law please know that the majority of american believe your heartbreaking story should never happen again the blessing is that you both have each other and your love is probably stronger a a result if your tragedy
yep welcome to 2022 inconceivable and what a shame that men law can decide how a woman can do with her own body
fake news doctor wouldnt leave a miscarriage to decay dont believe the propaganda
people just dont realise how disastrous being antiabortion is until it hit them personally i know that life is precious this woman should be just a precious a her unborn child wa but thats not how she wa treated shame on the doctor im sorry for what they went through it didnt seem to matter to the rest of texas though they reelected abbott and im sure all of their house representative on the national level are republican no amount of story like these or what happened to the 10 year old in ohio are enough to sway these monster
put aside the fact that they had to focus on a nice white homely couple who met in kindergarten when there undoubtedly 100000 of the same story in black brown community this is the travesty of american antiwomen law youre abhorrent usa
common those that voted for republican to represent them your vote for any republican ha caused this and many more own this couple pain and anguish i hope this pain befalls all that voted republican into office
shame on people who vote for this
abortion is every woman choice across the majority of the world republican are like taliban men dictating what subjugated woman should do land of freedom the u constitution ha been amended 27 time and is the reason they are called amendment
and yet they kept electing those same people that are opposing those law or just they didnt vote the only people im sorry for are the people that did vote for the right person and get dragged down with the rest of the stupid fanatic
this is all gop b punt abbot for his ineptitude
shes high risk for issue with another pregnancy and doe she want to risk that while living in texas she could die for sure
the unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for they never make demand of you they are morally uncomplicated unlike orphan they dont need money education or childcare they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationship and when they are born you can forget about them because they cease to be unborn it almost a if by being born they have died to you you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth power or privilege without reimagining social structure apologizing or making reparation to anyone they are in short the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe prisoner immigrant the sick the poor widow orphan all the group that are specifically mentioned in the bible they all get thrown under the bus for the unborn
im so sorry for your loss and heartbreak
shes not dead though and most abortion arent to protect the life of the mother most are for convenience
nothing is going to change in texas until business and more citizen affected by these extremist law start standing up and speaking out to not only abbotts office but to the state court a well a long a you live in texas with abbott a governor he will continue to force you to live by his principle blue voter need to start reaching out to rural and suburban texas because those are the place that kept abbott governor of texas he probably think you both are sinner and deserved what happened imagine someone running your state that think that way about you
one shouldnt get pregnant in such a state young couple should leave too much risk
this is going to become a more and more common story if these barbaric antichoice law continue being implemented glad she didnt fucking die
that sound more like a hospital who didnt know how to interpret the law it clear in this video she qualified the moment her water broke she should sue the hospital
republican police are responsible woman are second class citizen thanks to them
almost died still alive am i correct
texan who voted for abbott and the other republican should share the blame for this
well texas they keep on electing the same people who brought them nightmare
blame the republican and their barbaric christian pro life
there ha to be a law firm willing to take these case pro bono sue the state
that is despicable that amanda did not receive the care she desperately needed shame on texas and their barbaric and backwards law i would never live in that state even if you paid me god bless you amanda for your strength
i just think that baby almost died before she got done an abortion
they should sue the state
and yet most texan still voted abbott in a a governor they will never learn
used to want to go to texasbut with these barbaric law the racist governor judge giving murderer bondit would be the last place id want to go
i hope we elect warnock is so much more competent prochoice and he wa co sponsor of s53 raise the wage act of 2021 hope it pass in the senate too bad we dont have the
i would get a damn good lawyer and find a way to sue the state
dose cnn ever report about a baby that wa not murdered or report alive saved from somebody bad decision from a night of drinking however medical required termination should be automatic if complication arise
by the gop packing the supreme court and planning the demise of abortion right more woman might end up like that woman or die roe v wade must be codified
it incomprehensible to me how people keep voting for people like abbott and his crony from hell who make these law
you didnt mention the name of the one you contacted and refused to comment why
she doesnt have to live in texas there plenty of state she can go to vacuum her baby out if her she didnt die so whats the fuss the left is all about killing baby and grooming child
doctor could stop this they are coward they could easily band together and do right by their patient and not the expedient political thing but their country club lifestyle is at stake cant have that jeopardized
and yet texan still voted for republican so what that tell u
i think america need the iranian woman to show them how it done
thanks to republican
based texas
sound like they passed law halfbaked
talking about one woman we are talking about thousand of baby being murdered she is still alive all the baby are dead
i guess this is what happens when politician make the medical decision and not the physician we already have an ag threaten criminal case against the physician who performed the abortion the 10 year old case so i can see why physician feel like their hand are completely tied with anything concerning abortion
after being a republican for almost year 20 ill never vote for them again this make my blood boil
żurawski is a polish surname unfortunately similar case caused death of woman in poland because of barbaric law people do fight for our human right across the border
no story on the guy whole stole billion of dollar and funneled it through the democrat party through ukraine our tax money what nobody care about that thats just show you how messed this world really is
what a bunch of bull shit talk about pushing an agenda just call yourself the democrat news network
this is a governor that belief he is making the right decision for all woman regardless of the outcome and texas keep voting the 3 pack back in woman need to unite and bring a major lawsuit i am so sorry for what this young couple had to insure no one is a second class citizen blessing and love from san antonio texas
these law are pro death if anything
you need to move to state that can help you when pregnant for all woman
murdering a million american with covid wasnt enough for the bloodthirsty prolife crowd theyre going for another million in childbirth they have zero respect for human life thats always been fake news
where i come from doctor would put saving a life before the law and the court would agree
thanks to the unaccountable catholic oligarchy known a the supreme court woman like amanda can now be hunted by vigilante for a 10000 cash bounty and force to prove in court that they suffered a miscarriage not an abortion morally foul religious right build it path to power on the destruction of woman
politician who try to kill pregnant woman must not be allowed to stand for election in a free democracy even the taliban are more advanced in human right then republican these day wake up american conservative you are voting for criminal assault and female mass murder
this make my blood boil how can republican be so fken stupid
the government should not have the right to a woman body
good heaven i say those doctor are coward they could have defended earlier action to save her lifeblessings to all
republican would rather have a fetus burst through a woman abdomen like an alien then claim it wa god will with a trumpy smirking shrug than let her terminate an unviable and deadly pregnancy
crazy shit leave our body ourselves
nazi doctor were better than republican
im so sad and angry i think this whole situation is ridiculous
my biggest nightmare is literally coming true wtaf all decided by men who will never ever comprehend or understand the joy and horror of carrying life
this story just break my heart in way i cant describe politician need to get out of our healthcare
congratulation republican you cant blame the dems for this one
how about all the failed abortion on when the baby wa born and taken to a room to die they were issued both life and death certificate
this is total outrageous got out of texas fast
and what about all the baby that did die because they were denied a life to live it crazy how people dont care reproductive right oxymoron call it what it is terminating right
sweetie im sorrywas raped by 10 men and what if i had gotten pregnantwas left for dead my heart go out to you i cant have kid cause they dammaged mei am praying for you always mathew 424 bless you both
what a nightmare im so sorry you lived and are still living through it
young parent do not have a certain future in texas and neither do child neither do doctor death to barbarism
how is it an abortion if the cell are already dead im so confused
if she died trumptards would say it wa god will
i almost died walking across the street whats your point
one of my best friend died from sepsis two day after her child wa born
she probably would have gotten le time for shooting a texas politician than a doctor performing a life saving abortion in some state this is what it ha come down to
i know this network isnt considered a news station but dont they have some sort of obligation to telling the truth or is it simply what democrat want to hear wheres jackie
welcome to america in 2022 moving forward and for all the dems winsthere are so many place now where woman life are at risk daily so sadbut we still gave woman killer the house
my heart go out to amanda and her husband the anti abortion law should be finetuned to better address amandas situation but there should still be a total ban on elective abortion the extreme case like amandas are extremely rare le than 1 im not mad that cnn is showing the extreme case one life lost is many but the lawmaker should finetune the law to serve the people better our mantra is save them both we need both the mother and her child alive
omg this make me so sad
0ver 300000 baby murdered in one year by planned parenthood
thanks ted
marsha here abortion ha never been a constitutional right planned parenthood which ha a financial interest in keeping abortion on demand legal will keep fighting at the state and national level to make abortion a b constitutional right again the organization most recent annual report showed a record number of abortion 383460 and a record revenue 17 billion
all the dumbass who want abortion banned no matter what
this could have been prevented by not fucking in the first place
while i detest the idea of abortion i believe it murder i also believe there are certain time when an abortion would be necessary for instance if the mother life were in danger the people that make me mad are the one who get an abortion just because or it an inconvenience to me or worst of all they see a potential human being a nothing more than a mere parasite abortion should be left for each state to decide not the federal government a a whole all life is sacred no matter where you come from and all life deserves a chance to enter the world
thats what happens when the republican particularly the one in the supreme court decide to do more harm than good
the u is quickly becoming a global pariah
lmfao false cant believe anything from cnn trump 2024
how to be saved there is only one god in three person god the father god the son and god the holy spirit one god human are one person in three part the body soul and spirit three part one person the bible say that we are all sinner a it is written there is none righteous no not one roman 310 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of godromans 323 but we are all a an unclean thing and all our righteousness are a filthy rag isaiah 646 for the wage of sin is death roman 623 the word death in this verse mean eternal separation from god in hell come now and let u reason together saith the lord though your sin be a scarlet they shall be a white a snow isaiah 118 christ died for our sin according to the scripture and that he wa buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scripture 1corinthians 1538 in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin colossian 114 for by grace ye are saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of work lest any man should boast ephesian 289 i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain galatian 221 if you would like to receive jesus a your savior realize that you are a hopeless sinner and tell jesus that you trust in him and only him to save you from hell your trust in jesus and his shed blood on the cross to pay for your sin is what save you from hell the moment you trust in jesus and only jesus you are saved then you should be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit
hello bot and the woman who almost die from getting one wont cover that santino blanco
but it okay to kill the baby huh this is political b and you think it all about democracy at stake our democracy will never be at stake for we are a constitutional republic definitely need some termlimits on our scotus though left and right
you should be protecting the option of abortion for people who werent impregnated by their high school sweetheart that wa an unnecessary detail
this is why the government should never get involved in a woman health care an abortion is a medical proceedure it is up to the woman her doctor her family and her god it is no one el business period
they still voted for abbott sorry you get what you vote for sorry but they will be more
the gop doesnt care about woman health or right
it not prolife or anything ots being responsible with what one doe with their own body before they need surgery and then special case incest victim rape victim and special circumstance that threaten life so stop the fighting and realize it about being responsible
i think these doctor are coward they take the hypocritic oath and do nothing in the past people with clout have gone to jail for their belief it happened in ireland and a woman died but the law were changed she did not die in vainif a doctor had aborted the fetus no court would have convicted him there would have been hell to pay
absolutely abhorrent these law are insane shame on anyone who pushed for this
there is nothing at all prolife about a doctor having to wait until a woman is near death suffering through sepsis with a temperature of 104 before they can legally remove her naturally dying fetus
here we go again with cnn not using common sense just common ignorance any fact on the total number of people that this happens to cnn thanks for the useless noninformation again how many click did you get
so sad this didnt have to be this way this story need to be told so the law can be amended to protect mom
also republican we dont understand how we lost woman and gen z in these midterm election
i am still surprised kkk qop abbot still in office
an abortion always end a human life
they call texas the lone star state not because of whats on our flag but because thats what our state is ratedone star
i believe there will be more of these story over the next 2 year im sure it will affect the next election
when our border is secure we can deal with this
if you want somebody to blame for this blame christian
so republican youre now feeling the ramification of your law hell hath no fury than a woman scorned or suffering theyll make you regret passing those law
texas is like living in a other country and i cant tell you what country but it a very discrimination nation
why anyone would live in a 3rd world it hole like texas is beyond me it hard to believe that place exists in a western democratic country
one thing that we the people know social conservative follow the principle of the end justify the mean they lie cheat and deceive for what they claim is their god doing such immoral action for god mean that they can justify any unethical behavior eg winning at all cost god sanction slavery flying jet into world trade center building etc and they do justify any and all of their unethical behavior nothing good nor decent ha ever come from social conservatism
b here one equality is a two way street if you wan na keep pushing infanticide and calling it bodily autonomy then it time to talk about ending routine infant circumcision and starting federal protection for bodily autonomy for both gender and address the fact that only one gender ha had their bodily autonomy protected by law for decade now you cant only focus on woman issue and not even try to cover men issue any it doesnt work that way if you want true equality
when a man can birth a baby out his body then he can have say a to life in the womb
this is the biggest bullshit story ever so after all she got here abortion it wasnt a fast a she wanted where are the doctor why arent they there to confirm her danger why are they there to confirm how sick she wa
im so sorry for your pain and sorrow i say bring suit to the texas legislature that made this stupid law it is barbaric
fake news if a woman life in danger she can have an abortion thats between her and god
anytime a woman is attacked over her healthcare it misogyny anytime a woman nearly died or doe die it misogyny any time a woman loses her fertility because of treatment delay it misogyny anytime a child who is raped is denied an abortion it misogyny so called prolife people are hypocrite who hate woman and dont even support fully funded child care
all hail texas
why cant republican ignore abortion you know like they do school shooting
despite the economic downturnim so happy i have been earning 60000 return from my 7000 investment every 13days
explain the 600000 baby that actually do die each year from abortion please report on this truth she had a bad experience 600000 baby have a worse experience than her each year because of abortion can you please do a story on these 600000 baby killed each year by abortion instead of the one mother that never came close to dying you liberal are propagandist you all suck fact cheer woke low iq liberal
i would advise any woman of child bearing age to move out of texas until those barbaric law are changed those abortion law are written by misogynistic power hungry men who have no medical knowledge or concern for a woman health and they are backed up by the corrupt member of the scotus
it just awful what amanda and josh went through it tragic that she might never be able to have a child and i know this isnt the only case like this the government ha no business interfering in a woman medical decision
cnn this is beyond b your creating hate and war
dont ya love cold blooded american capitolism and americanstrumperschristians telling another to medically receive treatment they only approve of aint that coll go ahead keep voting republican trumpism lol
republican can be pretty stupid at time literally the only thing they are good for is kinda protecting the second amendment but they fail at that also
you mean the baby almost lived
dems lost the house even though they rigged it bahahahahahahahaha
can anyone here fathom 230000 illegals in a month thats 30 day absolutely unbelievable wow
maybe take step to prevent pregnancy next time
come back to the modele age how sad hope the doutor take off the dental anesthesia when those stupid and low lawmaker and politics need dental carethis is america now
anyone who can see story like this and still say abortion isnt health care is crazy it not pro life
dont expect republican to care
when yall are ok with removing a full term baby piece by piece from the mom womb i have no sympathy
republican well i guess she shouldnt have had sex with her husband anymore if she didnt want to die from an infection yes because that make sense
texas lawmaker cant spell
if she hadnt made it there would of been incoming lawsuit towards law maker
it seems the law statement applies to the situation she wa experiencing the doctor seems the most liable to have not reacted responded appropriately unfortunate their loss of the baby seems they really wanted to deliver and care for the baby
and texan still voted republican sick
i have nothing to add but arrrrgh you idiot youre killing already born people to save wish and prayer
so she could have one except her doctor decided to play politics by blaming the law even though it clear to any moron the law say she qualified blame the activist doctor
boy if i didnt like this id move to one of plenty of other state that do allow doctor to preemptively kill baby for health sake
no government should get involved in such a delicate and private issue woman would be encarcerated for political power if it wasnt for the democratic party who ha worked none stop to secured woman protection from unscrupulous politician like herschel walker
a see the new russian republican party dosent care if woman will die because the supreme court and the republican party want to run there life
i am so sorry to both of you and your baby willow is a beautiful name this is because of politician and doctor running scared my mom had sepsis and died im so happy you lived peace and love
how barbaric is the correct word prayer and luv from ontario canada
and that abortion is a safe an operation a appendicitis no woman wa harmed during an abortion the next step is forced abortion the bank will decide if you have the mean to have child it fair too
texas explains everything
thats what radical republican want for americakeep showing these story until 2024 when democrat take back full control of congress to codify roe into law
texas doe not carehell under wheelies texas froze and child also the elderly passed do not forget the gun bill which is one of the reason why the tragedy in uvalde happededtexans choose that for them
