amen glory to these american love from armenia
abortion hurt woman these greenhorn have really no clue what they are talking about
got ta love a man leading this group just one extra piece of irony
i am proudly one
pregnancy should be planned it an immense responsibility a life threatening risk and something that you personally would pour all your life and resource into for the next two decade it is a great sacrifice and should only be done willingly they talk about killing a fetus but nobody ever talk about prenatal and postpartum suicide andor lifelong depression mother mental health should be considered just a much a her physical when it come to abortion nothing worse than growing up in a family in which your mother simply resents you
im a prolifer and i commend these young people for speaking out and i commend the interviewer for having and showcasing a fair conversation i can see that the people in the comment are already persuaded a am i but this is an important conversation and people dont seem to be willing to have conversation like this anymore
seriously if you make a mistake and get a girl pregnant why should you be forced to be a parent
notice how they all look happier
more child more strong
i care more about my wasted tax money
delusion especially those who give b religious argument
greatest injustice to occur to woman in history that young person in the intro should read up on the history of woman right
this is so embarassing
629 doe she even know her own historyclearly she hasnt read the constitution
so why should the government be able to force someone to get vaccinated but when it come to abortion it my body my choice it seems like the shoe on the other foot now
if a woman doesnt want to use her body to feed a toddler and the toddler starves thats fine because it her body she didnt want to use her body to prepare and serve food for her toddler i would use my body to feed a toddler but i cant make that choice for others it insane that she would go to prison for that it her body her choice
i would tend to agree with president clinton view on abortion and also bill burr and also dave chapelles when it come to father who dont want to pay child support
what about men there are quite a few abortion that wouldnt happen if woman had the support and commitment they needed from the father of these unborn baby i didnt hear any mention about the men at this rallyjust a lot of people saying that woman can do it and there support out there why are the father being held accountable for abandoning these woman after discovering that they are pregnant there are also quite a few men who will pressure and push a woman into an abortionbecause they dont want a child and they dont want the responsibility of paying child support for that child abortion is not just about woman being selfish or not believing they can take care of a baby
im lgbt and sometimes when i see republican and successful straight people so happy i think am i doing it wrong what if they are right and their way of life is the best all of u have strayed and unconsciously were fighting for the right to live life that are unhappy in the long run ugh but i dont want to marry or have kid ughhh
when asked about the medical necessary abortion they dont even have a real answer i want to say fu to that woman who said pray the one talking on the conference also doesnt give an actual answer cause her we can take care of both is a lie but they cant say we dont care if the pregnant woman dy
what specifically do you think the government should do to promote the right of pregnant woman and the unborn there are valid answer to this question without incorporating religion but neither side is addressing it adequately im a christian myself but somehow i manage to get annoyed listening to people on both side of this issue based on how they are presenting their view and demonizing the opposing side
so if a woman is at risk of dying if she carry on with her pregnancy pro lifer think that prayer will solve the problem one word spring to mind deluded
ah the joy of lifelong religious endocrtrination
this is the uniquely american approach to public policy called flipacoin decision making it accurate 50 of the time and it very speedy
xd people realy wonder about this look at what you call woman the left pushed way way way to far and to hard and now the big pushback will come
i understand the need for people to express their view but once you try to make thing into law you are imposing your ideology on everyone and you need to consider the impact that ha this topic is decisive but it is at the root a moral based argument this is why it should not enter the legislative sphere how can you support a secular nation moving into a booming diverse nation by imposing biblical based moral related law this is a medical case by case issue if you want to allow your wife life to pas to save an unborn fetus you can go ahead and do that but do not tell me that is what i have to do
this give me hope
is it truly that difficult to respect woman and their decision
so many people damaged on their head
abortion is evil abortion activist lie to woman about what a preborn child is and what abortion doe to that child i think that anyone who realizes this and still support abortion right is deceived and ha a piece of their soul missing science show u that from the moment of conception a human embryo zygote fetus is a unique human person with unique dna that ha never been before and will never be again that person from the moment of conception is worthy of equal protection under the law and ha a fundamental right to live just like all other people to deny the pre born of that right is evil
a mother intentionally killing her child is a tragedy it wild to me that abortion isnt seen a a human right issue by the compassionate left
even though the guardian tried to spin this a concerning i feel really encouraged that movement continues with the next generation people need a hardcore attitude shift about baby before abortion will end
it is never medically necessary to have an induced abortion though early delivery may need to happen other procedure can take place such a a csection you can do early delivery without poisoning dismembering or starving a child
that march for life guy with the beanie give off major sociopath vibe
a compromise allowing some abortion is justified
praying hard for their continued success to protect and build a culture of life
the world would be so much better if people stopped caring so much about what other people do in their life and stopped utilizing religion and patriotism a a way to justify it
why is it a my body my choice issue when the unborn are more than obviously not her body if the unborn d1ies she doesnt if she move the unborn doesnt if the unborn is born she isnt the unborn only share blood flow just like two headed people
if the left is so prochoice why cant it stop it agenda on increasing regulation on every aspect of economy and politics are they hypocrite and are they hypocrite for denying the opportunity of future choice for the incoming unborn
if our civilized specie is superior to other animal specie due to self control and refrainment from impulse why is it wrong to train and impose manner on hypersexual non precaution highly instinct driven individual who are kill1ng uborn potential self controlling and highly functioning individual
people who save innocent life are hero prolife for life
some people should be parent some shouldnt being a parent should be a choice not because you cant get an abortion
the role of government is to protect the vulnerable abortion is so controversial because there two vulnerable population the unborn and their mother both side try to downplay the other but really a college mom is just a vulnerable a the baby she carry in iowa we have legislation coming through that will limit abortion but also provide funding for program that help pregnant mother get the help they need before and after birth i think thats the best compromise
im christian but i think theyre hypocrite immigrant child at the border are being trafficked or deported this is not about the child but hypocrisy at it finest
david duchovny age
hahaha they certainly have that look
reading the comment i only can think about that all people here who are for abortion are alive and let not forget the pain a baby suffers while being aborted
i wonder when motherhood went from something beautiful to being seen a a burden is it because of the poor economy single motherhood wa it a cultural shift every child ha limitless potential they are the future of your nation regardless of the stance you are on every abortion is a tragedy so why do so many young woman feel the need to do itthis is excluding those who needed medical intervention no woman should be blamed for losing a child to circumstance outside of their control
it is truly disturbing how people in these comment justify killing innocent baby these people are blind to the truth
america can no longer call themself the land of the free when woman dont have freedom over there own body
this is what infanticide called abortion look like abortion procedure 1st 2nd and 3rd trimester youtube
so many white ppl
remember guy if your life is on the verge of death just pray and all your problem will be solved
they arent pro life they are pro birth
based prolife
so much nonsense falling out of their mouth that i hardly believe they truly believe their own b
i find it hilarious that people will put so much energy into trying to ban abortion when there multiple war happening and that have happened that genuinely devastated the earth more than abortion ever will
if you dont agree with abortion then dont get one stop forcing your narrow minded belief on everyone else these people arent pro life they are pro birth once the baby is born they could care le about what happens to it
warning this comment section is filled with bot stating their view changed from pro choice to anti choice
they dont want abortion until they need one
these people are so misguided
if i didnt stand up for the defenseless i couldnt call myself a man go home and eats defenseless animal
432 for those overlooking the simplistic solution and seem to have no real idea what actual family go through here the time stamp to just pray
reminds me of the cultural revolution in china the young people were mobilized by the leadership and many later regretted it when they had more information the same kind of people supported slavery and genocide in u history banning abortion doesnt stop it it only make unsafe abortion more likely not to mention potentially criminalizing half the population denial of access to medical care is the greatest injustice to woman monk dont get to decide neither do young people who know little about life or the impact of unwanted pregnancy the presume there are adequate resource in a county where a large percentage of people can not afford medical care or go bankrupt due to illness these people are imposing their belief on others
these people seem to have little clue about biology and childbirth
26k rape in texas since ban 26 thousand unwanted pregnancy will you run the orphanage america foster care system is broken child protective service is broken when will your religion fix these
there is a lot of people who believe in abortion for forced situation and medically dangerous situation but do not support just terminating because that is what wa convenient to you if you dont want to have a baby then dont do what make baby i wa told by a pro choicer that abstinence is an unrealistic fictional solution
we should abolish freedom of religion
this nation wasnt founded a a christian nation it wa founded on the blood of the native population
how is abortion a presidential issue isnt it up to each state
make men pay for their child even if theyre not married
i hope theyre also marching right now for the child in palestine
they can never stop abortion just safe abortion
how many of these people support thing like free education or healthcare though thing that actually benefit everyone and ensure kid grow up safe
america will soon be joining the rank of afghanistan saudi arabia and other theocratic state it time to go back to the middle age
if prayer can heal woman who need an abortion due to their life being at risk then that should be the case for any medical need we shouldnt have doctor or hospital in fact because prayer apparently can heal u religion should not affect law especially considering that not everybody is christian
i have one question for anyone who support abortion are you thankful your mother didnt get an abortion when she wa pregnant with you
this nation wa founded a a christian nation 009
go feed and provide housingoh wait they actually dont care about human life
if u love people so much take the homeless into your house
they are not pro life they are pro fetus
show these guysthe activistshow bangladesh look like and let me tell you this guy will change their opinion in second
1107 if it wasnt for that one guy they looked like handmaiden
hypocrisy and ignorance usa is becoming like iran
religion shouldnt have any right in a modern society prochooise for woman is equality shame on people for restricting woman right
blessing and god protection for all the unborn soul yet to be born
they are all welloff white people who would have thought
heaven forbid people take responsibility for their action
i think that they should just legalize the case where someone life is in danger according to the law in some state any removal of matter from the uterus is considered an abortion there were case where some woman couldnt get cancerlike growth removed because the law technically considered that abortion no it wasnt an actual child not made from eggsperm just some weird but dangerous growth still illegal to remove under some state law
pregnancy hurt woman but i guess that doesnt matter
child a young human being below the age of puberty or below the legal age of majority embryo an unborn or unhatched offspring a thing at a rudimentary stage that show potential for development birth the emergence of a baby the start of life for before you were not known to this world hello
when there is societal injustice prof they are indeed running a social engineering campaign yes that is indeed what that is called
abortion is the greatest injustice inarguably true
these young woman havent faced a terrifying medical emergency yet they may change their tune ultimately this question should rest with the individual each woman may choose i would not agree with late term elective abortion not medically indicated because she had enough time to think about it if the pregnancy is quite advanced the fetus could survive
they should allow child to have abortion without showing proof of rpe btw kidnapping is a 5 year jail sentence and you can not prove rpe that happened 2 month ago there will be 12 year old that would give birth and 5 year later her kidnapper get released and is looking to have another kid with her
i want to see these same people protesting child death in gaza but that would never ever happen would it thats how you know they are just being worked by their local church
do what you want but dont impose your belief on another human being
based prolife generation glad to see that this younger generation is waking up and recognizing the science and morality
why are they selling merch is it going to fund the mother and child
praying is like a coping mechanism to anything a christian either doesnt have an answer for or they know deep down is morally wrong
the irony in campaigning against abortion they make u wish their parent had one
this is why religion and politics should should not mix it ok not to agree with something but you should not inforce your belief onto people i hope these people learn from history
people who say that having an abortion is killing a child must also think that eating an egg is eating a chicken
these people should go and adopt all the child who are living under bad condition then theyll understand the strain and stress and misery that a child go through when theyre born into bad circumstance it is well known that throughout history time when abortion wa legal have led to lower crime rate and happier family
i wonder how many of these people care about the baby that are being killed with their tax money right now
too much free time
at least half of those younger folk are troll
most american including in some red state that have had referendum like ohio and kansa support abortion availability but about 25 of republican who are prochoice nonetheless vote republican the democratic party should make an effort to win some of these voter over but that might require compromise on other issue
hello i am liza laxamana mangubat i support covid19 social distancing face mask planet global earth sun moon sky i want to work together engineering technology medicare healthcare innovation science technology thank you lord
how wa this ever a controversial topic killing innocent unborn baby is
those in favor of abortion bunch of young non knowledgeable of life wasting their time and energy carrying an flag of something that could ruin theirs whole life doe anyone asked how a woman feel after an abortion
they were there for a whole afternoon and only came out with 1107 worth of content
these guy have the best manner and attitude everyone wa so positive
the interviewer wa outstandingly professional i know i wouldt be
that virginia tech student is a strong man
in the end this is all a subjective moral issue anyway let people have their own belief if you dont like the diversity of value in america then move to a nondemocratic country where your side reign supreme
you got ta give prolifers one thingthey got pretty woman lol
these religious zealot have the same mindset a other religios extremist a for men telling woman what to do with their body is mysogynistic control how ha the u become so backwards
ah another day another nonsense
i can guarantee that these same people also scream and pout about their tax dollar being used for social service specifically for low income community and how people who use social service are just leeching off the government which those people who are forced to give birth will most likely end up relying on said social service
abortion hurt woman what about the child who are born unwanted and given up by their parent and grow up feeling a sense of neglect and loss and that they were never wanted
this will never change every woman should always have the right to continue a pregnancy and birth a child or not it their body
i got a highrisk pregnancy and need and abortion in order to dont die what am i supposed to do just pray lol
they look like the type to get a dream internship over the summer and come back 10 lb lighter
not enough for the right not enough for the left maybe there is room for a negotiated compromise
im a prolifer but i dont agree on total abortion such a in instance when the mother is in danger during labor there is something called therapeutic abortion in which the mom is given a choice to abort her child in moment when both of their life is in danger and she ha to choose which life is to save herself or her child therapeutic abortion usually happen when the child to be born ha very little chance of living and mom is also at risk of dying due to childbirth obviously im against the abortion due to inconvenience or having no medical reason i dont believe in the excuse that bringing a child into a financially poor life would make the child life not worth living when there is life there is hope and possible opportunity cutting a child before that experience is totally just an excuse for the mother to get away from the consequence of having a child and her newly imposed responsibility
america wa founded a an agnostic nation
it not imposing christian believe rather limiting human for not wasting unborn life just for pleasure
when there are some situation where there is a 0 chance of the baby survival and all it is doing is threatening the mother life and the mother cant legally get an abortion that is no longer prolife all that is doing is making the death of the mother more likely
i hope that every woman ha a choice if she wish so
a a pro choice person what i am taking from this is that we on the left maybe need to rethink our the younger generation is overwhelmingly progressive narrative we have been making this assumption and while it is ha validity we can not ignore that there is a conservative undertow
those who believe in praying over medicine cant be trusted with policy tbh
i dont get the argument the lady say about getting her abortion i didnt want to watch her suffer it would have been very hard she would have been placed directly onto hospice ok so what is more dignified and le suffering providing palliativehospice care for the newborn where the family can be together and grieve and the baby can be made a comfortable a possible or literally ripping it limb by limb and disposing of it in medical waste there such a disconnect the lady in her own word said it would be hard for her
the youth id doommmmm
the most stvpidd people ive ever sennn
the young 1di0ts
this make me physically sick to say that medically necessary abortion should be denied because prayer fix everything is so so wrong and so so hurtful these people have no idea what theyre talking about
what if your child is born with no leg and arm and a deformed face and you are an alcoholic ya the best advice he can give you is just pray sorry i try to keep an open mind but i just cant you guy have to worry on the prolife side about religious people it is a hard sell from my perspective and im only going to listen to prolifers from the fringe of society im not against religious people a much a im against atheist even though im an atheist but you have to reason thing though and not just tell u that praying is going to solve everything
these people are infuriating
abortion forever abortion is freedom
i wa prolife before i became a christian ive been prolife for three year and christian for two year i didnt know abortion existed until i started seeing the protest then i did my own research and wa immediately heartbroken and shocked why is this okay it is the biggest crime against humanity the absolute worst injustice ever i love the movement and cant wait for abortion to never ever be a thing or even a thought ever again
what doe this world even have to offer those unborn child nothing much only slavery
now ask these people who believe in the sanctity of human life if they condemn the genocide in gaza
brain rot
so they pray over the mother and the baby til death right
who are you to tell me how to live my life my abortion doe not affect you it more than having a babybabies are a lifelong change stop
i didnt realize that there are traditional woman exists in america who care about human life and value themselves
it should be both legal and banned legal for the first trimester that is enough time for a womancouple to make a decision after that tough cookie there are plenty of great couple out there who are waiting to raise a child if the mother doesnt want it the only exception should be if the fetus is unhealthy or the mom health is at risk
these people are not aware of science they should talk to gynecologist and patient and stop trying to impose their ridiculous idea on people
well then if a woman ha to keep a baby these people can raise the child themselves
because a woman decides to have and becomes pregnant a baby get the death penalty
so i watched some of the barbie movie now that the hype ha died down a bit and i thought it wa alright for the most part it had some very clear theme that i believe are relevant and after hearing carter speak about his role a a man in the pro life movement i cant help but laugh at how the movie portrayed the patriarchy because he sound exactly like one of the ken that learned about patriacrchy
i think abortion should only be allowed a a medical intervention instead of a service and i dont accept the rational of all life need to be protected at all cost because what of the mother moreover that kinda similar to the rational of calling everything racist that the far left doe because it ignores the reality of life the extreme use case where it is needed
if they are so pro life go support the people of palestine
an easy way out is abortion even in extreme circumstance but this an infinitely small number compare with abortikn at will the problem witb abortionist radical is making this a a religious issue it is not abortion is violent and more vile thing to do to woman who have thought they made a mistake woman should realize that they have the power to choose to stand for the baby thats in her no matter the circumstance of the baby conception easy way out yet afterwards post abortion is the most hurtful experience killer are liar
abolish abortion
i find it incredibly cringe when men comment on abortion
im so proud of my fellow pro life american we are the pro life generation let make abortion unthinkable
wait where are the tat body piercing purple hair and entitled pronoun oh these are the future taxpayer and the employable individual of tomorrow we never see
this nation wa founded a a christian nation this nation wa built on slavery you want that back too
fabulous to see these young people passionate about saving the tiniest of baby
do these people adopt child do they work at soup kitchen do they support law that support the community or do they only care about a baby being born no matter what
156 ah abortion is more injust than poverty or inequality
no you wont abolish abortion any more than prohibition controlled alcohol woman will always go to desperate length to end pregnacies they dont want always will and always did causing harm to themselves and their family the abortion industry is indeed dodgy for a start it is linked in with transhumanism and biotech but thats not a reason to totally ban abortion driving abortion into the backstreets where profiteering would be further complicated by illegality and blackmail is not the answer a they used to say in england the rich to harley street the poor to the backstreet please dont let u go back to those day of knitting needle and septic death prayeris simply not an answer at all
woman against baby men for baby i have seen it all now
i have no time for immature child who lack life experience and wisdom
these young american look like they work and contribute to society much better then the one who do t work and call off to work to riot and shut down bridge i think id rather listen to what they have to say
pray pray pray and pray and pray such complexity reduce to such stupidity it depressing but i know what you would say to me just pray
what are the fighting to achieve acceptance from their family and peer
bravo i stand with you 100
abortion should only be allowed if the mother health is in danger or if there wa an assault
abortion problem would magically disappear if woman had to pay for it
those poor indoctrinated people
just say you dont know instead of saying prayer will fix thing
abortion is horrible
hmm lot of murder prochoice people in the comment section kind of suspicious you only are okay with abortion after youve been born make a person think
even if medically necessary abortion were the only abortion allowed the vast majority of pregnancy would not fall into that catagory
unsafe for wanted pregnancy
step 1 have your baby and be all saintly about how pro life you are step 2 mistreat your child
all these people were denied various thing in various place in their personal life and needed a collective scapegoat to vent their frustration the real thing to pray for is that this wont get out of hand like pogrom or something
what about if woman dont want baby
people in this video hurt woman unbelievable
there are a minority
the main question is is embryo human life we think it is and that is the thing a everybody protects a child since birth we protect it since conception simple a that
1 it her body her choice no a a matter of biological fact it is not her body 2 you better be prolife once the baby is born we are is that supposed to be a gotcha do prochoicers seriously not have anything else
i had to see this cuz i didnt even know there were that many ppl my age who are anti abortion
abortion evil and wrong but the gop is running hot garbage a their candidate again so if he loses in 2024 for a 2nd time expect liberal to claim it wa because of abortion
what a hellscape
she can ban it for herself that is her business why do these people want a theorocy
no problem you will also of course pas law in every state to provide the social service these kid will need i am sure will do that enthusiastically along with pay the extra tax to pay for it
this nation wa not founded a a christian nation quite the opposite actually
i wonder what percentage will change their mind in the next 10 year a they have accident
end abortion once and for all
how about these people put a much effort into law and effort to reduce the occurrence of rape and act where the unwanted pregnancy wa created through violence
there are really always people that want to go back it incredible
i just wish couple can control more of their urge
christinaity is love for humanity born and unborn
im 16 and im a pro life female
based
it funny how easy it is to manipulate the mass thro medium and social medium
free julian assange if you are pro life
i am gen z and i am pro life
pro abortion is not anti life injustice is what these hypocrite are doing to stand up for justice is to not have your own point but to ensure people have right and medical and scientific principal apply it is immoral to suggest abortion is not moral
this is misrepresenting the prolife community the majority would agree that if the mother wa in a life or death situation then we have the moral responsibility to try out best to save both that would include considering a premature birth if possible immediately jumping to abortion for the mean of convenience is what most people fight against
america wa founded on zero religion
i had an abortion at 18 i remember getting screamed at by prolifers a i walked into the clinic it wa awful i didnt make my decision lightly ive always gotten the feeling that prolifers think that woman are just thrilled to get an abortion yes an unplanned pregnancy cant wait to for my abortion prolifers are so obsessed with the fetusembryo that they perhaps willingly forget that there a woman at the centre of this a woman with responsibility dignity and humanity if any prolifers want to have a cordial discussion im happy to have it but if youre just gon na call me a murderer dont waste my time ive heard if before
the usa wa purposely found not a a christian country
abortion is evil but dont like it simply dont get one shouldnt be a legal clamour
there is hope for the future yet
this comment section is an example of whats wrong with our country
wow look at all the single mother
the only argument proabortion people have is what if this what if that
i am not pro life but i am not for abortion abortion is a heartwrenching personal decision too many people go through this life unloved do not force your belief on someone you know nothing about if there are no legal abortion there will be illegal one
they are living in a medieval era
a bunch privileged people with no real problem to tend to
it is called baby killing not abortion
people keep spouting misinformation about america being founded a a christian nation it wasnt to know our true history read a people history of the united state by howard zinn
abolishing abortion 100 agree
yet these people are okay with actual child dying in gaza in fact they advocate for it hypocrite the right to abortion is a woman choice or the woman choice you know the one having the baby these people are a genuine a the one pretending to care about homeless people what they truly seek is control
disheartening to see so many woman supporting this wth
i am glad people are standing up against abortion it is sick that people will support abortion although i dont agree with most of the religious thinking and christian belief
and who gon na represents the baby
modern edgelords im soooo impressed
but they also want to prevent access to cheap contraception mean a well
210 ummm it half a man baby a well this is the problem with the whole judicial system that hate men adn take away their child i however do agree that woen are better at raising child
kiddos youve all just gone and given yourselves a reason for your kid to hate you
basically they are misogynist
teenager are the best
praise the lord
so we go extinct by 2030 from the loss of arctic sea ice and were having kid for what
this is fine if atleast america had a proper welfare state let be real most people who want to get an abortion would just give their child up got foster care or adoption if they couldnt get an abortion so if you want to remove abortion you have to start with better funding for school and food bank which start with higher tax which judging by the fact that most of these protestors are conservative they wouldnt want
more people are killed each year by abortion than by cancer
just an astounding lack of empathy
abortion is a medical treatment just like euthanasia i suppose abortion is racist abortion is ableist abortion is classist however until welfare is fixed i dont think we should be throwing child into a severe lack of resource i think the resource for post birth baby need to be fixed first i think condom need to be more accessible too to prevent pregnant peoplecouples being in that situation in the first place here hoping history continues to favor activism for those deemed not human by society
ok im against abortion but in some case it justified if it ending a mother life or potentially going to cause serious health probalems or in the case that the baby also wont survive
someone ha to give the unborn a voice
woman want to lose their right to choose if they want baby or not
you must be born again you have been informed
if potential braindamage wa a lawful reason for abortion these people protesting against abortion wouldnt exist stop telling others what they should do with their body
am against late term abortion in a fair society we must protect those who cant protect themself with law
ugh i lived through the 80 wave of this but we still kept abortion legal in many state these people are deluded even when i wa a christian i didnt think it wa my right to tell someone else what to do with their reproduction
half the country want a theocratic strongman dictatorship while the other half want a socialist welfare state would be happy with george bush or obama at this point
next step is to abolish abortion by criminalizing it
then you also need to adopt socialism free education free healthcare and mandatory adoption if you are demanding that every child is born
like slavery in the u in the 1850s human being treated like dirt and eliminated
america is healing
why are we still having this discussion in 2024 keep abortion legal but limited unless in life or death situation i think up until three month or 12 week in plenty done let move on dont ban abortion but also dont allow late term abortion unless medically necessary this is very simple i partly blame the left for this extreme push back against abortion now if they had not been pushing and getting law passed to allow late term abortion like nine month then i dont believe the anti abortion push would be this loud and fervent
im filipino abortion is illegal in our country living in this earth is a miracle and blessing killing baby is evil
cgtn the pointhubheat universal healthcarepharmacarematernitypaternity leavepoverty alleviation china ha amazing family friendly policy
yes abortion is bad it your body so dont give it out to hundred of men
im pro choice but that doesnt mean i think abortion isnt treated in this disgusting nonchalant attitude completely disregarding and denying the gravity action youre taking the longer you wait the le ethical it becomes
fight all day for the unborn but they couldnt care le about the already living people suffering in the world
wow moral
wow i didnt know the guardian reported positive news keep up the fight america no one should be killed just for existing
they are wrong because abortion are going to happen no matter what
dont be fooled most of these people arent really in it for saving baby theyre in it for the control to tell you how to live your life
these poor woman lack self respect to a depressing degree
i hope each of these girl find themselves if the truly heartbreaking situation of wanting a baby but something tragic happens and the fetus end up not viable but they arent sick enough in the eye of the law to receive the life saving care they need amen
they are free to pray when their loved one life are in danger let the rest of u practice our freedom of choice
it like watching a flatearther convention
eesh lot of redditors in the comment
this group of people are also antiwomen antiblack antidemocracy antimedical care for all american citizen anti social benefit for poor people and thise in need yet they do support immediate capital punishment without getting concrete evidence
the new middle age
i dont see many minority in bad area harassing u in the street like this about abortion thats telling
the constitution is not a religious document
but this nation wa founded a a christian nation that is so true a lot american didnt know their history they dont know thatmen and woman were viewed differently men were the primary parent protector provider leader of the home and teacher of the home and the world while woman were their helpersassistants men were the one who had custodial right over their kid and voting right that change with woman right
what about the agnostic people that are against abortion their are people i myself included that think unaliving unborn baby is wrong based on rational moral thinking the left like to lump this in a wholly a religious issue they are wrong
your body my choice i like the sound of that
abortion is the termination of a human life
obviously google and wikipedia are triggered tagging information about abortion
if you have medical complication pray like no one ever did that before and using their logic havent prayer been answered through medical advance
based thats what you get when most of the abortion are because they cant be bothered with a child not because they got rped nor victim of abuse abuse the compromise and the other will not put up with it any more it simple
this is why i love american not perfect but fight for the weak people and human right for everyone
i think we need to fund more initiative to support child care so that the decision to not abort is easier
great they can all get in line to adopt child if they have time to hold up sign then they have enough time to go adopt child you know because they need protection
finally
the peolife moment speaks truth it difficult for guardian reader to stomach a theyve been fed sweet lie and truth is difficult to digest for the weak of heart
so glad to see young people standing up for the unborn
i approve and appreciate young american fighting against abortion
scary
thats right
if youre young female not ci hetero not of the ethnic majority andor not rich and youre rightwing youre doing something unnatural
i wonder how many of these march for lifer have donated blood
abortion isnt a right it a drastic measure exception are possible but normalization is not
nothing wrong in supporting an abortion ban
wonder how many going take care of child in foster care
who taking care of the unwanted kid who were born
no one calling themselves christian can support abortion other than in the case of a serious medical condition the fact that over 250000 are carried out in the uk alone each year would indication there is either a massive medical issue with million of woman or it is being used for simple birth control
based
im a democrat and im proudly antiabortion
i dont want to impose what we believe on others well then just stop doing that big hypocrite
condom iud the pill vasectomy abstinence if ppl were more responsible million of unborn child would be living their life right now
_it is my body i can do what i like_ actually the dna show it is someone el body
at last some great news
whats wrong with condom and the pill
i dunnoits a tricky one under certain cirumstances i would want my future daughter to have a choice
shes loved and supported just not in the one specific way that will actually support her in staying alive
there a weird squinty look these people have in their lower eyelid when talking about their belief it is kind of uncanny anyone else notice that
it so weird that it also an election year isnt it
delusional people telling u what to do
i think personal responsibility is better option than abortion plenty of contraception option out there
yall keep on fighting and protesting the birth rate will continue to fall completely off a cliff check the perfect asian culture you rave about no dating no relation no baby
praying doesnt heal wound medicine doe
i urge all to watch dawkins speak on her youtube channel she is very factual and knowledgeable on abortion
a lot of people dont realize that abortion arent just about baby a tumor removal from a uterus is also classified a an abortion so by wanting to ban abortion they are making necessary care inaccessible
how the turntable
332 it always hilarious to see those glowies out in the open at protest they never speak to anyone else and always hide behind their full face mask plus they always get into unmarked vehicle the fact that a federal agency will have it agent trying to slander people and cause problem is cause for concern they use taxpayer money to try and foment hostility and political tension between citizen
another step closer to the handmaid tale future this is sheer lunacy
how beautiful to see all those young woman fighting against abortion there is hope
nobody force this people to have abortion if you are pro life be pro life and dont tell others what to do with their body
yall do know that theyll make a video with the people that sound most crazy so yall believe that the prolife people unintelligent just in case
the issue with abortion is that it risk leading to female led eugenics and to the commercialization of human life
this comment section failed the vibe check
what a joke trying skip over dealing with rampant child abuse neglect aiming right for banning abortion to feel like hero what about the child that are born and suffer
let be honest these woman know most abortion are done on healthy pregnancy and they use edge case to argue for the majority
coat hanger sale are through the roof
what a surprise patriot front wa at that rally
the christian taliban
no one ha the right to ban it no one just co you dont agree with it it nobody right to ever tell any woman she can not have control over her own body or her own life the end
end abortion now and forever
this hurt to watch
the amount of suffering these people cause and they dont seem to aknowlege any of it
maybe theyll just march off the edge of that christian flat earth
my body my choice except when we want to force you to get the jab
wow youtube thanks for the medical advice below my video
this is the only gen z im ashamed of
world gone when woman got the vote
this how gilead start
they love the unborn until theyre born then it who care about you fend for yourself
this whole ban is only to make people feel better if a woman want a abortion and the country make it illegal if shes desperate enough she will take a more dangerous option than a medical professional i bet these ban will cause more death than if they were not in law they would have to lockup every pregnant woman to be able to enforce the ban not to mention it would create sketchy clinic who charge a fortune tldr this is a pointless fight that is impossible to enforce the woman could just hit herself in the stomach over and over and nothing could be done stop creating more danger than it save it a pointless law
actually this country wa built on the principle of freedom from religious prosecution hypocrite solopsism rampant and unchecked
abortion should be illegal but some of these crazy say that woman who need an abortion should be punished with the death penalty is that really prolife
why is it in the constitution that there is a separation of church and state if the country wa supposedly founded on christian value
make abortion in available and then lose life of mother who can not carry the fetus to term so much for pro life
but this nation wa founded a a christian nation nope the first amendment establishment clause prohibits the government from making any law respecting an establishment of religion this clause not only forbids the government from establishing an official religion but also prohibits government action that unduly favor one religion over another this nation wa not founded a a christain nation
are there any nonwhite people there opposing abortion
legal abortion for all state 2024
why dont these anti abortion people focus on contraception which can prevent abortionsif they are so gung ho about ending abortion
tiktok firstthen natural right of unborn child
628 wrong separation of church and state credibility of your movement gone
why do all the prolifers look the same doesnt seem like theyd have a wide range of perspective
the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is based on religious moral it not just religion but also the u constitution which should protect the life of both a mother and a child
this wa a refreshingly neutral report by the guardian thank you
amazing how theyre outraged at abortion but the not the child being bombed to death in gaza with their tax dollar their pro life stance is just b
a man fighting for a choice he will never have to make is ridiculous
i thought this is a country of freedom why so many people trying to pose their opinion on others body
just google project 2025 enough said theyre literally admitting their plan of an overhaul of democracy
that girl right at the beginning who said abortion is the greatest injustice to ever happen to woman in all of human history how much of the world have you seen really also why dont they pray hard for poverty to end
i dont agree with abortion but then im not the one going thru that life changing decision how about each of these people sign up to adopt a child after an unwanted birth then there no need for abortion step up and put your money where your mouth is
okay hold on a minute legalising abortion doe not mean a woman is told not to have a baby it just mean that the option to abort is there for her in the worst of scenario it is her right to decide what to do with her own body and saying that abolishing abortion is giving freedom to people simply doesnt make sense youre diminishing their freedom
it not abortion per sé it the whole spanning industry behind it which is anti natural anti nature anti human and evil by default
prolife for life
a small but very vocal minority
they should just pray for abortion to stop because prayer work right
mind your own business
that lady just belief that christian should be the default since she brought up that america is a christian country
the people who said that praying is gon na save those woman life should never go to the hospital ever again because with that logic they can cure themselves by praying
this kid just want to be a part of something
life is life
christian taliban
they want to achieve a totalitarian christofascist regime thats what
im sure the unborn plump of cell that lack any ability for conscious thought are really thankful for their effort
for the little one
septichemorhaheshock

the founding father of the united state most were deist and practiced deism a movement or system of thought advocating natural see natural entry 1 sense 8b religion emphasizing morality and in the 18th century denying the interference of the creator with the law of the universe
when men oppose abortion and they are asked whythey never answer well because you cant get pregnant without u
abortion is nonsense human life start in conception so why all this continuo chatting
why impose your belief on other people it nothing short of terrorism
these people are culty and pretty cringe lol
sighif it is not in the constitution then it fall to the decision of each state elected representative dont like your state government then elect other representative or move state the american system isnt quite broken yet but american obviously are
it is so simple her body her choice like when it is your choice to take vaccinecoming from a moderate going to vote republican
these girl are very beautiful and seem homely
keep men and a book out of the argument
they really should fight to take care of all abandoned kid instead of forcing their idea on others
oh that is not acceptable people have the right to choose
but what if pregnancy is threatening health of that woman well the prayer can help her out
this people are lost this country main principle is the separation of church and government
the comment section say it all we want the right to choose
separation of church and state
610 which are the religion of america residing people that do not oppose abortion ill wait apart from that i did not expect actual impartiallity in a video of a hot topic which is super rare in today medium landscape pleasant surprise to see proper journalism
religion is holding america back from moving forward in time it like im looking at 1960 or something
the woman in tan and orange at 254 look like handmaiden from the handmaid tale
any woman who doe not want her unborn child should sign over her right to that child to give it up for adoption once it is born and the u government should pay the living cost for that woman and child to live until the day the child is born if that woman engages in risky behavior that cause damage to the unborn child then she should be charged with child abuse every human being ha a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in this nation guaranteed by our constitution this includes baby
and these people vote
it insane that u had legal abortion up until birth there were mother going with big stomach 20 plus week oh my boyfriend left me there you go your pill dont look in the toilet we are coming and cleaning the not a baby for sure what is the eufemism product of pregnancyin the 60th they had no scan 3d scan come on guy it a baby movinglove me mum i love you already
stagnant wage climbing home price opioid epidemic innovation slowdown rising national debt and this is the issue certain young people are devoting themselves to
these people are nothing more than enemy
im fairly prolife but the bit baout medically necessary abortion to just be answred by prayer that wa ferral
those pro life are the first choose the abortion if they need to
these type of people arent new it always been a type of thing
feel a bit negligent to gloss over the presence of fascist at the event 332
everyone is pro choice when you choose to take care of your own child but not other child thats pro choice when you choose which child to adopt thats pro choice if the government mandated every open pro life individual or organisation to contribute significantly to raising abandoned child theyd drop the pro life label in a minute
then dont have one
pro life
delusion is a strong drug embrace reality
abortion can not be abolished only safe abortion can be abolished these people are evil
the most interesting part is always how shallow their opinion are yet their feeling are this strong i would rather read a 5 page essay on one person actual opinion where they contend with themselves to figure it out for themselves instead of 1 mob opinion every time they start speaking they start with i feel i am right therefore i am right and you are wrong instead of hmm let see and make an argument call yourself a journalist when you dont even care or try to figure out i came for answer and i found empty shell trying to fill it with some cause they havent reflected about
there are so many contradiction about their politics
i want to know if they will have the same responsereaction if their life or a loved one life wa at risk and needed an abortion
question how many child have you adopted or given donation to unfortunate parent talk is cheap why dont you turn your church into save living quarter for single mother like i said talk is cheap
there not pro life there pro poverty
these people are absolutely okay with their own abortion
a man saying that abortion is the greatest injustice to ever exist in america is absolutely insane this rhetoric is so deeply rooted in misogyny and entitlement let a woman choose what she doe with her body during the time frame that she wa permitted to crazy that there is even a timeframe graciously allotted to woman to make decision
land of the nevermind
prolife team
they make me scary
just donald trump alone is my argument in favour of abortion vladimir putin would reinforce that argument
soif politically the country doesnt abide by your belief political rally and march actual physical and social action are necessary way to change thing but if a woman is caught in a lifeordeath situationprayers enough why is prayer a supernatural action selectively effective
the abolition movement mean a full ban they dont believe that there are exception for the mother life if you die it god will
it wild to me how few american have their fact straight about their founding father they were progressive thinker for the time i know i know who were didnt believe that religion had a place in government
i dont mean to impose my belief on anyone but im here advocating to impose my belief on everyone
do people change their opinion when presented with counter argument do people ever change their opinion and what cause it to happen
625 this is what listening to pretend christian trump look like
you can also match to end gun violence and try to adopt some baby
i wonder how many of the natalists in this video are prodeath penalty
you mean the forced bírther anti survívor movement abortion being illegal is literally emboldening child predator
the founding father made sure this wa not a christian nationpure ignorance behind that statement
america once stood for enlightenment democracy and civilization now religious fanaticism the disastrous school and education system and the unbridled free market seem to be making these achievement recede the prolife movement for example is a symptom of this organized stupidity
it kind of terrifying when faced with the reality of the situation their response is just pray about it if the mother andor fetus end up passing away then it wa a god plan for that to happen if the fetus manages to live but ha life long complication it wa god plan for that to happen if the fetus survives but the mother dy it wa god plan for that to happen meanwhile apparently if the mother had alternative plan they are irrelevant
yeah she ha two other kid already and an abortion would save her life but they want her to just pray what about her life her life is sacred you mouthbreathing virgin
rhythm is a dancer religion is a god damn cancer
abortion wa legal for year in the beginning of america benjamin franklin wrote a howto pamphlet on abortion for cry out loud
lol this is not the majority lol
woman have aborted abort and will abort a long a human are around you cant change that having a child is an enormous responsibility and not being wanted by your parent is tragic
oh look a religious group celebrating forcing their belief onto others while not being cognizant of what theyre doing shocked pikachu face
i dont think christian should impose their belief on others thats why we need christian law even if i agreed with this nonsense that thinking make no sense
i hope they are all out fighting for healthcare for allsafe neighbourhood and against child poverty and homelessness and against violence and ape against womenlow wagespaternalmaternity paid leavesupport for kid in carewealth inequalitygun law restrictionsmental health supportand all those other thing which enable a life of dignity and real choice and freedom what the hell do any of them know about bringing up a child in poverty or without support and why dont they go and stand up for better healthcareeducationhousingwageschildcaretelling woman they can do it on their ownthere is support out there also they care so much about the taking of a lifewhat about protesting against selling of arm to corrupt regime who use them to destroy innceont life including thousnads of child
these beigeorange look are culty
church need to pay tax
abortion is healthcare praying is not simple
how many of these people have ever had an extended conversation with someone who ha terminated a pregnancy
i know it an old argument but the guy at the start say he want to fight for the defenceless so id ask if he will continue to fight for these fetus once they become child to make sure they dont live in poverty get health care you know all this but just needed to say it once again
american christian love forcing their dog shit down everyones throat
616 girl im a christian too but you cant say the country they are in wa founded a christian when the land wa taken from the indigenous
few thing a gross a telling someone with a life threatening illness that the solution isnt medical intervention it to pray
straight white christian forcing woman to carry an unwanted fetus to full term even if they were raped or if it kill them from the inside thats america for ya freedom for some and justice for none
end abortion
hey lookopinionated white people republican feigning support for childrenuntil theyre born then any semblance of social assistance like welfare or a school lunch program is leeching off tax payer
good now we know thier face
nice to see young people who still care 100 of the baby who were aborted would have wanted to be alive dont take that opportunity away from them dont have sex if youre no ready to have kid it that simple
for every abortion they stop they should be made to adopt or pay to care for that child or pay because that woman is suffering bad mental health or is unalive do to her legally not being able to get one and then wa bleeding out for example also all these peopeo are of one shade of people and could be very well off i promise you no amount of government support is gon na give a kid a father or their mother back kid are not always a blessing in some situation they could be born very sick and suffer a woman said she would not abort a couple child a a surrogate because she vould feel them kick she even asked for more money when they offered to pay 5k10k she left the state gave birth dumped the poor kid with someone who wa blind deaf couldnt speak smile or react to any stimulus they child lived until 8 literally a vegetable a mom wanted her kid born even though he had no brain or little to no brain like maybe 19 percent he did nothing for almost 2 year pro life doesnt care about those here other wise they would take prisoner off death row kid would have nutritional food to eat single parent would be heavily supported and not wait up to 5 year to have a housing a choice of any daycare of theie choice paid for education for rhe child is paid for a well a her cause they care about mom and more
absolutely they are imposing their value and religion on everyone and the u wa not founded on christian value
abortion is the woman decision not the state
it is fine to have an opinion and do what you can in your power to empower those around you and galvanise pressure and vote the thing that seems tricky and dangerous is when the person equate morality with religion this is because you can be moral or immoral without religious value telling you what to do and especially because religious value can be interpreted misjudged or even abused or indoctrinated this is especially the case of imposing value that are thousand of year old on issue of the current era which can lead to both an interesting discourse or a misleading one
fanatic
the usa is in a very very bad place now it is the beginning of the end if any of these christian nationalist get their hand on the football they will throw it itll be their holy war they have yearned for for century also remember they think they have an escape hatch they call it heaven
wow none of those kid have any idea what the real world is all wrapped up in their privilege and indoctrination not one of the child asked that hard question wa able to give a real answer oh we would pray with them and support them but not agree to letting them be saved every day the news coming out of that country make me more and more grateful i wasnt born there and that dreadful female claiming they dont mean to impose xtian value on non xtians but this cuntry wa founded on xtian value so dont they realise that xtianity is just pure unadulterated gaslighting and how dare they ignore victim of rape they want to force woman to carry their rapist child to term they want to deny those woman the morning after pill because it might kill a few cell that might turn into a child they dont have any answer for the consequence of this foul campaign theyre just having fun screaming for a law that denies woman control over their own body at least half of the girl in those protest will grow up and realise the in the worst possible way just how gaslit they actually were and how vital reproductive health service actually are for them and having access to abortion is vital
this country wa founded on freedom of religion some of these people are nut
and none of them are willing to adopt
kristan hawkins is highly unlikely to experience the consequence of her action she look a if she would have insulin resistance minimum which make conception hard she also doe not look like the kind of person to suffer a date rape
abortion is the ultimate control attempt by men over woman nothing to do with saving a life etc
anyone have a translation for the woman at 530
abortion is healthcare a a woman i am happy to live in a pro choice state state that ban abortion will lose talent and woman a someone who work in healthcare do you think i will ever move to those state absolutely not abortion not for you your choice i respect it please respect everyone el choice p prayer will do little to bring a person back from sepsisdying and we should respect all religion and their belief not one above another
anti abortion to produce soldier
when there is socitial injustice you cant care what people think so long a you fight for the right cause genuinely a terrifying logic in my opinion i just find all these people logic baffling who are these people to say what people can do in a supposedly free country they dont have to have an abortion but why should they deny others
they are rich so they can afford kid
seriously extreminist religious woman are destroying the european and american movement for feminism for the last century woman in the past would revive form their grave if they knew modern woman are these nut anyway people have tendency to be unempathetic if they did not experience the pain and suffering of being rape and among other thing heck they did not read the history a a man it very frustrating to proect gender equality if there are some woman who are buts to abandon their right for their misguided sense of justice they were like western muslim woman who taught muslim are for woman and lgbt are for muslim sorry to break it to them but all theocracy hate woman and thats a fact
this shouldnt even be a debate how many of these people eat meat for example why is it okay to kill a lamb or a chicken and not an unwanted phoetus life is life but it ha to have dignity and coherence
america is beyond help at this stage
all whiteso funny
protesting is not the most efficient way to bring down the number these people dont even really care but celebrating themselves if woman are criminalised some will turn to medically unsuitable place and method
the handmaid tale is a romcom for america religious rightwing
my question is simple who do you think you are
those old ass denied right for woman a great injustice
wheres the help instead of saying there help out there show were single mother can get the help they need ill wait the homeless rate are rising we have a failing adoption system these kid are being forced out at 18 becoming homeless if she get rape she will be forced to keep it how about woman who are at risk of dying is that okay if you want woman to keep there baby than make law the support family instead of sending our taxpayer dollar to fund war overseas maybe you should save the life that exist now
this is some cultlike stuff banning abortion is the most stupid thing
hitchens wa right religion poison everything keep your imaginary friend and your mythological delusion out of politics christian nationalism is an highly dangerous and extremely toxic neofascist ideology it is a fundamentalist farright ideology based on a strategic alliance between the far right and the fundamentalist religious right aiming at establishing a u theocracy it advocate for a society in which minority rule by white conservative christian is enshrined democracy be damned
what would you do if someone life were in danger if they continued with the pregnancy i will pray with her no these people are crazy
the level of the stupidity make this cringe af
america ha become feral
glory to childfree glory to aborting
undereducated fool religious bigot and the u farright the result of decade of antiscientific disinformation and religious indoctrination
yes yes and yes
fucktards all of em
look at all these crazed individual
they dont wan na terminate the pregnancy but they dont wan na do anything for raising the unwanted child kind of sad these woman dont have health insurance so they cant pay for prenatal care they cant pay for delivery care they cant pay to raise their child hypocrisy of these individual is astounding 131
