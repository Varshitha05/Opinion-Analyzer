people of texas can only blame themselves for choosing the wrong candidate hopefully when it time for election they will not forget all these thing and pick the right qualified candidate
she can leave texas to get an abortion and spare u the histrionics if she were really in desperate circumstance she would have not wasted any time on lawyer and court proceeding shes doing this for the drama it not unusual for people truly in need of lifesaving medical care to cross state line to get it sometimes the facility best equipped to meet your need is in another state
i have not seen anyone who ha a true understanding of what the texas abortion kate cox case is really about what we need to understand is this is not about protecting unborn life aside from religion it ha everything to do with religion the belief in god will is very strong in the new republican party the belief that we must accept god will is absolute for them we are not supposed question god decision and we wont always understand his plan if you grew up in a baptist household like i did you understand this but this dogma is never spoken aloud in the political realm you can accept medical help to save the baby life or the mother life but line is you have to understand what is god will because only god can decide who life and who dy there is no reasonable way for these extremist republican to answer this question in a legal or sciencebased sense therefore republican will continue struggle with this issue and look like sadist to the rest of u we need to bring this to the forefront a their weakness my grandfather wa a famous southern baptist preacher from texas so understanding this deeply held belief is important it is the evangelist mantra that we can not understand god plan so we have to accept whatever happens a part of his plan and still accept what he doe a somehow a good thing we need to make them admit that this is a religious issue not based on science they are making the argument based on emotion and pseudoscience but it is not really the basis for their desire to control a woman body it is all about god will and his plan and that is impossible to define because we can never hope to understand god plan i wish someone would talk about this thanks

the problem with abortion in texas is the fact you can sue the doctor over it if i were to perform an abortion and considered it medically necessary for the mother to live and she come out fine anyone could still legally sue me in a court i could still lose my medical license because she did fine and the jury didnt think her life wa at risk at the time of the abortion therefore no doctor is willing to perform an abortion for any reason

please dont call these people christian they are the gentile and these are their last day a with the right of an abortion there is nothing in the bible denying it actually a wise man once wrote and i declared that the dead who had already died are happier than the living who are still alive but better than both is the one who ha never been born who ha not seen the evil that man ha done under the sun the sad thing is the great false religion the murderer of our lord and million of true follower hijacked our faith and created their religion of man they never gave a crap about abortion until 1869 when it wa prohibited by the so called catholic canon law but again what more do you expect from the gentile
having ken paxton making a decision of medical needsighhhh a corrupted political official telling a woman doctor and medical support staff he know more about human body cause he a gop shady a heck political member and now since he ha his law degree he know reproductive and oby carethis is where a medical person hippocratic oath should over ride a lawyer false wan na be medical ideology
the very same party that is against woman getting abortion i believe are also wanting to make a move to ban contraception they cacre so much that a woman must carry every baby to be to term and deliver said baby yet where are they on affordable childcare etc once the child is born they dont care it is no longer the government the state responsibility
lower than property
this is insanity
soowhat she ha to be on her death bed to have the abortion like really the ag is not medically qualified if anything happens to this woman her discrepancy is on their hand
file through the ag background see what boil
paxton should be in jail what a hypocrite
if i wa rich id fly her to a state where she can get one without a problem first class and pay all her bill texas may a well admit that it want no exception
apparently ken paxton and the tx supreme court have decided she cant receive the abortion that m cox and her doctor have determined is medically needed
this is what it look like when fascist rule and the people obey
this is what voting republican
no american citizen of the female gender should be voting republican
what would happen if this woman were to die who would be to blame shouldnt a woman who ha two young child have the ability and the right to healthcare in 2023 it would seem that child already born and facing their mother dying because she cant get the healthcare she need is ok with texas lawmaker it is nonviable fetus they want to keep alive for a few hour day week regardless how that affect the woman who care right woman in texas have fewer right that a pregnant animal who need medical help all you need to do there is make an appointment and the surgery will be performed without lawyer without judge without delay and without government interference and their lack of any medical knowledge whatsoever surgery are even available if it an emergency to save both mother and offspring if possible imagine that
if something serious happens to this woman there will be woman marching in the street until next november no matter what the gop try to do my wife and daughter will stop the street of our nation from moving anything and will make the just stop oil protest look like a tea party

this ruling wa placed on hold by the allmale texas supreme court sickening
maternal doctor should leave texaslets see how republican woman deal with it i want them to spend hundred of dollar traveling to another state for anything dealing with pregnancy
thats exactly how conservative intend for it to be
if she dy murder charge should be filed against the legislature republican who made this a law in texas
she can go to another state which allows late term abortion right texas doesnt wish to get involved
why wa this law put in place without a vote from the people state government should not have any decision in woman health
iran of america
not surprised this is happening in texas it one of those woman hating state
imagine that the criminal texas ag himself ha criminalized abortion
leave the state of texas and obtain the care you want
also this woman had to also now have her story on blast bc she ha to go to court and over explain her complication not only in becoming a mother clearly want a baby and this is just unreal that even the medical professional are standing by her her poor mental health
let make a deal trade texas for ukraine meanwhile let get mscox removed quickly to a more enlightened state a question for paxton you claim to be pro life are you concerned at all about the quality of life or just the quantity
no she must abide by the rule and regulation put into law by the leader she and others have chosen to be in power
is this in iran
dont care about cruel law i care about her life so much for prolife
if this woman loses her ability to bear more child due to the state insane invasive law it should owe her ivf a surrogate to carry the child and all associated medical expense for a many cycle and child a she want i swear it owes her more than that
the american nightmare but republican will sell it a a dream
right but then the texas sc stepped in and reversed the judge order this woman should go out of state i know she want to make an example but she also need to consider her health she should come to massachusetts we would be glad to give her what she need i say if the court delay her abortion until it is too late for a legal abortion an exception must be made to permit a lateterm abortion this is what the righttocrappers get when they meddle with a woman abortion right
republican are destroying this country
indeedwhat give a white guy with no medical training at all the right to judge what a sick woman need to do to stay alive they can not claim religion on their side because i am fairy sure jesus and his mother mary would think and act differently
this is beyond reprehensible
christofascism
those poor man in texas soon have no gf or wife anymore i cant imagen that woman want to stay in texas
this is exactly why healthcare ha no business being dictated by government they are not medically trained professional and need to stay in their lane
texan hate woman
texas need to get abortion on the ballot it should have somehow been a requirement that it be put to the people of the state once roe wa overturned state should not have been able to pas law like texas did so it wa primed and ready to the asshats in the sc take out row i know people will not like that comment ohio kansa and others have shown even with a rep legislature when put to the people they choose to protect individual right to choose what you need for your own health i argued with friend and family that this would happen they believed there would be exception lose of major bodily function should include the ability to have child in the future paxton action and threat show thats not true rep coward in the state senate need to be voted out
thats what i want to know when did paxton get a doctor license
texas is just conservative north korea that whole state is a cancer

this is about politics religion and forcing your belief on others when the state of texas get sued into oblivion for billion when someone wife or mother dy or when a woman cant no longer have a child becuse of their stupidity the christian will change their tune when it hit em in the pocketbook
vote blue and every election in every state and let end this fascism and bible thumping because republican are using religion instead of the constitution
she can leave the state and get the abortion elsewhere almost like she is purposely trying to stay to sue it your fault now for not leaving she can even go to mexico to do it for low cost
absolutely insane for this po paxton should dictate the future for any woman life paxton should be held accountable for anything that go wrong
i hope she sue paxton
you could bet if it wa the ag wife or daughter under the same circumstance hed get the abortion done under the table
texas ha always been an a backwards state aint nothin changed
if the mom dy then they need to charge ken paxton with first degree murder give him 20 year in prison
why havent the people of texas havent demanded a vote on this matter thing like this should be brought before the people whose life these law effect
this isnt prolife it something else i would call it pro birth a some have stated
and just what is the opinion of the health insurance they need to step up for the health of woman
i dream of the day when we have personhood right for woman in texas
abortion stance should be one of many single litmus test for politician and political movement for whether or not theyre good for democracy a a whole a politician say out loud he opposes abortion then he also opposes democracy a a whole also science say abortion is not murder so save your reply forcedbirthertrolls

ohio voted to protect yet the state is still pushing back against what the people voted for so even when the people have spoken the government still doing what they want
texas need to turn their state blue so sane lifesaving decision can be made for it citizen especially for woman

just think dad farther grandparent if she dy your now the care giver tonthat family that or the state orphanage some one will need to be the care giver to those child left behimd
this just proved that american are the least free people in the world amongst the 23 industrialized nation no other society in this category force it citizen to give birth and die it reminds me of how slave owner would dehumanize slave a property by taking away their body autonomy today message is clear the state owns you and your body and you are property of the state
republican are misogynistic and evil
all this from a man who is currently under criminal indictment and hide from it while he is in elected office that is the new norm by the republican
woman should leave all these state en masse make the men go to a place where the rule are different and they cant use religion and crooked politics to control woman
the voice of woman ken paxton cant hear them because he only listening to the voice inside his head he think it god i think he just psychotic
texas doe hate woman right
my wife and i had to make the difficult and gut wrenching decision to end a wanted pregnancy that had the life threatening complication of trisomy 18 we have two beautiful child now because we were able to make important decision with our health professional the texas supreme court and the people of texas that support such abominable policy are deplorable horrible subhuman people that are not even close to being christian

a a pro life supporter i pray for katie justin and their 20 week old unborn baby i found it barbaric that we a a society do not do our best to protect both mother and child why doe it have to be just one or the other an honest perinatologist and neonatologist would do their best to accompany the mother and baby during a high risk pregnancy i pray that the cox family is being advised lovingly and genuinely rather than being used a culture war pawn

white collar criminal belong in orange suit making chooses for woman
the people of texas got exactly what they wanted yall voted for this ban

we live in a era where doctor are punished and imprisoned for just doing their job

this is the same guy that admitted on air that he threw out 25 million democratic vote in 2020 because otherwise biden would have won the state
please people do realize that this is the beginning of trump republican party dictatorship on american
remember this donald j trump expresident boosted proudly that he alone wa the person who reversed roe v wade kentucky senator mitch mcconnell intentionally set the stage for trump to place the 3 supreme court justice neil gorsuch brett kavanaugh and amy coney barrett to confirm the scotus justice would be a republican scotus if american woman think that sc justice alitos reference using a 17 century jurist in the year 2022 will stop the republican scotus from finding other oppressive restriction against woman in america you are blind and foolish eliminating voting right for american woman will be next control oppression and power is the objective trump republican fascist party of america
woman must have negative pregnancy test to be able to use a seat belt after all a small short stop at 20 mph might cause the s e at belt to harm the fetus they are fragile when they have no organ
ambulance arrives at car crash see a woman trapped and bleeding immediately take a blood sample she sample to lab wait for result so they know if they can treat a woman or have to let fetus wait to god to let it be born before treating them
folk thought they were fighting satan by standing up for the poor baby that devil worshipping woman just threw away by having abortionsthe life of that woman be damnedsave every baby yupthat is how it wa put out thereover turning roe v wade wa just the beginningwomen were put under the control of the governmentjust wait and see
usa the land of the not so free what a messed up country for all the noise about the usa being free this law fails to the guarantee individual the right to choose freedom religion in the usa need to learn it place those who practice religion that prohibits abortion are perfectly free to avoid abortion freedom but to tell those that dont share those religious view what they can or can not do is medieval backward ignorant etc etc
shut up and take it already or vote blue it the only choice to get a personal choice the republican party is against freedom of choice
cruelty is the point there no mercy here there no care for life this is pure cruelty
how can a woman get thru the court system before they do give birth
if this attorney general should force a birth on a future presence in this world of this woman the physician should fight back it against the law to impersonate a medical physician by law fake physician impersonator are serving time at this point these republican are going overboard now their physician in congress licensed by the vote between them not a diploma from a medical school just a let do what we want with our american let see how far we can go sad

i believe this regime will be prosecuting woman for having miscarriage next there are already case of woman in the er who could not get medical attention or removal of the remains of a miscarriage because hospital and doctor are afraid to perform the procedure for being sued by the state
to everyone who wa on the fence about republican not being a totalitarian regime they wont even follow the rule of law they are openly trying to supersede a court ruling by threatening a 2nd party
you never want a man speaking like this a an ag i feel ashamed for inhabitant in the state no voice but love talking about democrat voter
beware because now they are openingly lying to you saying they want to have excemptions but i promise you if they get a hold of power in your next election they will double down and take away even more of your right land of the free lol give me a break
wow your country is a sick place any woman who would vote republican need their head examined when it is clear that they regard you a second class citizen wow that is so sad
the state a judge an ag the state supreme court lawyer all these people are deciding what one woman should do with her body america
a an attorney ken paxton should know that a court decision is the authority if he doesnt like it he can appeal to a higher court but he is in contempt of court if he is threatening anyone for following the direction of the court
i love texasbut our govt is so currupt
it is old men trying to control woman they are still living in the stone age
i betcha she voted for paxton
is this freaking gilead just crazy
yet they will continue to vote republican
im not sure voting is a viable solution to deal with lazyeyed soulless creature like paxton

the only thing i have to say here is that ken paxton should have been impeached and indicted on multiple crime he committed a the texas ag and before he a monster and he hate woman
the whole legal framing on abortion sound criminal i just hope that woman and all sensible men can get out and vote out the people behind these cruel abortion law
free texas give it to mexico

no stateincluding texas ha any business deciding such a health care decision for any citizen each human can make his or her own decision regarding their own health paxton can decide for himself whether he ought to get an abortion or not but he can go stuff his opinion about others health care
everything is bigger in texas including the duschbag handmaid commander posing a republican ag
just remember this donald trump is not only bragging about getting roe v wade reversedhe also want to punish woman with jail time if they have an abortion if he get elected in 2024 woman and life a we have known it in the u are doomed
it sad that this woman ha to fight to save her life the right to have other child and that she cant make the right decision for the best care that she requires since she won her case and the ag is going to go after the doctor that give her the abortion the hospital and her husband for participating in her abortion i pray that she take the ag to court for attempted murder of her life for the theft of her right to have other child and the doctor and her husband also ha the right to take him to court also for attempted murder by denying the right to have the abortion that could prevent death the ag is also saying that the judicial system mean nothing and that he know more than any doctor lawyer and judge this ag is one sick man no wonder god doesnt bless this country
when you vote republican you get death panel politician in your bedroom and doctor office they told you they would do it
woman a second class citizen is the great in maga that pub want america to go back to
until biden pack the sup court woman will be slave of the state
think carefully about the issue you are voting for or against b
the republican have ruined our state
if god forbid the mother were to die will paxton be charged with culpable homicide or is that too much to ask
jesus christ please come
that is insane who are these men who believe they have the right to tell a woman what she can do with her body
texas ag tom paxton need a postbirth abortion always ha the people voice is a the rightwing gun nutter keep telling everyone the 2nd amendment time for texas woman to speak up loud clear
ken paxton is cruel and ignorant how dare he meddle in this difficult situation he should be sued personally
cruel and ineffective sum up maga republican policy position
this is why i will never forgive amy covid barrett for her magacrimes against the american people not content to slay a million living being with her first ruling a a supreme court justice she viciously tore down roe and now seek another million death by miscarriage and selfishly think it will win her a golden throne and glory in the afterlife without her foul religious predation american woman would not have to beg the government for their very life today
this whole clip is some woke trash 3 woman complaining about men and talking about their body you going to talk about that foreign guy you banged while drinking that old lady coffee next
i thought it wa government of the people by the people for the people i guess texas is too big for that principle
it not about abortion and saving child it about controling woman and girl if they cared about child they would have past better law for gun control foster care and adoption
texas republican have more respect for their cattle than woman
anyone can be a woman today remember whats this talk about right what are those apple engine what
this is a total embarrassment on the world stage i see a fast exit of drs out of u
texas is not part of the democratic world
wasnt ken paxton almost impeached in a vote and in a trial not too long ago
our country sute ha fallen a long waya criminal ag threatening others with charge for receiving healthcare
well we also have malpractice insurance carrier making medical decision for doctor no the insurance carrier do not have medical degree so glad you asked this is the same thing it is dangerous it is unfair it should be positively illegal for anyone other than a patient chosen doctor to choose what is best for hisher patient the bloody end man im pro choice but really thankful it did not have to be my choice desperate woman will resort to desperate action this is why i am prochoice of course it break my heart for the pig that use it a birth controlbut it not my decision i am so sad for this woman truly
ken paxton is a criminal and the fact that the american law allows him to still be a governor make me sick
republic of gilead is alive and well in texas
sue paxton and file charge for attempted manslaughter
republican must pay for this in 2024 especially in texas florida and all punk state trying to control woman
woman of the u we the men of god own your body we own your reproductive right we own your health care you are nothing but property le than a 2nd class citizen you will do a we say a our bible tell u if you disagree then vote vote vote vote
isnt this 2023 or 1723
blessed be the fruit
vote for all democrat in 2024
secondclass citizenship for woman is allowing men to replace them in society literally
what in the heck is wrong with the doctor of texas that they dont fight this cruel hideous law
they dont care about baby this baby ha zero chance of living but 100 chance of conti6to devastate this mother and possibly leave her unable to have child having lost a pregnancy at 22 week the grief and devastation that come with knowing that you will never get to bring your baby home is beyond what most people can grasp her milk will come in and there will be no baby to feed to put her through this is absolutely disgusting cruelty seems to be the point and i am thankful that i dont live in texas
imagine what happens to the citizen of this country who can not afford a lawyer or lawsuit what are they supposed to do ken paxton ha ignored the judge and threatened to prosecute her doctor and husband this is american we should all be furious
yes this is health care why call it abortion turning off life support for a terminally ill patient is not called homicide
the medical community should have created different code long ago for situation like unwanted loss of wanted pregnancy this is no different than removing someone with no chance of recovery off life support if it had terminology recognizing it not the same situation a what everyone mean when referring to abortion we wouldnt be here
paxton is like the villain in a bad movie red state are going backwards
how doe it affect woman status men can be pregnant people too ya know
another reason to never live in texas
if you believe the bible you dont believe that woman are equal to men it not binary like conservative pretend god made man man wa lonely god cloned adam and made him a trans gender partner conservative are hypocrite
law written by men for men period we couldnt get the era passed the gop will never allow woman to survive their hatred
magaga is going to regret this
this cruelty and negligence to this lady is ridiculous the usa ha gone backwards to the rest of the progressive world
i cant believe that the man and woman kenny pax suppose his daughter wife every woman in texas his selfishness and fear of woman maybe he should have a baby
the irony is the gop want to cut funding to all childrens program that help child in need but they want to insinuate themselves in between a doctor and a woman these men who are making these law are hypocrite
maybe paxton should be sued or arrested for practicing medicine without a license
the judge already ruled but paxton prefers to impose his cruel personal ideology on a suffering woman just to show her who bos i can not use the word here that i would prefer to say
texas when told theyve got it wrong say hold my beer
these people need to be stopped may i suggest that emergency personnel when arriving at an accident find gopers on scene and injured the paramedic and physician claim this is an act of god hand them a bible and tell them they havent prayed hard enough and walk away
religion is the motivating force behind all republican law being cold hearted hateful and prejudice against everybody that doesnt go to their churchgod must be proud to have such heartless spinless worm standing up for him
let be real she most likely voted republican until it didnt work to her advantage now we are supposed to feel bad for her year of poor choice stop voting for them then cry when they bite you the republican party ha been the party of hate for decade and the european woman have been voting for them or decade now they losing their right the republican party is the party of hate really
what can woman do to retake their bodily autonomy that answer is very simple vote for democrat across the board and get those evangelical tyrant republican idiot out of our government
their holy book tell them woman are property
she doesnt realize that she is not considered an equal with men she is property and is now being reminded of that status we have fought for equal treatment for decade and finally won in 1973 here we are back at square one
i find it very important to point out how much of the issue around abortion is coming from men i am so tired of men trying to control everything and anything on this planet especially a woman body and health issue woman are not your incubator and if you really want to end unwanted abortion then it ha to come from the root cause of a pregnancy which is the sperm the sperm is what cause the pregnancy not the woman egg no sperm no unwanted abortion
why do we continue to excuse murder
a bet you a quarter that in the past maybe one of trump girlfriend had an abortionim not saying it trueno proof but why wa he pro choice back in the day then in 2015he change to pro lifebecause evangelist where supporting himand how many republican have the same history when younger their girlfriend had abortionsiporcrytes
why is ken paxton not in prison yet all government aid to texas should be banned
vote them out
this is so distressing she is cradling her bump so the baby is more than just a clump of cell and for this poor woman to let go and say goodbye to her baby who she know will never survive must be so sad and for some republican fool to pontificate and threaten her health care provider who are trying to help her survive it just unfathomable republican who support torturing woman are doomed
looney tune think people think
please can we call it healthcare because that is what it isan abortion is only part of the healthcare she need a key part of her healthcare she can not get
ken paxton belongs in prison
im pretty sure denying someone medical care to the point where theyre almost on the brink of death is a sin texan need to read their bible more closely
he should be in prison for corruption but his time is coming
why doe your country even have judge if noone listens to them
republican are using abortion a just another tool against woman to maintain control and authority force birth oppose program for childcare and economic cost of raising child force woman from achieving higher education and employment advancement
i am pretty sure that if ken paxton wa suffering from a medical emergency he would get the best treatment from texas doctor so if ken belief that this poor woman should not get the medical treatment in an emergency situation then neither should ken nor any of his family even in an emergency situation
voter in texas wanted it that way they voted their people in
imagine the arrogance and cruelty it take to force a woman to endure such continuous pain and suffering and mental anguish to prove your christian value and some nonsense religious point if she is unable to have child again because of this she should sue paxton personally and the state of texas for damage
shouldnt politicans write law that help healthcare worker keep and support their sworn hippocratic oath and not break them do to avoid legal prosecution
a a texan im appalled at our republican house the ag paxton paxton is a major criminal being allowed to stay in office by the other republican who are know accomplice in his crime the texas republican money is vile corrupt how texas ha allowed this to happen is beyond comprehension
abortionondemand turn men into second class citizen and brainwashes woman into believing that theyre god that have control over life and death even the prolife movement doesnt have control over life and death were the messenger for the one who doe
it sure is and the rest of u peones are next in the traitorous republican cross hair
ken paxton is the the most despicable sleazy poshe need to be removed from the ag office immediately
it too bad msnbc decided to report the story this way because it actually an example of our law and court working correctly new law are sometimes purposely vague in order to allow for the citizen to debate the issue and work out the detail in court it impossible to consider every possible outcome or consequence of something like a partial abortion ban so iit sometimes make sense to provide a general framework get clarified over time the woman in question took her issue to court because it wa possibly borderline and prevailed because of an effective attorney we should be happy with this not angry
ken paxton and gov abbott shoukd be removed investigates and barred from gilding any office
kkk want to control everything but other pink girlmen
for someone who looking from outside the united state this is one of the most depressing thing i ever heard it just depressing and sad to see how bad
the left dramatist this case is pathetic and discusting mika is one special woman huh folk she know nothing about this but is telling people that maybe she cant have a child in the future i dont think she ha the qualification to do that
let see if the most ignorant stupid people in the usa could figure this out and explain it to the rest of the country we were number one worldwide in education now we are number 24 worldwide in education because we let the criminal democratic party and the stupid people that vote for them take over the university and the college will some intellectually stupid democratic person explain that to any of u because i like to know why they were so stupid to vote for the criminal democratic party they are destroying the usa and everybody already know there the ignorant people that vote for the criminal democratic party theyre too stupid to understand any off this

woman just need to move out of texas leave these control freak men behind to be the incels they deserve to be
it amazing that paxton isnt in jail republican have a moral value at all to vote for criminal for office
smh it strike me the whole abortion issue is about fear and control those most fearful of what for god sake woman are the one most hung up on controlling they couldnt control their way out of a paper bag
the last stats and study i saw were that over 75 of abortion were out of convenience with money and not the right time being the top two reason le than 5 are out of actual medical necessity
if you want to know how thing like this can happen in the state of texas it is because texas is the buckle in the bible belt these are god fearing fascist in this statenot all of them but too many of them
lol second class a if a mythical 1st class is getting abortion wow leftist are this nonsensical it comical im not even prolife and i cant stand the way you idiot talk about this
i live in texas and yes our state government is run by a bunch of hack but that doe not let the voter off the hook on this issue no i have never voted for a single one of the abysmal candidate that were elected to lead this state but a a voter i share the collective guilt of the voter of texas who have installed these misfit into place of power i apologize profusely for the misery that woman and her family have had to face because of our elected crud and ken paxton is the worst of the lot
nice to see the bonehead havent learned a thing and keep doubling down on stupid
ken paxton you nut case these decision are not your business
with ken paxton would qualify the abortion is when this woman ha a tombstone and dy from the complication of the pregnancy
bring it on texas keep pushing america button fafo
this doesnt seem very pro life too me condemning them to potentially die from medical issue very texas pro life only after people die then do bare minimum to fix issue to look like theyre doing something texas energy grid come to mind people who didnt realize how conservative american are must not deal with many restrictive law colombia a very catholic country legalized abortion a did overly conservative skorea the usa isnt that pro life more like pro cruelty i wouldnt be surprised if the usa start acting like uganda or russia and start going after lgbt next
it shame that they used religion a a tool to control woman body
george carlin had the gop dead to right they are not prolife conservative want live baby so they can raise them to be dead soldier
hold on define citizen ship is that at the open border
men should have no say in any woman health issue
doesnt texas execute criminal why isnt that life sacred christian playing god
there not a single woman in texas that feel like a second class citizen
when the comment about abortion after birth wouldnt this be the same thing to force a woman to carry a baby knowing ultimately the baby will suffer a painful death after birth
why do we have to deal with the state when we go see our doctor this is no one business but our own if you dont like abortion dont have one if you dont like to think about it dont you will never know these woman story and it messed up that we have to be public with our health issue we are all held hostage by a few men dont like or appreciate woman
wheres the surpriseyou voted for this
this is just so sick
it is the arrogance of xtianity coupled with misogyny and narcissism paxton is deplorable
each state should have a referendum on abortion let the people speak
you guy have any breaking news on hunter biden
i can predict with very high certainty if this becomes the standard texas hospital will close down maternity ward and many obgyns will leave the state just like idaho a a single straight male i am very bothered by this just like mika
republican must be voted out of all level of government for this madness to stop
id be curious to know where she stood about prolife and where shes standing now with regard to reproductive right and healthcare
so let me get this straight a woman need the ability to murder her unborn baby to be a first class citizen just trying to wrap my brain around what you are stating i understand the dilemma i really do but please do not make this about class right it not about that period there should be limit and woman must step up and take personal responsibility for their own choice personal responsibility doe not mean killing it mean preventing stupid argument foul
paxton say shes an activist yeah i bet thats why she got pregnant
are we going to imprison everyone who assist 66th term abortion cause i think mexico is ready to pay for that wall
yeah right this is coming from the party who trying to remove woman from sport by supporting men playing in woman sport so unfortunate
what part of infanticide do you not understand
so sad for her she obviously wanted the baby there is no reason to threaten her life by forcing her to continue to carry a baby that appears to be aborting already and that can not survive even if carried to term
this ruling would have never happened if the woman suing the state if they were black or brown white woman tear are a powerful thing
the reality is that human society have to be class differentiated patriarchy and matriarchy because the function of the human mind is to discriminate no discrimination is no mind or mindless state of consciousness
no woman should have to beg anyone for her healthcare this is goodmn ridiculous
democrat just love deleting those baby
a corrupt texas attorney general
ask ken paxton anti abortion politician bullying this woman q how many secret abortion have you had paid for or forced mistress to have
this is insanity disgusting what maga ha done to our country
it stunning to me that 548 of texan vote for this

a a texan fuk ken paxton
they dont care about baby antiabortion law are not about baby theyre about punishing woman
oh well at least the economy is great according to democrat govt worker in the dc beltway
usa ha always been a caste class society depending on your race religion wealth and position of power in government if your a poor native american woman living of the reservation your treated a the bottom of our society if your a rich wealth jewish colonial parent government official your at the top of our society
thats a rather nice way of putting it
woman should be allowed to do whatever they want with their body there already too many people on this earth anyway
religion is behind all this crap vote these nut out
where are all the republican pro life preacher now i havent heard any of their take on this they are coward come on out and discus an actual circumstance that happens instead of lying about post birth abortion
this is what forced birthers want for young girl and woman in all 50 state forced birthers have repeatedly proven that they view young girl and woman a sub human property thats the point of law like the one in texas florida idaho etc vote blue to stop them
paxton is a disgrace without empathy for anyone why is he still in power welcome to texas if woman arent allowed necessary procedure then make those in government who deny them accountable for the support of mother and child texas politics suck vote blue
maybe paxton need to do a little learning about these rare genetic problem trisomy banies seldom survive and their life are full of discomfort think of having a baby with microcephley spinal bifida clef palape and lip do a littlt research ken be responsible learn how your action may affect and effect others
now i know where i can sell my steel coathanger collection thanks msnbc
woman in red state are not second class they are nothing but breeding box when they are young and even le when older
sound like a good test for a selfdefense for the woman
while i agree she should be allowed to get an abortion in this instance and what im going to say is not the answer but wouldnt it be easier to go to colorado or new mexico where there are no restriction and then sue texas later
ah so your life on the line and you need the government and court approval to get the necessary health care you need in order to survive the republican party agenda folk
ken paxton a totally corrupt selfserving sorry excuse for a human being threatening woman and doctor on woman healthcare decision what woman vote for ken paxton or any texan gop poltician
but woman are supposed to be second class citizen read your bible ephesian 52223 1timothy21112
never forget we are the carbon the liberal want to eliminate
and texas state republican actually voted to keep this corrupt piece of human garbage when they had the easiest excuse to get rid of him ugh

she isnt a second class citizen she isnt even a person in fascist texas
let make a ban on men who have erectile dysfunction testicular cancer prostrate cancer etc let deny them healthcare and let see how fast they would turn this around this is against the law
where did ken paxton get his medical license and he could orphan two existing child
paxton is pure selfish evil period
this is the same abnormality the son of singer prince and his wife suffered when he wa born and suffered until his death
holy is texas still part of the united state do better
im at risk of death im a human being it unavoidable
i could be very proabortion if these loon are all reproducing at a high rate
a pronoun can not get another pronoun pregnant why are you so obsessed about abortion
anyone who would force a person to carry a pregnancy is a predator and anyone who would force it upon child are child predator
religious idiot trying to impose their imaginary belief on other people a minority of insecure men trying to control the life of woman
my mouth is agape this so is wrong
fun fact abortion is not health care
so all you people moving to texas for a better life better think again before moving to a state with corrupt leader like impeached paxton your life may depend upon it
in joe bidens america you have to step over human feces on the sidewalk keep voting blue
texas is voting to succeed from the union america this would be funny to see how many democrat flee texas if that did happen
the gop want to bend law for trump and his traitor thug from jan 6 but a woman needing medical care from her doctor they step in unwanted and put that woman at risk and in front of a judge
abortion right to stay
how would making an exception affect paxton life i never realized how many very cruel people there are in this country
how quickly would paxton threaten criminal charge and prison if this wa his daughter any chance he can be sued for practicing medicine without a license
fascist blue saying republican are putting woman in second class yet fascist blue want men playing woman sport thats rich citizen are lastin compromised 46s world behind his war illegal grifter his ice cream and his corruption
if men got pregnant there would be more abortion clinic than bar and church combined and they would be running daily special and discount
i have four sister how dare anyone anyone at all tell them what they can or can not do for themselves especially stupid ignorant bible thumpers
democrat woman shouldnt have to worry about an abortion because trying to convince a democrat woman to lose weight is like trying to convince a snake to get off it stomach
this poor woman her life health and fertility are going out the window if she is unable to get a lifesaving abortion that pregnancy she is carrying is doomed to fail because of a fatal fetal anomaly that kill fetus before or shortly after birth
just how low and disgusting can the republican stoop we will never know because they find a way to disgrace themselves further each and every day
great but it not abortion or the democrat poor messaging it the inflation
paxton is pond scum
they are denying an abortion for a woman with a fatal chromosomal abnormality in the fetus it is pure evil to deny this woman when her health life and fertility are endangered
