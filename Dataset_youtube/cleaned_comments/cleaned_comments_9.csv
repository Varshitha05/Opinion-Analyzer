never vote gop again . that 's how we fix healthcare .
"a better world , with le murder"
"easy solution . if men really wanted to save baby life , they would mandate vasectomy instead of playing politics with woman 's body . vasectomy is safer , cleaner , more successful , a one timer , not risky nor fatal , and a whole lot cheaper , hey guy , how about it ? solution to abortion is prevention ."
extreme ? no . sorry . a wrong ha been righted . roe v wade wa based off lie . using larry laders ideology .
they be illegalizing abortion but still let people sell gun legally

"many church are evil . do n't give your child up for adoption . they want to ban abortion only for their own greed and evil intention ; to sell child to pedophile , sexual pervert and into slavery ."
"1 ) abortion ban do nothing . woman will always have the option of abortion , whether it banned or not . 2 ) abortion ban actually increase the number of abortion , ironically . so i guess you people really arent about saving fetal life so much a virtue signaling . 3 ) fetus now have a right that no other human being ha , and that is that the government can forcibly allow the fetus to use another person body to stay alive . no other human ha ever been granted that right . even if you stab someone and theyre bleeding out , and you have matching blood type , the government can not force you to give them your blood to keep them alive . or if you use a mask , glove , etc . but you still accidentally give a disease to someone who is immunocompromised and their organ start shutting down , the government can not forcibly make you attach to them and keep them alive with your own organ . you used protection , so the chance of giving this person the disease that youre a carrier for were very low , but it still happened , and now theyre dying because of you . guess whatthe government doe not have the right to force you to use your body to keep that person alive . thats exactly what an abortion ban attempt to do , however . so im not sure why fetus should have that right when no one else doe ."
"by the order of god , a soul is sent to a particular womb , but by this contraceptive he is denied that womb and ha to be placed in another . that is disobedience to the su-preme ."

is n't it something how they talk about the one woman in a million that could n't get an abortion and something went wrong but they do n't talk about the other billion of baby that are born safe and naturally . ban all abortion pill . it go hand-in-hand with overturning it
every abortion is the murder of a baby . i do n't understand how blind people are .
"the `` right to lifer '' tend not to mention the thing i 've delt with ; i am mow 62 , never had kid ( because i did not want them to grow up in this world ) . i get consistent from people in the reich-wing because i did n't have any . seems it is not all just the gripe that abortion is murder . clearly they have other motif . the reich-wingers will never touch my child ! !"
every woman encouraged by dems to just get an abortion all wind up in therapy . dems should get abortion

"it make me so angry . these people demanding abortion until a long a they want . who do they think ha do these thing . nurse and doctor who do n't have a choice or lose their job . we get to do the nasty murderous thing these people demand . nurse and doctor committing suicide on a daily rate because they are being forced to be murderer . assisted suicide , late term abortion . they monster demanding it do n't have to get their hand dirty or sin against god 's wish . they do n't have to live with seeing baby taken out piece by piece . you are monster to make medical people who swore to say life take it so you do n't have to be bothered . that is why i left my profession and why thousand are leaving daily . you selfish little snowflake ."
till she 's on death door really ..
"doe abortion cause breast cancer ? in medical circle , estrogen is a known carcinogen ( cancer causing ) . when a woman is pregnant , her estrogen rate spike significantly , and her breast begin to change in size and function ( differentiate ) for breast feeding . specifically , her ovary produce 2000 percent more estrogen and progesterone at this time . with the level of estrogen now elevated , if she interrupt the cell differentiation process before full term pregnancy , this elevated estrogen introduces route for the onset of breast cancer . this is the triggering process where abortion increase the risk of breast cancer . this is why in a late term abortion or miscarriage , with this abundance of estrogen , the risk of breast cancer increase by 638 percent over those with no such history . this is also why teenager who have an abortion are especially at risk for breast cancer , because of the change estrogen is already causing in their breast , plus the additional estrogen from the pregnancy . there are a lot more data on this but the bottom line is , ( 1 ) abortion significantly increase the risk of breast cancer for all woman , ( 2 ) the younger the woman and the later the abortion , the greater the breast cancer risk , and ( 3 ) the breast cancer rate for woman almost doubled since roe v. wade . it is medically established that abortion increase the rate of breast cancer . but woman typically are not told about this until the breast cancer start and by then , prevention is no longer a choice . if you wish to learn more , check out `` my right to choose , '' on amazon . this information will help you make informed choice about what you do , and what you encourage your family and friend to do . it literally could be the difference between life or death ."
jesus is coming folk . repent and be saved .
"the living but unborn are person in the sight of god from the time of conception . since abortion take a human life , it is not a moral option except to prevent the death of another person , the mother . the sin of willfully aborting a child , except in those very rare situation where it may be necessary to save the life of the mother , is a sinful act , totally contrary to the will of god ."
i would n't personally want to abuse my child but i would n't stop other parent from doing so .
free ticket to heaven ! free limb to be able to afford to get through life !
stop the drama and use protection ! if you cant afford to raise a child then use a double condom . actions=consequences ! pro life !
happened with biden administration . y'all voted for him and wanted him . do n't cry now . just like how he left extremely expensive military equipment in afghanistan purchased by my tax money .
killing is killing use a condom .
yeah . it mean no baby will be murdered . thats pretty much it .
the defining moment of being a modern woman the right to abort your child . what a sick position it 's the epitome of stupid . i 'm pro-life even if it mean the unborn child might possibly turn out a ugly a your disposition . shame on you for bringing your hurt to the party and advocating for termination of the unborn . go forgive your mother
you can get all these people out on the street to fight for the right to abort but you ca n't get anyone to protest the current political regime in america even when you ca n't afford gasoline and your family is going hungry . how about a great reset to the american people 's priority ? good luck repopulating the future too .
"woman should have the right not to become pregnant . have n't they always ? it is her body after all , her choice . pregnancy is not a communicable disease , it is ( usually ) a choice for exposure they make for themselves . irresponsibly removing consequence of detrimental decision encourages more of the same . `` more of the same '' meet the definition of perversion . some people want big government to mess in personal life where individually you own consequence . that you can depend on big government for your well being is a fallacy democrat are selling and failing with . think about it . people reach new understanding every day ."
i know a woman who is extremely conservative and all about the abortion ban . what she wo n't tell you is that she 's had 3 abortion herself when she wa younger . if she would of had any of those child her life would have been completely different
"reverse psychology that 's why they did this , it 's to easy the government is smart . they do n't want anymore baby born , there are to many people on this planet . you 'll walked right into there hand !"
we need to fight for abortion so black and mexican are not born anymore . legalize abortion n place them in all black community plz ! !
how about woman start using protection and taking responsibility for their action ? aka dont be a murderous po !
"i 'm a 100 % republican , and i just do n't get my side point of view on abortion , or understand why they 're all so against it . personally , i think there should actually be a 100 % legal forced abortion , after a family ha just 1 child , if that many even . none of this adoption garbage either because that just add to the problem . not just because i hate , and despise , child but also , and mostly , because this world and especially this country ( u ) are all completely overcrowded . we do not need more people in it , plain and simple . enough is enough ."
abortion is not medicine it is murder
the movie 2001 a space odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion . a space odyssey is a fetus in the womb . the clint eastwood dirty harry movie wa angry calm . it seems nasty but it 's a good police officer . angry calm is how a woman chooses abortion . everything in motion make one error . your supposed to park the error where it doe n't matter or you play wack a mole with error . it 's intelligently designed that if you try killing god you will always make one error . a movie is in motion so you have to park the error where it doe n't matter . 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind . that why hal computer eye is colored red so it still ha artistic integrity . 2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made . it only ha one error to park . you ca n't do better than that .
abortion is not the issue most people want some regualtion schumers bill advocated for 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 month and aftr birth thats murder
simple solution .... stop spreading you leg
more future wage slave this is why they decided to banned abortion .
they bought the supreme and now this anti abortion law in 2022 ? this law is bigoted intolerant and make a lot of problem for people . i dont know how this people were elected but sure usa voter have to ponder about it
"exodus 21:22-25 authorized ( king james ) version 22if men strive , and hurt a woman with child , so that her fruit departfrom her , and yet no mischief follow : he shall be surely punished , according a the woman husband will lay upon him ; and he shall pay a the judgesdetermine.23and ifanymischief follow , then thou shalt give life for life,24eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot,25burning for burning , wound for wound , stripe for stripe ."
"men have no right to be the one to decide woman issue , especially about reproductive right . if the shoe were on the other foot men would literally lose their mind if woman were in charge of deciding men issue , such a who get vasectomy , who is allowed viagra , etc !"
"here 's what i do n't understand : 1 ) bearing a child carry an inherent risk of death or grievous bodily harm . 2 ) one may not be forced to use their body at the service of another ; that would be slavery . 3 ) one may not be forced to endure medical risk , physical pain , and mental anguish ; that would be torture . so how , exactly , is abortion anything other than self defense ?"
"i dont understand how people who are/were against government mandated covid vaccination , but are in support of abortion ban . it enraging that some only support bodily autonomy when it in regard to themselves , but dont care that woman right are being violated ."
more lie and propaganda . abortion ha not been banned . check with state voter ! ! msnbc ca n't be trusted . beware of these propaganda news network . american deserve truthful reporting ! !
"u.s. democracy is a broken system and it doe not represent the majority of american . the majority of american approve of legal abortion , they approve of stricter gun control law , support raising the minimum wage , recognize our southern border is in crisis with illegal immigration and etc. , yet our representative continually fail u , playing political game back and forth , prioritizing their own need and the need of corporation and special interest group over the average american voter ."
"gop ca n't respect a woman 's right to decide what to do with their body in order to `` protect . '' when it come to gun and violent though , they do n't seem to care about those life ........"
we are all here because our parent choose life for u and yet in 2022 we are still killing baby in the womb . so wrong .
hopefully what the supreme court did will be the undoing and the permanent removal and destruction of the republican party and hopefully we can have term limit
you can only ban legal abortion .
"just wait , itll be 2055 and the country will be so overpopulated that you have to live in stack like ready player one . imagine banning the one form of population control we had a right to ."
almost 50 % of the adult voting age population are woman . if they dont stand up and vote these republican out they will have only themselves to blame when their right are taken away from them . what will it be next ? the right to vote taken away ? the right to travel to another state is already in jeopardy . will they make it so you have to have a man sign for you if you want to travel or open a bank account or get a loan from the bank to own your own property ? this is only the tip of the iceberg and woman need to sit up and take notice or they will lose all the gain that our grandmother and mother fought so hard to secure for woman of today . wake up to whats really happening here ! !
"it le about abortion and more about that some ppl believe they know better how to live your life . but do n't tell them how to live theirs , that 's their freedom . it 's your freedom that offends them ."
abortion ban dont stop abortion . only clinic . most woman are just causing their own miscarriage . i am glad woman have abortion . pro life only want u born so we can suffer . every abortion save a child from this world .
"it 's a woman choice ! republican have no business taking away a woman 's choice to their body ... period ! remind , remove republican ... roevember ! ! !"
"remember , remove , remind republican ! ! ! ... roevember ! ! ! vote to remove republican across america ! ! !"
still hasnt changed my mind . these child matter more than you think
dude it up to the state
protection of the helpless baby is never mentioned .
"why do peopke think they have any right to tell a woman what to do with with her body ? no one should be able to . my body my choice . if someone doe n't believe in abortion fine , do n't get one . but why bc they do n't believe in it , they get to tell others what to think , how to feel , what to do with their body ? i bet most of these people yelled `` my freedom ... '' during covid . thing is they were n't forced to do anything . there were limit and boundary but not forced . woman are being forced to do something major with their body ."
"a a mature woman who lived in the time before roe , i remember . the tear of a teen who missed her period . the ostracism of a pregnant young girl from school , church and/or family . the swallowing of pill & potion attempting to self-abort . or the horror of nurse & doctor when left with the ravage of the damage a coat hanger can do when a woman is desperate . those were horrendous time for woman . please dont make me live them again ."
"never forget that all it take is a political , economic or religious crisis for women's right to be put back into question . these right are never truly acquired . you will have to be vigilant your whole life . -simone de beauvoir"
"it like a really old computer , one is too lazy to get a new one because the old one still work , even though it slow and out of touch and doesnt pick up the internet well , but it ha all your old file and would be just a big mess to switch over to a more functional government , ahem i mean computer ."
over a million dead labor unit in the u alone . big money want forced birth cattle . religious nut want to control crotch . what a team .
"republican do n't give a crap about the unborn , they just want to keep birth rate up , so we do n't runout of taxpayer 's and cheap labor in 16 year ."
abortion kill alot of baby
can texas please just secede from the u . it a po state .
that 's just a small percentage of the general population .. not a many idiot out there a i thought
i would like to know if there are any incident that doctor were charged when treating a miscarriage . if not this is fear mongering . every party doe this . if it ha happened then that would be ridiculous and we should address it
the staff at msnbc is reason enough for abortion ........
"come on , `` supreme '' court , follow through on this fair decision based on the same reasoning ! update the federal voting law ! roe v. wade wa overturned based on 14th amendment and the situation in 1868. look at who were allowed to vote or hold office in 1868 based on the law and the 14th amendment . arkansas constitution1868 sec . 3. the following class shall not be permitted to register , or vote , or hold office , viz : 1st . those who during rebellion took the oath of allegiance , or gave bond for loyalty and good behavior to the united state government , and afterward gave aid , comfort or countenance to those engaged in armed hostility to the government of the united state , either by becoming a soldier in the rebel army or by entering the line of said army , or adhering in any way to the cause of rebellion , or by accompanying any armed force belonging to the rebel army , or by furnishing supply of any kind to the same . 2d . . . . 3d . . . . 4th . . . . 5th . . . . 6th . those who are idiot or insane the first group take care of the former president , many congress member , and the insurrectionist . the sixth group encompasses those people who still think trump won in 2020 !"
this will make people le reckless about getting pregnant .
it is inhumane to murder your own child .
vote blue and get these people out of office
"you are being snowed , wool pulled over your eye , they tell you custody is n't kidnapping , and they tell you child support is n't enslavement , and they tell you abortion is n't murder , you are being snowed ."
"man imagine not being able to get treatment because you are pregnant , but you ca n't cease your pregnancy to get the treatment that can save your life because of the new abortion law"
i really do n't see the problem . no one outlawed dumpster .
"what is nauseating is the motive for banning abortion ... these so called prolifers say they want to save a life , but they wont sign on to feed and supporting the life of the child ... like extending medicaid or raising the wage that will enable the family to function at a humane level . so the family wo n't be kept in poverty ... poverty is one of the tool that the system us to remove child from the family .... in turn an unsupervised prolife adoption agency will be at the family front door . how much will an adoption agency get for a new born baby ... it a fact that the younger the child ... the higher the price ... how many people in our society have horror story of being separated from their family and getting lost in the adoption system .... not having knowledge of their proper identity ... this form of human trafficking ha bee going on for hundred of year . these preditory prolifers must be challenged . someone need to push for legislation to remove the profit from the adoption process , ... the legal human trafficking process"
"yeah , republican shoot themselves in the foot ... lol"
"based on this , greg abbott is done ! !"
with all the issue in the world and a big a the world is why focus on abortion ! ! ! usa need to find something else to focus i !
welcome to the islamic republic of america .
"organized crime is what you are really seeing , woman 's biggest partner in crime walked away from them , look at all the custody and child support law when they really started and you 'll see it all about the 70 's when they legalized murder of the unborn , just because they call something different than what it really is doe n't change what it really is . custody=kidnapping , child support=enslavement , abortion=murder , they just changed how you think about it by calling it something different ."
no matter how you feel about abortion . msnbc is an ignorant outlet that is driven by hate . every valid point they may have is lost in a river of stupidity and ignorance . msnbc suck
it not that i dont understand being pro-life . i do understand . i get it . but it simply doesnt outweigh the reason to be pro-choice . there are too many exception and too many tragic situation where an abortion is - a unfortunate a it is - the best option . and it really nobody business to impose law upon a woman in one of those situation .
"watch out in 15yrs or so , crime rate is gon na go up ."
"it is time for american to man up . if republican win this then we must face some fact . republican have not hidden the fact they are going after birth control next so together with banning abortion this amount to forced birth . if they win and you care about child you might want to consider getting your tube tied or a vasectomy . if this sound a little drastic , it is . however , if republican win would you really want to bring a helpless baby into this country under their rule ? ? ? ? ? ?"
let vote this republican out of power .
"abortion is not for religious fanatic and politician to decide . it is right of the woman to decide , with help of doctor and specialist . there is so many thing wrong with you america ."
what doe msnbc know about people ?
the republican are making sure that they will not be elected with all of the very unpopular choice they are making .
abortion is not healthcare . miscarriage is not manslaughter
if people dont want abortion banned then murder should be allowed
she went into the eyeglass store and thought `` i want to look like a woman disney villain ''
"meanwhile in my state no change in maternity or family leave- we are literally one of only three country in the world to have no care , woman risk losing their job for having a baby , no care by doctor for fear of doing wrong and having to carry your dead baby to term after a miscarriage , no plan for mental health for these woman going through trauma , no plan for expanding the foster care or adoption system bc they can barely account for the thousand of child and woman , especially black woman and child , who disappear after either being in the system or going in for medical care yeah , we really pro-life in the u . meanwhile all those rich girl who get knocked up come to whatever doctor or clinic they want before the clinic office open and get the deed done under the table ."
"you know the same `` christian brother '' that want to deny food assistance to our continually starving kid , want to force more starving kid that we ca n't afford or raise . religious scum ."
it ha nothing to do with keeping baby alive and everything to do with control . if you cared about those baby you 'd stop killing them in your school .
"this will be the same a brexit and trump election . people make important decision based on emotion , gut feeling and stereotype . decision such a these should always be grounded on solid thinking through . people are acting more and more rushed , hot headed and arrogantly these day , and it impacting our democracy"
enact a law the requires male who father child and do not financially support their child to be chemically castrated .
the american dream just get better and better
"in anti-abortions state , could people set up planned parenthood clinic on native american reservation land ?"
"if everyone vote , the gop handed the democrat a major share of both house . the majority of people believe in human right where a the gop belief in billionaire right and bad faith politics ."
a big part of me is desperately trying to hold back from laughting at them for allowing such right to be taken away another part of me tell me that not everyone of the voter knew what it meant
the problem is not the banning of abortion but it performance
so are we going to have punishment for assisting woman in getting pregnant ?
"take a measure of our school , of how disgustingly underfunded , undersupported , de-prioritized our child are . see how the gop fight to take away wic and food stamp that feed hungry child . see how the social worker are handling 10x the caseload that they should be , and all the instance where horrible abuse go undetected because we are n't lookig out for child in the system . see how utterly dysfunctional the adoption gordian knot is . you think these unwanted pregnancy , the child resulting from the forced birth , that they are going to be `` taken care of '' ? give me a fvcking break . that is a fantasy . doctor and pregnant woman need to be able to make healthcare decision without government interference ."
i tell you what .... i 'm so fvcking livid . itching for the ballot box . time is now . this is an attack on woman .
it always been banned in my country
"senator raphael warnock stole $ 60,000 in campaign fund to pay his child support ! that 's how demonrats operate !"
"here 's the thing : it doe n't matter . it doe n't matter if a fetus is a full human being . it doe n't matter if they have a heartbeat . thousand of people die every year because they did n't get organ transplant . there 's no law forcing anyone to give up their organ . medical school need corps to study - but they legally ca n't use a body that did not consent in life . so . even if - and the `` if '' is very exaggerated here - abortion is murder , then that doe n't matter , because you can not force someone to preserve another person 's life ."
if woman do n't care about ending the life of a future baby why should we care about their life ?
"and yet planned parenthood tell protester not to say woman on their sign . they claim to speak for woman right , but wont even dare to use the word woman . cute , right ?"
msnbc get your subtitle system sorted so that it is close to what people are saying
"a woman die due to self abortion or unsanitary ended pregnancy it will be revealed just how little the male population care . all the natural miscarriage that occur , will be considered a an abortion . where are our right a woman , a voter . this sickens me . being pro woman 's right doe n't mean being pro abortion . it mean a it say being pro woman 's right ."
can they not have a referendum on this ? let the people decide through a vote .
that 's why when november come all these woman all over this country have to vote to let the supreme court and gop hear them clearly that a woman 's right to chose is hers and hers alone
"'the handmaiden 's tale ' is merely boot camp , according to the repukeliekkkons ."
"if abortion is murder than every person you did n't donate your liver , kidney , or blood to and they died is your fault ... murderer ."
bottom line : law maker are all about creating more human suffering ! there 's just too much money in it for the people at the top .
"watch the movie the silent cry ! i guarantee you will change u mind about abortion ! if that movie doe n't affect you , you have no soul ! do you know what the leading cause of death for black in this country is ? it 's abortion ! 15,000 or more black child are murdered every year !"
all you biden democrat do n't worry about it abortion go down to the border pick up 10 or 12 people call them your kid call them whatever you want and then while you 're at it let your president know what 's going on down there
texas want to finish the wall all on it own but you idiot have tied them up in court for a long time disallowing them to finish the wall . discus that . this whole administration is disgusting n a lie .
should be banned every where . you people are evil
"really dont care about female right to abortion , because it not that you ca n't vote , but wo n't vote for your right . until you do , you do n't deserve them ."
i hear they are building a mayflower to sail across the great pond to get away from religion persecution .
"why do n't they do something about the root cause - the reckless f * * * * g ! in this day and age , there is simply zero excuse for an unintended pregnancy . wrap that rascal . snug panty . just say `` no ! '' a solid punch to that horn dog 's throat . terminating a pregnancy should be so onerous that couple will think twice about doing the dirty deed . lol^10 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! abortion should be free . cheaper for the state than unwanted child they ca n't afford or parent . but if you still have one walk into any starbucks , there will be a free clinic in back . when you leave you will be sterile , there will be no repeat and certainly no three-peat . and we will hunt down the dumb sob that contributed and fix his junk , too ! !"
every time a democrat fight for more right .. they end up losing more then they gain .. hey dems .. stop shooting yourself in the foot while trying to win a sack race .. lol just about every state gave woman 15 week to decide to abort or raise the kid .. you challenged for more now you got nun .. when ya gon na learn
"hay lindsey g , here 's your people in the street ."
fun fact the democrat have already taken away everybodys medical right bye forcing injection into people body with out consent democrat just passed a law a gun bill that strip away the second amendment from the constitution so democrat have already started taking away and stripping away fundamental constitutional right from every single american citizen and we the people are allowing this to happen and we dont have the courage to stand up against joe biden and his tyrannical administration .
impeach the supreme court judge ! ! ! now .
stay out of my body . the govt didnt have say on the moment of conception ( unless they were peeking ) . it none of it business .
must be hard to live in a country that take backward step on large issue .
"overturning r vs. w will cost the gop just a much , if not more than 45 's `` indiscretion '' ."
"the overturning of roe v wade wa a political choice by republican lawmaker to help their party get religious zealot on board to vote for their party during the mid term election . think about it . the timing is n't just random . whether these justice are religious zealot thou is n't an argument i am going to get into now . what is a religious zealot ? well in my opinion it a person who ha a faith and that faith dictate their life ... and they attempt to force others to comply with their belief by any mean necessary ... whether it be changing the law , mob , all the way upto death squad and such . they do not believe others who do not follow their idea or their faith have the right to exist . and by their action others of faith with anything in common with them , will be forced to help them or face their wrath . and that is how you get anyone who is religious to get in line and support the zealot ... fear and the desire just to survive take prestant , to fit in , even if these idea are not your own . so ya in my opinion ... roe v wade being overturned is a mean to buy religious folk compliance to the zealot , and to force the population to follow the idea of the zealot . either the population act or it lay back and accepts these religious zealot rule . which ha only just begun .... next it will be public school , science , medicine , the list is endless ... but attack have already started on every front .... people fight back and hopefully it will be enough to retain our democracy and not fall back to being pre constitution day ."
"everything happens for a reason . i believe this is happening because it 's damaging republicons reputation to the point where even die-hard supporter are saying they 're voting blue this year , effectively removing the gqp 's power over u one election at a time"
"i hope that every woman that ha been denied medical assistance and ha suffered for it , sue every pro abortion government ."
"everyone need to plan ahead and make sure these cheater have not purged you from the voter registration list . we all need to plan ahead and know where , when and how we are voting this november . they have passed a ton of voter suppression law all over the country . we got ta do our homework well in advance . there are fewer drop box for ballot to be dropped off at . you may no longer be eligible to vote by mail so check now . they have closed and or consolidated many precinct to make the wait time to vote in person prohibitive in minority area . the maga klan ( red hat ) will be out trying to intimate voter . some of them have run off the usual poll worker so that they can intimidate , misinform or discourage voter that might not vote for mara-lardo . we should all expect obstacle and be ready to overcome them quickly . know who 's running and what policy they stand for and against . vote against the fasci-publicans or we will loose even more of our right and freedom . these crazy will make handmaid 's tale an american documentary if we give them a fraction of a chance ."
living in nc near the border . still wanting sc money for it . we go for firework they come for abortion . crazy .
i cry for all the woman who will die because their right to safe care ha been taken away . too many woman will die when we could have helped save them . i live in texas and im terrified of having a complicated pregnancy now .

"abortion are not taken away , the question of abortion wa put back to the state where is should have always been abortion is not birth control"
"abortion need to be legal again , it 's a woman 's body and her choice . unless she ha an abortion to spite someone like her husband or wife . while we are on the topic , circumcision should be made illegal , his body his choice ."
blessed be ...
it 's about the total ban of abortion for me . no exemption is a fking joke .
"can we ban msnbc , fox , cnn . the biggest virus is the medium ."
"see some people think that abortion is a religious thing and some believe it 's killing of a life , but it still is a woman 's right . now woman have to walk around with dead body floating around inside of them . this is not the old dark witch doctor day , but it seems the right far right religious nut want u to do . everybody do n't live by god every word ."
"i am so ashamed to say i am a texan . abbott , cruz and crew are horrible human being and even worse for texan ."
i registered to vote this year specifically for abortion . i will be voting from now on .
"what if we just remove government social program that pay for woman 's contraceptive and reproductive health bill . woman want the government involved to pay their reproductive health bill , but then they go around saying i do n't want the government to touch my body it 's my choice . the biggest problem woman face today is thier own stupidity , and utter lack of perspective ."
"some will be happy that baby wont be killed , some will be angry that baby wont be killed ."
"15 percent of pregnancy end up in a miscarriage . woman have known this but legislator do not . these ban will affect woman choosing to get pregnant , because the risk are too high ."
gop christofascists are the american taliban . forcing woman to give birth is just a start for them .
"woman 's right being taken away are just the beginning . the gop plan to take more right away from many different group . the gop say the democrat want all your gun , not true they only want to ban weapon of war being sold to 18 year old ."
texas violation of the pregnancy act ! ! !
"when child lose their mother due to a complication during pregnancy , i hope the father get worthwhile help from their pastor . jesus wanted your mom to die just doe n't seem that helpful ."
"99 year ? premeditated murder carry a life sentence , usually only 15-20 year depending on circumstance . these people are waaay out of line ."
where and when is the next march ?
we should either take away the penalty for doctor for making the wrong call or also put in a law that prosecutes doctor for delaying life saving treatment
america give more right to corps than living woman
texas is terrible
"this ha worked just a well a banning alcohol , or drug . complete and utter failure ."
2 side to everything . if the state can force a pregnancy they could one day force abortion . it 's already done in china . the state should n't decide .
those who take life will answer to god . all of this evil increase is just getting u closer to end time & jesus ' return .
"doe this mean we 're gon na have organized group that secretly provide adequate medical care for woman , similar to people that were supping up their car to evade police for alcohol running and eventually become the first nascar driver , drug cartel in mexico , the underground railroad ?"
if they dnt want to have a baby they need to use a condom n they wont have to worry about having a baby just use a condom
"democrat should use abortion , boom banning and other thing to get support from both side to win this midterm"
i am an example of woman that morally had no `` right '' to have child . zero . my child would have become burden on the state .
it 's ridiculous that a corpse ha more bodily autonomy right than a living person .
"conservative : baby having baby , that 's hot . ( stroke m16 )"
easy to pas law . . . but the consequence ? ? ? ? ? . . . these right winger are clueless
"can a conservative please explain to me why you dont want to save a dying mother , therefore her baby will also die ? im so confused . or why you want a woman to die over an etopic pregnancy , which is never viable ?"
"the court that did this are bonkers , causing extreme unnecessary suffering for an already vulnerable population . poor woman . government is bonkers . anyone who enforces this persecution of woman ( doctor , police , lawyer , etc ) are guilty too ."
sorry but if your going to make u wear a mask then screw you then the unborn deserves to be have life at anytime
i love to see the strength of woman !
"the loudest group is almost never the most popular group . this is why we all must vote and vote for the candidate or issue that you really support , not just vote to be on the winning team . the quiet dont need to necessarily protest in the street , just actually exercise their vote ."
"india is with republican and trump , protect the child ! !"
"by banning abortion , they thought that it meant just `` stopping '' abortion ! ! now they 're seeing that it 's so much more than that ."
abortion is murder.thank you almighty god that roe v wade wa finally overturned !
vote the anti-abortion jerk out .
texas lul shes my cousin i seen her first ! go murica
why is nobody talking about not get pregnant in the first place ? other than extreme situation . the pill is free and there is the morning after pill .
"just wait til the people see the private water tanker hooked up to the jackson mississippi governor mansion while the 150,000 people have no clean , safe running water . it way past time to eat the rich before it too late ."
"fortunately , none of these people were aborted and have life and freedom to protest ."
abortion is murder the inside right or do n't get pregnant simple a that .
people are welcome to move out of the state you 're in to a place that is better for you . i 'm planning and preparing to leave mine already . is it quick and easy ? no . it not impossible .
black is the dominant color . lol if we a black men impregnate a bunch of white woman i promise those white male will change the abortion law so fast your head will spin . lol i 'll do my part
"america had a high maternal death rate before roe wa overturned . now it just going to get higher . no one would be okay with being told `` sorry cant treat your failing kidney until your kidney have completely stopped functioning , just go home and come back when they 've completely failed . youll smell a rotting smell that 'll make you gag . sepsis sorry the law told me i cant treat you until they are dead and rotting inside of you . '' so why are we okay with telling folk they got ta wait for their unviable child 's heart to stop beating . and come back once it actually dead inside of them , when the child would have died shortly once labor start or exit the womb anyway ?"
why do n't you stop the false narrative . the supreme court handed it to the state and people to decide . fake news and the democrat and nut are causing chaos and should be ashamed their doing it .
"yup , baby get to live"
if you cant trust me with a choice . how can you trust me with a child ? ?
this is similar to brexit . a lot of people voted without really understanding how they would be affected . then suddenly ...
how can the united state hope to lead the world in important issue when they are busy fighting over problem that belong in the dark age ?
the democrat were in power and they did not sought this out .
"shame on these lawmaker for not thinking of woman health , and only thinking of their own selfish religious belief . whatever happened to separation of church and state ? maybe we need to ban vasectomy , and make it a felony for doctor who perform them ? i guarantee it would never happen , because it involves men ."
they is the devil they know the world overpopulated but the devil want a war
conservative should be the first to complain against abortion restriction since they do n't want government to be involved in their life a little a possible .
"* the republican have created all of these problem that we are suffering from in our country right now ! they have done this to try to trick american voter into voting for republican ! * * every american voter need to understand that democrat are not to blame for inflation , high gas price , rising crime , or any of the other problem the republican are blaming them for ! * * the republican desperately want american voter to be totally distracted and confused about the absolutely most important thing to vote on ! that 's why republican are doing this ! * * just vote democrat all the way up and down the ballot , in the midterm , and in 2024 ! if you do this , and the democrat control the country , all our problem will start to go away ! trust this ! *"
here 's the secret ... * every single bill and law the republican vote on is deliberately harmful to the american people in some way either directly or indirectly ! and this is not an accident ! * * the republican do not have any policy or any intention of ever helping the ordinary average american citizen ! the only way they can succeed is if they make democrat look bad ! * * american need to realize that the only people who actually care about you are the democrat ! you must have faith that the democrat are the good guy ! you need to vote democrat ! * * the republican want american to think that the democrat are doing the wrong thing so that american voter will vote for republican ! this is the biggest mistake you will ever make ! *
"oh i know this one , it 's barbaric . that 's what it mean . there is a reason most of the world offer abortion one way or another . it 's because when you do n't allow abortion to be performed , woman die for no reason . we have the technology to save them and we are n't using it based on the decision of a few judge that were n't elected . they were appointed by a president who did n't win the popular vote . based on the preference of a minority of deranged religious fanatic . a loud , caustic minority , but still a minority ."
woman do you think it is time to take to show we have power . now is the time to fight . this must be much bigger then my time of burning bra . we never kept it going equal pay for the same work . why is it these men feel they have the right to a woman 's health . who wa the republican sob who wanted a part of a bill excluding age which would mean he could marry a child . if there is a god thank you for givi g wisdom to catch it expose him for the predator he is and what wanted fing child .
if it your body your choice then why were people being threatened to be fired from their job if they didnt get vaccinated ? it the principle of the matter . my body my choice . not to mention all the people who are dealing with the side effect of getting vaccinated . they wont even publicize that . our principle are not your body and it not your choice . thats what we should stick to . so too bad
"i 'm so glad we have put a stop to the wholesale slaughter of baby ! ! ! yeah , i said it !"
"0:02 tangent ! wow , face filter much ? doe she really think no one can tell she 's using a face filter ?"
pretty sad when it 's better legally for a doctor to let a woman die or become maimed by her pregnancy than to help her and give her the care she need to maintain her life and health .
why are n't ob-gyn doctor fleeing texas ? why are n't pediatrician fleeing texas ? why are n't woman fleeing texas ?
they did n't ban abortion if dems had n't promoted same day a birth abortion then supream court would n't t have made that decision until m turned it into genicidal .murderof infant that 's the reason they did this left it with state plus pregnant teen sarearesultof leftist minoratracted person
"about half of child in the united state ( 40 million ) are now insured through medicaid or the childrens health insurance program ( chip ) the vast majority in medicaid . 54 % of child support ordered by the court go unpaid so tax payer pick up the tab . we should put a human service dept on every corner there wa an abortion clinic so woman can enroll in all the entitlement program possible in their state and federal program . every poor woman is entitled to wic , welfare , medicaid , public housing , free day care , phone . and internet ."
so glad i dont live in the u . what a joke !
abortion is a woman 's choice across the majority of the world . the u constitution ha been amended 27 time and it 's easy to amend a abortion law . american are like taliban men who pretend they can dictate what woman should do . land of freedom ?
i am so confused . 99 year for necessary health care while they fight for cop to have the right to murder . can a republican please respond and explain to me why a potential life is so much more valuable than a living one ?
"nickson started a political war on drug . reagan made it a real war will law . clinton provided the prison and militarized police . politician use abortion right for political gain . nationalist made it a real issue . state 's are providing law and the same militarized police . curious , do history repeat itself ?"
i grew up hearing horror story about the aftermath of back ally abortion . of `` doctor '' using the equivalent of a coat hanger to pop the placenta . of woman hemorrhaging and ultimately needing a hysterectomy in order to survive . the fact that the country took away necessary medical procedure based on religious belief is an affront to the very constitution . the freedom to believe/practice a religion or even to not believe in religion . the fact that only now people are realizing the toll that their close mindedness is causing is a tragic a it is selfish .
"choice is about letting the person have the freedom to choose . why are religious people so adamant about dictating over other people choice ? you dont agree with abortion , then you dont get one . but who give you the right to determine another person choice ?"
this is really heartbreaking
"yea , we never asked for it the supreme court did it entirely against our will but go off ."
"the simple solution to this would be to make american who want to force woman to give birth , pay for the cost of raising those child . medical bill , food , shelter , and education should be paid solely by american wanting to ban abortion . take responsibility and put your money where your mouth is ."
let the voter decide . woman body are not to be controlled by men telling them what can or ca n't do about their body . what 's next . bare foot and pregnant . it ai n't happening . million of woman in ca n't and wo n't be controlled like their puppet
these people have no idea what our body do .
"sanction every state with a total abortion ban . no federal money , no loan , and no tax break for people in state with total ban ."
"yet every right wing seat ha purgered ! oh but pink do n't have law , only color people ."
elephant in the womb . vote for democracy vote blue
"you voted for trump , knowing this is what he would do , and now you are mad ? do better white voter !"
"more vasectomy and woman getting sterilization , is the result of this supreme court decision ."
"scotus did n't ban abortion . they overturned an unconstitutional ruling and reverted the decision back to the state where it belongs . if you do n't like the law in your state , move to a state that more suit your desire to murder innocent human ."
"every a-hole is pro-life until their preteen or teen daughter get pregnant unless pro-lifer want to pay child support for every orphan , you might want to let financially burdened parent make their own decision . this is going to be a ton of kid depending on taxpayer to pay for them till 18"
"a lot of people were eligible to vote , but chose not to in 2016. hillary clinton tried to warn u about trump-appointed judge overturning roe v wade . maybe these non-voters thought she wa being hysterical ... please remember that youtube comment do n't win election . make sure you 're registered to vote . .. while you still have the right to vote if you 're tired of seeing red , vote blue in 22 !"
i simply dont understand why woman are allowed to vote in the usa .
these people want to make sure their position is very clear : the life of woman mean nothing to the white men who have control of all law .
"wtf is `` the party of small government '' about taking legal control of other people 's uterus ' ? ? ? or telling people what book they ca n't read , or how they have to pray ?"
"* only 69 day left to save democracy * .... magats make it a point to go vote `` their guy in '' . get up , go vote `` your guy in '' , or die at the hand of `` christian '' nationalist . do n't kid yourselves people .... * this is a defcon one to get out and vote * to save the democracy , or sit back like it 's 2016 to let the republiklans end democracy for u . i strongly suggest that each of you get everyone you know who can vote , to get registered/ * verify you 're not purged * , and exercise your right to vote if you still can . if * revoking woman 's reproductive right , and restricting who 's eligible vote wo n't be counted * is n't enough of a * wake up call to go vote all blue * on ballot , then what is ?"
yes . people realize that murdering baby is evil .
texas ag should n't be fighting emergency abortion .
"law need to be clearer so that doctor know what they can and can not do . removing a dead fetus should be legal , of course . but banning abortion is still good ."
banning abortion with some exception is good policy . enforce the law a a deterrent to reduce abortion . keep your leg shut if you do n't want a kid .
anyone that is against abortion should have been aborted
most arrogant/irresponsible/deranged/delusional step america ha ever taken
ridiculous that politician and insurance company decide on what kind of care we will get .
it 's obvious that the majority of american prefer blah blah blah than actual social justice for all .
just call abortion right gun right
you want abortion ? allow father to have a right to deny paying child support . it take 2 to make a baby but you crazy only want the woman to have a say so . why should you have 100 % say so in killing an unborn child if the father want that child . thats not equality that you clown scream you want !
"being forced to have child is more important than gas price . the traditional birth control that contains estrogen string the clitoris volume by half . theyre castrated . only the mini pill w only progesterone is the one that doesnt completely ruin woman . . this is not a male issue . the fetus is not viable up to at least week 26 , it not killed bc it not live yet , take it out and the tissue ha no possibility in any way with all the money and medical help in the word to survive , it not alive yet , so this is only about controlling female . woman need their clithead rubbed to get off , that doe not take more than 5 min or longer than men=sex education , the angle of the dickrod need to rub the clithead while thrusting , thats it , we all get off and live happily ever after . im just posting it here cause it like people dont know these basic thing in the u . a law just passed forcing all men to have vasectomy , that make u feel a way , that pain is what woman are feeling now . i am an md ."
the gop is an enemy of the people .
"lol , see the power of inertial mass"
the biggest unintended consequence is that doctor will choose to not go into obstetrics because of the insurance . all of these baby pl is obsessed about will not have proper doctor . and woman will still get abortion because a long a you can get pill through the mail itll continue and you can not stop it . so all of this and youre not saving life like you think .
"the republican party is the party of `` no '' . their only agenda is to defend a fascist criminal , donald j trump . democrat put people first over party . it 's a no brainer people ."
trump and the horrible justice he seated should be arrested because the agony that they have initiated against woman and their access to healthcare should be considered criminal .
trump 's scotus made zygote more important than woman . rapist have more right . this is the what republican believe . vote democratic if you want any democracy left
it called life happens ! ! ! abortion mean murder !
"exactly that is what emergency care is . an emergency is some thing that happens that must be treated or it could result in deformity , lose of lame , permanently damaged health , or death . normally if a woman is pregnant she ha an obgyn . if she come into the ed her doctor would be notified , because that doctor ha already been to care for the woman until her child is born . so it would n't be some unknown , to the case , ed doctor but her own doctor . so it is n't like some woman is just thrown to the wind . well it might be if the woman wa n't getting pre-natal care , but that is different level of stupid . people like the woman in this video who base their argument on hysterical emotionalism are no help to anyone ."
"woman , and girl , in the usa are fkd ."
the hippocratic oath is more sacred than that of the bible
if you did n't see this coming you are truly ignorant . if you are a woman and did n't see this coming you should be ashamed of yourself .
this is fake news . disinformation .
there 's more supporter for access to abortion then there ever were for benedict donald . let that sink in .
"too bad you 're number are no where near what you claim . you will lose , just so you know . now ."
land of the free ! ! ! lol .
i completely support abortion even know you actually are killing a baby .
"if you 're a young woman in texas , good luck ."
most voter are moron . it 's a terrible idea to put such important policy in the commoner 's hand .
"ben franklin anonymously published `` the poor planter 's physician '' in virginia in 1727. it wa a guide to living in the colony without aid of doctor to treat a variety of thing . in it , there is a section to treat the `` suppression of course '' . entry state that it wa an affliction to mostly unmarried woman and included a recipe for a treatment used by the greek for contraception and termination . where are the historian calling out these idiot using the founding against woman ?"
leave woman alone and neuter these men
and these said people that are going to get voted for who are running for congress etc what 's going to stop them from lying just like the supreme court justice ?
just another example of how the gop crazy hate woman . they hate everything that doe n't look like them walk like them talk like them or agree with them . question i have is who died and made them think they are god ? i do n't think any of these bible thumpers actually read the bible ! what happened to god 's free will ? and is n't this between me and my judge ... god ?
texas should go independent problem solved .
public service announcement : do n't feed the bot in the comment section .
i am sick of people trying to control woman 's right .
"abortion is health care issue , if it were not for religious influence we would not be having a debate about it"
yall think this will be expensive ? wait till the `` college bailout '' charge hit our wallet .
christine = most hateful group hate and discriminate anyone with a different view from theirs . they use the name of jesus to hate .
"irresponsible abortion legislation will lead to the death of mother , the lengthened suffering of terminally underdeveloped infant , increased number of child suffering in the foster care system , and increased crime including murder . abortion , unlike murder , is nothing but healthy for society and can only be painted a evil by arbitrary moral or religious argument . i do n't really care about personal moral about abortion , mother should have a right to get an abortion just a much a mother have a right to not get an abortion . at the end of they day it 's the mother who ha to live with any sin , society bear no responsibility for her action ."
"unfortunately , a someone who life in a country where abortion is illegal , it is very hard to show actual evidence to those people who are fervently against it . they will celebrate when a woman dy in a backlash abortion , they will demonize her and call her death justice . and a the many comment showed here : they will deny the example of woman suffering from the repercutiam of these law , they will say those example dont exist , minimize it and say their suffering is justified . it is sad how good human are to demonize and remove the humanity of actual living people . those thing are easy to do when you dont view woman a human anymore"
america 's really going backwards and so many people are trying to fight forward towards a better future .
we should start suing every politician that ha voted for this .
the world is laughing at you ..
"am i glad i do n't live in the u , if it turn out that i 'm incapable of carrying a baby to full term because i 'm too sick , i at least get to live and to adopt and care for all the baby and older child me and my partner want ."
it wa such an insanely stupid and short-sighted decision to overturn roe .
"seperation of church and state , self autonomy and revamp the supreme court ..."
"i feel like even woman didnt really appreciate abortion until now . based on what ive seen on social medium and online , this is probably the first bad thing to happen to them collectively in year . theyve had a nice run and now people are starting to actually think about where all this is getting u . low birth rate low marriage rate . no one need a man . so why tf do i care ? they arent having baby with guy like me . so why tf do i care ?"
republican are clown they just like controlling people
"just saying , there wa a reason why we okayed it in the 1970s a time when the nation wa ( by admission of today opponent of it ) wa much more moral and grounded . if even they knew it wa something we needed to allow , than why cant we figure it out ? we just have to see for ourselves . and this is the problem with people who cant move forward , they forget all the bad thing of their glorified past"
this backfired for the republican beautifully .
prohibition will always cause trouble .
i do n't know why anyone would listen to this old woman with purple hair .
both side are wrong on this . abortion is not about cleaning a woman 's womb after a fetal death . abortion is killing a fully functional baby in the womb . it is asinine to say it is only the woman 's decision .
"i hate abortion , but the fact is , they 're necessary . what we will see happening more and more are , dead or abandoned baby left in box , garbage can , side of the road , and in park , because people can not provide for them . you think the cost of abortion were high , just think of the cost of court case will be , and the cost of finding home for these abandoned kid . by the way , god hate those who turn their back on the needy ."
pro life people have created a religious tyranny . they never meant to help woman with unwanted pregnancy . scotus is nothing but a religious extremist court . all gop and conservative that voted for extremist law banning abortion need to be voted out .
i think the g.o.p . now stand for something like `` gruppen obersterfuhrer partei ''
it took 8weeks for all this to happen i
"for every woman who dy from not be able to get care during a pregnancy where they could die from complication , the governor of texas and those who banned abortion should all be held accountable and prosecuted for each death ."
"there should always be an evidentiary test for any ban or law . it should be unconstitutional to take away any right without that . just a assault weapon ban have no basis in evidence to show effectiveness , banning abortion ha only emotional argument ; it is utterly stupid to ban either . there are better solution for both ."
"abortion isnt banned you twit , it just up to the state"
poor woman being forced to have unwanted child is going to lead to a huge increase in the crime rate in red state fifteen year from now .
kudos to corporation like walmart that are providing transportation and time off to it employee seeking abortion .
the president this country elected put justice in the supreme court . and now they do n't like what they 've done ? oopsie !
"she 's talking about extremism ! . these clown are so unhappy they ca n't go on killing baby , boo hoo ! . i guess they do n't call killing baby extreme ; just another sign of the degradation of our country and all the value it hold dear i 'll bet when their child get married and then get pregnant they do n't hold fetus shower ; but i wonder why not , after all it 's just a clump of cell they should hold clump of cell party for the unborn !"
"all the cope in the comment section , because woman cant sleep with deranged drug dealing psychopath and murderous , godless degenerate anymore without true consequence . who would have thought holding woman accountable for who they sleep with would bring so many tear . lmao let go brandon ."
trump stopped hillary clinton from becoming a usa president ... trump gave u ( 3 ) excellent supreme court judge in one term
all this because a bunch of delusional cultist have convinced themselves that zygote are people .
"im a religiouly conserative person but i dont agree with this at all . these people are forcing their religious belief on others . i am happy to resectfully explain why someone should not end a life and the biblical reason for it , if they dont agree thats up to them and their conscience . but i dont feel like forcing it on someone without there consent is right at all . what if the reverse wa true , what if they ban religion because they did not agree with it . forcing them to be secular , how would these people feel then ? god is our judge , not human . stay out of other people life if they dont want you there ."
dont let these republican make you ( woman ) into a handmaid . that is what the supreme court see you a ( just a baby factory ) and not a human . remember remember november roevember ! ! !
"regardless of how you feel about abortion , the bottom line is if youre not the one who is pregnant then it none of your business . it that simple . if youre against abortion , for what ever reason , then dont get a abortion . vote in november"
"the government need to differentiate between an abortion and a life threatening circumstance . getting treatment if the mother or baby would 100 % die or if the baby is already dead is not an abortion , and these lawmaker need to guarantee that right to health care . other then that specific circumstance , then yes ban all abortion"
"get out of texas now , younger woman leave while you can ."
vote blue ! stay safe .
"i can hardly believe how stupid american are . even if i support the ideology , i ca n't possibly think that the law with no exception is ok. they will rather let their woman die then end their pregnancy ... if a woman is dead the child in her womb is also dead , make no sense whatsoever . this is insane situation . no exception to protect the health and life of the woman sound like a dystopian novel coming true ."
pro-lifer who care for the unborn while hating people who breathe .
crazy religious zealot have caused this ban on abortion to happen . religion poison everything . you have to be really stupid to let religion guide any decision .
these law about medical necessity are so vague . medical practitioner are delaying lifesaving medical care because they do n't want to risk going to prison for life . poor woman are disproportionately affected by these law . this is despicable and there are likely dictatorship that have more sensible abortion policy .
or why idealism is moronic .
if no one go out and vote then the right doe n't care . keep that in mind .
"republican will now have to provide . provide healthcare , provide whatever it take to raise a child , provide for what the `` father '' refuse to do , provide for the ignorance and disdain republican have for their fellow american . that 's going to take a lot of money state wo n't have . republican really know how to screw up their own country . there 's nothing like it you can see in other advanced and industrialized country . u conservative are the worst curse that ha ever happened to this country ."
supreme court need to put back `` roe v wade '' and not take any ruling already decided by past justice away by overturning them . these ruling were fought for and fairly won and they should not be in jeopardy based on some minority group with a personal ideology or political agenda of their own .. government can not run properly if law 's are constantly going to be at the wim of who 's in that office or position at another time .. you ca n't have law of one minute it legal then another min it not then another min it back legal again .. how can citizen be held accountable to the law if they do n't even know whether it legal or illegal based on constant change of it ...
it hard for me understand how other woman going along with this abortion law .
who know ! next they 'll be wanting to bring back coporal punishment in the school ! oh ...
"scotus didnt ban abortion , if your state did take it up at the state level . havent woman ever heard of birth control"
`` pro life '' unless your an actual living woman ! ! ! ! ! ! !
"america got what it deserved when it put special interest above the people . it 's easy to blame republican , but democrat are just a much to blame . lunatic trump would have been cast aside like the joke he is if his opponent wa n't hillary clinton . this stupid choice doomed the country ."
remind republican of this error year later . `` hey . remember that failed experiment where you banned abortion in red state and it had dumb consequence ? ''
"abortion is a life-altering event that will affect a woman for the rest of her life whether she ha one or not . she will have to live the consequence all of her life . i would not want to trust a politician to make such a decision for me . i am quite capable of making my own decision , thank you very much . perhaps the voter need to elect new state legislator who will accept the advice of a licensed , trained physician rather than some fascist who want to take away a woman 's right to direct her own life ."
there is no reason woman should not have power over their body especially how society say men can treat them .
"abortion is killing a human , alive baby in the womb ."
"republican are out in force out voting the democratic party . we saw this in the primary where the majority of trump supporting candidate won . if we want to see a change , democrat have to get their butt out there and vote . i just dont know if they will ."
"enough out in the street to fight maga civil war . lock him up , lock him up ."
"nah , it ha n't even come close to showing the true ramification of these ban . wait about 2-6 year , when all those forced kid are now taking mom out of employment , because they ca n't find or afford child care . wait for the social safety net to really strain at the seam , for welfare , snap , wic , subsidized housing , smart start , school free lunch , and health care . wait for ob/gyns to flee state where ban are in place , and woman who want to have baby ca n't find doctor to deliver them . wait until those forced birth kid become school age , and everyone 's tax go way up to provide for their education . most of u never wanted to see huge number of abortion . but there are much better way to fix the problem . this is nothing but a final failure in a long list of failure ."
"the woman in federal , state , and local government , a well a the supreme court judge that implemented this nonsense , threw half the population under the bus ."
"umm , we already knew what criminalizing abortion doe . it kill woman who most often are already mother , leaf child without their mom and family without a loved one . have we so quickly forgotten the image of the young mother killed by her married lover when he tried to play surgeon in a motel room and left her to die alone a she bled out . ms. magazine published that photo ."
"these male lawmaker really havent thought this thru . pretty soon some of them will be in a disastrous lose-lose situation . how long before one of their daughter ha a life threatening pregnancy ? it already sound like a woman ha to be in great jeopardy for a hospital to treat her . if that happens to a law-maker they have two terrible choice . run the risk of using your influence to run interference contrary to the law and risk having the press find out , or having your daughter die . in the first scenario the daughter will be inundated by the press and all those family who lost their daughter in that circumstance . in the second she will lose her life . you can bet in both scenario that he will be cast out of his family by his wife and all the other woman in his life . his political career will be over bc he will either cause a huge firestorm by being a hypocrite , or he will be the guy who let his daughter die . chew on that ."
"i mean , they 'd be about 40 year too late , but isent it about time for all those ammosexual 's to put up or shut up ? if you 're saying we need to complete deregulate firearm because our government might become too oppressive and remove right , you 're late on address this but now would be the time to act on what you 're saying right ? ........ just a thought ."
the republican go on and on about how the democrat are responsible for inflation . ( they are n't . ) but what 's more `` inflationary '' than having a child you did n't plan for and can not afford ? how doe that compare to gas being over $ 4/gallon ? ? ?
"maybe how about this ... until this all get settled maybe woman for once should stop getting pregnant all the time when they arent planning a family ? .... you know you can act like an adult , ,its not like you cant control just how you spread your leg .."
this is why bernie sander needed to win the election .
"the desire , the will , the goal is to never have a loss of life before it natural fait . but reality is that we a human have not evolved to that point , a yet , and a unfeeling a it may appear abortion come under that category . you have to look at the human condition a a whole . you can not separate abortion into a different category . politician have twisted and used abortion purely a a political tool . the day we evolve and there are no more unnecessary loss of life is the day when we dont have to bring law to stop abortion . that day will happen , but not a yet ."

"yea but the federal constitution never protected access to abortion , and that 's why it wa struck down . if people want abortion access protected then they need to lean on their lawmaker to create law to protect it . this issue is not , and never wa , a constitutional matter ."
remember - voter - your vote only count if you use it .
it just stupidity to punish the doctor or woman for having a medical emergency to save her life . this is inhuman ! ! ! ! !
please vote democrat and dont abandon the woman like me in louisiana and other state
all those paid protestors . now i can see where the ukraine money is going
"watching this from europe is just painful . i really hope that people wake up and show those religious bigot the middle finger . and while the backlash last , first make sure personal right get protected by law , and then fix your god-awful voting system ."
mandatory vasectomy . stop abortion at the source .
texas is ran by bible thumpers .

"there are so many child already in `` the system '' ( e.g. , foster care ) and so many child already that are in home where they are unwanted and often abused .... it boggles my mind to see how this will be exacerbated . that 's who i think of - the child who are n't in home where they are loved and wanted . i do n't think of the people who are pushing their own agenda and telling woman , `` i care about you '' ? do they really ? i 'm wondering if they care about anyone but themselves . they 're clueless about what 's going on in the world around them and most likely have never had to work with an abused or neglected child ; it 's heart wrenching . let 's actually care about each other ."
99 year in prison ? that is ridiculous and republican need to go .
this guy really asked for the silver lining
murdering an infant should not be allowed .

"i wa horrified when roe wa over turned . abortion wo n't go away , it will go under ground and woman will die , like they did prior to the 1970s . woman are now suffering because doctor are no longer allowed to logical call ! ! the supreme court ha made woman second class citizen ! !"
banning abortion would create more maga republican so of course the right want to put a stop to it
"if i wa in charge , i would n't have allowed travel for an abortion . make those people in state with illegal abortion vote the elected official out . if you elect those people you should have to live by their rule"
think of all those baby saved .
shame on all mother effing republican ! ! !
"so much bad information on this video . do your own research . abortion is illegal in texas . treatment for miscarriage , ectopic pregnancy are not illegal in texas . the confusion come from the doctor ."
"id be curious to know what plan are being made to care for all the unwanted baby that will be born next year ? are the anti-abortion state prepared to house , feed & give the baby medical care for year to come ? no-one seems to be addressing that issue ..."
"technology changed in the blink of an eye yet her leg are stil up in the sky while the nurse tell her to slide down lower and the doctor hold his vacuum like it 's a damned hoover it take a seed and his came by the thousand and it 's her who they want to send to prison because she 's free but not really and it 's her body but not really so she ca n't drive and she ca n't vote and high school 's feel like a damned joke but here she 's got a doctor 's note , and she is holding her doll with her belly start to poke it 's not your fault , baby girl and it should n't be your burden to carry when his sentence is to force you to marry your abuser and the state will accuse her because it 's her body but not really and it 's her right do n't be petty when his seed come by the thousand and he still get to walk freely . she watch witch burning on tv and she hide in the alley not wanting to be seen a hanger in one hand and a needle in the other she 's not ready to be anyone 's mother and it 's her life but not really it 's her body do n't be petty he held her down like so many others it 's his seed one in thousand must she die to save her child who will care for the million he walk the street feeling cocky claim his innocent like it 's his destiny he walk into the office he claim his seat at the table he life his life like cane met able it 's his seed one in thousand he feel no shame and no restraint so who is trapped in this economy when all the world love new technology should she bear society 's hypocracy when it 's her body but not really"
america is going in the wrong direction after abortion ban .
vote blue in november so we can codify roe v wade
"a per your headline . the real meaning is that innocent baby will be born and not murdered . in the meantime keep your pant zipped guy , and your leg crossed gal . it ha worked for century !"
"understand this , the bible is a fictional bookfictional ! everyone ha a right to turn to which ever faith they so choose if they choose to , but it ha no place in the rule of modern society . if the bible wa used to make law a father would be allowed to murder his child if they dishonored him and if his wife cheated on him or disrespected him she could be stoned to death or murdered by her husband . these are not concept that should be applied to law and right of a modern society , not to mention that in this country we have freedom of religion which mean that the idea in the bible are not the belief of the majority of people on this earth , theyre not even the majority of people in this country . that book of childrens story doe not mean you get to tell every single woman what she can and can not do with her body , or allow her to die because you miss read or misinterpreted a fictional story to suit your own need . if you think that an abortion go against the teaching of the bible and go against god then dont f @ * king get one ! that is where your contribution to your faith begin and end . keep it in church and not in our hospital or our court . oh every bible thumper is a bad a every other religious extremist , thats why theyre called belief because you choose to believe that they have no place in a modern society ."
"it 's not banning abortion , it 's taking right away , that 's what it is , and sensible american do not want a political party that is living in the dark age to be in power ."
what ever happened to using way to prevent pregnancy ? why are there so many unwanted pregnancy happening ?
"another consequence of the abortion ban is all the unwanted baby who will be born , and an increase in the number of people on welfare . and they will mostly be minority , which the `` pro life '' people hate , so they should have thought this through more clearly ."
"so they are banning abortion on a state and federal level but dont medical student learn how to perform a dnc in the case of a miscarriage ? if the procedure is taught it is for a reason and im going to assume that reason is to preserve vital lifewhat the federal government need to concern themselves with is the homeless pandemic , hunger pandemic , gasoline pandemic , social medium pandemic , because covid blew the lid off of the real issue that arent being dealt with and making abortion illegal isnt going to solve homelessness , hunger , or any of the other thousand of issue this country ha . banning abortion but doing nothing about the foster care system in place in americai mean make it make sense ! !"
they did n't ban abortion . the sc made the logical decision that abortion wa not in the constitution and sent it back to the state .
that 56 % number doe not say what about abortion will be an important factor . `` i 'll vote for anyone who will promise to make abortion legal '' and `` i will vote for anyone who will make sure abortion keep being illegal '' both trigger that `` abortion will be an important factor . '' the 56 % number mean nothing .
i see this a a problem of politician letting their feeling determine their policy . religion and state are supposed to be separate right ? so why do we let all these political leader stand on religious platform and not call them out on it . religious zealotry should be something that make it harder for you to become a politician not easier .
"teach your child empathy , folk"
so what ? stop killing child . is that sinking in yet ?
the supreme court is going down the donald trump road of crime . with trump in office there wo n't a need for a supreme court .
"this ha nothing to do with ethic of abortion , never did . this is goverment enforced breeding and mandatory delivery law , a well a direct assault on people 's medical safety regardless of the aspect of pregnancy alone . it 's yet another decision over people 's life , actual existing living people . it will hurt wanted pregnancy and the safety of the wanted child and especially mother way more than it will ever restrict the alleged harm of abortion itself . once again , america , if you keep telling yourself you are the `` leader of the free world '' , start leading in example and not showing the rest of u the worst case scenario . alternatively , mandatory vasectomy could be beneficial , in the meantime at least , just an idea since you 're making people 's medical decision for them now ."
"woman of america , you outnumber men - if every woman voted for abortion right , it would be a slam dunk , especially when there is a large number of men who agree . use your vote to vote for your right !"
"just stop no one is buying the b , we know when an abortion is right and when it is wrong . stop playing game you trying to make it so that everyone can do it for no reason other than `` i do n't want too ''"
america is going back to a neanderthal age
"i guess i need to avoid having a kid and putting my wife at risk . this is sad , and i live in texas"
"im a 73 year old catholic abortion would not be my choice if it wasnt a necessary pregnancy . that being said , each and every person & situation are different and no one should be told what to do . that decision is between the woman , her doctor , and her creator ."
"biology is way messier than the average ignorant christian think . in their head , every sperm+egg result in a perfect baby ."
"expontaneaus miscarriage is not same a abortion . a miscarriage a painful a it is you are not going to bleed to dye in most of the case . ( thank god , now drs have to explain why the miscarriage occurs or if wa poison ) abortion is not a woman family planing thing .. but very irresponsable medical option if it is . abortion is destructive , mutilating , killing , against humanity , . ( specie ) . dream , future ... etc"
wonder if abbot would send along some woman wanting or needing abortion with his migrant bus ?
"to samual flores '' for some reason i am being blocked from responding directly to you . start with exodus 22. god ordered the sacrifice of every firstborn male child a well a the firstborn of every clean animal . the firstborn human could be redeemed by replacing the baby with a lamb . or by the payment of 5 shekel to a priest . that is why jesus is called the lamb of god because he redeemed the sin of man by his sacrifice . there are a few verse dealing with this . god also said that human were no better than the beast of the field , just more arrogant ."
"monster ca n't control u woman , we are not animal nor their slave 's ."
gop were projecting bigly when they complained about obama 's imaginary death panel !
"america is now in decline due to the combination of half the population being uneducated a well a religious zealot , a perfect storm . for year republican have chipped away not only on abortion right but also democracy itself . and now youre seeing those factor come to fruition effecting america standing a a whole . hence the u is in decline , it turning into gilead from the handmaid tale ."
"lady you need to vote these creature out of existence or they will just keep coming back and you 'll have to deal with them again , give the democrat the number they need to put roe v wade into law . everyone need to vote , they need to win the house and senate with enough seat to get thing done ."
why do american die when the republican talaban is in charge ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
banning abortion is so dangerousso many thing could go wrong
"a someone who saw the abortion story in the news in the 70 , i 'm expecting we will see a lot more story given social medium ."
"none of the men involved in passing those law have mother , daughter , or wife they love . clearly . disgusting"
"a the old saying go , `` people tend to not appreciate what they have until it 's gone '' ."
it 's so stupid . woman will get abortion . abortion in our state is protected by the law in our state . woman are travelling here to get abortion . there is more to terminating a pregnancy than an unwanted one . so many medical reason .
"the same people who melt down at the thought of government-mandated vaccine and mask that save life want government-mandated pregnancy , birth , and maternal death . go figure . seriously , folk -- let 's teach empathy , especially to republican ."
i do n't want to hear any republican complain about this .
dark brandon will abort the republican agenda .
"anti abortion is a terrific way to make sure the poor get poorer . and the people who are anti abortion are the same people who want to end social security , ssdi , and other mean of helping people to thrive . dictator know that if a population ha to struggle to put food on the table , a roof over their head , and clothes on their back they wo n't have enough energy to protest the regime that 's in power . north korea is a great example of this ."
a bunch of baby killer .. repent !
you know who else want more child ? russia . woman should do whatever they want .
you have the right to choose what you want to do with your body but that baby inside you doesnt have the right to live cuz the baby ca n't talk on cam neither protest on the road .
"republican on covid : my body , no vaccine , not mask . republican on abortion : not your body , not your descision ."
this is what happens when you awaken the sleeping giant the sideline voter
imagine the irony of the woman who supported these law dying from miscarriage because they ca n't get medical help .
"i think the reason this is an issue is because people think it 's murder . it 's not about woman 's right . there is no consensus on when life begin and those for abortion feel life doe n't begin until the fetus can survive outside the womb . those against abortion feel life begin at conception . you have to resolve that before there is a chance at resolving this whole issue - not that it will really . but , if there is law that state life doe n't begin until ( blank ) there will always be this stance ."
well let hope this inspires the democrat ! !
why am i not allowed to post in comment ?
"i do n't think it 's the act of abortion per se , it is the government telling woman what they can do and not do with their own body ."
"lol , you elected these old azz rapist . eat that pie ."
well the good news is getting dragged into a global war will bring yalls domestic focus on such nonsense a abortion issue into appropriate priority . im sure the russia/china/iran alliance is enjoying the destruction from within the u . make their takeover of the western world so much easier . and they wont give a rat a $ $ what pronoun you prefer in the encampment either
"i am 78 yr . old and do n't like even thinking about abortion , but it is a woman 's private life . it 's a woman 's decision to make . if you do n't like abortion , then do n't get one . what others do is none of our business !"
"the republican politico that pushed the anti-abortion movement in the first place , never took `` pro-life '' rhetoric all that seriously , a we are seeing : abortion in the u still exists and is available , if you are willing or able to pay for it . it wa all about dividing the working class vote ."
all the protester that know one want to have child with
"taking away woman right and endangering woman and girl life is not democracy or american , this is fascism . it must be stopped ."
republican already lost the november vote with woman coming to vote in mass .
"the `` abortion is murder , '' rhetoric is a red herring . i do n't care if the fetus is curing cancer or writing poetry , it doe n't get to use another 's body without their permission , in the same way you do n't get to take my kidney just because you need one ."
"this is what fascism look like . texas is controlled by fascist , the gop ha become a fascist dictatorship cult & maga domestic terrorist ."
abortion is not murder . a fetus is not a person . it 's just a blob of cell . a fetus is not worthy of having right since it 's not sentient nor doe it have emotion
from the outside - it hard to feel sorry for american woman when they vote radical conservative policy ! they have a choice ! election have consequences- hows that working for you !
"it 's abysmal that rule of law and democracy in the usa have become fragile and vulnerable a they are under attack by domestic terrorist in the shape and form of the so-called republican party . the world is watching the syndrome of the american experiment degenerating into chaos , anarchy and threat unleashed by fascist element against democratic and federal government institution and public civil servant within the usa ! the rot and stench of a republican party turned fascist is there for all to see . the orwellian spectacle is ominous . the world is watching gibbon 's decline of the west ."
none of your business . it 's a woman 's body her choice period .
it is really about woman getting access to reproductive health care . republican do n't seem to care about health care service . funny how republican are not emphasing changing abortion law .
how did the supreme court get taken over by the american taliban ?
get out and vote ! period !
all baby killer or anyone that facilitates the murder of a baby should get the death penalty . eye for an eye .
"oh now people are seeing what happens when woman cant abort . people sure dont like to remember the past huh . like , it in textbook and even on the internet how it wa in the early 90 for woman who had unwanted/dangerous pregnancy ."

i dont understand why there even need to be a law for or against abortion . it a medical decision that a person and their doctor make and under hippa they have the right to keep that private . it no one el business period .

well at least we can sell our nuclear code to russia ! that 's really all that matter . who care about woman when we can sell our nation security ?
maga rep : vote for u and you will never have to choose again .
"the state that have banned abortion and made draconian law have made it very risky for any ob/gyn to practice in their state . when woman on either side of this issue are no longer able to find a doctor willing to manage their pregnancy , it will be too late . ob/gyn 's will have moved to a safer state for them to practice and no political posturing , rhetoric or finger pointing will change the fact that their state is no longer a safe place to live for woman and girl of childbearing age . which i feel they 've already done . politician have zero business making medical decision or imposing religious belief on the citizen of their state ."

give u back our right to choose .
never forget that the democrat want to murder baby -- even after birth . they 've said so . remember that extremism when you go to the ballot box .
"some people care , but most of the republican do n't give an f about anyone but themselves , and only know suffering when it effect them personally ."
funny how im being censored on here a bunch of baby killer
"american rave on about being active in fighting for their right and how politically aware they are but that is all b . they dont have a clue . while they vote republican their right will reduce . if you want more right , vote in democrat into every post . stop banning and burning book . stop using godfilla to fill hole in your knowledge . check your belief , your word definition , and demand proof of whatever people claim to be fact . if you had checked trump claim , you would have found nearly all of it wa b ."
we need to rise up and get rid of the fascist in our government who are out here making insane decision . replace the entire house and senate

they will never starve they will eat each other .
smart people will not risk a pregnancy . republican you have stop population growth in america .
baby killer take all the respect or reverence away from `` good mother '' .
"so , i just have one question . how come you all make this about the woman 's right to choose to end the pregnancy or not , then these same people turn around and say that you have no choice whether or not to take a vaccine or not ? take the shot and shut up , if you do n't you are shamed and ridiculed for making the obvious and right decision ."
i did n't realise the gop took their public health policy from the taliban ...
doctor need to stop providing medical service to republican elected official
republican are the bane of humanity
too bad they werent aborted .. so ironic .
roe roe roe your vote blue ..... no republican vote until they understand who is in command ... we the people .... ! !
pro-choice is the only choice in the u . the democrat are the real pro-choice party . vote blue in 2022 .
"dropping roe wa literally the worst thing republican could have done , and now they 're trying to bring back assaulting child in school with bat . way to really fire up your opponent ya moron ."
what make the people banning abortion any different than serial killer whose motif is because they hate woman and want to remove a many people a possible from voting ?
"just ignore all those ignorant people who believe a fetus is a baby . 10 week old fetus is only 1-3 centimeter long , call that a baby again lol . put that fetus in someone 's food and they wo n't even notice it ."
"they want to `` protect all life '' so they will let the woman die . forced birth is not protecting life . these law must be changed and given back to the doctor and the woman involved . this gop insanity must end before more woman , girl or even ten year old child die . criminalizing pregnancy is not `` protecting life . '' what is wrong with these people who voted to do this ?"
the gop is a cult enough said ! ! !
well it hard to see or hear the people who got aborted ...
no ban on ar15s or abortion .
"the desire , the will , the goal is to never have another abortion . the same go for any other loss of life . but , we dont live in a perfect world and death occurs all around u . therefore abortion are required . the same a execution and war are required . you can not have it both way . to pick on woman this way is wrong when the fault lie with all of u in this iimperfect world ."
one dumb country
this is why you commentator will never know power .
"ironically it will be conservative woman who will ultimately return u to some level of sanity with regard to abortion and bodily autonomy , bit by the predictable consequence of their own rhetoric . it 's already happening ."
well then men should not be allowed to be treated for prostate cancer or erectile dysfunction .
we hold these truth to be self evident . except for defenseless unborns .
vote vote vote for life not the insane
"this is mid evil torture to have lawmaker change law when we the people are going to work and are paying tax . stop trying to get u to believe in a fake false illusion . this is absolutely absurd and barbaric to deny tax payer their right is disgraceful distasteful , unconstitutional , inhumane and unacceptable ."
there is no changing the supreme court 's mind . a crisis situation is a very small percentage of abortion . north carolina will be put in it place . she is lying through her teeth and he doe n't care .
we need to be vigilant in everything . there not gon na stop there . theyre gon na strip people from every facet of their right while still calling this country the greatest country where your free and have opportunity . i wonder when well decide to just say enough is enough . theyre pushing and pushing and eventually everything is going to go belly up at some point . control seems to be the objective . there are too many law within bylaw to even keep up with that im sure people are breaking them without even knowing .
you can aways see the baby murder in politics . just listen to this old bag
"remember that when there is a new law put to a vote that limit your right , and when others do n't like or feel the need for that right they 'll vote against you . and pretty soon everyone is going to loose their freedom . really think it throu"

come to california and we will happily get rid of your bad choice . you can take monkey pox back for free .
the republican leader dont care how many woman and girl they hurt or take the life of with this . they need to be voted out .
religion should play no part in politics . it doe nothing but cause harm . religious people should never push their religion on other people . what about those woman that do n't believe in your god ? why should they not get to choose ?
"how effing political for the liberal medium to leave out the following : embryo - an unborn or unhatched offspring in the process of development , in particular a human offspring during the period from approximately the second to the eighth week after fertilization ( after which it is usually termed a fetus ) . fetus - an offspring of a human or other mammal in the stage of prenatal development that follow the embryo stage ( in human taken a beginning eight week after conception ) ."
"indiana did n't get a chance to vote . our supposed lawmaker voted for u . at least they had the grace not to claim it wa the will of the people . they know that if they had given the voter choice , it would have been another kansa , or even a greater margin for freedom of choice . i woulod tell you what i think of our lawmaker , but youtube would block the comment ."
"did n't god destroy sodom and gomora according to christian . how many innocent fetus died in that little operation ? in fact if you believe that event then what about the flood , how many innocent fetus 's died in that `` world event '' . god wa n't worried too much about that , wa he ... ? ? ? i can start hearing the double standard or host of other weird logic ready to burst ."
"better wake up white republican woman ! you sat quietly while your men ha screwed over every one else ! now it 's your turn ! how doe it feel ? he want you bare foot and pregnant with a house full of kid , so he can feel superior and not become a minority in this country ! !"
anti-abortionists always wanted people to die .
funny the one screaming loudest about abortion are the one least likely to get pregnant
crusty old white men who know absolutely nothing about a. being a woman . b. being pregnant . c. giving birth . d. caring for a child . yet these crusty old dinosaur are making law on all these issue which they know absolutely nothing about . absolutely mind boggling .
it 's going to require a constitutional amendment to set this straight once and for all .
"the republican are about to reap the whirlwind , serf them right"
i never thought we would see taliban mentality take a hold of the largest democratic nation in the world . america is no longer a democracy . old white republican male will have woman in burkhas next . christian and wealthy people are self centred people .
these people make it sound that every woman that get pregnant will want to abort it and if their state ban abortion . maybe they should be looking at le invasive form of contraception than ripping a baby from their womb because they couldnt control their sexuality
"we are going to see increasing instance of girl and woman dying from pregnancy complication because doctor and health care system in general are too afraid of or too hamstrung by anti-abortion law to provide timely care . you know , just like we did before roe v. wade 's decision . we have completely forgotten the horrible thing that just suddenly did n't happen anymore once the decision to terminate a pregnancy became the domain of the pregnant person and their team of medical professional ."
"a dead corpse ha more right . you can not use any part of the body of a newly deceased corpse , to help another person stay alive , without strict legal permission - given pre-death `` organ donor permission '' - from that now dead corpse . so a dead corpse ha more say over what happens to their body , then a woman doe ."
pregnant woman need to move out of state until they give birth or they might die . even cat die giving birth . it is not simple . men are stupid idiot . woman need to be in office to protect pregnant woman from death .
give it time . republican will start blaming democrat for not stopping them when they ( republican ) started stripping right away . they will never accept responsibility for their bad decision .
these law these abortion law and the penalty are unreasonable unwanted and unconstitutional to even be on the book they should immediately be expunged never to be repeated again and automatically we ought to put roe v wade back into effect and make it a law proactively the supreme court is fixed it is a primarily conservative supreme court and that 's not fair and i think that rovie wage will be overturned in time but i 'm i 'm really starting to think that these republican need to be taken out of office and never be allowed to go back in
this is why the fascist do n't want u voting . when we vote we negate their agenda .
woman need to change this in november ! do they have power or not ? let 's see if they listen to old white men or if they call their own shot .
okay you can still get abortion it 's up to your state okay nobody is going to ban abortion it 's just they 're saying you ca n't have an abortion when the baby is fully developed and if you think that 's okay then you were inhuman
the usa is a nation of religious violence . no wonder christian usa created islamic fascism . they are one and the same .
life to be lost that will never be conceived because getting pregnant is too scary now
some extreme legislator what to impose travel band on their citizen trying to control what their citizen may do in other state . insanity .
"i love all the comment about vote or vote blue etc good luck with that ! no amount of voting blue will change the discourse in the u , it wont get the church out of your life or out of your body . not when there political hay to be made by subjecting the mass to such inhuman condition . if only there wa some other option besides r or d but it a 2 party system both full to the brim with people that are the same age , old , the same color and basically the same insane view . here a shocker for ya none of them care about you at all , at most you are simply a vote in their eye . cant we all just enjoy the descent into decline ?"
im glad i live in the uk where for now sanity prevails and abortion is easily attained
"if 1 shoot and kill a pregnant woman , double murder . even if she had an abortion scheduled for later that day . sup with that ?"
"yes , their androgynous god moloch is displeased and demand the infant sacrifice continue"
"register and vote , lady . register and vote , vote , vote . fantastic that woman will be the one who finally squash the arrogant , overreaching , authoritarian gop ."
it seems that the texas taliban care more about their ideology than woman 's life .
"keep in mind that this is about power . keeping woman pregnant when they are not doing well , or do n't want to be pregnant should be up to her . vote . vote for woman 's right ."
our abortion is more liberal than china or europe . you talk about abortion like it 's some walk in the park . it 's a mom sitting in a bed with stranger that come in and remove a baby . now people are fine with doing it late term ? or after .. i see society just want convenience rather than morality . the fear of god is no longer in style . it 's selfish society that term their own rule . what 's next . msnbc you are so wreched . god will and is protecting these child . he ha stepped in bc he heard the blood that is cry out for justice . mom that have abortion do n't walk out and have an ice cream afterwards .. if they do then their conscience is seared
"i wa born in soviet union . usa is quickly becoming like soviet union . there wa provision is criminal code , due to which non-traditional sexual orientation wa punishable by 5 year in prison . i had been arrested there for being autistic . usa is getting there . when it doe , i will leave . i do not need another soviet union experience . those republican that shame communist are communist ."
should be banned . killing baby is not a good thing . personal responsibility is a good thing .
surely every thinking human being is anti abortion . no young woman or their mother ever set a goal to have x number of abortion by the age of 30 .
i find it ironic those who support abortion are already born .
woman will vote republican out roman emperor each and every one
"america are always shouting about free speech , free will , a woman should be able to do whatever she want with her body , i mean this is going mental , their are over 100 gender ( supposed ) now , the world ha gone mad , i 'm just happy in ma wee house in beautiful scotland"
love that this woman is filing lawsuit on behalf of woman healthcare in abortion . woman are being treated like we are controlled .by the taliban !
this is all a bunch of manure and riddled with lie . .anything to protect sexual immorality . .
roevember is coming and it going to be huge ! !
ooh jesus . look at all those baby killer
"january 6 the supreme court .. why not , you 'll be patriot according to gopers ."
i agree it should be your choice to opt out of pregnancy whether it 's for personal reason or medical reason .... your life not mine who am i to judge . i can only make my own choice not others but i dont get that option because i 'm a male whose opinion doe n't count just like every male in this debate because lady made it clear it thier body the only thing i can do is make sure my dna stay in my body lest someone besides myself us it against me
one good thing about trump is that he exposed how stupid the republican party really is .
"judge made it dangerous to get pregnant or be pregnant ! ! good way to slow population growth then destroy social security because le people paying towards it . i see that shell game ! ! they also harmed/destroyed privacy right , doctor oath and safe practice , hippa law , besides destroying constitutional right and woman 's right ... all in one judgement call by rogue judge build authoritarian culture and also race a 2 party system towards anarchy . they all need to be charged treason and obstructing our constitution ."
thing could happen ... get rid of those judge now ! lock them up for harming woman ! ! they lost credibility . they are dangerous and biased and merging religious belief and destroying right . ca n't wait until they decide to destroy more right .
"it 's not to early to get sticker , yard sign , and t-shirt for november that read : roe roe roe your vote . get that message out in every community ,"
we need to execute all these right wing terrorist trying to destroy the country .
all that is forced into having the baby should just give it to the state once the state get the thousand of baby they will figure out it 's to expensive to raise these kid until they are 18 then they may change their mind
"a meidas touch t-shirt say , `` roe , roe , roe your vote ! ''"
"abortion is just the present day prohibition , pushed by religious people to try to make society better and more moral . what they dont seem to realize is that it will play out exactly like prohibition . people going to jail , being killed , cartel that control the product will rise and thrive , everything except actually getting rid of the product they are seeking to ban ."
"if texas were to jail all the doctor and woman that they want to jail , it would n't work too well . for varied reason ."
it not just about abortion . it personal freedom without big brother intervening .
"there a procedure that is used post abortion but also stop bleeding . dr will let u bleed bc they fear the procedure being reported a an abortion . that mean sepsis , death , or blood need . banning birth control also is an issue . ppl use b. control a a med to cut pain due to other med cond ."
we particularly dont want old saggy white men telling u how to run our personal health right .
"meanwhile , in the country that officially hate woman ...."
that 's good no more murder of baby
it mean whore are out in drove ...
if you call your self a christian you must be mad to be among this woman .
so the child of god is among this woman that is absolutely madness
"what it really mean is , far le baby being murdered by their mother ! end of story"
dont forget to sign the petition to impeach clarence thomas ! !
when all this happened i really did n't have any input one way or another ! i could have never conceived the notion this could effect me or my love one . i have a young family member who is married and they were trying to conceive.they did and we a a family were elated ! they were 14 week and went for a ultrasound and they could n't find the baby 's heartbeat . they ran all type of test and imaging . ultimately they had a miscarriage . it 's been two week and the doctor are trying to figure out how to proceed because the process of removing or anything is treading on the line of abortion . i do n't understand how because there is no longer a heartbeat . why should a woman have to be subjected to the mental anguish of this situation ? how do you move forward ? i 'm really confused on who this help ? one size doe not fit all !
"i 'm pro life and choice , but you need to know your choice , you child will likely be 'named ' , if aborted their spirit live on and are likely to spiritually and typically sexually enslaved by people running the clinic , and people running msnbnbc , ze vanderbourgh"
"if you dont believe in abortion , then dont have one . do not dictate to me what i can or cant do with my body.i will deal with my soul on my own ."
"if people were not getting abortion 'just because ' i doubt this ban would have happened . imo this is a reset . no abortion and then slowly lift restriction so that we all agree on when it acceptable . saw a woman post a video a year ago about her being 7 month pregnant , her bf left her , so she nonchalantly wa going to get an abortion and start over with someone that want to stay with them . why not just save up the carcass of the entity that are removed from woman and pile them up in a public area . just leave them all out in the sun to rot . let the pile grow and then if anyone want an abortion they need to go and see that pile and sign off that they are ok tossing their own lump of cell onto it ."
"pure propaganda democrat ... what about inflation , the illegals , what is democrat plan for that ! trump 2024"
when the democratic party hang it 's hat on abortion -- killing your own for convenience - that is sick to see u fall this far ..
"a so-called principle of right to `` life '' for a foetus should never be upheld and enforced over the right and desire of human being who are real living . being . since this ha happened , woman are made slave or otherwise held captive to their womb . the whole issue is so clearly religious . church and state should be separate . i do n't transgress your boundary by insisting you abide by my religious belief . you do n't transgress my boundary by insisting i abide by your religious belief this is how we agree to disagree and still get along in society . we agree not to turn our religious belief into political issue ."
"i would love it if someone conducted a research survey on who and how many objector have had abortion in their family . this is the same with religious zealot , they spew god and violate every religious doctrine when it suite them . the hypocrisy is dripping from these people ."
over turning roe v wade show the american people which party is really trying to take our right and freedom .
oh look ! sexual promiscuity ha check and balance now for woman the same way family court checked deadbeat dad . live with your decision unless it is from sexual abuse
if you are a republican woman you should stay silent if you are angry about this for obvious reason . to the rest of woman when it come to abortionwelcome to equality . men had no choice financially even if he did not want the child . woman now have to live with their sexual promiscuity . sound like equal treatment to me
"people should wait until they get married and have a home established . then have child . this would solve many problem . i can understand what some of the comment below are saying . people would like to be loved and not feel alone in the bedroom . they want to end the suffering . condom and birth control pill are the thing now . it really fire me up when i see democrat using this abortion ruling by the u.s. supreme court a a tool to attack republican so they can win in the 2022 midterm election . i believe chief justice john robert ha a hand in this . i think democrat got a hold of john robert and got him to put the abortion up for a vote . then when the other 5 republican judge voted for it . john robert voted against it and said , `` it is not my fault because i voted against it ' . even though it wa john robert that put it up for a vote ."

"`` texas '' & other like minded individuals/conglomerates do n't care if the mom dy . an orphan under the right circumstance is easier to manipulate and exert an agenda upon . that 's good for them in the long wrong . easier to brain wash `` texan '' y companion to their point of view . it 's a long game ... a long con if you will . it 's effective . look at any close minded group over time & you 'll hopefully be able to see that . to all good soul , ... thought , action , & deed matter in the long run . that is all . carry on ."
"only person who should have any kind of say on a woman abortion , is her husband . but he cant have veto power . just hey , can we talk ? power ."
dear dimwit . do n't blame the supreme court for something they should not have been involved in to start with . go to the state legislature if you want change . but first decide what the law should be ! it 's difficult to accomplish when you are n't sure what you want .
this is so wrong i mean these poor transwomen have lost access to safe and secure abortion
assassinate the judge that did this
"good old texas . it 's been said that the state is purple , but the government in texas is so vulgarly red and in bed with the evangelicals ."
"the usa can not be considered a representative of democracy , future mindedness and leader of the world . the usa can be considered a an apartheid state that actively and wilfully promotes intolerance , ignorance and irrationality ."
you people are evil . no response necessary .
"i have never voted before , it felt pointless . i 've already registered to vote , and will vote from this upcoming election onward . religious conservatism need to be removed ."
not exactly reassuring there so many baby killer out there .
"south carolina , republican state representative neal collins recently said he is reconsidering his support of his state so-called fetal heartbeat bill : `` that weighs on me . i voted for that bill . these are affecting people . why , yes , woman are people . thanks for figuring that out ."
"the fauci wheel house of the satanic titanic woman folk and life boat philosophy , that dude in a dress , yes yes , satanic life boat athletics , the devil standard of kiddy stomping excellence"
msnbc is an abortion of journalism .
gop is a death cult
"so giving state the power to allow people to choose is wrong . for over 40 year people didnt have a choice . these democrat lie and inflate the number to scare people . why do democrat want so much control over child ? abortion , school , and raising of them ."
"yes , people are seeing what it mean to ban abortion . it mean : more responsibility for your action . it mean abortion is not birth control , and it mean more human ( especially black baby ) can live ."
this is a reason why religion should have no place in court decision and even political arena especially since texas and a few other state abortion ban law pretty much prof our point on how far they can go by trying to shove their religion down people throat especially wen it come to trying to control a woman body .
look like your tying to make people think there are mass of people but it a small percentage
it funny how you spread false information
"no , we are seeing just how much they want to murder full term baby !"
put every wanted child on the step of the supreme court .
"the outro say it all , `` this is who we are '' baby killer"
"if you see what these republican did to ban abortion it created so many more problem and now law . they shouldve just leave it alone and let people make their own choice , these republican created a problem for woman right and choice that didnt need to be addressed"
"so , everyone need to take note of this . this one issue should let all american know that the republican want nothing more than to become dictator if they come in to power in the future ! !"
this is straight up an attack on woman
look leftist think scotus is radical republican think and ha proven the fbi is biased and favor the left .
"lady , do n't date republican , they do n't want you to make your own reproductive choice ."
"if a woman get into any legal trouble because shes getting or got an abortion , the the man who got her pregnant need to face the same persecution . she didnt do this to herself and we all know how baby are made . then again , the majority of these law were passed by male official . they would probably never think to to that . would probably never think a man should get in trouble for having a good time ."
my personal belief is that so much more could be done if we stopped saying `` abortion right '' and actually call it what it really is ; woman 's right !
"is having our breast removed due to cancer , also illegal ? they are part of our reproductive anatomy ."
this bias anchor need to be fired . how can his opinion of being better off before allowed to be on here . propaganda fake news
"continue protesting , but obey the law . great job scotus . thanks again rbg for sticking around long enough allowing this to happen . your legacy will live on ! ! ! ! ! !"
i do n't like the republican vision for america .
i like the `` no choice no child '' . this would be worse than abortion if it came to play . stupid law and justice would have real problem on their dirty hand . peace .
"frankly , this is a good side effect of roe v. wade being overturned . even rbg wanted this to happen -- the voter will have to mobilize to protect their right to abortion and not depend on some unelected judge staying alive until they 're replaced by similar-minded substitute . that 's a ridiculous way to preserve what ought to be a constitutional right . now momentum will build over the next five year for the right to abortion to be enshrined in federal law passed by the u.s. congress . lot of work ahead , especially with mobilizing the huge pro-choice voter bloc . the best part , the anti-abortion force now have to defend their radical , fringe notion at the ballot box . and it 's not looking too hot for them outside the deep south ."
voter need to vote out all these politician and lawmaker that supported removing woman 's right to have abortion and vote for lawmaker that support abortion
all this nonsense because the white supremacist want to keep the white majority !
vote blue ! ! ! because we want our freedom to choose back ! ! !
amazing how y'all ignore hunter 's laptop and sleepy joe 's illegal business partner from russia and china !
`` reproductive right '' is that the opposite of `` production wrong '' ? ? ?
somebody should tell some of these woman that there are form of birth control rather than abortion !
let those who have an abortion experience the pain that baby in the womb go through . watch what is done to that baby .
"if you have to watch people actually suffer at the cost of your belief system , your belief system failed and you should no longer be affiliated with it ."
"you baby killer and supporter have no right to point your finger at anyone , criminal , murderer , rapist , nobody . your the lowest of the low ."
been murdering kid for the last 50 year in the million upon million and now they are exposed and want to keep doing it . smh
hopefully more republican daughter and wife will die because of abortion banning . karma
"i really effin wish that so many people were n't so keen on the `` fo '' part of `` fafo '' . how can one rationalize letting one human die of sepsis because they were all for criminalizing a medical procedure ? how can one make excuse for tormenting people with uterus just because of one of the many after effect of sexual activity ? and i bet , dollar to donut , just like the height of the covid pandemic , there will still be yahoo clinging to the flag and their bible to soothe that ever encroaching feeling of desperation because their mother or sister or auntie or any other family member died because they could n't access an abortion and did n't have the finance to travel to another state for one . this is a human crisis ."
i hope woman ( and the men who support them on this issue ) really flex their political muscle and vote in force in the midterm so hopefully we can get the woman 's health protection act passed to insure a woman 's reproductive right nationwide . vote all blue in '22 ! ! ! you go girl !
the land of the free . really ?
"take away all your human right starting from banning abortion ! maga ultimate goal is a white christian nationalist ( kkk ) church run slavery system ! woman , minority , and child are property of kkk ! banning abortion so white men can make any woman reproduce like life stock animal !"
all through history anything the government touch fall apart : housing railroad industry school infrastructure farm natural resource health care etc etc the list go on . now people ! just let u all do what we do best . and you guy ? well i dont know what you really do . go somewhere and sleep i guess would be safe .
im a british man and what is being done to woman right in america disgust me . if i could i would be voting blue with you .
"do n't try to stop the scum of the earth from killing their baby . cnn is the mouth piece for the depraved . i got news , you are about to see voice and protester for the aborted baby of america and who do you think will be more dedicated , those acting to save life or those trying to take them ?"
"we all are reacting to this deadly new virus - the moronic agent orange plague . . worst than the corona - this poison orange killer doe it in our face ; lie , obstruction , hate , death to brother , death to our child in school , at mall , at church , at parade , fraud , robbery of our vote , of our democracy , our wombs- the corona did it silently- the moronic virus -with such in decency - splash it all over our face , mind . and heart . everyday in the stupid medium that go for profit over truth . did the moronic virus contaminate all our news ? or is it an advertisement for mar a lago for sale ? we had enough ! though have faith we believe in this great vaccine- love . vote the moronic bully and all it variant out ! let u lift again the light of respect , kindness , like the subaru - campaign for love over this moronic pestilence . that ha made america putrud - stench infecting all the is noble , just , beautiful about us- let u get vaccinated with the love vaccine- it is 100 % safe -vote them out ! they have no right to steal my sacred womb ! this is between man and woman or between you and god . and no one ha the right to steal our national security an sell it to putin ! treasonous- crime of espionage - we do not need no other over sight- we the people are the truth jury !"
"if this doe n't start it , i do n't know what will"
this is why supreme court anywhere cant or allowed to be political or interfere with politics .
roevember will hopefully be one to remember .
"did the gop have a meeting and say , `` how can we guarantee we lose the next election ? ''"
all `` pro-lifer '' should have been aborted . the world would be a much better place ..
"even if you are firmly and immovably republican , tell you representative that you dont want woman right stripped away . if you cant do that , you are a horrible person and your god will judge you for every woman who dy from a failed pregnancy ."
again abortion isnt banned just left up to the state a the 10th amendment clearly allows god how people cant accept this and just vote people out who dont support abortion is beyond me .
it mean some innocent baby wont be killed by some doctor who make money off of killing baby
"oh poor satanic baby killer , dont want a baby , use birth control , better yet keep those leg closed"
"if these state are forcing woman to have child , can the woman sue the to state for the medical and care of the child until theyre adult ?"
that 's a mere drop in the bucket . compared to what you will see over gun control
"republican , woman think it doe n't affect them , but they just wait and see , unless their rich ."
"a comedian named hofstetter once said `` there wa a time that widow were n't allowed to get married . then one day , a really hot woman 's husband died . the everyone wa like 'this is a stupid law ' '' . the only time politician care is when it happens to them . george carlin also commented on this saying `` it 's a big club , and you and i are not in it . they do n't care about you . at all . at all . at all . at all '' . according to the dsm5 , one of the hallmark of sociopathy is that a person doe n't care who they hurt or how badly , so long a they get what they want , and history ha shown sociopath make great cult leader , a shown by manson . the oracle in matrix 1 also commented by saying `` what do men with power want ? more power '' . sun tzu predicted this also . when you back an enemy into a corner , it fight hard and recklessly , for it know it at death 's door . also i encourage you to look into the college prison experiment . it wa ended after just day when the guard got too violent with the inmate . they were classmate doing an experiment on themselves ! so what do we do ? keep pushing . this tyranny is about to break . it wo n't go peacefully so be ready for that . but talking , march , tweeting , these will not work . no tyrant in human history ha ever , ever gone quietly . yes , voting is the least you can do , but in time of life and death , do everything you can do ."
"the longer i 've lived the more weird and twisted i see usa . wtf doe anyone ha to say in woman own body ! ? crazy , crazy ..."
"republican pretend to care about kid but also do n't care when they get shot in a school , ca n't afford food , or are abused by one of their catholic priest . conservative are hypocrite and liar , and it is n't difficult to prove it ."
"maybe greg adam wa correct , why all the illegal immigration ? because they have baby , lot of baby . the government is all about that ."
99 year for abortion ? meanwhile you could murder several people and not serve 99 year .
keep the government out of people personal decision .
pregnant woman in texas are being hunted like animal .
see who is extreme and vote them out !
what madness .
so if you 're trying to say that you can have an abortion all the way up to the ninth month you 're all sick and need serious help .
"vote blue ! get rid of abbott , get rid of his crony ! vote !"
"why are american moving backward ? the rest of the world look at america and we see stupidity , bigotry , racism and truly uneducated and horrible people !"
republican have sealed their fate . the blue wave is coming
giving state power back is not extreme . it would be more viable to argue the opposite . she dumb .
"it 's not really about abortion . it 's about freedom , privacy , and choice . how can the government tell an american citizen what they can or can not do with their own body ? in this case the woman of america ! that 's unconstitutional , and un-american ."
using the word extremism doe not help . life begin at conception . period !
"there are form of birth control and the majority of woman ( and all low income woman ) can get them for free . they need to use birth control , abortion is not a form of birth control ."
something to think about pregnant lady get murdered they go for a double murder charge ? if it 's just a clump of cell why double murder ?
"i dont think ppl who voted for banning abortion care . too many of them arent impacted by it . too many men dont care how the woman in their life are impacted by this , and theyre not informed on woman health issue ."
"dead woman and child giving birth is the desired effect of these ban . the goal is , and ha always been , for more white christian baby . christian nationalism is quite an old term . anerican nazi sympathizer and klansman used the term proudly ."
a a canadian i find this unthinkable that the government can decide what i think . i am so glad to live in a truly free country in canada .
roe wade never banned abortion ..... it 's now up to each state to decide what their abortion law will be ..... so this channel is basically lying to the uninformed
maybe we need to put a personhood amendment for woman . a in you are fully vested in the same personhood a men and therefore have the same right to bodily autonomy
how 'bout people keep their leg closed instead of creating baby just to kull them ?
.... woman have a choice ... and it doe n't involve murder . pretty simple really .
the only pregnant woman a man should be concerned about is his own .
imagine a man that think another man 's wife body and her health is their business . men should not even have a say in this .
"this matter wa settled decade ago . the usa ha bigger problem , like preventing mass murder . it is mental health , the very stupid continue to try to bring u back to a time that never existed ."
the founder never put abortion in the constitution : abortion ha never been a constitutionally-protected right ! why would the founder have wanted to violate the right of the unborn by allowing them to be murdered inside the womb ?
"i find it interesting that the republicans/christians are die hard supporter of israel , a country that provides 40,000 abortion annually . we provide aid to israel , they have healthcare . question is why do republican deny their own citizen ?"
"i dont want to pay your loan or for abortion . your not gon na pay your loan , dont take it . abortion : outlaw this inhumane practice . narcissism run amuck ."
it 's not a ban it 's the right of state to legislate a ban . if you do n't like it elect someone else who you favor .
"how about the politician focus on the terrostic threat caused by trump and clean up that mess ? how about focusing on worrying about our national security how about climate control ? thing that affect all citizen , themselves a well and quit trying to take woman 's right away , banning book , deamening the lgbtq community etc . none if that affect them , except maybe on the next election . let 's hope . we can turn this mess around with the right people in office . vote blue in 2022 and 2024. that 's our only hope otherwise welcome to communism !"
"thank you for everything you do , ms. nancy . i love you ."
"america is becoming south america , with it 's harsh abortion law , that ironically rank among those with the highest estimated frequency of abortion administered . abortion will happen , law do not reduce abortion ."
no question wait until the `` important woman '' are not able to get their abortion or become septic ..
why do american have to put their hand in the fire to see if it hot .
sad nooooo lady u can not murder your own baby anymore ! ! ! hallelujah praise jesus
not to the christian taliban who want to control woman .
that roe wa not codified is a failure of leadership . i 'm a one issue voter and i ditched my gop in washington state in favor of the candidate who wa pro choice .
a far a i am concerned wherever woman have voted republican they must own the consequence of their vote ! ! !
"complete idiocy ! american legislator have not learned about history ! they just need to look at the 18th amendment to the constitution created basically 100 year ago , only to be repealed about 25 year later ! now they have the same crazy ideology in dictating woman what they have to carry for the next nine month and raise for the rest of their life based on a religious belief , just like way-back-when , even though the first amendment clearly state : * congress * * _shall_ * * make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievance . * my grievance to the government right now is their imposing on , and suppression of , the freedom of choice for woman to do what they feel is right for them at the time . _murdock v. pennsylvania ( 1943 ) _ * plainly , a community may not suppress , or the state tax , the dissemination of view because they are unpopular , annoying or distasteful . if that device were ever sanctioned , there would have been forged a ready instrument for the suppression of the faith which any minority cherishes but which doe not happen to be in favor . that would be a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the bill of right . * today , people both the public and the one in power lack the lesson of history and seem to have lost their sanity again . i fear for the future of our country in what it is becoming in what it ha already become ."
are you telling me no one wa aware that the ban of abortion would increase the oppression of woman ? and people think i am mistaken when i preach the failing of our education system ... smh
"remember : christian set people on fire , threw acid on people , and assassinated doctor to bring all of this about ."

"well , when 10 % of those miscarriage cause death or 50 % of them cause permanent sterilization happens , we 'll see whether the gop realizes that blocking your own population from wanting to have baby is a good thing or not ( hint : it 's not . china ha already proved it . )"

"forcing each state to codify and strengthen abortion right , we will have barrett , kavanaugh , and gorsuch to thank . let that notion consume them ."
next republican are removing birth control . they are at it allready .
do you not believe in god . anyone who is for abortion doe not have one bit of compassion for life itself . who care right ? your living your life to it 's fullest so it really doe n't matter huh . what if you were the one being aborted ? god said i formed you by hand in the womb . if you do not want the child i suggest abstinence .
praise god ! abortion is an abomination thank you lord for this correction !
"take the church , at 75 % of income to pay for program to offset their need to abuse woman ."

"if you grew up wondering why everything around you seemed oddly contradictory and hypocritical and could n't quite put your finger on it , now you can , you wa surrounded by baby killer ."
"lady it is cheaper to borrow money to go interstate to get back your right to decide , than it is to borrow money to allow a fetus to develop into a child you could not afford . what make the supreme court think the state government is better qualified to make this decision on abortion for you . what doe the state government know about your circumstance , that you do n't know yourself . from the supreme court : - dear mr abbott you know better than all these woman , so you decide if they can have a termination . ( a crippled man in a wheel chair know better ? ? ? ) i do n't think so !"
i belive a corrupt scotus ha woken up a lot of people and will hand the democratic a big win in the senate and the house . i believe 3 judge committed perjury under oath and should be impeached .

"i ca n't even get insurance to cover a laproscopy to check for endometriosis because i 'm `` not in enough pain yet . '' i ca n't imagine what it like to have pregnancy complication , be miserable and/or at risk for severe damage or death and be told `` you ca n't have care because we do n't want to be arrested for aiding in abortion . ''"
this is why christian cultist do n't want people to have their voice heard because they know that they wo n't get the ability to make woman second class citizen when it come to full autonomy over their own body .
you see live people ! same eugenics lie a ever .

"maybe it 's just me , but i seriously hope that everyone who voted to take away woman 's right to choose for themselves , dy in an excruciating way . it 's 2022 , and we still have people using religion and egotism a a mean to write law for other people that they have no right to choose for . i 've had more than my fill of it , and it 's enough . the u wa never great but this just add extra anchor to an already sinking ship !"
an individual 's right will only be protected so long a it doe n't conflict with the state . nothing could be more dangerous to a society .
why abort ?
this is an outstanding example of why the individual vote count - taking away the power of choice from half of the u population is outrageous particularly a a separation of church and state matter which is a basic tenet of our democracy .
if you are going to ban abortion then why not make a law to get every man should have a vasectomy - it only fair . this really shouldnt be a political issue because it ridiculous . just study the problem ireland have had with this topic !
"from outside america , i saw in you news , a lady whose foetus ha no skull , yet she can not abort . how medieval is that you dinosaur judge ."
"when law becomes ruled by ignorance and religious zealotism . certain thing should stay separate . law and religion politics and religion religion should stay away from everything . expert should be consulted before dumb decision are made , especially concerning something like this ."
there wa never a constitutional protection to abortion . that is why the ruling wa overturned .
thanks nancy !
if i did n't have abortion right i 'd have 3 kid instead of one because men did n't use condom because i wa on birth control .

"with this , usa take one step back . in term of woman 's right . freedom of right . where ? it just got taken away by the gop . so trump commits crime , he doe not jail , but a doc can get jail for 99 year , if an abortion is done to save a life , ? ? ? ? ? ?"
"with the country awash in gun , thanks to the court , i would n't want to be a gutless doctor , especially in texas . just think about what is going to happen when someone 's wife or daughter becomes disabled or dy because the doctor give up power to the republican and refuse care to the woman . it will be interesting ."
if abortion right were put to a vote in each state individually none of them would pas this rediculous abortion ban period . the republiquanon domestic terrorist party know that & that is simply a fact .
give this time some woman related to these abortion hater will die cause of these crazy law . let see how these gop nut react when their daughter or wife or sister dy when their pregnancy go bad and an abortion would save them . it will happen at some point and it will show they are using this for vote not true belief .
i am disgusted that men in power can decide what a woman can do with her body .
nothing hate like american christian love .
"it 's clear that more and more people have begun to realize that 'banning abortion ' is n't just a fun little game , but is actually an action that ha consequence that might effect themselves ( or their own loved one . )"
"25 % of all pregnancy self abort , usually early on but not always . that 's why it customery to wait 6 to 8 week before even telling people you 're pregnant . what are you going to do about those abortion ? arrest god ?"

republican will still vote republican democrat will still vote democrat it wont matter for 90 % of people .
not all but the supreme court are full of rich white men the majority the big majority
"when protestant were allowed on the supreme court , we did n't have justice taking order from rome ."
young woman took their right for granted .
this is not about abortion but about human right ! this is about the health care of an individual . how come nobody say this ? this is cruelty at the highest degree the world is in awe
"i , also , wonder what would happen if mandatory financial support level were set : it take two to tango but np one want to be the men actually paying support for child that helped create . suggest government support in lieu of `` the father '' and watch mind get blown . how about adding in the same charge are applicable to any man facilitating an out of state abortion so his wife doe n't find out he 's wick dipping ."
the lesson from dirty dancing wa never learnt .
"`` the unborn '' are a convenient group of people to advocate for . they never make demand of you ; they are morally uncomplicated , unlike orphan , they do n't need money , education , or childcare ; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationship ; and when they are born , you can forget about them , because they cease to be unborn . it 's almost a if , by being born , they have died to you . you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth , power , or privilege , without re-imagining social structure , apologizing , or making reparation to anyone . they are , in short , the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe ."
"the worst result of anti-abortion are yet to happen once again . wait until a woman dy from getting a back alley coat hanger abortion , then the worst result will have occurred again and the reason pro-abortion law came about in the first place . pro-abortion is not about protecting right but protecting the life of the mother . what get aborted is not much more than a parasite when it happens , a potential of being a person is fact but at that stage it is just a blob of cell leaching nourishment off the host . abortion and medical technology is also being held back , in the future right to life could be a thing of the past when it come to abortion . parasite removed from the host just like a standard abortion will still exist but the parasite will not be harmed but transplanted into a electronic/mechanical womb where it will gestate into a newborn baby . newborn baby without the pain of being shoved through a vagina but a tank draining with the same butt slapping to cause the amniotic fluid expulsion from the lung . mother 7-8 month prior already put the child up for adoption , she just did n't need to birth it . and point being right to life should also include allowing abortion , the focus of the movement should be on the technology not being able to save the parasite though it save the mother . an artificial womb is not impossible ."
abortion wa used by republican to get christian vote .
if a state is legally responsible for a banned abortion then the resulting child should be the legal responsibility of that state . all cost incurred until 18 year old
what do you think would happen if a married texan politician got their mistress/girlfriend pregnant ? how would they then get rid of the evidence ? wait .... i know they legally own an ak51 lol
common laddie move on n down here to cali we banging and not carin over here !
"easy solution . most if not all doctor have enough money in the bank to do without work for 3 to 5 year . a general walkout by doctor from hmo and private hospital should turn the tide . the ball is in the doctor 's court . the money running the hospital in america ha sufficient political clout to turn supreme court decision upside down . america had ample opportunity to keep religion out of government , they failed and religion got the upper hand . that can be reversed , christian sharia ha no place in america . if that is not so , then what we call democracy is b * * * * * * * , and the u constitution is little more than toilet paper ."
it funny how many people are pro murdering baby . sad state we r in
you know who doe n't care ? the majority of republican leader and the majority of the supreme court . the voice may reach them but it 's easier not to care .

"hello ! every doctor swear to follow the hippocratic oath : the hippocratic oath is an oath of ethic historically taken by physician . it is one of the most widely known of greek medical text . in it original form , it requires a new physician to swear , by a number of healing god , to uphold specific ethical standard . the oath is the earliest expression of medical ethic in the western world , establishing several principle of medical ethic which remain of paramount significance today . these include the principle of medical confidentiality and non-maleficence . a the seminal articulation of certain principle that continue to guide and inform medical practice , the ancient text is of more than historic and symbolic value . it is enshrined in the legal statute of various jurisdiction , such that violation of the oath may carry criminal or other liability beyond the oath 's symbolic nature . phil , belgium . peace ."
"even child know it 's wrong , but not you ."
a the old saying go be careful what you wish for . i think the blowback from this horrendous supreme court decision is going to shock the extreme right and cost them a lot of election which it should . being a man i do n't think i have the right to tell a woman what to do with their body plain and simple .
"those middle aged and elderly mostly male politician would not think twice to have their , mistress , aide and personal assistant seek an abortion for an unexpected , inconvenient pregnancy . hypocrite ... all of them ."
keep in mind - this is the 1 % trying to become the 0.1 % .. they bribe to make this happen so everyone is distracted from the rich not paying tax & demanding free handout while most people can not pay their bill .
2018 say a huge increase of ppl showing up to vote which helped and 2020 made mcconnell a minority leader 2022 : we need to the republidiots again that we want the gop gone so our right can return and so the gop wo n't have power to revoke more of our right ( like reversing the voting amendment ? )
abortion is ending of a fetus life so that it will not result to birth because of various reason . what are your reason ? may god enlightens u in our reason .
alito and the maga justice on the court should be aborted .
giving the power back to each state wa a fair decision by scotus . it give the people of each state the power to decide for themselves and to vote for the official that align with their pro-choice or pro-life ideal . if you live in a state where you feel you do n't have right a a citizen then you should consider moving to one where elected official and citizen alike have the same ideal a you . it is only fair that through voting the people decide their own fate .
"i want to know what they are gon na do w all those kid . the state is going to have to place them somewhere , plus it 's tax payer money ."
and who 's egg head commenting . he 's probably never even been with a girl . and experience a girl pregnant abortion is wrong

how doe an abortion work ?

"dont let the stupid people win ! by stupid , i mean religious people ."

"the republican party is a party of taking away . it is n't a party of giving . they wan na strip away your right , your human right . they are extremist . the republican party after trump became president ha decided this is the decade to show people who we really are . white extremist , who hate minority and hate woman ."
"let not forget that in the republic of ireland , even when abortion wa outlawed , the maternal mortality rate average between three and four per 100,000 live birth . in 2021 , the maternal mortality rate in texas wa nearly 34 per 100,000. it not simply a matter of access to abortion . it is also a matter of woman having access to healthcare ."
the two thing that have always made murica an idiotic country . racism and religion . it 's going to end you soon .
"stop calling it abortion . it 's murder . no one can justify murder of innocent child , and if they try to , it 's a red flag ."
"first lady 's abortion ? oh my goodness , i have a demand for sanitizer ."
certainly not just a woman 's issue . there must be million of men who are scared to death of the result of their sexual activity .
"it really pretty basic , if you were against abortion , and you strongly feel that your religious belief do not believe in it , then dont get one , however you dont have any right to inflict your own religious belief on every other american in this country , who may not share them , who may not belong to your religion , or may not belong to any religion whatsoever , thats whats protected in our country foundation , that anyone can practice the religion of their choice or no religion whatsoever ."
what most of the anti abortion people simply do n't know is that many medical procedure pertaining to woman 's health that run from infection to cancer treatment can and do come under the abortion umbrella . they likely wo n't know until it personally affect them or someone they know or love . the religious right and political extremist do n't make that known because they know it will make them lose supporter !
texas should be another country .
remember : in ohio ( the `` florida of the midwest '' ) having an unplanned pregnancy would be considered 'an opportunity ' for girl a young a ten . vote !

educate yourselves before making stupid comment on this feed ! can we please have a debate on here only with those who are well informed . spewing comment based on misinformation or extremism accomplishes nothing . we do n't have to agree but we ca n't debate if only one of u ha bothered to read something other than extremist tweet .
"had law maker bothered to educate themselves , interview woman , interview doctor and other medical professional , research before jumping to action , then maybe they would have been well informed enough to understand the consequence before they took action ! but ofcourse they did not do anything other than pick up the phone and do a 'yes-man ' routine when their donor/owners called about $ $ $ $ in return for their vote against woman 's right to healthcare . some of these law maker do n't even understand basic biology or reproduction ! we the people expect better than what our tax dollar for their exorbadant salary are giving u !"
"1. woman are not going to simply give up having abortion just it is against the law . ( think prohibition and drug ) , 2. if and when the republican get their hand on both house of congress and the whitehouse they will enact a nation wide federal ban on abortion , 3. banning abortion is going to turn out to be one of those thing republican are sorry they asked for because they got it ."

"here is an idea ! if you dont want to have a baby.dont get pregnant ! ! this is not the old day when woman had no method other than total abstinence to avoid pregnancy . thing are different today ! ! if you want to have a child later , take birth control pill ; use a birth control patch ; get an iud ; use spermicide . if you dont want a child ever , get your tube tied ! ! bottom line : there is no excuse whatsoever for using abortion a your birth control solution ."

"having been forced to have an illegal abortion when i wa 15 and a half year old by my mother in 1966 , let me assure people that abortion ban will not stop abortion . they will be done in back alley , in some dirty office space by a quack like my mother forced me to have . i wa saved when my father realized that my bed wa covered in blood , i wa unconscious and he took my to the nearest place he could get help for me and that doctor saved my life . my mother had not told him what she had done to me . so you folk who think banning abortion will stop them are dead wrong . what they will stop is safe abortion access . mom will die , leaving young child without a mom . poor woman will likely die but then again nobody actually care what happens to poor woman regardless of what the right to lifer type claim ."
"it wa about time that all this republican anderstand wa the republican party is trying to do.they are taking the right of all the woman and this is the begging for what they have in place . look at florida , texas , and all the state that are republican . they are even changing the history of the usa in the school and taking the book so they would not know the real history , this is how hitler started .we ca n't let this happen to america . we are in 2022 not in 1940 we have to stop them before they do more harm to the usa ."

i want to know how outsider are getting medical record of these female how doe anyone other than the immediate medical team know the circumstance surrounding the pregnancy
not to mention the fact that they want to send woman to prison for having miscarriage
this is what happens when people place bumper sticker politics over human being .
the people that want to ban abortion doe n't have a clue what they are doing they are nothing but control freak and blind with a one sided view without any knowledge of the risk and problem that a pregnancy can present it not the same for all woman and every pregnancy problem do happen and will continue to happen that is why this decision should be between the doctor and patient it would be better cheaper and more effective to help provide contraception and tubal ligation to woman and those above the age of 35 that elect to do so but most definitely let it be a choice of the woman
guess white male in texas want all woman to be stepford wife and breeder ..

"looking at this logically . the cutoff for abortion should be the same cutoff for forcing premature birth . no matter what , a woman shouldnt be forced to carry an unwanted baby . either give premature birth and put it up for adoption or abort it . the world record for this is born 19 week premature . so whether the cutoff is 4.5 month or 3 month or 6 month , no woman should be forced to carry it to term if she doesnt want to ."
"yes , we are seeing . that 's a whole lot of murder sympathizer . yhvh is also watching . he created the life of the innocent being slaughtered . woe be unto these killer ."

the myth wa promiscuous woman ( note not men ) getting pregnant and having monthly abortion .... the reality is a whole lot different
thats the weird thing about most american : they only get it once they are personally affected . whats so difficult about informing yourself before you make political decision that have far-reaching consequence ?

let 's hope that american realize just how the usa got into this mess.thanks to the gop lining the supreme court with right wing member of the gop that court is now just a political arm of the gop and they will not have the best interest of all american in their decision ... now the minority of america will rule instead of the majority and that is just plain wrong ...
make this a roevember .
"keneilwe mashigo 2 hour ago ( edited ) if texas see a fetus a a human , can it be insured ? i mean , if you have no choice can you at least make sure , should it go bad , you can afford to pay the medical bill ? or will they allow pregnancy insurance , so like after 9mnths you get a pay out for medical fee and extra thing for this human ? real question . usa medical fee are crazy . are y'all at least getting paid for the risk ? you have to have the baby , did they at least increase maternity leave to at least 6 mnths ? paternity leave ? what are the benefit of this law ?"

what 's that ? pic of protest in europe over stealing land from farmer ? or baby not being murdered by the million a a form of depraved birth control . or maybe it 's the death of the elite sick evil form of eugenics .
no man dream of putting a ring on the finger of a baby killer that ca n't keep her panty on . they are going to figure that out soon .
this collective angry crowd is incredibly at least 100 time bigger than any of trump 's rally . it 's definitely bigger than trump 's inauguration crowd . funny how gop 's plan for total domination is failing .

"i really believed a few month ago that congress would be taken control of by republican . it happens basically every midterm of any democrat first term in presidential office . the supreme court really poked a hornet nest by this b overturning of roe v. wade . the progressive base is not usually this excited during this time of the political 4 year cycle , but if we all go and vote we might actually give democrat the tool they need to make significant change ."
yo ohuckkkk republican and trunip supporter
those 5 scotus member are gon na keep going until they get their bigoted evangelical paradise . the only way to stop this is to fight back and fight back hard .
"they are exposing themselves for who they truly are everyday more and more , excellent every man 's eye will be opened ."

i had to change my opinion on abortion after seeing the type of woman protesting for it . do we really want that type of woman to reproduce ? ? ? i do n't .
"supporting and demand and cheering for killing your own child is not the path you want to take , that 's all i 'm going to say ."
random comment for channel interaction .
"saying it for year and it fell on deaf ear , racism and abortion , the democrat bread and butter .... funny how the two are also related ."
overpopulation people think about it we 're already overpopulated
it also amazes me that they could even make a ruling like this . pregnancy is one of the most dangerous thing a woman can do with her body . yes your body wa made to do it but not all woman can physically do it not all baby come out correct or develop correctly sometimes a baby dy during pregnancy . and if you do n't get that baby out you have a strong possibility of sepsis and many other problem . this law is pretty much telling woman that if they get pregnant they have no ability to protect themselves if there is a medical problem or condition with that pregnancy . so for instance a 16 year old girl get pregnant there 's a severe medical emergency and the girl is going to die if they do n't take out the baby but if they take out the baby the baby 's going to die . now so that girl end up dying then the baby ha depending on the time frame how developed it is a you know a 20 % to a 60 % chance to live maybe even a 70 or 80. and have a few kid later on in their life but how many kid could that 16-year-old still had so you 're killing one person to save another person for what reason why is a infant 's life more important than anyone else 's . and let 's not forget for all you religious nut out there god kill thousand of baby everyday why do we have to serve a 99 year term for killing one to save the mother 's life .
"if you are miscarrying , you do n't need an abortion . it will happen naturally . do people believe this b ."
the only way to save the life of woman aside from voting is for the woman in these state to strike . take woman completely out of the workforce and their economy will fail .

"for woman that think the abortion law is good , i only have to say , this is n't about whether you think abortion is okay or not . i tried to explain to my daughter , this is about having someone else ( the government ) telling me what i can do and ca n't do with my own body . for me , it is n't about whether you feel abortion is good or not . that is between me and my religion , or what is right for me and my family , or the particular medical circumstance someone is in . just recently a woman wa denied an abortion when the baby she is carrying doe n't have a skull . this is absurd - it wa a medical issue . vote these people out ! i respect other woman 's decision they make for themselves , but i do not want my state telling me what decision i can make ."

the republican are the american taliban .
we need neutral sup.ct.justices . impeach the judge that lied during their confirmation hearing
this is the only program i have seen that dare to say one word about the family suffering unnecessarily . this is a travesty and unworthy of america . we are not perfect but this is beyond savage .
totally not acceptable by republican leader . it totally wrong to have government take away your right . im voting to make sure we have more democrat in the washington this november .
people do n't understand the meaning of `` total ban '' ? maybe they just did n't think about the implication for themselves if they were to need pregnancy-related life saving treatment . here 's your death panel !

`` strength in number '' ! ! ! ! to all dissenter ; brave enough to take it to the street . brava ! ! ! !
christian confederate conservative just have nothing better to do . not understanding how they are pro life and against abortion and also against welfare and support program for single mother getting government assistance . that 's why voting red is like shooting yourself in the foot . voting blue you just have to fight to keep your gun and gas price low .
"yet releasing toxic pollutant into the air and water is ay ok ! drive through texas in the small town it 's a toxic waste dump , a third-world country ."
the answer is leave if you can .

abortion is murder
who are going to take care of the million of baby born in america after baby are rejected and abandoned in hospital across the country ? are they willing to lock up parent for abandoning their baby ?

"register to vote , locate all voting place near you , and vote blue or kiss woman ' health good-by . then what will the republican ban next ? and after that ? ........"
here in texas they should let the people decide and vote on it . abbott would never let that happen . we need to get rid of these republican running our state . vote them out !

"i 'm in texas and i am so embarrassed by the gov and others . abortion right and voter right . infact , the state aborted voter right to stay in power . roevember"
i suspect well see most state pas law putting abortion on a firmer state-by-state basis than roe ever did and a the conservative justice knew would happen . within 10 year i suspect there will only be three or four state who ban or highly restrict abortion . these will be the four or five where there is a genuine majority against abortion .
he a handsome advocate . why doe the medium think all republican are against abortion . it is a flat out lie .
the biggest problem with america one country but in reality is 50 country rolled up in one each state it own law who ha the upper hand there is no united

america so backwards
"3:45 if leader dont support their constituent having access to abortion , it 's obvious , the woman ( and their loyal familymembers ) will vote someone else ... dictator wont prevail in a democracy ."

nope all phony
"what boggles my mind is that a ) they forget back when abortion were illegal ( or in other country that have similar law ) and b ) they have no long-term thought process : what happens when people are forced to carry child they do n't want ? people were getting backdoor abortion , which were n't always safe and hygenic , often dying in the process . woman died in pregnancy/childbirth because something went wrong and the doctor were unable to give them the care they needed . more baby with life-changing disability and problem are born , causing stress on a system that already ha limited healthcare . unwanted child are more likely to be mistreated or abused . the already problematic foster care and adoption system become bloated with kid . baby start getting dumped ( even more so than they already are ) . and that 's not even touching the issue we 've seen lately where * child * are being forced to carry their rapist 's baby , despite the danger to a body and psyche that is not yet fully mature . yep , that sound like a * great * plan . /sarcasm"

make it a blue tsunami in roevember ! ! !
"so naive to think that banning abortion stop abortion . it hand it over to exploiter , drunk , extortionist , quack , people who have lost medical license for a reason , and desperate teenager . it massively increase the number of pregnancy death of mother , the number of baby born damaged by medication and chemo ( because mother whose period stopped during illness realised they were pregnant too late for these new deadline ) the number of baby killed soon after birth , the number of baby abandoned soon after birth , the number of baby born into massively dysfunctional family who end up being horrendously treated . and republican , be prepared for tax increase to support the number of people who will need total long term care because of being born with catastrophic congenital condition ."

one important difference between now and prior to roe is that woman and those who support their right of self will not be silent . this is a critical difference and one that can make far reaching positive change across all area of our life
this is why `` all or nothing '' politics is the wrong way to go . compromise is necessary in a civilized society . lawmaker should never vote on anything without knowing all the fact . it is blatantly ignorant to assume you know everything about an issue you are voting for . i personally need all the fact before i can form an opinion and i 'm not making decision that impact the whole country . it blow my mind that citizen and politician vote for bill they have n't actually read .
"over the past 50 year , roe ha brought nothing but extreme promiscuity , depravity and more decay ; this resulted to the destruction of the family a we knew it . we did n't know thing would get so bad when they promoted and encouraged abortion in the 70 , but now we know . 50 year ago , we could claim ignorance , but not this time . passing a law that promotes or encourages abortion would undeniably be a curse this time , please men stay away from this . you do n't have to be religious or a god fearing person to see how bad society ha become . a a man , if you do n't stand up for something in life , you will fall for anything and everything . life is sacred we should protect it , and cherish it at any cost . ty"

"message for gregg abbot , texas governor : you want to punish woman for having an abortion . you want abortion provider to serve long prison sentence and pay enormous fine for merely helping woman . yet you support the former president , who currently is the worst criminal in u history , having botched the covid pandemic and therefore is responsible for hundred of thousand of death . he incited the jan. 6 , 2021 insurrection that killed five people , injured many law officer and did serious damage to our capitol . now he is under investigation by the doj for stealing classified document from the white house that very likely ha endangered life around the world and caused great fear for million . how you can hold any political office is a mystery to me , after your numerous failure , especially the uvalde tragedy . i hope voter in texas do the only thing that will make sense to most if those who live there : elect beta o'rourke on nov. 8 and send you packing , along with your corrupt enablers and sycophant ."

"these people have no regard for life , they love mutilation of the unborn"
woman brought this bann on themselves with the 1 million abortion for 19 year straight .. abusing the system .. over 19 million abortion from 1993 to 2012 ... most unwanted pregnancy came from promiscuity not from rape .. there need to be access .. but it need to be regulated & tracked .. noone should be forced to have a child but those that abuse the system should face consequence .. it not the doctor .. it the loose woman making it bad for everyone .. like the criminal in society make it bad for the rest of u .. there always those that abuse the system .. even with abortion & that should be addressed nationally ...
it 's crazy to me how mad people get about not being able to murder there offspring ....
"anti choicers are `` pro life '' only until birth and then it 's fend for yourself . republican are hypocrite . unless each and every anti choice hypocrite ha a house full of adopted , unwanted child , they need to stfu . they have no right to tell woman what to do with their own body . i think the scotus should pas a law that all men get vasectomy so woman stop getting pregnant . men getting woman pregnant ha created this problem . if men did n't impregnate a woman , she would n't need an abortion . vasectomy for all men ."
abortion right are very important to me .

the majority of the state that banned abortion supported slavery during the civil war . just saying .
we must absolutely gain an overwhelming majority in both the house and senate that make it possible to codify the right to choice and right to abortion permanently into federal law in a way that doe not allow individual state any leeway to override it or the supreme court to nullify it . it should have been down a long time ago .

"i think you forget the fact that the only thing rowe v wade did wa move the decision back to state where there is more ability to hear and put into law the will of the people . it requires an answer from medical doctor , ethical contemplation , and social consideration . the killing of the most innocent amongst u is a community decision regardless of what any one person feel about it . if there is a point where the mother is at risk due to her pregnancy then intervention of a medical doctor is of course available so let 's not misrepresent or lie about that fact ! when you lie on your news in attempt to trick your listener into your narrative you lose all credibility and it expose your insincerity in the matter you are discussing . it prof how little you care because you are lying about it and are not operating in the reality of fact because your real aim is to control your listener for a political narrative . that is just a display of how little you care about anyone ."

"the silver lining could be that some of the woman who are going to experience these emergency are going to be the one who supported making abortion illegal . that will be a major eye-opener ( or an eye closer , if they end up losing their life because of it ) . but stubbornness can be a strong force and martyrdom is applauded by some . time to vote !"

"even the so call god , believed in abortion . number 5:11-31"
they wrote these law against abortion to be a cruel a possible because that wa the point and this wa never about a life this wa about control and these people want to control their property quote unquote back and what is their property you ask everything woman and anyone who doe n't share their skin tone included

"religious people need to keep their belief to themselves , and keep thier noise out of others life . until the clump of cell can live on it own and not leaching off of the woman body , it 's not a person , it 's a clump of cell , just like cancer is . and if the person doe n't want a clump of cell growing in them and leaching off of them and possibly costing them thier life , they have that right to have it removed . any person who belief that they have a right to control what someone doe with thier own body deserves a trip through maximum security prison for a few month , they can experience what not controlling what is happening to your body feel like ."
you say people are finally seeing what happens when you outlaw row versus wade but people already know what would happen if you 're outlawed road versus wade because it 's happened before anyone old enough to tell you the horror story of relative who had to get back out abortion but of course these men who lived through that time said we should do that again

1:33 youre wrong they dont even want to do it when the woman is on death door these people think that a dead baby is more valuable than sentient human woman life who ha been using resource for decade . they want a bunch of baby they can mold into being illiterate race baiting taxpayer .

"doe anyone out there remember being a fetus or being born ? abortion is necessary . need to be reformed not just have the baby and see what happens . too many circumstance involved . poor quality of living if complication , mother could die , or zero nurturing ."
just tell republican that you feel that your baby is a democrat . theyll let you in ...
"abortion is not a right , and 'just staying out of people ' private life ' is an inane argument that ignores the moral recognition of human life within the womb . pregnancy should end with birth and life respected always ."
"here 's something republican jesus freak may not have thought about , which is people can , and often do , say they believe in something when they know there wo n't be any consequence ( it 's a big reason why so many claim to be religious ) . but with abortion now there will be consequence , and they will effect conservative woman just a much , if not more so , than any other group . and we 're already seeing sign some of them are now thinking , `` you know , maybe i do n't really think abortion is murder after all . ''"
"there are 18 state that allow abortion . oh and washington d.c. too , i almost forgot . it may be a further drive but saying it banned is kind of poor reporting , especially since it obvious that there are state where you can have this procedure accomplished ."

"these radical nutcase need mental health evaluation before they are installed in governmental position ! if they were later deemed to be lying , they need to be terminated !"
this is what happens when you mix religious belief with biology/science/reality !
"roe v wade wa n't decided because people loved abortion ; it wa because woman kept dying , so the system changed . it 'll go back . just have to see a lot of woman die first ."
put it on the ballot in every state . let the people decide whether or not they want abortion in their state . get the government out of the abortion issue !
and texas will reelect abbott and those pushing this because they put party over what is best for themselves . voting against their own best intreast .

old men have no right telling woman what they can or cant do with their own body .
the republican party ha spent the last 50 year working up to the point where they could gain control of scotus ....... and overturn roe .......... and during all that time they never realized they were on the wrong side of 80 % of the voting public ? ? ? ? ? that 's kinda like trump surrounding himself with a circle of would -be felon ..... and surprised that someone dimed him out on the stolen doc ..... ! ! ! ! ! ! color me shocked ! ! ! ! !

agree 100 % woman should have right to do what they want not to be tell by the gop who what all male white nation .
"we see more medium propaganda . abortion is not banned . the supreme court examined the constitution and found that nowhere within the framework of this document is there any mention of abortion . they came to the realization that roe wa an improper decision and they corrected it . now the subject of abortion or abortive procedure go back to the state legislature where it shouldve been in the beginning . it is now the duty of activist on both side of the issue , both side of the issue pro-choice and pro life , to convince their elected state representative to do the job that they were elected to do . some state will allow abortion and aborted procedure and others wont . what we are seeing is democracy in action . we need to support democracy ."

u.s is super and civilized country for this brutality on woman
keep ur sin from our law .. abortion is not constitutional .. god overturn abortion .. teach god 's law n they wo n't need abortion
oh the bot are out in the comment section
"aww look at the desperate troll trying to convince the other 70 % of the population that anti-abortion is more popular . you troll are laughable at best , but pathetic would be the more accurate description . scotus and republican sealed their fate when they went after woman . new voter registration among woman is at an all time high . all poll are shifting , and popularity for those who are in support of a woman 's right to choose is off the chart . magats better get their kleenex ready , because you 're about to see what happens when you motivate the voter . we outnumber you neo-fascists by a lot . by a whole lot ."
people are seeing the result of democrat failing to protect and codify roe for the past 40 year . turn out campaigning on the pledge of protecting right - and the fear of losing right - is preferable to actually doing something that would have prevented this .
red wave coming to congress
republican candidate will `` pay the piper '' come roe-vember
fun fact : nobody anywhere opposed abortion until segregationist realized they could n't win running on segregation . racist invented abortion panic .

this is to distract you from the fact that hunter 's laptop and ashley 's diary are not `` russian disinformation '' like they told you which mean joe is a pedo . democrat constantly lie and report it a truth .
i guess they never need kid just unborn baby they do n't want .
imagine trying to convince the voter the main issue to vote on is abortion right and not the rising cost of food
you dont have the right to an abortion paid for by someone else .
and here come all the maggat troll and bot to wah wah their little maga tear lmfao
it mean reproductive right are in tact and life is valued ....
