lol i just saw a different lady do the same thing xd i alwaysed said banning abortion are pointless i am glad these pro sadist that call themselves pro life are failing and woman are still finding a way to have their abortion thank you to all the woman who aborted and saved a child from this trash world
pregnancy is dangerous even fertility clinic have to go through multiple embryo before success i have friend in texas who wanted to start family but are now too scared to try this punishes everyone across the board if you dont understand that just wait til it your turn to deal with a pregnancy expected or not
lol imagine being one of those absolute tool who got tricked by the government and big pharma that a child is nothing but a clump of cell and is not valuable a a human life so it can be exterminated you realize these same people who taught you to be so stupid are the one who profit off of abortion stem cell among all kind of other thing are harvested from baby who are aborted by stupid as teen who just want to have fun without any repercussion imagine that idiot dont understand the monetary value in thing like stem cell and how much of a market there is for it among the super wealthy and elite but keep offering up your child a sacrifice to them and one day youll meet the creator you think is just a sky wizard and youll get to see first hand what hell actually look and feel like enjoy

republican uterine obsession song by hand off my tush
all these ppl having sex but not using no protection it too many device and method put here the pill the patch the insert under the skin condom vaginal ring sponge film gel like if u are getting pregnant in 2021 it because u either want to or you are being reckless 98 of the time it very rare to get pregnant while on birth control do what u got ta do but most of the time abortion is preventable if u use the proper contraceptive messures
i am against abortion because today more than any other time in history we have way to prevent pregnancy why doesnt the government pay 100 for pregnancy prevention from the pill to sterilization if a man never want to father child or a woman never see herself a being a mom instead of creating law that only worsen the situation and the mantra my body my choice is not valid it is something you tell yourself when you want to get past something that ha put a wrench in your life once you get pregnant there is another body that doe not have a say in what you are about to do
this kind of thinking is sick and twisted how can we a a society sit here and allow this
at least she wa able to get the abortion she needed it suck that many woman in texas dont have the luxury to travel for abortion though woman are truly living in the dark age where we have to jump through loop to have autonomy of our own body everyone want to put their rosary bead and bible in our uterus

private adoption is not good it is legal human trafficking you exchange a large sum of money for a child in return that is human trafficking with a new name the private adoption industry will make about 191 billion dollar this year in foster care parent should always go in with intention to reunite the child with the bio parent unless it is absolutely not possible
some of these comment are vile until you all are prowelfare expansion low to no cost healthcare pro mask and vaccine pro foster care reform pro comprehensive sex education and free birth control wo parental consent and anti death penalty you all are not prolife you are pro forced birth because you all have made it clear you dont care about that being once it is on earth just be fucking honest with yourself also if an embryo at 6 with cardiac electric activity it is not a fully formed heart or true heart beat it is also not considered a fetus even at 6 week is considered a child woman should start receiving child support at 6 week of pregnancy right and be able to take out a life insurance policy right too the vast majority of pro life argument are based off the bible guess what we dont live in a theocracy we live in the u where per our first amendment right in the constitution which for a much a you all claim to love and love your freedom you sure do pick and choose we have religious freedom and separation of church and state law shouldnt be based on religion ever even a little bit because by doing so you violate my first amendment right to religious freedom

prolifers have never been against abortion because they care about saving the life of unborn baby it ha always been about wanting to take away the right of woman plus the bible is proabortion see number 52022
adoption their is always a family that cant have a child that will give so much love to those baby
god can and doe bring good out of evil of all kind murdering the baby shortcircuits this good process and deprives many people of blessing

thats right i agree with this abortion need to legal everywhere especially in the midwest where there is large population of european
your parent should be ashamed that you murdered their grandchild
everyone just remember if you dont want to have a kid dont have sex the solution isnt that complicated
you said you take contraceptive then your partner didnt wear a condomvery irresponsible excuse and health care insurance should not cover for your irresponsible behavior grow up
thats their right abortion is a state right issue not federal
pro life pro woman pro child
wow we just watch a child get murdered on camera classy
i once aborted and i have regretted my decision it something so painful you will fill guilt every time you here the word abortion and these child deserve a chance to live cause they are blessing from god if one is not ready for child the first thing would be abstainanceif not family planning method to prevent the unwanted baby
because of the economic crisis and the rate of unemployment now is the best time to invest and make money
hmm if bcp is not 100 why not use 2nd protection to prevent an unwanted pregnancy hard to watch no one win here
should have practiced safe sex
then when woman make choice about what to do with men body
13weeks is not ideal poor thing should have been able to get it when she found out the law is absolutely bullshit it like texas went back in time
american woman are guaranteed to equal protection under the law by the 14th amendment a rogue government in texas doe not have the right to take away american woman right and protection that are guaranteed by the u constitution this law in texas is unlawful unjust and discriminatory against american woman
my body my choice oh wait didnt government force a vaccine for people not at risk and against their will hmmmmmm
my body my choi oh wait it isnt your body you do you but dont try and justify it living your life and carefree huh you mean being irresponsible and have unprotected sex and yeah let slip in 6 week into the conversation even though they said 10 15 week at the start abc news is trash
dont kill a child they deserve a chance at life too same a all of u
none of my business
i dont here one thing about father right
this is clearly unconstitutional and a direct violation of the 4th amendment which guarantee that everyone be secure in their _persons_ paper house and effect a fetus before 18 week when it is developed enough to feel pain ha no legitimate moral claim to be considered a an entity in it own right worthy of legal protection the right guaranteed to all american of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness simply do not apply to it _at least_ in the first 17 week of gestation the autonomical interest of a fullygrown adult woman who is capable of experiencing pain and suffering and seeing herself a entity existing over time the notion of personhood supersedes the nonexistent desire of a firsttrimester fetus to stay alive or to not suffer it couldnt be more obvious what the correct moral stance is here unless your faculty of judgement are blinded by the shackle of iron age superstition put twoandtwo together folk this law is an indefensible abomination in any modern civilized society
abortion is murder these woman should be shackled and chain and arrested
all human life is sacred this genocide of the innocent will one day be seen a the collapse of our moral on a huge scale so many innocent child have been killed that future nobel peace prize winner pultzer politician people that would one day make life better for all who inhabit earth for what because you decided that a child life wa worth sacrificing so you could continue living a irresponsible and unsatisfying life that is all about you human life is the most amazing thing to have ever graced this world and yet we still treat those of u who are the absolute most vulnerable a nothing more than a annoying side effect from a drunken one night stand if you are having consensual unprotected sex then you have no right to take the life of the child that you had so carelessly pushed into this world
kill a life so you can get back to your life what a self centered po abortion are not healthcare in fact theyre the opposite of healthcare
shes selfish
if you are pro abortion you should be well aware of how it actually work they rip the child apart by each arm and leg and then they literally scramble the poor child brain and head before removing the child all life is scared either be responsible when having sex or be responsible and at the minimum allow the child to be born and have a fighting chance at life who are we to snuff a child life out before it get a chance to see the world that ha so cruelly destroyed it
it may be her body but it the baby life adoption is her only choice to not be a disappointment to god only he can take a life
god bless governor of texas
if you have unprotected sex you had better be a responsible a you say you are and find out if you are or arent pregnant before 6 week and dont say oh i didnt know i wa pregnant until i wa half way through my pregnancy no if you have had sex unprotected then you are well aware you may be pregnant and to deal with it accordingly personally i think all abortion should be illegal except for medical and special occasion
why do republican state keep passing these law because white people keep electing them dont like it leave texas because these racist draconian law are being rubber stamped by six republican on the u supreme court
just wait till the kid are 18 then use a gun like everyone else and take responsibility like everyone else that doe it just because the government can kill anyone they want with impunity doesnt mean they can give you the same right it wrong for them and it wrong for youto you have the right to an attorney jesus is mine he already paid my price for sin so i dont have to on judgment day but for some reason this evil generation want to kill their child by the million it used to be illegal when the world wasnt a evil
u miss one day that baby never see the light of day
your literally ripping the baby out of u limb by limb thats so messed up they literally slice the baby up a it alive and ha a heart beat dang it take a man to have the kid too
despite the economic crisis this is still a good time to invest in crypto

who care
u cant set it up for adoption if u dont want kid dont start screwing then it not 100 percent protection
why are these woman having sex during a pandemic in the first place
it is not your body it is the baby body
dont open your leg to anyone and pls use protection
stop killing baby dont have unprotected sex give it up for adoption selfish brat
140 that care free is what got you pregnant condom is the best easy after abstinence she will probably will regret it down the line why not simply give the baby up for adoption
if you said it wasnt meant to plan so it mean it happen for a reason
watching the msm whine when they dont get their way is hilarious
good if they dont like the law in texas theyre free to leave
use the safe haven law and drop unwanted baby in firefighter station since the government is denying you the choice to abort make it the government problem to deal with those unwanted kid
your body end where the baby body begin
selfish
if billion of dollar are being made off of the genetic material that the woman are giving up why arnt woman mad they dont see that money

b all for narrative clear actor
i know it ur body your choice use 2nd protection or calm ur hormone down seg not necessary to live so yea
i dont get it why not have the baby because you dont know if your going to live to see tomorrow to decide to even want a baby
should have kept your leg closed
abortion is not health care neither is contraception however youre there because you had sex knowing the risk grow the hell up stoping a heart beat is murder
