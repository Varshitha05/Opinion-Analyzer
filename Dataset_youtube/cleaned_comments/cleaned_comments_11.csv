what america should do is have a referendum vote to establish pro abortion and anti abortion the people vote for what they think is right let the people of the united state of america decide if they want abortion legalised or not legalised
they will eventually regret it now democrat have permission to overturn year and year of settled law and for sure they will eventually take the court back
it wa only suppose to be a marriage decision to protect the wife health however she planted in his mind it wa to protect their husband union or image that he wa faithful it been a matter of mankind controlling their impulse desire and organ ill agree the south example in the case of protection of the wife temple not the husband reputation their been killing the dark man seed with womankind
it should be ban or 6 week and that for rape and incest mother life matter
the principal is stand on your perception of life and what you belief in and it will turn out for the good or bad but it saying freedom is always controversial but her right to war exist cause table can turn by truth at any moment in life a we birth and die and involved in our practice of medical and health like weed wa illegal and had penalty now it doesnt and their not being incarcerated for it it either this or the world is a hypothetical or hypocrisy bowl of chaos
it is incredible how the devil twistes the big mind of human a right to privacy when it come to decisioning on the other human right to live of course the woman ha conceived another human being another personevery medical science will back up thisthat is how the human rase reproductsintrauterino we are a really corrupted specie to still be debating in the 21st century despite the pure common sense truth about the human life beginning whether abortion should be or should not be illegal illegal abortion is unsafe well dont do it
excellent video very informative with the varying viewpoint
even rbg said roe wa terrible case law it created what wa never there
drumpf drove the u off the rail when he packed the supreme court with evangelical wackjobs if any republican candidate get elected expect a national abortion ban abortion will go black market back alley again
it so gratifying to watch the pro choice movement have win after win on this issue i guess pro lifer didnt have a plan apart from overturning roe thats pretty clear
should have been decided under equal protection
the supreme court need to go back and listen and review roe v wade they were using coat hanger back in the day before roe v wade this could happen again
we are human being being human i should say we are not human being we are animal just like our pet in the food we eat we are not supposed to kill and eat our child a we are doing today this is blue planet animal planet where law order rule of engagement predator versus prey continuously in play legalized abortion is also legalized baby killing murder and what we kill we must eat so readily available abortion is also legalized cannibalism
government that allows their citizen to kill their own child is a slaughter house this type of citizen dont treat any one else any different thank god roe v wade ha been overturned in the united state of america
killing of human including the unborn need to be banned not just called by another name which make it sound more harmless
if only the federalist society could read the 9th amendment and the argument behind it it nullifies all argument from the federalist society
abortion ha been going on since literally dirt egyptian greek and roman were not opposed to it since too many child meant not enough food for everyone such is the case on our planet now increasing population is never discussed when talking about abortion but we have a fresh water problem a food affordability problem a housing problem and most southern state dont like social program after child are born so there little in the way of affordable childcare and medical care dont you think that better law and resource for fixing the issue would have already been established by now it not about abortion it about control additionally there are no regulation placed upon men in pregnancy if they conservative were serious about the right to life there would be child support at conception support for the pregnant woman and support for both her and the child after the child is born yet that is not the case and it 2023 we dont need more people in the world we need to move people around because were running out of resource fresh water is finite the world is heating up and we cant take care of the kid we have it not rocket science aside from fact the decision to abort a child should be between the woman and her doctor we have entirely too many people on the planet people in the south are going to migrate north it already happening farmer are moving crop to cooler state insurance company are pulling out of florida due to climate change conservative want to pretend it a moral issue when it really a control issue they want to force their morality upon everyone else but the reality is that it a sustainability issue we simply can not afford to produce more people on this planet until a whole lot of people die off human have wreaked havoc upon the earth period
great information and fact
abortion is murder the bible is clear today we have ceased to believe the bible the bible is god word and he never change we will stand before him and give an account
it just amazing how they gloss over the fact that she lied about wanting an abortion because she wa raped
im pro choice too shame on the evil anti abortion movement shame on the rotten anti abortion pig
restore roe vote blue until they do
people have to remember we did not have the contraceptive technology back then thing have changed time change thing
it is not controversial it is baby killing harvesting shoveling out the womb in other word killing a baby a human being that you dont think is a human being who the hell are you how the hell did you get here hatched now we are wondering why your mother didnt kill you during her pregnancy no because she hoped youd be somebody is she disappointed
the fetus is not a person abortion is a god given right
i never thought that the right to life depends solely under the choice of woman who never wanted responsibility in the land of the free the basic human right which is the human life isnt really free at all there no freedom in such an atrocious choice to not give the unborn human life the choice to live
it murder
624 the right to privacy a invented by the supreme court is the absolute foundation for the modern jurisprudence on abortion
this question is solely based off of knowledge not including life of the mother or rapeincest if a pregnant mother decides to have an abortion it is a clump of cell but if the mother is murdered it is a double homicide is it a clump of cell or a human
1548 the state having interest in potential life wtf someone tell me any precedent or common law where the state ha any legal authority over potential life
this fails to recognize the right to privacy derived from the first amendment freedom of religion i can make private decision based on my religion and you can make private decision about yours if youre a jehovah witness then you have the privacy right necessary to practice your religion and refuse a blood transfusion that mean cps cant investigate you for child neglect judge cant approve court order to compell a transfusion and legislator can not make law intruding on your private belief i realize opting out of a blood transfusion isnt a perfect comparison to opting into an abortion but hopefully my point is still clear
the asshole literally cherry picked the constitution to justify the evil action
christian want the fear of pregnancy to curve teenage sex but the only safe sex will be teen having sex with their same gender they seem to only want new baby from people who make poor choice and havent learn selfcontrol all they accomplished wa government and parent spending more money for out of state abortion for girl who can get help ending an unwanted pregnancy adopting kid is the fastest way to get new member for cult if they step up to help the overburdened system that remove child from mother all i see is more number of human suffering to stop the poor from being baby killer and higher suicide rate the bible is proabortion and give god the glory
you will never stop abortionwomen have been ridding themselves of unwanted pregnancy since time began nature give her this option it a survival instinct and protective of the young already needing her nurture
looking back with hindsight realising that the rightwing christian in the u are even crazier than first thought isnt a excuse but the fact is america is being dismantled law by law right by right the u will take one of the biggest decision in american history during november if it go the way of the republican i see no way back for democracy the republican will make sure trump will be returned a president from then on the people will never see another fairly elected president again
thank you so much for helping me understand the fundamental aspect of rvw really great and informative
question so why is a baby called a baby when you want to keep it but called something else when you dont which one is it are you pregnant with a baby or are you pregnant with a lump of tissue and cell in your womb im thinking that people say this to appease their conscience so not to feel so horribly guilty when it come time to get an abortion i mean seriously people make up your mind all ready
did i miss the part where the constitution say you can have an abortion
the pro life movement is about punishing woman for having sex
the movie 2001 a space odyssey is the antichrist solving abortion a space odyssey is a fetus in the womb the clint eastwood dirty harry movie wa angry calm it seems nasty but it a good police officer angry calm is how a woman chooses abortion everything in motion make one error your supposed to park the error where it doesnt matter or you play wack a mole with error it intelligently designed that if you try killing god you will always make one error a movie is in motion so you have to park the error where it doesnt matter 2001 movie is about abortion but a fetus is blind that why hal computer eye is colored red so it still ha artistic integrity 2001 movie is most perfect movie ever made it only ha one error to park you cant do better than that
now it gone
wellmade and engaging video but holy cow is it biased it would be nice for example if they would discus what blackmun et al said with respect to the textual basis of the alleged right to privacy it seems to this reader that there is lot of textual support for such a right despite the fact that the word privacy doesnt appear in the text since they mention the penumbra and emanation it would also be good if they spent a little time talking about what that mean in the context of the griswold opinion and how it matter for the roe decision at the end of the day federalist are welcome to their view but this presentation pretend that there are no good reason for the opposing view and that just isnt the case
omg we are such an awful country we cant even speak two language without complaining
roe provided woman the choice to have an abortion it did not force it upon anyone woman could still choose to have their baby if they so desired now the choice is gone now certain state are forcing woman to give birth they have removed choice this is not freedom those that call themselves prolife do nothing for child after they are born are not prolife they are probirth they are forcing their belief onto others this is also not freedom only narcissist feel entitled to force their view belief choice onto others
the west is doomed because it men allowed their lady into governance it guarantee demise of any civilization no society could survive emancipation of it woman
everybody act like it a right the government owes you if you want to abort your baby do it but why doe the government have to provide the service do it yourself if ya really want to
holy bible 18 wife submit yourselves unto your own husband a it is fit in the lord 19 husband love your wife and be not bitter against them 20 child obey your parent in all thing for this is well pleasing unto the lord 21 father provoke not your child to anger lest they be discouraged
holy bible 5 mortify therefore your member which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry 6 for which thing sake the wrath of god cometh on the child of disobedience 7 in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them 8 but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth
this federalist society is evil truly evil
extremist conservative religious belief gave u the 2022 decision
wikipedia for context what a joke youtube
abortion will never be truly abolished a long a society continues to tolerate any form of artificial contraception and the contraceptive mentality in general after all abortion is the inevitable backup when those fail down with incrementalism screw 14a jurisprudence
america is dead keep fighting guysthe sane one left who can actually think for themselves without putting god in every fucking sentence before these lunatic turn it into a war zone filled with bible and gun also change your country name while youre at it it about time we call u the divided state of america
i want to understand something covid is a health and safety issue and psa by the thousand to get a vaccine how come with all the contraceptive decices we dont get any psa on sexual responsibility i guess it because it is not a communicable disease
now get that 2 amendment
so the federal government kick the decision back to each individual state can the people in each one of these individual state inform their congregational leader of how they feel about it at a state level if the people are not happy about their leadership can they just vote them out make sense
im struggling with this video first of course the federalist society isnt unbiased and never ha been on this topic it still a fairly informative video but far from unbiased the video is heavily frontloaded with a lot of antichoice language and some lie ie the legality of abortion preroe then i get to 6 minute in on the screen is a timeline it say a had been spoken earlier by someone else that black and harlan retired but the voice over it say two justice had died shortly before which is just not true how did such an uninformed person come to merit a voice on such a complicated issue when they dont know a simple basic historical fact were people who are actually informed not available i dont hate the video just find it misleading in several place it still a good guide for prochoice and prohumanrights activist to hear what the other side is saying true or not and who theyre listening to cant defeat this stuff without knowing what theyre spouting
abortion wa with the state and unconstitutionally the justice of scotus wa manipulated and made a wrong decision that wa extremely popular at the time bill clinton claimed far and few abortion to save a mother life and incest that didnt take long to grow into abortion on demand and used a birth control and today politician must decide by state a it should be we should take our personal life seriously and protect ourselves when we can
and now roe v wade ha been overturned it hard to believe that it took nearly 50 year to overturn this law that had no constitutional basis at all
what do six lawyer know about woman reality is this anger about woman
about time the supreme court did something right they sure a hell screwed up marriage
rod wave make bortion legal
goodbye roe i wont miss you
why the background music very annoying
the true federalist wouldnt spit in the face of this society this is nothing more than a grift organization infiltrating our judiciary to put religious lunatic in place to steal the freedom of woman this ban on abortion is not a victory for anybody except those who want to cause chaos in america those who want to see woman and young girl suffer and die those who want to see our city flooded with unwanted child those who want to see are state divided between ideology this is the worst thing thats ever happened and the federal of society made it so
it so stupid how a woman can get an abortion and it not being called murder but when a person stab and kill a pregnant woman and her unborn child that person is charged with double homicide
how on earth could a human being ever justify this law or mindset is absolutely crazy the church wa obviously fast asleep during that watch this wa blood sacrifice of the innocent to empower demon just like in the old testament
disgusting theocratic fascist like the federalist society are destroying this country these scumbags want people desperate in poverty and under their control they are a cancer for all of society to be wary of
holy bible 18 wife submit yourselves unto your own husband a it is fit in the lord 19 husband love your wife and be not bitter against them 20 child obey your parent in all thing for this is well pleasing unto the lord 21 father provoke not your child to anger lest they be discouraged
26 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affection for even their woman did change the natural use into that which is against nature 27 and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which wa meet 28 and even a they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those thing which are not convenient holy bible
a always the federalist society take no position on particular legal or public policy issue fucking liar
remember it wa based on 100 lie
i havent seen demokkkrats this mad since the republican freed their slave let the liberal tear flood the ocean beware of rising sea level today is a good day thank god
you forgot about jerry falwell deciding that wa a great way to make money off of the nonreader pop right in the 1970s like trump the insurrection the election liesin a bigly way
is it just me or that woman sound a lot like ruth paine 1717 mark
it sad the way woman are fighting for something like this
it really not about the right of woman it about the right of doctor no it about the right of a little baby girl that get her arm and leg ripped off with forceps
the scotus ha decided what religion the u will follow
the federalist society belief in originalism they literally believe no one ha a right to privacy or any other right that arent explicitly mentioned in the constitution bunch of religious quack
at least you got the word history right
protester should educate themselves on how to prevent a pregnancy instead of killing defenseless unborn human being life begin in the womb and those life matter and must be protected
woman have been using abortion care since the mist of prehistory when woman were the plant gatherer and observed what plant had what effect and invented medicine woman managing their fertility is a natural right that preexists the state criminalizing abortion is the aberration only a century of american history abortion wa legal in early america and ben franklin wrote a book on what every american should know and it included instruction for athome abortion legal abortion is deeply rooted in our history and tradition the founder had legal abortion all around them and they did not seek fit to involve the government in people private business get a pdf of the document and search on keywords woman girl pregnant pregnancy gestation procreation reproduction uterus vagina baby fetus zygote embryoany word you pleaseits not in there because it not the government business our privacy right around reproduction are also rooted in skinner and griswold yall are just wrong
now theyre going after griswold goodbye birth control
1973 roe v wade u kicked out of vietnam glam rock doobie brother and deep purple smoke on the water 2022 roe v wade end american woman become second class citizen and america the butt of the world joke we live in the generation that tease and laugh at american
abortion is a woman choice across the majority of the world abortion is not mentioned in the bible so why do american christian lie and say it is the u constitution amendment have already been amended 27 time the u constitution can be easily amended again at anytime
the right to make reproductive decision privately wa judged to be a constitutional right before roe but also in roe by overturning roe the present supreme court ha jeopardized this right in many other case a well i find this an appalling misreading of the constitution
woman should send their aborted foetus to these people and they can do what they like with them then
answer me this federalist society why did your supreme court backed pick end roe v wade
wowwhat a onesided video but what did i expect from the federalist society
protester should educate themselves on how to prevent a pregnancy instead of killing defenseless unborn human being life begin in the womb and those life matter and must be protected
if you voted for trump or didnt vote at all you voted to overturn roeits that simpleelections have consequence
we heard then and are still hearing it now from woman my body my choice wonder how wed all feel if the unborn child declared the same statement but it seems that their cry might be my bodyno choice
the devil deception is that dividing thing will ever help u to find a solution to any problem it wont division on the contrary just creates more confusion and the more confused we become the le likely we are to resolve problem that bring u torment
in spite of everything that wa done and that is being done to me by evil soul i still enjoy life because i am an independent thinker and now i love who i am i have never agreed with destroying anything that can potentially turn into a human being because i do love nice people and i am opposed to the curse
i think there are repercussion for choosing the fate of someone existence if i got a woman pregnant and she were to ask for my opinion then id want her to have the baby because i am against death i once got married to prevent a girl from getting an abortion i think in time everything come back to u and if someone chooses to destroy andor alter a human functional existence then it will come back in a bad way the future will bring them a dark curse that they will never escape id never agree with anyone who asks me if she should get an abortion andor if that child physical attribute should be altered the dark curse be on anyone who doe it not to say that thing cant be made right in the future they can but the one who dont make them right will inherit the bite of hate and the bitterness of knowing that theyll be randomly attacked and tormented later in the future

do we need a new constitutional amendment that address personal privacy directly a it relates to social issue like these but also growing concern with infringement against freedom prevalent here is this internet and postinternet age

rvw is legally history
very good documentary thank you for posting the video
if a raped woman is punished by law how is it different from the taliban maybe there are terrorist in the federal government now lol politically it is also bad news for you guy american freedom is no more exist now i think abortion law they overturned is definitely crazy woman body is woman body it funny like the law make men need to be circumcised who could say like this from now on i really disagree with america constitution it is human right you guy are not a god and now america need this law men who dont use condom go to jail no sex with no condom no sex before you marry if you dont want more baby men or woman should get surgery you justice are wanting this people have their own right i want to pledge but i dont know how to do please let me know
i agree with you 100
if you look at the value of an unborn child in regard to legal judiciary decision you will find the hypocrisy that is gravely needed to be argued example if you were a pregnant woman who wa murdered and a a result the unborn wa also deceased the charge would include a seperate fount for the murder of the unborn why is an unborn baby only valued when it is convenient and devalued when it is inconvenient abortion should be reserved for extreme case where a womanchild conceives via rape incest and when the fetus will be born without a brain or similar severe abnormality not autism etc when birthing the baby can cause the death of the mother or when the mother is unable to safely carry the pregnancy due to addiction or severe mental illness people should be responsible with sex we have so many option
those are a joke of law professor coming from very and very much conservative law school in the u just saying
im on the left and i dont like the idea of baby being aborted i dont see it a a black and white issue i still think it should be legal because of the black market involvement in unlicensed doctor doing them under ban
how wa it a private matter if the government funded it wouldnt that be a public matter thats why they had to over turn it because the shit wa straight unconstitution
repent and trust in jesus christ

i believe every new law and loophole and blind eye turned towards oppression and every joke thrown at an uncomfortable topic just take u farther away from a desperately needed change in our education system fuck yeah were uncomfortable we were never taught sexual education kinetic education sociological education psychological education financial education you know who the state leave that up to unprepared and terrified parent who are still learning the world a their child are learning theirs
do fetus have the right to life the argument of this essay will prove that abortion is wrong for the same reason that killing a reader of this essay is wrong i will simply assume instead of proving that your murder is seriously wrong i will make no attempt to offer a full ethic of murder finally i will make no attempt to resolve some very basic and difficult general philosophical issue to which this analysis of abortion ethic may lead the symmetry arising from the analysis of the main argument on both side of the abortion debate may explain why the abortion debate seems difficult consider the following standard argument against abortion fetus are both human and alive people have the right to life therefore fetus have the right to life of course woman have the right to control their own body but the right to life go beyond a woman right to control her own body therefore abortion is wrong the fetus right to life doe not include his right to use someone el body to preserve his life however an opponent of abortion may point out that a woman right to use her body doe not include her right to end someone el life in order to do what she want with her body in response one might argue that a pregnant woman right to control her body is not much if it is wrong to take any action that end the life of the fetus within her however an opponent of abortion may argue that the fetus right to life doe not come much if a pregnant woman can end it when she chooses the consequence of all these symmetry seems to be a stalemate but if we have an attitude then one could argue that we are left with a conflict of right a fetal right to life versus a woman right to control her body one could then argue that the right to life seems to be a stronger right than the right to control one own body in the case of abortion because the loss of one life is a greater loss than the loss of the right to control one own body a respect for nine month therefore the right to life prevails over the right to control one own body and abortion is wrong
it funny how woman can change their mind about having a baby with out a problem but a man cant change his mind about paying chidsupport with out problem
so she lied about being raped who did she blame tho black men would like to know
your only choice lie right before the moment that meat stick fill your womb and bust baby gravy deep in your gut anything beyond this point is murder if you dont want to have a baby dont do what it take to make one
the burger scotus wa made up by conservative justice
roe v wade wa wrongly decided from the start while there is a fundamental right to privacy in the 14th amendment it is impossible to frame a workable legal rule in deciding when a government can stop an abortion and of course the government doe have an interest in protecting life the question is how to do you balance the competing interest in this context when scientist dont agree when viability begin the unworkability of roe is underscored by the fact the scotus in casey v planned parenthood threw out the trimester framework in roe why because it doesnt work but here is the irony in dobbs the scotus wa wrong in overruling roe outright the reliance prong of the five part test in deciding to overturn precedent is not met the fact is there is a strong public reliance interest on the case but justice alito skirted around this in dobbs by this noting that there is no traditional reliance interestthat is there is no advance planning of great precision is most obviously a necessity this standard of course is drawn from commercial case which obviously doesnt apply in abortion case hence why the casey court rejected it faced with this dilemma alito did the only thing he could doie he ran roughshod over the intangible reliance standard adopted in casey in casey the court found that there is an intangible reliance interest which precludes overturning roe outright the casey court described it a people had organized intimate relationship and made choice that define their view of themselves and their place in society in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail and that the ability of woman to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation ha been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive life in this sense the casey court is right it echo the reality of everyday life in our society yet alito said the court is illequipped to ass this intangible form of reliance ridiculous it a if alito want u to believe that he life in a bubble in short the conservative block of the court wanted a certain result and bent themselves into a pretzel to get it and in doing so the court destroyed itself the court is a kangaroo court it should be packed immediately with more seat and life time appointment should be abolished enough is enough
people get in contact with your local politician and let them know if they dont support abortion you will not support them in the next election there more people on the side of abortion and there is against it
aka roethe big liargod always win
it roe had the perfect state of fact even though we now know that they were a lie what what _roe_ wa based on a lie
digest that no man ha power only godhe dead and come back to life see who ha powergod above who roll thunder and strike lightingdigest that idiot
dead man roe wade think he ha power then why he can not come back to life god took him back to dirt dust to dust ash to ash only god above live forever
doe the supreme court judge male feel how a baby feel when moving inside the womb hell noso stop makingvroe dead wade abortion stupid law
yeah supreme court judge is like watergate corruption and abortion
why people in usa is still voting and they are disrespected by usa corrupt hypocrite racist supreme court judgesor people voting because they like racism and disrespect from the supreme court judge and politician
roe and casey brought to u by a marxist court and made up out of whole cloth lawless scotus for shame
with roe v wade now being overturned we can all look forward to the right to contraception going next
this sight is bios the federalist society is who paid to install the last 3 judge the ceo of the federalist are the koch brother they are 100 far right wing and everything oil these guy have bought and paid for republican in our government the actual argument wa about personal privacy ruled that it constitutionally right for a woman to have the right to privacy with her doctor this new ruling took personal privacy right away this story is b
sad how i never heard of this case ill definitely be doing some research on this
abortion still exists in the usa the u federal government will return each individual state the right to decide their own abortion law for themselves vote accordingly
why didnt they explore what jane roe said
13509 reported rape in texas last year we know 75 of rape go unreported thats over 50000 total rape in texas in a year now those woman will be forced to carry give birth to their rapist the repulsive feeling i have for the republicanreligious right is quite high
what an astonishing shame that in 1973 none of these lower court case or roe v wade wa dealt with on the basis of the child right to life all this muddied water over privacy while million of defenseless child are slaughtered in silent darkness the same devil who argue in defense of a woman right to choose or constitutional privacy would also argue in defense of infanticide or any other evil act of might make right it come down to the law protecting big strong people brutally torturing and murdering entirely defenseless people god alone know why he waited in patient long suffering all these year but he will not tarry forever the blood of the innocent cry out to him
it once wa a mother responsibility to teach her daughter that it is her responsibility to keep her leg closed why not for any other reason than woman are smarter than men a a man raised in a large family this wa certainly obvious girl are smarter than boy everyone know it she taught her boy too but it never got in our thick head we just pretty much wanted sex but these day it is a crime to burden a woman with something called responsibility these day we celebrate woman making very poor decision like abortion and divorce woman have lost the ability to choose a proper mate in one generation like cat the mother ha to teach her young how to hunt our woman are no longer mouser you have let the government become your parent and they think they need to control you
show you how close we still are to hilter way of thinking our own court thinking the right to abortion is a fundamental right
my legal argument is that a woman ha the right to keep her leg closed in a peaceful society and should be put in prison if she kill her unwanted child
it is like dred scott declaring black american were not and could not ever be considered human enough to be granted right of any kind viability a time passed and advance in science progress will happen earlier and earlier however what i find equally disturbing a the slave owner willingness to go to war over the right to own a person is the modern day glib disregard for the life in the womb i am all for abortion in case of life of the mother and rape but a a method of contraception especially after that heart start beating and the body and limb start to form it is so american we are a culture that pay no mind to the document that list life before liberty we want our abortion and our gun matter how many life are lost we tolerate a classroom filled with 5 year old being murdered in the name of our right and having a fetus sucked out of a womb piece by piece all in thr name of freedom of choice sadly if we made the correct choice in the first place we wouldnt be in this mess if abortion is to be legal my vote is the heartbeat limitation
this isnt a constitutional right it a human right to protect life abortion is murder those who choose to have abortion and those who perform them are murderer there no difference in killing a baby and an adult
no termination of a healthy foetus after the first 8 week of pregnancy hows that sound
by the time the judgement came down jane roe ha already had the baby she wanted to abort thats f up
ok jane roe is the woman who wanted to have an abortion who is wade in all this
perhaps im optimistic but what if the overturning of roe v wade can be used to make abortion from a priclvacy law to a public health law
i think that the solution to unwanted pregnancy is not abortion abortion is killing life or killing viable life woman are free to have sex with any man but they can not or shoukd not cause it to create life that is nature responsibility cast on woman if woman dont want to csuse life they can take so many step and even remove the womb on the other hand men shoukd bear responsibility for parenting child which can be ascertained by dna if a man is proven to father a child he should summarily bear full responsibility for that child if not can serve a 15 year sentense in jail
in a dark world i pray to people being light and a person that fight to kill a baby certainly cant be light in no one way
we have to fight everyday for the life and the good conservative way no matter what they fucking scoundrel say about it
abortion is not healthcare neither can be is a assassination of a human life and a assasssination cant be healthcare bunch of evildoer leftist
i dont give a fuck what the constitution say a life is more import save the baby
the baby is the most beautiful and inocent creature that exists i love baby every good person love baby baby are joy even hers motherfuckings ugly and disgusting woman that defend abortion one day wa a baby too but they dont want to allow other baby come to the world such an absurd
dont matter a dime what they people say abortion is muder simple like that
a a foreigner it so weird to know that abortion wa legalized based on right to privacy instead of public health
i have a good rule think about the consequence and act responsibly
im 60 and i dont believe that ive ever heard how the ruling wa made or how they based the ruling that wa what i wa looking for and i want our girl to hear it because i live i a house with 2 teen and their mother and they are shity and dont even know why
roe v wade january 22 1973 to june 24 2022
thank god this is over
this should be a state law why is the federal government telling u what to do
republican do not want to adequately fund the social program that are going to be necessary for all of the unwanted child that will be born
the federalist society can go to hell hell is exactly where they are going because they are racist bigoted xenophobic corrupt elitist and amoral
thank hillary clinton and rbg for this trump doe what he say he will do
roe being overturned is such a travesty so much of this is going to create a horrible chain reaction
even victim of rape or incest cant have a abortion now in many state how is that ok to any sane person
the taliban took over afghanistan so i guess they can take over the supreme court
putin and trump via the supreme court are destroying america
is it true that the federalist society is a conveyor belt for unqualified judge judge who represent a religious cult and pussyfoot around the constitution with thinlyveiled religious motif like the old intelligent design is legitimate science crap

how strange it is that this particular youtube channel ha no providence what is the name and address of the people that have crafted this want
very interesting how this is the first video to pop up when i searched roe v wade historya very conservative filled rightwing take on the issue despite not having the most view compared to other video be aware of the medium they pay to push first in front of you
the federalist society is a cabal of satanic worshipping men evil in the flesh
uncle sam greasy paw in control of every uterus in america the triumph of small government conservatism
they legalized murder genocidal murder government legalized abortion is a communist policy the former communist ussr wa the first country in the world to legalize abortion under lenin so it is a communist policy like the other method of genocide that are typical of communism and nazi socialism yes it is they had to know about this yet no one talk about this no one connects the dot
in no way shape or form a right to privacy and due process can not override the right to life of innocent human life yet they over rode it anyway like good communist
their are only 3 jurisdiction the law of the land the law of the air and the law of the water
republican are probirth not prolife

democrat have used litigation to evade law for over 100 year dems were proslavery against woman right to vote against desegregation dems have never been on the right side of history abortion is no different using infanticide a birth control is a terrible evil choice murder most foul but what about rape and incest or if the mother life is endangered those are a very small percent of current abortion abortion is about evading self responsibility and allowing a sexually promiscuous life without consequence it a get out of jail free card for woman who want to sleep around end of story
but it not the court job to say if something is a human right that is up to the constitution dems know they can never get abortion in to the constitution in the legislature so they cheated with roe v wade
fascinating
the issue decided in dobbs is that not only abortion but anything not specifically assigned to the federal government in the constitution and all other power not forbidden to the state by the constitution are reserved to each state and to the people in other word if it isnt the federal government responsibility a specifically detailed in the constitution then jurisdiction of that issue is to be left to the sovereign state regardless the job of setting policy is the job of the legislative branch not the judicial branch given these two pillar of our system of government the berger court of 1973 should never have even entertained taking the action they took this court corrected the gross judicial overreach roe v wade is representative of
uncle ruckus clarence thomas think he is white so he took a ancestry test and it came back that he is 102 african with a 2 margin of error
our population need baby china got a billion people india billion people if we get in a war with them it wouldnt matter how many weapon you give our soldier we are losing at close combat not to mention world bank evaluate a country ability to pay them back based on population size and growth lesbian are literally killing america roe wa a bad person she gave away a child someone find her kid that she put up for adoption and see how they feel
and it gone
last week holding up sign to support a wife beater this week holding up sign demanding right of their daughter

life win
i have 5 kid and they are all doing well and ive had to sacrifice and so ha my wife if you are not prepared then simply do not get into a situation that you have to bear kid if you believe in abortion and believe in a loving god then guess what god love all of u including our unborn child
i am pro choice but i cant for the life of me understand why people are okay with justice legislating from the bench this most recent ruling is exactly what happens when the court stretch so far the meaning of federal law democrat should have spent all these decade after roe fighting tooth and nail to codify abortion right into the constitution this is what we get for lazinessa complete lack of understanding of our legal system from the electorate now people think the supreme court is taking away a constitutional right rather than what it is actually doing overturning a ruling that had little constitutional basis and historical precedent to begin with
the power and love of god will always always triumph against evilfor the real innocent
im curious ha anyone found a documentary on whether there are group trying to get fetalembryonic right a in fetalembyonic support wic snap or even legal aid if the potential father raped the mother wouldnt an embryo or a fetus have the right to defend itself against a rapist and even paid fmla while it wa developing into a human baby also i cant imagine state with trigger law would want to be shelling out more government aid to woman having these baby too many people ridicule illegitimate child and the mother popping out baby to stay on a much support a they can get wouldnt such state want to find the father so the mother could stay off of the government dole and would such father also be eligible for wic for their potential baby before they had developed into an embryo and then a fetus this whole thing is pretty messy
roe wa a liar nothing ever happened to her she admitted year later more than once she made the entire thing up nothing should ever be go into a bill based on a lie
people should use protection and they wont need abortion
with abortion now rule out not gon na surprised if their woman would start any pregnancy prevention earlier and perhaps fertility rate going down later
my opinion to everyone who want to overturn roe v wade then take 10 of your pay check or government welfare check and offer these unwanted baby universal healthcare offer universal childcare because that shit is expensive offer family leave so mommy and baby can bond offer a solution to this formula shortage better yet supply the baby with formula pampers and wipe up until 18 month of life
life win
so it okay for america to go to war in vietnam and iraq without any proper reason murdering ten of thousand of innocent people but when one want an abortion it is a criminal offense even if you have been raped having to bare a forced child is wrong morally and religiously so overturning roe v wade is the result of a leap forward to an autocratic society in which you can not decide your own destiny america is not a land of freedom or opportunity it ha become a nation of suppression and cynicism
diy abortion doctor recommend a combination of misoprostol and mifepristone for diy abortion but the world health organization say misoprostol alone can also be used to safely induce abortion provided patient get followup care misoprostol can be purchased online sold to treat ulcer research it
i have a finger for you evil people it in the middle of my hand
ya know it crazy how they create law off hypothetical this government is a what if government and not based on reality no one want to be held accountable for their action and people always want to insert their situation into others that have nothing to do with what the original reason for the situation stop moving the goal post keep the scale balanced get the government out of your home and be adult a far a rape victim and those with medical issue i understand their decision to want an abortion which is justifiable because uhhh it wa beyond their choice bit for the people who lack self control and just want others to save them from their action and irresponsibility are immature and should own up to their action you have xxx you let someone nut in you uhhh wtf you think is going to happen deal with it yo cant control the law of nature you may think there loophole but there isnt just a bunch of dead end path and bottonless pit
rest in hell norma
abortion should be allowed a exception to victim of rape or sexual abuse but in general it should be prohibited
this topic is heavy
and we are back here again on the day abortion is now officially illegal in the u
it take two people to produce a child so why doesnt the man have a say in the choice of abortion
roe lied not fact
do not doubt me planned parenthood is already on the phone to state like texas and load up plane with public school girl to wisk them off to the nearest butchering state during school hour without their parent consent but with the full cooperation of the school λεσβοομοηδονικα
let u not forget on this historic day june 24 2022 the man who got u over the finish line of this 50 year battle to take down roe v wade that man is donald john trump thank you mr president for listening to the people and nominating scotus justice who practice fidelity to the constitution not just talk about it
for 40 year every opportunity i have had i voted for prolife candidate a true singleissue voter every candidate wa chosen to move u closer to reversing roe i wa mocked for voting for donald trump in 2016 and wa told he would not be able to do anything to reverse this travesty of a scotus ruling today my prayer dream vote and pleading have come to fruition roe v wade is now justly history all of the argument of settled law established precedent stare decisis and law of the land have all taken a back seat to actual fidelity to the constitution of the united state of america the fight to protect unborn child will continue on in the state legislature where we will bring an even stronger voice to these voiceless victim we will work to strengthen adoption service support mother with unplanned pregnancy providing hope and support for those who have neither the feeling i am having today is similar to the feeling i had on election night november 8 2016 i had goosebump then at the prospect and potential and now to see that potential realized on june 24 2022 after nearly 50 year of barbaric atrocity is something i will never forget this course correction wa needed and will go down with other famed reversal such a plessy and dred scott solo deo gloria
this wa good insight and why anyone on either side should be very wary about judge creating law from the bench and today it sold a woman right issue when in fact it wa about privacy right and doctor wanting the responsibility removed to curtail law suit
thanks to the supreme court for finally revoking roe v wadepraise god maybe we will end the curse on america for killing all those innocent baby
the federalist society is a menace to democracy in general and the republic in particular using mostly woman and minority in this propaganda piece doesnt help with optic it arrogant and cynical

the democrat are unprincipled and unrelenting at all time they try to change the country by changing the culture acting at the localstate level when they must then at the federalnational level whenever they can when fair election are held and the american people overwhelmingly return republican to office democrat have no qualm about pressuring their state government to ignore and reject any federal legislation that the american people have requested be passed they have no shame in using their state to harm the national economy and disrupt national supply line fragmenting and undermining the longterm survival of our country just to embarrass republican president and congress then when theyre able to steal back the federal government they immediately use it to hammer through their agenda overpowering the will of republican state and infringing on their right to make their own law thats the ruthless enemy were pitted against one that hate u so much theyd rather see the country destroyed than concede one inch of it for the american people to rule themselves one that hypocritically preaches federalism when theyre on the defensive but then act a a unitary state when they sneak back into washington since the gop doesnt believe in undermining the longterm survival of the u in the name of shortterm political win they act at the local level and take back the country one countyone state at a time a the founding father intended but were also left at the enormous disadvantage of playing on a field which is always tilted in favor of the democrat who then use the federal government to hack and slash away at state law however even though our strategy of chipping away at our enemy by working at the localstate level may be very hard work and often agonizingly slow it the side that patiently and consistently chip away little by little that always win in the end each time the democrat use the federal government to sweep through their unpopular agenda they may win today battle but they set themselves up to ultimately lose the war
it interesting i didnt know about this can one be radically pro choice but not agree with roe v wade what happens when if the top down decision disagrees with everything you believe next time who watch the watchman
if your pro abortion are you anti vax my body my choice
thank you for the closed captioning
anyone ever think that the abortion issue and planned parenthood are the working agenda of white supremacy sanger wa certainly an advocate of abortion a a way of controlling the black population in this respect abortion is another form of genocide go ahead and kill your baby your body your choice but the supremacist arent going to kill their baby
great and fair doc on how the decision came about and why it never really settled the issue i honestly think abortion would not be in danger of being outlawed had the prochoice movement from the start admitted most people think it kind of icky the further along a pregnancy is people really dont like abortion it depressing and feel just plain wrong to even people who want it to remain legal but many will tolerate it what ruined the right to choose wa the extremist who relentlessly kept insisting no issue of personhood were at stake at all up until birth this insistence ha repeatedly inspired prolifers to examine personhood using ultrasound and science to strengthen their argument year after year coupled with that is every smarmy antireligious person who ha been a part of the prochoice movement saying stuff like keep your rosary off my ovary and you had a perfect combination of poorly reasoned emotionalism and good ole fashioned bigotry that only made prolifers solidify their conviction the prochoice movement wa nothing more than pure evil the prochoice movement essentially defeated itself with it own excess and rhetoric it is undoubtedly one of the most poorly led political movement in u history given 40 percent of female voter oppose it i have no doubt had saner people led it we wouldnt even be having this discussion right now
majority of american favor roe v wade that matter more than mental gymnastics abortion is legal in mexico armenia legal everywhere unborn child dont exist that is a delusional there is a nonviable pack of cell that ha the potential to be a child down the line to say it an unborn child is simply disingenuous and illogical
bottom line if you feel abortion is wrong then dont have one if you dont want to give birth and see your offspring go through this hatefilled life then end it before it too late if your knowing that someone is ending a pregnancy anger you then mind your own business
the only moral abortion is my abortion by joyce arthur google it
they used the woman and she never even got an abortion
im a man and cant do a bong without breaking federal law in any u state and thrice my privacy did not merit dried dog shit the state came in with a warrant did i mention three time and said flower were a public health hazard schedule one approved privacy my as a fleecing nothing more
unless im misunderstanding something this video seemed very unbiased up until about 1942 when the black lady said she belief the right to terminate a pregnancy should be federally protected epic fail
so someone could argue that murder is a private matter and that the government can not interfere
jane roe wa an evil vile woman and her daughter that she wanted to abort that is still alive today hate her gut with a burning passion
when man elevates his view personal interest and convenience over god law separation and chaos ensue a society that fails to recognize god hand in creating life and presumes that it can decide to act against god hand is doomed to fail we cant ask for his blessing and at the same time refuse that blessing when inconvenient the arrogance of man father heal our land turn our heart renew our vision

roe v wade wa about patient confidentialityread the holding of the case that protects a pregnant woman liberty to choose to have an abortion they want to overturn roe v wade so that your vaccination status can be divulged by your dr
why roe v wade should have failed because there is now significantly more scientific evidence that the sole purpose of a the female organ known a the uterus is to house another human life and human life unequivocally begin at conception and finally since the u constitution ha been repeatedly tested been proven to protect all human life regardless what race it is or whether or not it can sustain itself or regardless how old it is or what sex it is etc then it ha become clear that no woman or doctor ha the right to kill an innocent human regardless how she wa conceived unless that new human is directly threatening the life of the mother everything is covered in that one statement above if you take time to review it it answer all possible counter argument in favor of killing human in the womb illustration just because the captain of a ship discovers several week into the sea that someone ha abandoned a baby onboard without her consent doesnt give her the right to kill the baby regardless how inconvenient or potentially threatening it may be to the life of the crew to get to a port birth until then the captain ha both a legal moral responsibility to care for that tiny human
trudeaus crime are not canada only the canadian justice system can corrupt themselves and deny me my right but human right law are international law i have hitler court to help with that level of hate and corruption

god will judge the matter his sovereign will stand
the court is unquestionably correct in concluding that the doctrine of ha controlling significance in a case of this kind notwithstanding an individual justice concern about the merit the central holding of ha been a part of our law for almost two decade it wa a natural sequel to the protection of individual liberty established in the societal cost of overruling at this late date would be enormous is an integral part of a correct understanding of both the concept of liberty and the basic equality of men and woman justice stevens 1992
this wa a very helpful restating of the event i wa in high school during the time that the decision wa announced i remember the fellow in my gym class telling me about it and saying he can have all of the sexy one and get all the girl pregnant he want because they can just get abortion i didnt think much of it then the pro abortion position is suspicious they always claim the worst case scenario of rape and incest in the like
missouri is setting up pregnancy checkpoint to prevent woman from seeking medical attention out of state and woman who go to a doctor or obgyn for any pregnancy related issue will be put on a list
this is the legacy of donald trump in office installing religious fundamentalist masquerading a impartial judge of the law
we live in the world where it okay for the doctor to change a female to a male or a male to a female but it supposedly not right for doctor to help during abortion america the most free but most dictated nation ever cant even provide food for your table like the constitution list without paying a few hundred to be licensed for the year wait till they try to call off the constitution cause it listed unconstitutional to our new government to controll the mass
yep totally controversial of telling woman they cant do a they please with their body people need to wake up like why is this even brought back up multiple time still

if you dont own your own body you own nothing if abortion restriction came to where i live id sterilise myself immediately i refuse to be controlled especially by backwards sexist wilfully ignorant religious cult member aka radical prolifers people who force woman and girl to stay pregnant and give birth especially after rape are animal barbaric animal
ha anyone actually researched how roe wa interpreted in non abortion case for example forced medication which is foundation to forced vaccination roe wa interpreted to mean in forced medication case that the right to privacy in medical decision where the procedure wa recognized a legitimate in any or some case should rest with the election of the person recieving the treatment absent a compelling government interest in which case substantive due process is required substantive meaning actual evidence must be considered and merely a procedural formality being followed scalia said procedural due process is simply to say procedure twice while the substance of the process is what is actually in question in the example of forced medication for a mental illness did the doctor merely confer among themselves to satisfy a procedure in hearing or wa the patient given the opportunity to present evidence and have an attorney who could argue legal alternative the roe court then asked for a definition of abortion which would exclude a legitimate medical procedure then a definition of a fetus a a legal person with right and duty within the jurisdiction of a court the person issue is what would give substantive due process right by equal protection to the fetus this could have been done under fetal inheritance right a long established law but wasnt why bad lawyer the fetus a a person then place the mother and child in controversy and adversary in jurisdiction and the mother can have a right to abort which is of a lesser weight than the fetus right to lifeliberty and property in inheritance by both consanguinity and legal posterity who inherits the benefit of citizen the case now turn on equity in the application of law in a controversy between competing right oconnor pointed to this when she asked if waiting 9 month infringed any right or duty this whole thing is a sham roe doesnt need to be overturned what is needed is the recognition of the fetal right of inheritance that defined conception a the beginning of a legal person
abortion isnt medicine
do not overturn roe v wade well be going backwards woman will be having abortion in back alley in a nonmedical safe environment it a medical issue
god is an ever receding pocket of scientific ignorance that get smaller and smaller and smaller a time go on ndt
even religion can not agree when life begin the irony is that you have ton of very conservative republican cry endlessly about how govt is too big to get rid of regulating corporation and industry that we need freedum etc etc but suddenly in the case of something that is fundamentally an intimate and private yes private issue suddenly they want to be all up in your business all for the unborn mind you doesnt make a lick of sense especially when they scream and cry that they need to protect life yet they dont want to regulate toxic chemical in your food or the environment where people often get sick and die they say oh no we want le regulation and oversight regarding dumping of toxic waste oil spill gun etc so this is not about protecting any kind of life and just about controlling the act of procreation presumably to continue to create a nice market for adoptable baby so they can have a xtian nationalist army i am sorry but the right ha zero legitimacy in this area oh and this is not merely restricting banning abortion this is also about banninng birth control which would prevent the pregnancy in the first place and many woman take birth control merely to help regulate menstruation and menstruation complication like heavy bleeding etc quit trying to take some legal high ground the fact is the right is not consistant the abortion right advocate have endlessly been portrayed a murderer and godless and all sort of extreme distorted view woman do not merely become incubator and dont say well then woman shouldnt have sex seriously what about the guy in all of this where is their role their responsibility no it is always on the woman it is never the guy that is the slut it is always just the woman the state ha no business regulating sex period or a woman body period
why is it so difficult to find an unbiased explanation that just look at this from a standpoint of case law
woman need to stand the f up and fight back we will not go back to being treated like property we can not let woman die because of this b and even more unwanted child suffer through life a a ward of the state
completely disgusted that the federalist society and it propaganda showed up in my feed may the leader of this antidemocracy racist misogynistic hateful organization die penniless and alone
i am an advocate for anything that reduces the awareness of being in this form life in this world is not and can not nor ha it ever been perfect and if it were we would be a close to unaware a there could be so why continue on the misery of existence if we are truly meant to continue i believe we shall regardless of these simple practice of science and well when you break it down it all science thats the best we got and the best well have if we choose to live

thank you federalist society i am so inspired and i loved seeing mitch mcconnell and susan collins during visit to ukraine introduced to 15 year old girl raped and impregnated by russian soldier and congratulate her on her joyous experience and give her a hershey kiss to give to little ivan when she is forced to birth him finally the world is being set right satire
abortion on demand need to be blasted from the page of this illegal decision the scotus legislated a constitutional issue from the bench it wa unconstitutional from the getgo
jargon that doesnt tap the issue of what constitutes a person worthy of protection
dearest law and order justice why is it ok for a woman to abort murder a new unborn person because she doesnt want it then why is it wrong for a man to murder a woman he doesnt want and find her unworthy of living after all trash is trash betrayal parallel rape adultry parallel murder murder is murder equal right are equal just because you are woman doe not give you the right to murder unborn child keep your dress on and your pant on leg closed murder is murder child are not to be murdered by their mother you can understand that if you can say what a woman is in the real world wake up no matter how dark and twisted your moral are

can you force a person to do something with their body against their will
abort the gop from elected position
the federalist society made sure woman will lose their right to medical privacy this wont stop here state are ready to destroy every right the 14th amendment affords u you all disgust me

clutch the pearl if you must but more and more individual human life will enjoy personhood a long a this nation endures the unborn are receiving the right individual human lifeforms have been gaining since the founding first it wa black people then woman now the unborn the people that lost power because those folk got the right they deserved a human human right are all from the same party coincidentally and it is that same party wailing and gnashing their teeth today
ai wait aint this channel managed by group of judge and lawers with the agenda to fuck over the country the one aligned with the gop
why abortion is an issue in america is it because america is overpopulated the answer is no if roe v wade wa wrongly decided and it led to thousand of newborn being put to death doesnt it need to be rectified what message are american mother teaching their child that it is ok to have unsafe sex and then to report to abortion if it lead to a woman being pregnant who are we to decide how the supreme court judge should decide the fact that they have lifetime tenure mean that they will decide impartially without any fear or threat of being replaced let them do their job which is to allow the individual state to make their own law on abortion for or against it what is the problem is this asking too much
it is not about woman right it about the doctor once again big pharma showing it as
but it ended up creating a right to an abortion to a t and the rest is history a lie ha stood for the longest time and it need to be corrected
you cant run around screaming land of the free with your american flag on your shoulder and then vote to take away the freedom of other people simply because you dont agree with them
one important piece of information that this documentary left out is that _roe v wade_ didnt just make elective abortion legal through the first trimester a many western european nation have done it made elective abortion legal through 28weeks of pregnancy after the _casey_ decision in 1992 elective abortion is now a guaranteed national right until legal viability generally around 24weeks this decision ha made the u one of only a handful of nation around the world to currently allow abortionondemand at or past 20weeks scientifically and morally there is littletono difference between such lateterm abortion and infanticide while i still would have disagreed with the democrat effort this week to codify elective abortion nationally i would have at least respected them a little if they had limited their proposed law to _12weeks_ rather than 24weeks
looking back my mother had two miscarriage before i wa born she wa given a medicine by her doctor that allowed her to have child what they did not know back in the 1950s wa that drug made some child sterile mom had four kid my sister never had child neither did i am i thankful for the life my mother gave to me yes life for me is good
this is terribly edited and produced it a soup of 2 secound soudbites with cheesy music im not 6 get to the meat of the issue
the unborn are a convenient group of people to advocate for they never make demand of you they are morally uncomplicated unlike the incarcerated addicted or the chronically poor they dont resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct unlike widow they dont ask you to question patriarchy unlike orphan they dont need money education or childcare unlike alien they dont bring all that racial cultural and religious baggage that you dislike they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationship and when they are born you can forget about them because they cease to be unborn it almost a if by being born they have died to you you can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth power or privilege without reimagining social structure apologizing or making reparation to anyone they are in short the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love jesus but actually dislike people who breathe prisoner immigrant the sick the poor widow orphan all the group that are specifically mentioned in the bible they all get thrown under the bus for the unborn dave barnhart traditional christian pastor
it going down
i demand the right to privacy so i can murder people
the right to kill
decision that are between a husband and wife are one thing decision that then affect the life or death of a child are a bit different
are woman worried about getting this firmly protected in the constitution because we have a 2nd amendment protection to gun ownership without infringement clearly documented in the bill of right and look at how often those right get infringed upon
roe v wade created a right that doe not exist in the constitution we are now correcting that ruling and putting the decision back to where thing that arent in the constitution where they belong back to the state
yeah bring back slavery state right
this leak leak which supreme court justice will retire after this leak something stink about this whole situation

the case against prolife the trumprepublicanjesus cult will never allow a life that is good you are literally fighting to bring child into an existence of abuse poverty suffering disease pain and hurt did you know that the murder rate dropped 43 in the 1990s do you realize how big of a statistical feat that is it is the direct result of the legalization of abortion guess what happens when child are brought into home who actually are able to love and take care of them prolife is actual prohateforcing abused woman and child to give birth is actually the most hateful thing a society could ever do the one and only freedom we have a human being is bodily autonomy another reason that prolife is a farce is that it is built upon a lie christian use their religion to justify their prolife postionbut when you look at the reality of miscarriages500000 each and every week you realize either the christian god doesnt care about the abortion question or the more likely reason is that said god doesnt really exist i know that once you can believe a magic man will return and fly down from the cloud one day their are no delusion you are incapable of embracing so keep showing your hatred and hypocrisy a you refuse to do anything about the science of climate changekeep celebrating your bodily automony not to get vaccinatedkeep supporting the trumprepublicanjesus cult a they fight to kill american democracy just remember your day are numberit is just a matter of time until the lie of jesus and all religious superstition are exposed maybe this time youll actually adopt the drug addicted baby you force into the world
alot of these people who get pregnant on accident are pretty dumb i am for dumb people getting abortion if they want to
abortion is a woman right she and only she should decide if she want the baby or not allow woman their freedom to choose and the world would be better
doctor want to perform abortion but can be prosecuted because they want the money that go to nonmedical and quack doctor so supreme court of 1973 paved the way to make those medical professional richer

this is why education is important weve learned a lot since 1973 about embryonic and fetal development and educated people understand that an embryo with a beating heart armslegs and a functional nervous system is a living human being
so a religion that denies medical help to a born child is legal is that not the same thing
the state ha a compelling and legal interest in the development and safety of the state
the right to privacy is this adequate to the issue of abortion
we rightly regard hitler and the nazi slaughtering six million jew a one of the most horrific atrocity in human history yet legal abortion ha killed ten time the number of human being and we are expected to be fine with it contraception gay marriage interracial marriage etc are fundamentally different from abortion if a woman wear a diaphragm marries another woman marries a man of a different race etc nobody dy
this channel loes and twist thing like thr supreme court they are federalist society cult member doing business for dark money donor beware
the illegally leaked early draft opinion in the case dobbs v jackson woman health organization wa happily released by the mainstream medium to spread fear and disinformation incorrectly stating that this would make abortion illegal in the united state this ha led to the vandalism of church and pregnancy resource center the disruption of church service and the attempted intimidation of supreme court justice by liberal leftist domestic terrorist organization and supported and encouraged by the biden administration and the democrat party

it would have exactly the opposite effect when you get koop and the swiss cult to push agenda and fry american intellect with flatout lying jesus disapproves time for another harrowing 1906 those people dont need to have an abortion goofy thats a nonsequitur and bad intellectual syntax and dissatisfaction didnt just arise it wa clearly and powerfully engineered by a wealthy elite engaged in deception lying lying propoganda clearly available never disputed prior by various conference deal with it or be seen a the whitewash you appear to be i advocate life a well like moses who allowed the choice and enumerated the prospect why do you want a pure soul that ha no support birthed into a world of sin exactly you religious maniac
according to norma mccorvey jane roe because she didnt want an abortion roe v wade wasnt even a legitimate legal case mccorvey had her daughter how did this even reach the supreme court if it wa not a legitimate case ive always wondered this
people do have the right to exercise their own reproduction right to procreate or to not if we were to take this right away it would be on the line of saying one cant have sex or ripping ovary or uterus out of child then one will not have reproduction right over there body ie it would be mandated or taken away the misdefinition of it ha been thrown around on the senate floor a of late we all have the right to reproduce but you dont have the right to kill what you reproduce because this infringes on an innocent helpless life or every innocent person god given or inalienable right the right to life

i know many people who are here today by mean of in vitro i know that many people will know people who have chosen some mean of reproductive help it is common for individual to seek out artifical reproductive technology person are choosing to become parent by a surrogate in fact adoption is becoming more difficult many option were not possible in 1973 becoming pregnant or ending pregancy today is an equal choice in the 21st century either choice present chanllenges on a personal level in our society individual have right guaranteed by the constitution the u doe not give person monetary bonus for term pregnancy a sweden doe and i hope that the u will never adopt the possibility for only totally healthy full term pregnancy every challenge of bringing forth a healthy pregnancy is made by the person this all sound like science fiction and yet what wa science fiction in the 20th century is our future every challenge of nurturing and supporting the new child is personal responsibility we are now approaching a new territory of making decision which will effect our free choice and how we will live be very careful
prolife is a religious force on the secular population to accept and obey their religious belief pure and simple
if the roe versus wade law is going to stay in place then they need to make it a law that a man who doe not want to be a dad is not obligated to pay child support if he doe not have the right to make a woman get an abortion then he should not be obligated to pay child support she want to continue having the child without his support then she need to raise the child without his support
ok i understand your position but are all yall going to provide their pampers formula healthcare cost or copays for the very poor and then the republican currently are cry about welfare when all these rich people get corporate welfare it a nowin situation with some of them complete hypocrisy for the corporate and wealthy welfare not to mention are yall going to provide for them for christmas is birthday every any holiday every year i buy those angel tag to get gift for child theyre going to need five or six or perhaps 10 tree if this go into affect some people are smart enough not to have them if they cant afford them and theyre going to get persecuted for their choice because they dont want to bring a child into the world dirt poor or is it the elite idea of having slave labor so to speak disposable for year to come bad situation if you ask me

roe v wade is finally banned im not religious at all in any way and im very glad to hear it gone it absolutely disgusting for the most part except for some very extreme and very rare case in my opinion
religious people my wife included all think god would not be pro abortionthe problem with getting your information from a book we can actually see god in nature if you take a look at his mode of operation his intent is clear controlling the specie is number one numero uno on his bucket list god would see abortion in lock step with controlling the specie giving the best chance in life for all his creation
stop blaming woman for abortion more often than not the abortion is because of a man a man who forced himself a man who left a man who wont step up a man who wont support a man who wont participate when are we going to hold men responsible for abortion
since republican are so concerned about woman getting abortion or so they like to say then they should have no problem banning vigra a this will lower the amount of pregnancy however if republican are against banning vigra so that there are le pregnancy that could possibly be aborted than republican really dont care about abortion they only care about controlling woman
the texas law should include rape incest case thats just common sense
anything can be twisted into whatever the most powerful people want

yes an act of raw judicial power so is the death penalty something that the majority of prolife people oddly support the question remains is abortion a private or a public matter i believe it a private matter between a patient and a dr therefore the ruling work i have the right to use contraception even though it not in the constitution can the state mandate me not to or anyone else can the state claim jurisdiction over a fertilized uterus the answer is no if the state is declaring such jurisdiction what responsibility is the state assuming a well can the state be held to monetarily support the mother and child can the state force the father to be monetarily responsible
a very level headed documentary some of the imagery showing a woman well past the second trimester and talking about abortion is suspect however at the end of the day if you are against abortion dont have one
the u constitution wa written in the more primitive le knowledgeable 18th century by clever people who expected it to be adapted and improved with time it wa written when woman basically had no right only wealthy white men could vote and were african american were worth 35ths of a white person this is what they want a return to an american version of sharia law after abortion contraception and lgbtqs right will be axed a will civil right after all it not in the original constitution these rightwingers are extremist beyond belief
spends most of the time supporting abortion a a right folk with a head nod at the very end towards the the constitution doesnt say anything about that folk it shouldnt be that hard for the democrat to get 10 moderate republican senator to agree to some sort of federal abortion law likely with some time compromise around limit

the answer is so simple perform a vasectomy on every prepubescent american boy when he financially able to pay for the child health care and education then it can be reversed not only will this reduce the medical cost of pregnancy gone wrong but the mgm circumcision cash cow will get bigger it the american way at least for the christian fascist
vasectomy is the future
pro choice assumes that the baby doesnt want to be born pro life assumes that it doe neither side really ha the capability to ask the child nor do they want to have equal division of labor or responsibility in the raising of that child so both side are wrong

i graduated high school in 1973 in 1974 i wanted an abortion i wa told it could only be done no later then 12 week i had understood that to be the law i am pro abortion but with time limit a fully formed fetus and partial birth are murder in my opinion consider the many time wimen gave birth at home killed the baby or dumped live baby in trash can what wa that called wa the woman arrested
it interesting that in our modern time that destroying a human embryo doe not effect the conscience but what about destroying a eagle embryo then the conscience is greatly alarmed abortion is therefore defeated

the prolife people lie like trump doe a woman who decides to have a baby even though she cant afford it will never be supported by those prolife idiot it the same with the war in ukraine youll never find these people caring about the baby and child being killed by russian in the war those rightwing liar only care about themselves and no one else the lie will continue from these idiot but god will judge them in a very harsh fashion let abortion be a woman choice over her own body let god be the judge not liar who really dont care about a woman

any child forced to be born must be brought up with the same standard of living a the legislator and justice who forced that child to be born if the legislator and justice who forced their birth dont pay they must convince antiabortion citizen to pay to protect society from rapist and men who cant provide that support make them pay for the society they demand

i hate trump i hate the republican and i also hate abortion i feel child in the womb deserve the right to live if a woman ha consensual sex it is her right and responsibility to use some form of birth control if she doesnt want child if she doe not and get pregnant she should not have the right to kill an innocent child in the womb life start at conception

roe wa a massive overstep of the scotus by taking an authority they did not have per the constitution and simply by passing all the state that is why roe is about to to be aborted so to speak crappy president by the court that could not stand when challenged by the merit of the constitution and a pure power grab in the 1970s with raw judicial force even the abortion avocate rbg understood that when you build a castle on sand it will eventually fall if you want abortion a a federal constitutional right there is only one thing that will do that a constitutional ammendment a law imposed by congress can be removed later by another congress the democrat will never solve the problem because if they did the would lose a mean to stir their base think about it
it did not give you the inheritant right to murder unborn child
during the woman speaking around 745 this line of privacy she cite do not protect the act of murder how shallowly argued by these lawyer sole judiciary concern in complete absence of humanity
the idea that abortion are a right is an egregious fallacy there never wa nor should there ever be such a constitutional allowance let alone any real excuse for aborting an unborn child possibly barring maternal death seeing so many people rail against their better judgement on this matter is truly disheartening
this shouldnt even an issue this should have always been a state issue the federal government truly ha no fight in this wow over 50 million have been slaughtered simply because federal government stepped in on state right
a similar conversation with robotic lawyer talking about the dred scott decision occurred year ago then we had the 13 and 14th amendment overturning roe v wade will not be enoughhuman life amendment is needed

roe v wade isnt legislation there nothing that say precedent cant be overturned and reversed the issue of abortion should only be decided by the state there no constitutional basis for requiring abortion on a national level
with perfect timing this issue ha been unveiled to repolarize america the establishment prodded democrat brought outlandish proposal to the table and the republican establishment handed the bait to the base smart red state right now would freeze existing policy for 5 year while a real discourse take place and include squaring the right of medical privacy regarding abortion with right of medical privacy with the new mandatory experimental covid treatment we will be looking at mandatory abortion if this isnt dealt with now
this is simply an attack on civil right taking u back 50 year in our struggle this is not the way forward clearly i am very upset that our right are under attack again we are absolutely positively unable to care for more unwanted child when we are so supremely failing those kid our system already school are in trouble downright abusive practice are used this need to be improved adoption house are full and can not handle the large addition that would be the result in reversing roe v wade also our foster system and our court system child and youth is a joke none of our social service system are in good enough shape to handle this change in a healthy positive nor meaningful way who will provide for these life we insist upon creating i guess the supreme court just want more pain and suffering for we the people shall we proceed with creating many more criminal shall we add to our overpopulation shall we see the total collapse of our social support service let not make this mistake think of the child really think of the child the best and only way forward is to drop this insane idea and actually fix what is broken this roe v wade issue however is not broken

abortion should be illegal when used a birth control only under special situation should it be considered otherwise youre just murdering for your own sexual selfishness and irresponsibility i also find it very hypocritical of people supporting by saying my body my choice when these are the same people that were mandating everyone to get vaccinated while creating prejudice on the unvaccinated where wa my body my choice then

god biblical literature allows people to procreate abortion go against the law of nature the body were born in arent ours it a vehicle nothing in the world is private it all public we the peopleget it legal system represents satan of course he want people to kill each otherhmm
i love the hypocrisy of pro roe v wade people majority of them believe in pure democracy but they would be absolutely terrified if roe v wade went up for election through democracy allow the people of the land to choose this law and then we can live with it
why do we even use roe v wade roe literally said she wa lying about everything that happened to her she said she wa forced to lie about being raped and that she wa antiabortion
this is the most neutral video out there i like it super informative
when you take god out of everything you have nothing but chaos look where we are today all the violence murder child trafficking child molester school shooting it a sad world we live in now and he is coming back sooner then we think we need to put god back in everything
a mum who ha the courage to strangulate his own child can strangulate anyone in this world where is humanity the decision of roe versus wade is symbol of mud world
for any prolifers here your question of when doe the baby count a a hypothetical life why should a woman be forced to bear a child thats what id ask you pregnancy can kill you you can be allergic to the baby and painful rash can eat your skin you can have organ failure sometimes you know the baby will die ahead of time and having a painful miscarriage after month of carrying is way more traumatic and extremely painful for a woman so much happens to a woman body during pregnancy that could cause complication leading to her death or her baby death the fact that the government would be forcing people to go through disease pain and death just because one loud group say they dont like it is appalling and outside the government scope of responsibility would we really prefer to spend more money on service and tax tracking down the 25 of woman in america who need or want to not carry a baby to full term were going to spend money on that which also force woman to take thing like turpentine a poison that could kill them or back alley procedure done in sketchy health condition that could also kill them or damage their organ permanently you would really rather force that reality on other people why is the state forcing their citizen to birth baby thats ultimately what your question should be
the right to privacy in the bedroom exists no question there the problem with this argumentation is that cease to exist when someone el life is terminated by your decision
the problem with this case wa that abortion is not the decision whether or not to have a child thats what you decide in the bedroom it about whether or not the child that is in the womb is allowed to be born or is terminated in an unnatural way called murder
what right to privacy to kill an innocent baby how about the fundamental right of that babyperson to life and to be protected by the state god law is above humancivil law
i dont understand how these conservative can reconcile forbidding abortion but claim moral superiority when single woman ask for help to support the child what happened to limited government
abortion is killing not caringmay god forgive you all
no human is ever afforded privacy when it come to murder
i had no idea 62 million baby since 1973 have had severe deformity wow and 95 of them are from the black community then you are saying margaret sanger planned parenthood wa correct in her belief that there should be a genocide for the community that is of a lesser class than the upper class on another note im sure there ha never been a woman who ha used abortion a a form of birth control right
lately the current debate about the vaccine mandate and the right not to be vaccinated are very similar in the right to private medical decision debate for abortion but the irony is that most liberal are okay with mandated govt overreach into forced vaccination for the greater good and those that are using the my body my choice argument usually the mantra of pro choice advocate dont want that over reach and are mainly conservative constitutional believer but using the liberal argument for the greater good what if the govt said we believe that the pregnancy and the unborn is for the greater good of the nation that we welcome and respect life and that an unborn child ha a greater good for humanity and that govt mandated that all pregnancy must be full term is that okay
the funny thing about roe wade is when it come down to the republican choosing to get vaccinated or not they say it my right to choose but on the other hand is nobody else ha the right to choose they talk out both side of their mouth im glad they use their right of freedom there for the other people have the right to choose to you cant have it both way but these stupid people feel they cant have it both way they listen to an idiotic donald trump
this is good thing to learn and it is rrally deep
abortion isnt contraception privacy isnt an excuse to kill someone the ruling wa both legally and morally wrong and wa somewhat overturned recently being illegal after 6 week but fact is that unless the pregnancy is literally killing you and it a form of selfdefence it essentially voluntary manslaughter funfact firearm will prevent rape attempt if you dont want to accidentally kill the rapist use a 22lr pistol a they are basically upgraded bb gun and hurt to be hit with youll have them running for the hill
gov should not spend a single dime to fund abortion related activity
im already confused and lost by 1 minute past the intro
i am pro life and pro choice just not pro death abortion is a procedure that should only be used to protect the mother life in some rare scenario it should not be used to killed the child in the mother womb for the choice the mother and father made or not understanding the consequence of their action ending a life is not a quick fix it evil and murder should be illegal in a society these menwomen can instead go and have an operation which will make them infertile and have all the sex that they want i wont stop them though i would suggest otherwise cause it unwise but it okay you can always adopt and it just clump of cell what you dont want an irreversible procedure on your body i dont want an irreversible procedure that end baby life
imagine being that kid and when you grow up you find out youre only alive because your mom wa taking abortion to supreme court
abortion is murder of the unborn murder is a crime
cant the woman in texas just go to another state and get an abortion there
this wa a poor supreme court decision then and now time for the current supreme court to fix this societal mess a woman right to kill an unborn child where is this in the constitution comparing this right to that of having a family and raising child ridiculous comparison privacy a a right to abortion huh the case wa poor fact were twisted and wrong the supreme court should strike down the decision just because of this viability now it is 15weeks when the normal fetus can potentially become a separate individual human being being born a a baby with full legal right abortion after this date can thus be argued a murder even if the baby ha not been born irrelevant status of the baby born or unborn
roe will fall because god will itjust watch
baby life matter baby life matter the new blm
every person who may be thinking about having a child or engaging in sex between the sex should watch this there is a flaw in the thinking of the prochoice stance that the mother and the baby life are not separate they absolutely are separate the fact that the baby is contained within the mother body should not give the mother the right to decide the fate of the life of that baby or baby
all person born or naturalized in the united state and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizen of the united state and of the state wherein they reside no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privilege or immunity of citizen of the united state nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within it jurisdiction the equal protection of the law section 1 14th amendment u constitution to even make an argument that woman have the right to slaughter their child in their womb one ha to argue that said child are literally not person whilst in the womb ergo neither you nor i were people while we were in our mother uterus it absolute nonsense not only is it blatant sin in the eye of holy god it not even logically rationally scientifically or morally justifiable if you dont want child so badly that in the event you had them you would brutally murder them dont make them thats not impossible despite what the highminds of the left may say or think dont bring up the rape or health victim strawman none of the dispute today revolve around those isolated case that could be handled privately between medical professional and family although im sure child of rape victim would certainly love to voice their right to exist the argument is about government regulated ondemand and taxpayer funded infanticide that is the american abortion industry i pray and hope to god roe is overturned all to his glory alone
it blow my mind how much effort people put in just to get government permission to murder baby
if roe go down than these leftist will have to win some election and argument in local government
pregnancy can be risky and difficult on woman body the status of a fetus before birth is a contentious question inextricable from the question of woman autonomy two principled moral people can come to different conclusion about what they would choose embryo and fetus are fragile spontaneous abortion is very common 3040 of pregnancy and difficult to distinguish from induced abortion early abortion are far more common than later one lateterm abortion is rare after the first trimester and only come up due to medical complication sex or traitselective abortion is unethical unless the trait lead to an unviable literally not survivable condition in lieu of safe and legal option many woman will still try to induce an abortion possibly unsafely based on these idea i come to several stance on how abortion should be approached in term of public policy and culture abortion should be legal overall with minimal hurdle for inducing one making abortion illegal would be ineffective at reducing abortion making abortion illegal put an undue burden on woman including compelling woman undergoing miscarriage to prove that they miscarried which is a horrible situation for anyone who is already facing miscarriage to face pragmatically i wish more people would agree on policy that actually made abortion rarer for instance sex education and contraceptive use should be more widespread and comprehensive personal opinion against abortion are valid and medicallyinformed policy that ensure the safety and bodily autonomy of pregnant woman and the fetus they want ought to be encouraged
how is abortion private by that logic a person can kill someone and argue that it private is it just me or did they drop the ball by conceding
roe wa basically saying our body my choice
when is it too late to get an abortion i think the 6 week law texas passed is more than fair and a reasonable amount of time
i hope they arent mad when the supreme court us penumbra and emanation to protect the life of a child what happens when the supreme court invents right that pro choice dont agree with it should be left up to the people and the state legislation
it wa said that abortion wa going to be safe legal rare now it is ok to abort up to 9 month and even if the baby is born the mother with her physician can decide whether or not to murder it while it is laying on the doctor table how far have we gone
you want an abortion even though i disagree with your decision thats your moral issue therefore my tax dollar should not pay for something i think is evil
i ask this question out of genuine curiosity to those who are prochoice and believe a woman should be able to choose because it just a cluster of cell when do they cease to just a cluster of cell what is that fine line where it is actually taking a life
what i dont get is if henry wade is the lawyer then why doe it say roe v wade also if roe v wade wa only a ruling by the supreme court and not a law then why do you have all of these crazy idiot defending this a like it is a law and not a ruling it doesnt make any sense at all to me whatsoeverbut then again if you have 2 crafty lawyer albright and wadethey can make sense out of almost anything and everything which is fair to everyone else except the innocent person inside the womb of their mother whose having their innocent little life murderedand for whatfor nothing and it is especially unfair to the young woman because it is a fact that alot of woman suffer guilt and other mental health problem because of the guilt later on in life and it is also unfair to the boyfriend or husband that maybe didnt want the expectant mother to murder their childor worse yet ha no idea that shes pregnant rignt because she doesnt say anything and just go ahead and doe it anywayyou know more men then you believe can take care of their unwanted unborn childrenand his family could helpand the woman ha no responsibility in the matter if she so chooses and i also believe that it is really unfair because alot of people on the left do not even think of counseling these young woman before or after they have an abortion we a a society need to let these woman know that there are other option to abortionsuch a adoptionbecause alot of people are out there that will take care of your baby and raise them a their own if you cant do so we just have to make adoption more easier in this countryinstead of being so hardbecause to me abortion just isnt an optiononly if it risk the life of the motheror there is no sign of life in the womband the baby is going to be born still born
if the federalist society can undermine the 9th amendment they can undermine the 14th
people dont understand how corrupt the court have gotten and how many million of dollar the federalist society ha spent to undermine the u supreme court
every time there is an abortiona heart beat stop it not the 60 birth control is easily accessible if you were assaulted most people dont wait for 6 week to figure out if they are pregnant lady need act more responsible if youre having sex you can get pregnant no surprise right
it wa all a lie unteal when you research it and find out roe wa just in on it
well a woman should keep her leg closed and stop thottin around and abortion wont be an issue
roe is going downstates will implement on the local level
court are made up of corrupt people mostly men interpretation of law good luck
time have changed evolution ha been proven true social unrest upheaval desperation on the part of the religious good news time have changed woman should be free from control by men and religious fantasy

fundamental right arent constitutional right thats when the supreme court need to set the record straight
scotus wa right to decide that a woman had a right to decide what to do with her body however when the right of the unborn fetus came into the periphery they had to make a pretty nefarious argument which wa that based on the 14th amendment the fetus or child having not been born wa not afforded right a a citizen of the united state and therefore wa not afforded the right to it life or even the pursuit of it which wa a horrendously stupid conclusion the justice had basically said that if you werent a citizen of the u you had no right to your life which leaf me to ponder if a foreigner enters the country is it okay for me or a doctor to have them aborted killed is that legal a ridiculous a it sound imagine how it is for an unborn child the legal precedent behind this did nothing but make a mockery of the law to make such a childish leap by using the 14th amendment which wa created to give former slave the right to citizenship wa an extremely shortsighted decision what bother me the most is that no one address this act or even question it yet if a woman is deciding to keep the baby and someone kill her and the unborn child it considered a double homicide the selfishness of people astounds me the thought that an unborn child ha no right is monstrous especially since a box of 20 condom cost 12 or le
wait why doesnt this video ha more view it feel like im watching the history channel
january 22 1972 is when the government sold it soul to satan
the beautiful blessed most wonderful and most prowoman passing of roe v wade turn 50 year old this year

so let me get this straight the argument on the religious side is choose life correct and yet religion especially the christian faith ha had more people die in it name than for any other reason in our world and people wonder why so many are turning away from religion in staggering number these day possibly because theyre seeing through the bullshit and hypocrisy
thank you may the lord of host the creator the only giver of life the lover of our soul each soul overturn roe v wade soon for his glory love win choose life
the right to kill your baby i am so grateful that i would never do it i wa brainwashed before thinking it wa ok for others now i dont think so freedom of thought is no longer allowed on yt twitter or fb
woman arent obligated to have baby if they dont want them we arent baby maker and we are no longer only held in importance for our procreatingbiological value
no big surprise the scotus decided at one time that japanese american citizen could be rounded up and put in concentration camp sorry if that upset your world
abortion is a right smh if youre argument against it is because of religious reason then it invalid
the right to infanticide i dont think so
the biggest part of the lie wa woman could not get abortion if their life were in danger before roe v wade the decision to have an abortion in order to save the woman life wa a decision between her and her doctor now it between the medium and congress and the coffer of planned parenthood and the like of baby murderer who gleefully support the slaughter of the unborn baby judgment day is coming and not one of these baby murderer will escape the wrath of the true supreme judge it will be interesting to witness the like of ginsberg and biden and ted chappaquiddick putting forth their argument in favor of baby murdering a they stand poised to be throw alive into the lake of fire talk about your right to a lateterm abortion
the right to privacy wa a weak argument thats why it should be overturned
it wa a conspiracy to pas roe v wade the medium hollywood politician brainwashed the mass to accept abortion a a right
this documentary is so wellmade
the court do not make right they are already ours
abortion will never be truly abolished a long a society continues to tolerate any form of artificial contraception and the contraceptive mentality in general after all abortion is the inevitable backup when those fail
it is the most unfortunate decision in scotus history the rule is that a judgment obtained by fraud should be set aside but it wa never applied to roe v wade apart from the appalling implication for the sanctity of life it wa one of the few time that a travesty triumphed over justice the only scotus judgment worse than it wa dread scott
